The XRD pattern of -MnS corresponded to the cubic phase (PDF06-0518), while that of -MnS corresponded to the hexagonal phase (PDF40-1289) (Fig. 2) 17,18.After the introduction of the Pd ions, the structure of -MnS remained unchanged, and no diffractive peaks of PdS or other Pd related compounds were observed in the XRD patterns of the -MnS-PdX samples.Furthermore, the addition of Pd increased the specific surface area of the photocatalysts and decreased the grain size (Table 1), thus clearly indicating that Pd ions can inhibit the growth of -MnS grains. Moreover, based on Table 1, the diffractive peaks, cell parameters, and cell volume of -MnS-Pd1.5 were similar to those of -MnS, indicating that the Pd ions do not enter the -MnS lattice.According to the doping mechanism, the ion radius of Pd 2 (85 pm) is greater than that of Mn 2 (67 pm), making it difficult for Pd 2 to enter the -MnS crystal in the interstitial mode 19.Moreover, based on Fig. 2 and Table 1, the lattice volume and lattice parameters of -MnS-Pd1.5 did not increase compared to pure -MnS, while its diffraction peak did not shift to lower diffraction angles, indicating that the introduced Pd ions will not be doped in -MnS in the substitution mode.Therefore, we concluded that Pd 2 exist on the surface of -MnS as active species 19. The Pd 3d XPS spectra of -MnS-Pd1.5 and PdS (Fig. 3a) revealed that the binding energy of Pd 3d 5/2 (336.4 eV) was between the metal Pd (335.2 eV) and PdS (336.8 eV).Thus, the two peaks at 336.4 and 341.7 eV were assigned to Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 of the -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface, respectively 20,21.In the S 2p XPS spectra of -MnS-Pd1.5 (Fig. 3b), the two strong peaks at about 159.4 and 160.6 eV were assigned to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 , respectively, and were almost the same as those of pure -MnS.However, two additional peaks were observed at 160.9 and 162.0 eV, which were lower than the binding energy of PdS (162.0 and 163.2 eV) and were attributed to the unsaturated surface S 2-species generated by the introduction of the Pd species 22.Therefore, based on the XRD, XPS, and HRTEM results, it was revealed that the -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface are formed by the coupling of each Pd 2 species with two unsaturated S 2-ions 23. The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution of the examined samples were also studied.As shown in Fig. 4, almost no hysteresis loop was observed in the isotherm of -MnS, while the pore size distribution curve was almost a horizontal line, indicating that the adsorption capacity of -MnS is weak.In contrast, the type-IV isotherms of the -MnS sample showed a hysteresis loop, while the main pore diameter distribution was observed between 10 and 40 nm, suggesting its higher adsorption ability compared to -MnS.Moreover, the type-IV isotherms of -MnS-Pd1.5 exhibited a larger hysteresis loop and the intensity of the pore diameter distribution between 10 and 40 nm was significantly higher than that of -MnS, implying that the introduction of the Pd ions improved the adsorption ability of -MnS-Pd1.5 compared to pure -MnS. The CO 2 -TPD curves of the -MnS, -MnS and -MnS-PdX samples were also recorded (Fig. 5), as the strength of the CO 2 desorption peak reveals the CO 2 absorption ability of the different photocatalysts.Here, weak desorption peaks were detected in the range 50-450 C for -MnS and -MnS, indicating the weak CO 2 adsorption ability of these samples.In contrast, the CO 2 desorption peaks of the -MnS-PdX samples were higher than those of pure -MnS, while the CO 2 desorption peak strength was further enhanced at 50-450 C with increasing Pd content.Therefore, it was further confirmed that the introduction of Pd can improve the CO 2 adsorption ability of the photocatalysts, with -MnS-Pd1.5 showing the strongest capacity. For the measurement of the XPS valence band (VB) spectra of the examined samples, we considered that the zero-energy level was consistent with the work function (4.10 eV, Fermi level) of the XPS instrument, while the binding energy at the initial edge of the S 3p peak indicated the energy gap between the Fermi level and the VB top 24.Moreover, the Fermi level of the XPS instrument was calculated as 0.4 eV vs. NHE.Based on Fig. 6, the VBs of -MnS and -MnS were 1.52 eV (1.12 eV vs. NHE) and 2.02 eV (1.62 eV vs. NHE), respectively 17.However, a larger hump was observed at 1.31 eV (0.91 eV vs. NHE) for -MnS-Pd1.5 compared to pure -MnS, which was attributed to the Pd 4d state of the -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface.Therefore, we concluded that the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species is 0.71 eV above the VB of -MnS-PdX 10. The diffuse UV-Vis absorption spectra of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX were also obtained to study their response to light (Fig. 7). The absorption starting points of -MnS and -MnS appeared at 461 and 373 nm, indicating that their bandgaps were 2.69 and 3.32 eV, respectively (Fig. 7a).Based on the VBs of -MnS and -MnS (1.12 and 1.62 eV vs. NHE, respectively), their conduction bands (CBs) were found to be -1.57and -1.70 eV, respectively.After the surface modification with Pd, an additional absorption peak was observed at about 450 nm in the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the -MnS-PdX samples, which gradually increased with increasing Pd amount (Fig. 7b).This new absorption peak was attributed to the addition of the Pd species due to the transition of the -MnS-PdX electrons from the energy level of the -S-Pd-Ssurface species to the CB. To verify the energy band structure of the photocatalysts, the models of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX were established, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed.As shown in Fig. 8b and e, the zero levels for both -MnS and -MnS were located at the VB top, corresponding to the highest state energy level occupied by electrons, and their indirect bandgaps were 2.49 and 3.09 eV, respectively.Moreover, the VB of both -MnS and -MnS consisted of S 2p orbitals and a small amount of Mn 3d, while the CB consisted of Mn 3d orbitals and a small amount of S 2p (Fig. 8c andf).The DFT studies also revealed that the surface modification with Pd ions did not affect the bandgap of the -MnS-PdX samples, which was similar to that of pure -MnS (3.01 eV) (Fig. 8h), while a new energy level was observed near the VB of -MnS-PdX compared to pure -MnS, which was attributed to the Pd 4d states of the -S-Pd-S-surface species (Fig. 8i).Moreover, we concluded that the energy levels of the -S-Pd-S-surface species were occupied by electrons, as the zero-energy level of the -MnS-PdX samples was above the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species.It is also important to note that the theoretical calculation results were consistent with the experimental findings. The PL spectra and time-resolved PL decay curves of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX were recorded to investigate the behavior of the photocarriers.The PL peaks at 475 and 525 nm observed for -MnS, as well as the peaks at 450 and 515 nm for -MnS were obtained by curve fitting (Fig. 9).In particular, the peak of -MnS at 475 nm and that of -MnS at 450 nm were both attributed to the transition from the CB to the VB.Similarly, the PL peaks at 525 and 515 nm observed for -MnS and -MnS, respectively, were attributed to the transition from the CB to the defect energy level 25.Thus, the photo-generated electrons in the CB could be directly combined with the holes in the VB, producing fluorescence, or they could be transferred to the defect energy level and recombine with the VB holes.Therefore, the decrease in the PL intensity suggested the reduction of the photocarriers recombination and the increase of their separation.Moreover, the fluorescence intensity of -MnS was significantly higher than that of -MnS, implying that the photocarriers separation was lower for -MnS compared to -MnS.Furthermore, the PL intensity of the Pd-modified -MnS samples was significantly suppressed as the amount of Pd species increased (Fig. 9), indicating that the formation of -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface can effectively inhibit the recombination of photo-generated charge carriers. The fluorescence lifetimes ( 1 and 2 ) of all the examined samples were also obtained by double exponential decay fitting (Fig. 10 and Table 2) 26272829.In general, the fast decay process ( 1 ) is due to the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes from the CB to the VB 303132, while the slow decay process ( 2 ) is attributed to the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes from the defect energy level to the VB 333435.Here, the fluorescence lifetime of -MnS was particularly longer than that of -MnS, implying that the separation efficiency of photo-generated charge carriers was higher for -MnS than for -MnS.Moreover, after the -MnS surface modification with Pd species, the 1 and 2 values of -MnS-Pd1.5 were significantly prolonged, suggesting that the separation of the photo-generated charge carriers was further accelerated compared to pure -MnS.Thus, in addition to the intrinsic transfer pathway, the surface -S-Pd-S-active species produced a new photogenic carrier transfer pathway.Since the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-species is more negative than the VB of -MnS, the holes will be transferred to the energy level of the -S-Pd-Sspecies, thus reducing the PL intensity and increasing the PL lifetime.It is therefore clear that -MnS-Pd1.5 can effectively accelerate the photocarriers separation. It has been reported that the final product of the studied photocatalytic reaction is CH 4 , while the intermediate product is CO 30.Thus, to investigate the photocatalytic performance of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX, their corresponding activities in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. 11 and Table 3) and CO under UV irradiation for 8 h (Fig. S1) were measured.Blank experiment and commercial P25 catalyst experiment were used as control groups.-MnS showed low photocatalytic activity, where only 0.351 mol CH 4 was produced.In contrast, the photocatalytic activity of -MnS was higher than that of -MnS, while 2.5 times more CH 4 (0.870 mol) was generated in the presence of -MnS (0.351 mol).The photocatalytic activity of -MnS was further improved after the modification of its surface with Pd species.Among the -MnS-PdX samples, -MnS-Pd1.5 showed the highest photocatalytic activity, while the photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 was 2.03 times higher than that of pure -MnS as well as 7.68 times higher than that of commercial P25 catalyst (Table 3).Fig. S2 shows the recycling test of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-Pd1.5 samples.All the catalysts could be used repetitively for more than 3 times without a significant decrease in their activities.More than 92 of the original photocatalytic activity was retained after two recycles.And the slight decrease might be caused by the loss of photocatalysts during separation and wash processes 36.Fig. S3 shows the XRD patterns of the spent material after the reaction.Compared with the catalyst before reaction, no significant changes in the structure were observed, indicating the excellent stability during the reaction process.Those results above showed that all the catalysts exhibited good stability. The main factors affecting the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts are the surface properties of the materials, the band structure, the matching of the band structure, the redox potential of the CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 , and the effective separation of photocarriers.Thus, to explain the photocatalytic mechanism, the energy band structures of the -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX samples were determined based on the abovementioned XPS VB and absorption spectra and the VASP calculation results (Fig. 12). The mechanism of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 can be summarized as in Eqs. ( 4)- (6).More specifically, the photocatalysts generate photo-excited holes and electrons under irradiation (h) (Eq.( 4)).Then, the photo-generated holes (h ) react with H 2 O to form O 2 and H (Eq.( 5)) (E redox 0.82 V vs. NHE; pH 7.0), while the electrons react with H to produce CH 4 (Eq.( 6)) (E redox -0.24V vs. NHE; pH 7.0). Photocatalyst h e - h (4) According to the mechanism of the CO 2 -to-CH 4 photocatalytic reduction, the VBs of -MnS and -MnS (1.12 eV vs. NHE for -MnS and 1.62 eV vs. NHE for -MnS) were more positive than the redox potential of H 2 O/H (0.82 V vs. NHE), whereas their CBs (-1.57eV vs. NHE for -MnS and -1.70 eV vs. NHE for -MnS) were more negative than that of CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V vs. NHE), indicating that the photo-generated carriers can take part in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .In addition, compared to -MnS, -MnS showed higher photocatalytic activity, higher adsorption capacity, larger specific surface area, lower recombination efficiency, and longer PL lifetime, which improved its photocatalytic activity, as more photocarriers contributed to the reduction of the surface-adsorbed CO 2 molecules to CH 4 . The photocatalytic activities of the -MnS-PdX samples were further improved due to the formation of the -S-Pd-S-surface species.In particular, the formation of the -S-Pd-S-active species increased the specific surface area and the CO 2 absorption ability of the -MnS-PdX samples compared to pure -MnS, thus favoring the photocatalytic reactions on their surface.Moreover, the energy level of the -S-Pd-Ssurface species improved the absorption of visible light, produced more photocarriers, and prolonged the lifetime of the photo-generated carriers, which in turn improved the separation of the photo-generated carriers and enhanced the photocatalytic activity of -MnS-PdX.In addition, as the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species (0.91 eV vs. NHE) was 0.71 eV above the VB of -MnS, it was more consistent with the redox potential of H 2 O/H (0.82 V vs. NHE) than pure -MnS.Thus, the holes on the VB migrated to the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species and further reacted with H 2 O adsorbed on the surface to form H and O 2 (Eq.( 5)).At the same time, the electrons on the CB were transferred to the surface and reacted with the adsorbed CO 2 and H species to form CH 4 (Eq.( 6)).Hence, the photocarriers were effectively separated, implying that more photocarriers contributed to the CO 2 -to-CH 4 photoreduction, thus efficiently improving the photocatalytic activity of -MnS-PdX 373839.These results could also explain the higher photocatalytic activity of -MnS-PdX in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 compared to pure -MnS."}, {"llm generation": "photocatalytic", "source": "Among the -MnS-PdX samples, -MnS-Pd1.5 showed the highest photocatalytic activity, while the photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 was 2.03 times higher than that of pure -MnS as well as 7.68 times higher than that of commercial P25 catalyst (Table 3).", "context": "To investigate the morphologies and surface properties of the photocatalysts, we measured the SEM, TEM, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, pore size distribution, and CO 2 -TPD patterns of the -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX samples.More specifically, -MnS had a regular octahedral structure with an average edge size of about 5 m (Fig. 1a andb), while the measured lattice spacing was found to be 0.261 nm, corresponding to the 2 0 0 plane of -MnS (Fig. 1c).In contrast, -MnS exhibited a truncated hexagonal prism structure exposed with 1 0 0, 1 1 0, and 1 0 2 facets (Fig. 1d ande).-MnS consisted of a large number of uniform rods with hexagonal end faces.The diameter and length of the rods were about 1.0 and 2.0 m, respectively.In addition, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1f) revealed the existence of interplanar spacings of 0.345 nm, which were attributed to the 1 0 0 crystal plane of -MnS.After the introduction of the Pd ions, no change was observed in the morphological shape of -MnS-Pd1.5 compared to -MnS, as it still exhibited a truncated hexagonal prism structure (Fig. 1g andh).It is also worth noting that neither PdS nor other Pd related compounds were detected in the HRTEM images of -MnS-Pd1.5,indicating that the introduced Pd ions may exist on the -MnS surface as Pd species.Thus, the crystal structure and existing states of Pd ions on the -MnS surface were further studied by XRD and XPS.

The Pd 3d XPS spectra of -MnS-Pd1.5 and PdS (Fig. 3a) revealed that the binding energy of Pd 3d 5/2 (336.4 eV) was between the metal Pd (335.2 eV) and PdS (336.8 eV).Thus, the two peaks at 336.4 and 341.7 eV were assigned to Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 of the -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface, respectively 20,21.In the S 2p XPS spectra of -MnS-Pd1.5 (Fig. 3b), the two strong peaks at about 159.4 and 160.6 eV were assigned to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 , respectively, and were almost the same as those of pure -MnS.However, two additional peaks were observed at 160.9 and 162.0 eV, which were lower than the binding energy of PdS (162.0 and 163.2 eV) and were attributed to the unsaturated surface S 2-species generated by the introduction of the Pd species 22.Therefore, based on the XRD, XPS, and HRTEM results, it was revealed that the -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface are formed by the coupling of each Pd 2 species with two unsaturated S 2-ions 23.

The main factors affecting the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts are the surface properties of the materials, the band structure, the matching of the band structure, the redox potential of the CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 , and the effective separation of photocarriers.Thus, to explain the photocatalytic mechanism, the energy band structures of the -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX samples were determined based on the abovementioned XPS VB and absorption spectra and the VASP calculation results (Fig. 12). The mechanism of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 can be summarized as in Eqs. ( 4)- (6).More specifically, the photocatalysts generate photo-excited holes and electrons under irradiation (h) (Eq.( 4)).Then, the photo-generated holes (h ) react with H 2 O to form O 2 and H (Eq.( 5)) (E redox 0.82 V vs. NHE; pH 7.0), while the electrons react with H to produce CH 4 (Eq.( 6)) (E redox -0.24V vs. NHE; pH 7.0). Photocatalyst h e - h (4) According to the mechanism of the CO 2 -to-CH 4 photocatalytic reduction, the VBs of -MnS and -MnS (1.12 eV vs. NHE for -MnS and 1.62 eV vs. NHE for -MnS) were more positive than the redox potential of H 2 O/H (0.82 V vs. NHE), whereas their CBs (-1.57eV vs. NHE for -MnS and -1.70 eV vs. NHE for -MnS) were more negative than that of CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V vs. NHE), indicating that the photo-generated carriers can take part in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .In addition, compared to -MnS, -MnS showed higher photocatalytic activity, higher adsorption capacity, larger specific surface area, lower recombination efficiency, and longer PL lifetime, which improved its photocatalytic activity, as more photocarriers contributed to the reduction of the surface-adsorbed CO 2 molecules to CH 4 . The photocatalytic activities of the -MnS-PdX samples were further improved due to the formation of the -S-Pd-S-surface species.In particular, the formation of the -S-Pd-S-active species increased the specific surface area and the CO 2 absorption ability of the -MnS-PdX samples compared to pure -MnS, thus favoring the photocatalytic reactions on their surface.Moreover, the energy level of the -S-Pd-Ssurface species improved the absorption of visible light, produced more photocarriers, and prolonged the lifetime of the photo-generated carriers, which in turn improved the separation of the photo-generated carriers and enhanced the photocatalytic activity of -MnS-PdX.In addition, as the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species (0.91 eV vs. NHE) was 0.71 eV above the VB of -MnS, it was more consistent with the redox potential of H 2 O/H (0.82 V vs. NHE) than pure -MnS.Thus, the holes on the VB migrated to the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species and further reacted with H 2 O adsorbed on the surface to form H and O 2 (Eq.( 5)).At the same time, the electrons on the CB were transferred to the surface and reacted with the adsorbed CO 2 and H species to form CH 4 (Eq.( 6)).Hence, the photocarriers were effectively separated, implying that more photocarriers contributed to the CO 2 -to-CH 4 photoreduction, thus efficiently improving the photocatalytic activity of -MnS-PdX 373839.These results could also explain the higher photocatalytic activity of -MnS-PdX in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 compared to pure -MnS."}, {"llm generation": "catalyst", "source": "Among the -MnS-PdX samples, -MnS-Pd1.5 showed the highest photocatalytic activity, while the photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 was 2.03 times higher than that of pure -MnS as well as 7.68 times higher than that of commercial P25 catalyst (Table 3).", "context": "To investigate the morphologies and surface properties of the photocatalysts, we measured the SEM, TEM, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, pore size distribution, and CO 2 -TPD patterns of the -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX samples.More specifically, -MnS had a regular octahedral structure with an average edge size of about 5 m (Fig. 1a andb), while the measured lattice spacing was found to be 0.261 nm, corresponding to the 2 0 0 plane of -MnS (Fig. 1c).In contrast, -MnS exhibited a truncated hexagonal prism structure exposed with 1 0 0, 1 1 0, and 1 0 2 facets (Fig. 1d ande).-MnS consisted of a large number of uniform rods with hexagonal end faces.The diameter and length of the rods were about 1.0 and 2.0 m, respectively.In addition, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1f) revealed the existence of interplanar spacings of 0.345 nm, which were attributed to the 1 0 0 crystal plane of -MnS.After the introduction of the Pd ions, no change was observed in the morphological shape of -MnS-Pd1.5 compared to -MnS, as it still exhibited a truncated hexagonal prism structure (Fig. 1g andh).It is also worth noting that neither PdS nor other Pd related compounds were detected in the HRTEM images of -MnS-Pd1.5,indicating that the introduced Pd ions may exist on the -MnS surface as Pd species.Thus, the crystal structure and existing states of Pd ions on the -MnS surface were further studied by XRD and XPS. The XRD pattern of -MnS corresponded to the cubic phase (PDF06-0518), while that of -MnS corresponded to the hexagonal phase (PDF40-1289) (Fig. 2) 17,18.After the introduction of the Pd ions, the structure of -MnS remained unchanged, and no diffractive peaks of PdS or other Pd related compounds were observed in the XRD patterns of the -MnS-PdX samples.Furthermore, the addition of Pd increased the specific surface area of the photocatalysts and decreased the grain size (Table 1), thus clearly indicating that Pd ions can inhibit the growth of -MnS grains. Moreover, based on Table 1, the diffractive peaks, cell parameters, and cell volume of -MnS-Pd1.5 were similar to those of -MnS, indicating that the Pd ions do not enter the -MnS lattice.According to the doping mechanism, the ion radius of Pd 2 (85 pm) is greater than that of Mn 2 (67 pm), making it difficult for Pd 2 to enter the -MnS crystal in the interstitial mode 19.Moreover, based on Fig. 2 and Table 1, the lattice volume and lattice parameters of -MnS-Pd1.5 did not increase compared to pure -MnS, while its diffraction peak did not shift to lower diffraction angles, indicating that the introduced Pd ions will not be doped in -MnS in the substitution mode.Therefore, we concluded that Pd 2 exist on the surface of -MnS as active species 19. The Pd 3d XPS spectra of -MnS-Pd1.5 and PdS (Fig. 3a) revealed that the binding energy of Pd 3d 5/2 (336.4 eV) was between the metal Pd (335.2 eV) and PdS (336.8 eV).Thus, the two peaks at 336.4 and 341.7 eV were assigned to Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 of the -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface, respectively 20,21.In the S 2p XPS spectra of -MnS-Pd1.5 (Fig. 3b), the two strong peaks at about 159.4 and 160.6 eV were assigned to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 , respectively, and were almost the same as those of pure -MnS.However, two additional peaks were observed at 160.9 and 162.0 eV, which were lower than the binding energy of PdS (162.0 and 163.2 eV) and were attributed to the unsaturated surface S 2-species generated by the introduction of the Pd species 22.Therefore, based on the XRD, XPS, and HRTEM results, it was revealed that the -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface are formed by the coupling of each Pd 2 species with two unsaturated S 2-ions 23. The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution of the examined samples were also studied.As shown in Fig. 4, almost no hysteresis loop was observed in the isotherm of -MnS, while the pore size distribution curve was almost a horizontal line, indicating that the adsorption capacity of -MnS is weak.In contrast, the type-IV isotherms of the -MnS sample showed a hysteresis loop, while the main pore diameter distribution was observed between 10 and 40 nm, suggesting its higher adsorption ability compared to -MnS.Moreover, the type-IV isotherms of -MnS-Pd1.5 exhibited a larger hysteresis loop and the intensity of the pore diameter distribution between 10 and 40 nm was significantly higher than that of -MnS, implying that the introduction of the Pd ions improved the adsorption ability of -MnS-Pd1.5 compared to pure -MnS. The CO 2 -TPD curves of the -MnS, -MnS and -MnS-PdX samples were also recorded (Fig. 5), as the strength of the CO 2 desorption peak reveals the CO 2 absorption ability of the different photocatalysts.Here, weak desorption peaks were detected in the range 50-450 C for -MnS and -MnS, indicating the weak CO 2 adsorption ability of these samples.In contrast, the CO 2 desorption peaks of the -MnS-PdX samples were higher than those of pure -MnS, while the CO 2 desorption peak strength was further enhanced at 50-450 C with increasing Pd content.Therefore, it was further confirmed that the introduction of Pd can improve the CO 2 adsorption ability of the photocatalysts, with -MnS-Pd1.5 showing the strongest capacity. For the measurement of the XPS valence band (VB) spectra of the examined samples, we considered that the zero-energy level was consistent with the work function (4.10 eV, Fermi level) of the XPS instrument, while the binding energy at the initial edge of the S 3p peak indicated the energy gap between the Fermi level and the VB top 24.Moreover, the Fermi level of the XPS instrument was calculated as 0.4 eV vs. NHE.Based on Fig. 6, the VBs of -MnS and -MnS were 1.52 eV (1.12 eV vs. NHE) and 2.02 eV (1.62 eV vs. NHE), respectively 17.However, a larger hump was observed at 1.31 eV (0.91 eV vs. NHE) for -MnS-Pd1.5 compared to pure -MnS, which was attributed to the Pd 4d state of the -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface.Therefore, we concluded that the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species is 0.71 eV above the VB of -MnS-PdX 10. The diffuse UV-Vis absorption spectra of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX were also obtained to study their response to light (Fig. 7). The absorption starting points of -MnS and -MnS appeared at 461 and 373 nm, indicating that their bandgaps were 2.69 and 3.32 eV, respectively (Fig. 7a).Based on the VBs of -MnS and -MnS (1.12 and 1.62 eV vs. NHE, respectively), their conduction bands (CBs) were found to be -1.57and -1.70 eV, respectively.After the surface modification with Pd, an additional absorption peak was observed at about 450 nm in the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the -MnS-PdX samples, which gradually increased with increasing Pd amount (Fig. 7b).This new absorption peak was attributed to the addition of the Pd species due to the transition of the -MnS-PdX electrons from the energy level of the -S-Pd-Ssurface species to the CB. To verify the energy band structure of the photocatalysts, the models of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX were established, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed.As shown in Fig. 8b and e, the zero levels for both -MnS and -MnS were located at the VB top, corresponding to the highest state energy level occupied by electrons, and their indirect bandgaps were 2.49 and 3.09 eV, respectively.Moreover, the VB of both -MnS and -MnS consisted of S 2p orbitals and a small amount of Mn 3d, while the CB consisted of Mn 3d orbitals and a small amount of S 2p (Fig. 8c andf).The DFT studies also revealed that the surface modification with Pd ions did not affect the bandgap of the -MnS-PdX samples, which was similar to that of pure -MnS (3.01 eV) (Fig. 8h), while a new energy level was observed near the VB of -MnS-PdX compared to pure -MnS, which was attributed to the Pd 4d states of the -S-Pd-S-surface species (Fig. 8i).Moreover, we concluded that the energy levels of the -S-Pd-S-surface species were occupied by electrons, as the zero-energy level of the -MnS-PdX samples was above the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species.It is also important to note that the theoretical calculation results were consistent with the experimental findings. The PL spectra and time-resolved PL decay curves of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX were recorded to investigate the behavior of the photocarriers.The PL peaks at 475 and 525 nm observed for -MnS, as well as the peaks at 450 and 515 nm for -MnS were obtained by curve fitting (Fig. 9).In particular, the peak of -MnS at 475 nm and that of -MnS at 450 nm were both attributed to the transition from the CB to the VB.Similarly, the PL peaks at 525 and 515 nm observed for -MnS and -MnS, respectively, were attributed to the transition from the CB to the defect energy level 25.Thus, the photo-generated electrons in the CB could be directly combined with the holes in the VB, producing fluorescence, or they could be transferred to the defect energy level and recombine with the VB holes.Therefore, the decrease in the PL intensity suggested the reduction of the photocarriers recombination and the increase of their separation.Moreover, the fluorescence intensity of -MnS was significantly higher than that of -MnS, implying that the photocarriers separation was lower for -MnS compared to -MnS.Furthermore, the PL intensity of the Pd-modified -MnS samples was significantly suppressed as the amount of Pd species increased (Fig. 9), indicating that the formation of -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface can effectively inhibit the recombination of photo-generated charge carriers. The fluorescence lifetimes ( 1 and 2 ) of all the examined samples were also obtained by double exponential decay fitting (Fig. 10 and Table 2) 26272829.In general, the fast decay process ( 1 ) is due to the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes from the CB to the VB 303132, while the slow decay process ( 2 ) is attributed to the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes from the defect energy level to the VB 333435.Here, the fluorescence lifetime of -MnS was particularly longer than that of -MnS, implying that the separation efficiency of photo-generated charge carriers was higher for -MnS than for -MnS.Moreover, after the -MnS surface modification with Pd species, the 1 and 2 values of -MnS-Pd1.5 were significantly prolonged, suggesting that the separation of the photo-generated charge carriers was further accelerated compared to pure -MnS.Thus, in addition to the intrinsic transfer pathway, the surface -S-Pd-S-active species produced a new photogenic carrier transfer pathway.Since the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-species is more negative than the VB of -MnS, the holes will be transferred to the energy level of the -S-Pd-Sspecies, thus reducing the PL intensity and increasing the PL lifetime.It is therefore clear that -MnS-Pd1.5 can effectively accelerate the photocarriers separation. It has been reported that the final product of the studied photocatalytic reaction is CH 4 , while the intermediate product is CO 30.Thus, to investigate the photocatalytic performance of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX, their corresponding activities in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. 11 and Table 3) and CO under UV irradiation for 8 h (Fig. S1) were measured.Blank experiment and commercial P25 catalyst experiment were used as control groups.-MnS showed low photocatalytic activity, where only 0.351 mol CH 4 was produced.In contrast, the photocatalytic activity of -MnS was higher than that of -MnS, while 2.5 times more CH 4 (0.870 mol) was generated in the presence of -MnS (0.351 mol).The photocatalytic activity of -MnS was further improved after the modification of its surface with Pd species.Among the -MnS-PdX samples, -MnS-Pd1.5 showed the highest photocatalytic activity, while the photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 was 2.03 times higher than that of pure -MnS as well as 7.68 times higher than that of commercial P25 catalyst (Table 3).Fig. S2 shows the recycling test of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-Pd1.5 samples.All the catalysts could be used repetitively for more than 3 times without a significant decrease in their activities.More than 92 of the original photocatalytic activity was retained after two recycles.And the slight decrease might be caused by the loss of photocatalysts during separation and wash processes 36.Fig. S3 shows the XRD patterns of the spent material after the reaction.Compared with the catalyst before reaction, no significant changes in the structure were observed, indicating the excellent stability during the reaction process.Those results above showed that all the catalysts exhibited good stability. The main factors affecting the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts are the surface properties of the materials, the band structure, the matching of the band structure, the redox potential of the CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 , and the effective separation of photocarriers.Thus, to explain the photocatalytic mechanism, the energy band structures of the -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX samples were determined based on the abovementioned XPS VB and absorption spectra and the VASP calculation results (Fig. 12). The mechanism of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 can be summarized as in Eqs. ( 4)- (6).More specifically, the photocatalysts generate photo-excited holes and electrons under irradiation (h) (Eq.( 4)).Then, the photo-generated holes (h ) react with H 2 O to form O 2 and H (Eq.( 5)) (E redox 0.82 V vs. NHE; pH 7.0), while the electrons react with H to produce CH 4 (Eq.( 6)) (E redox -0.24V vs. NHE; pH 7.0). Photocatalyst h e - h (4) According to the mechanism of the CO 2 -to-CH 4 photocatalytic reduction, the VBs of -MnS and -MnS (1.12 eV vs. NHE for -MnS and 1.62 eV vs. NHE for -MnS) were more positive than the redox potential of H 2 O/H (0.82 V vs. NHE), whereas their CBs (-1.57eV vs. NHE for -MnS and -1.70 eV vs. NHE for -MnS) were more negative than that of CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V vs. NHE), indicating that the photo-generated carriers can take part in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .In addition, compared to -MnS, -MnS showed higher photocatalytic activity, higher adsorption capacity, larger specific surface area, lower recombination efficiency, and longer PL lifetime, which improved its photocatalytic activity, as more photocarriers contributed to the reduction of the surface-adsorbed CO 2 molecules to CH 4 .

For the synthesis of Pd-modified -MnS samples, methanol (20 mL) was mixed with deionized water (30 mL) at rt, followed by the addition of -MnS (1 g) and a certain amount of a PdCl 2 solution (0.01 M).The reaction solution was then stirred under ultraviolet (UV) light for 20 min.The resulting precipitate was washed with deionized water three times and dried at 90 C for 10 h.A series of Pd-modified -MnS samples with different Pd contents were thus prepared and designated as -MnS-PdX, where \"X\" represented the molar mass ratio of Pd to that of Mn (X 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5).The chemical reagents used in all processes were all of analytical grade. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Bruker-D8 X-ray powder diffractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA irradiated by Cu K ( 1.5406A).The average crystal size of the sulfide samples was calculated based on the Scherrer equation (D ()/(cos), K 0.89).The scanning (SEM) and transition (TEM) electron microscopy images were obtained by a Zeiss Gemini 300 scanning electron microscope and a FEI Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope, respectively.Moreover, the specific surface area and pore distribution of the materials were measured by a Tristar 3000 surface area and pore analyzer.The CO 2 -temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) patterns were recorded by an AutoChem1 II 2920 temperature-programmed chemisorption analyzer, while a PHI-5000 Versaprobe spectrometer and a monochromatic Al-K X-ray source (1486.6 eV) were used for the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).The binding energy was calibrated according to the C 1s peak of 284.8 eV.The UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were measured by a PE lambda 750S UV-Vis spectrophotometer, while the photoluminescence (PL) spectra and the timeresolved fluorescence decays were measured by an Edinburgh FLS9800 fluorescence spectrophotometer. A 350 W spherical mercury lamp was used as the light source for the photocatalytic reactions.100 mg of each photocatalyst was placed on a 1.0 3.0 cm glass plate, which was in turn placed in the center of a 350 mL tubular quartz reactor filled with 99.999 CO 2 at a flow rate of 20 mL min -1 for 1 h.Deionized water (1.5 mL) was also injected into the reactor, which was then placed vertically 10 cm below the spherical mercury lamp, and the light source was switched on.A sample of the gas mixture (0.4 mL) was extracted from the reactor every 2 h, and the amount of CH 4 produced was determined by a photocatalytic activity detector.This detector consisted of a hydrogen generator (BCHP, sph-300a), an automatic air source (BCHP, spb-3), a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, gc-2010plus), and a computer.The blank experiment was performed under the same conditions without a photocatalyst.The conditions and process of the recycling test is the same as the photocatalytic activity experiment.Between each of the recycling test, the catalyst needs to be washed and dried, and the reactor is refilled with carbon dioxide and distilled water.The values of quantum efficiency can be calculated from Eq.

All theoretical calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio software package (VASP) with projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials.The structures were modeled based on the generalized gradient approximation and the -MnS and -MnS models (80 atoms each) were established.The thickness of the vacuum zone was 15 A.Each Pd ion (Pd 2 ) in the -MnS-PdX samples was coupled to two surface bridge S ions (S 2-) on the 0 0 2 plane.Due to the standard PAW potential, the Mn3d 5 4s 2 , S3s 2 3p 4 , and Pd4d 10 states were considered as valence electrons.The energy cut-off value was 364 eV.On a 4 4 4kpoints grid of the Brillouin zone, a hexagonal super element was used to calculate the intrinsic defects and 80 atoms were used to calculate the external defects.The structure was obtained by optimizing the original element according to the experimental lattice parameters.The error of the repeated optimization process was less than 0.001.Moreover, the structural relaxation was performed with a force convergence criterion of 0.01 eV A -1 .Compared to the experimental results, the bandgap was often underestimated due to the defect of the exchange correction function in the description of the excited state."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "The diffuse UV-Vis absorption spectra of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX were also obtained to study their response to light (Fig. 7).", "context": "To investigate the morphologies and surface properties of the photocatalysts, we measured the SEM, TEM, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, pore size distribution, and CO 2 -TPD patterns of the -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX samples.More specifically, -MnS had a regular octahedral structure with an average edge size of about 5 m (Fig. 1a andb), while the measured lattice spacing was found to be 0.261 nm, corresponding to the 2 0 0 plane of -MnS (Fig. 1c).In contrast, -MnS exhibited a truncated hexagonal prism structure exposed with 1 0 0, 1 1 0, and 1 0 2 facets (Fig. 1d ande).-MnS consisted of a large number of uniform rods with hexagonal end faces.The diameter and length of the rods were about 1.0 and 2.0 m, respectively.In addition, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1f) revealed the existence of interplanar spacings of 0.345 nm, which were attributed to the 1 0 0 crystal plane of -MnS.After the introduction of the Pd ions, no change was observed in the morphological shape of -MnS-Pd1.5 compared to -MnS, as it still exhibited a truncated hexagonal prism structure (Fig. 1g andh).It is also worth noting that neither PdS nor other Pd related compounds were detected in the HRTEM images of -MnS-Pd1.5,indicating that the introduced Pd ions may exist on the -MnS surface as Pd species.Thus, the crystal structure and existing states of Pd ions on the -MnS surface were further studied by XRD and XPS. The XRD pattern of -MnS corresponded to the cubic phase (PDF06-0518), while that of -MnS corresponded to the hexagonal phase (PDF40-1289) (Fig. 2) 17,18.After the introduction of the Pd ions, the structure of -MnS remained unchanged, and no diffractive peaks of PdS or other Pd related compounds were observed in the XRD patterns of the -MnS-PdX samples.Furthermore, the addition of Pd increased the specific surface area of the photocatalysts and decreased the grain size (Table 1), thus clearly indicating that Pd ions can inhibit the growth of -MnS grains. Moreover, based on Table 1, the diffractive peaks, cell parameters, and cell volume of -MnS-Pd1.5 were similar to those of -MnS, indicating that the Pd ions do not enter the -MnS lattice.According to the doping mechanism, the ion radius of Pd 2 (85 pm) is greater than that of Mn 2 (67 pm), making it difficult for Pd 2 to enter the -MnS crystal in the interstitial mode 19.Moreover, based on Fig. 2 and Table 1, the lattice volume and lattice parameters of -MnS-Pd1.5 did not increase compared to pure -MnS, while its diffraction peak did not shift to lower diffraction angles, indicating that the introduced Pd ions will not be doped in -MnS in the substitution mode.Therefore, we concluded that Pd 2 exist on the surface of -MnS as active species 19. The Pd 3d XPS spectra of -MnS-Pd1.5 and PdS (Fig. 3a) revealed that the binding energy of Pd 3d 5/2 (336.4 eV) was between the metal Pd (335.2 eV) and PdS (336.8 eV).Thus, the two peaks at 336.4 and 341.7 eV were assigned to Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 of the -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface, respectively 20,21.In the S 2p XPS spectra of -MnS-Pd1.5 (Fig. 3b), the two strong peaks at about 159.4 and 160.6 eV were assigned to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 , respectively, and were almost the same as those of pure -MnS.However, two additional peaks were observed at 160.9 and 162.0 eV, which were lower than the binding energy of PdS (162.0 and 163.2 eV) and were attributed to the unsaturated surface S 2-species generated by the introduction of the Pd species 22.Therefore, based on the XRD, XPS, and HRTEM results, it was revealed that the -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface are formed by the coupling of each Pd 2 species with two unsaturated S 2-ions 23. The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution of the examined samples were also studied.As shown in Fig. 4, almost no hysteresis loop was observed in the isotherm of -MnS, while the pore size distribution curve was almost a horizontal line, indicating that the adsorption capacity of -MnS is weak.In contrast, the type-IV isotherms of the -MnS sample showed a hysteresis loop, while the main pore diameter distribution was observed between 10 and 40 nm, suggesting its higher adsorption ability compared to -MnS.Moreover, the type-IV isotherms of -MnS-Pd1.5 exhibited a larger hysteresis loop and the intensity of the pore diameter distribution between 10 and 40 nm was significantly higher than that of -MnS, implying that the introduction of the Pd ions improved the adsorption ability of -MnS-Pd1.5 compared to pure -MnS. The CO 2 -TPD curves of the -MnS, -MnS and -MnS-PdX samples were also recorded (Fig. 5), as the strength of the CO 2 desorption peak reveals the CO 2 absorption ability of the different photocatalysts.Here, weak desorption peaks were detected in the range 50-450 C for -MnS and -MnS, indicating the weak CO 2 adsorption ability of these samples.In contrast, the CO 2 desorption peaks of the -MnS-PdX samples were higher than those of pure -MnS, while the CO 2 desorption peak strength was further enhanced at 50-450 C with increasing Pd content.Therefore, it was further confirmed that the introduction of Pd can improve the CO 2 adsorption ability of the photocatalysts, with -MnS-Pd1.5 showing the strongest capacity. For the measurement of the XPS valence band (VB) spectra of the examined samples, we considered that the zero-energy level was consistent with the work function (4.10 eV, Fermi level) of the XPS instrument, while the binding energy at the initial edge of the S 3p peak indicated the energy gap between the Fermi level and the VB top 24.Moreover, the Fermi level of the XPS instrument was calculated as 0.4 eV vs. NHE.Based on Fig. 6, the VBs of -MnS and -MnS were 1.52 eV (1.12 eV vs. NHE) and 2.02 eV (1.62 eV vs. NHE), respectively 17.However, a larger hump was observed at 1.31 eV (0.91 eV vs. NHE) for -MnS-Pd1.5 compared to pure -MnS, which was attributed to the Pd 4d state of the -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface.Therefore, we concluded that the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species is 0.71 eV above the VB of -MnS-PdX 10. The diffuse UV-Vis absorption spectra of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX were also obtained to study their response to light (Fig. 7). The absorption starting points of -MnS and -MnS appeared at 461 and 373 nm, indicating that their bandgaps were 2.69 and 3.32 eV, respectively (Fig. 7a).Based on the VBs of -MnS and -MnS (1.12 and 1.62 eV vs. NHE, respectively), their conduction bands (CBs) were found to be -1.57and -1.70 eV, respectively.After the surface modification with Pd, an additional absorption peak was observed at about 450 nm in the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the -MnS-PdX samples, which gradually increased with increasing Pd amount (Fig. 7b).This new absorption peak was attributed to the addition of the Pd species due to the transition of the -MnS-PdX electrons from the energy level of the -S-Pd-Ssurface species to the CB. To verify the energy band structure of the photocatalysts, the models of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX were established, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed.As shown in Fig. 8b and e, the zero levels for both -MnS and -MnS were located at the VB top, corresponding to the highest state energy level occupied by electrons, and their indirect bandgaps were 2.49 and 3.09 eV, respectively.Moreover, the VB of both -MnS and -MnS consisted of S 2p orbitals and a small amount of Mn 3d, while the CB consisted of Mn 3d orbitals and a small amount of S 2p (Fig. 8c andf).The DFT studies also revealed that the surface modification with Pd ions did not affect the bandgap of the -MnS-PdX samples, which was similar to that of pure -MnS (3.01 eV) (Fig. 8h), while a new energy level was observed near the VB of -MnS-PdX compared to pure -MnS, which was attributed to the Pd 4d states of the -S-Pd-S-surface species (Fig. 8i).Moreover, we concluded that the energy levels of the -S-Pd-S-surface species were occupied by electrons, as the zero-energy level of the -MnS-PdX samples was above the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species.It is also important to note that the theoretical calculation results were consistent with the experimental findings. The PL spectra and time-resolved PL decay curves of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX were recorded to investigate the behavior of the photocarriers.The PL peaks at 475 and 525 nm observed for -MnS, as well as the peaks at 450 and 515 nm for -MnS were obtained by curve fitting (Fig. 9).In particular, the peak of -MnS at 475 nm and that of -MnS at 450 nm were both attributed to the transition from the CB to the VB.Similarly, the PL peaks at 525 and 515 nm observed for -MnS and -MnS, respectively, were attributed to the transition from the CB to the defect energy level 25.Thus, the photo-generated electrons in the CB could be directly combined with the holes in the VB, producing fluorescence, or they could be transferred to the defect energy level and recombine with the VB holes.Therefore, the decrease in the PL intensity suggested the reduction of the photocarriers recombination and the increase of their separation.Moreover, the fluorescence intensity of -MnS was significantly higher than that of -MnS, implying that the photocarriers separation was lower for -MnS compared to -MnS.Furthermore, the PL intensity of the Pd-modified -MnS samples was significantly suppressed as the amount of Pd species increased (Fig. 9), indicating that the formation of -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface can effectively inhibit the recombination of photo-generated charge carriers. The fluorescence lifetimes ( 1 and 2 ) of all the examined samples were also obtained by double exponential decay fitting (Fig. 10 and Table 2) 26272829.In general, the fast decay process ( 1 ) is due to the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes from the CB to the VB 303132, while the slow decay process ( 2 ) is attributed to the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes from the defect energy level to the VB 333435.Here, the fluorescence lifetime of -MnS was particularly longer than that of -MnS, implying that the separation efficiency of photo-generated charge carriers was higher for -MnS than for -MnS.Moreover, after the -MnS surface modification with Pd species, the 1 and 2 values of -MnS-Pd1.5 were significantly prolonged, suggesting that the separation of the photo-generated charge carriers was further accelerated compared to pure -MnS.Thus, in addition to the intrinsic transfer pathway, the surface -S-Pd-S-active species produced a new photogenic carrier transfer pathway.Since the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-species is more negative than the VB of -MnS, the holes will be transferred to the energy level of the -S-Pd-Sspecies, thus reducing the PL intensity and increasing the PL lifetime.It is therefore clear that -MnS-Pd1.5 can effectively accelerate the photocarriers separation. It has been reported that the final product of the studied photocatalytic reaction is CH 4 , while the intermediate product is CO 30.Thus, to investigate the photocatalytic performance of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX, their corresponding activities in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. 11 and Table 3) and CO under UV irradiation for 8 h (Fig. S1) were measured.Blank experiment and commercial P25 catalyst experiment were used as control groups.-MnS showed low photocatalytic activity, where only 0.351 mol CH 4 was produced.In contrast, the photocatalytic activity of -MnS was higher than that of -MnS, while 2.5 times more CH 4 (0.870 mol) was generated in the presence of -MnS (0.351 mol).The photocatalytic activity of -MnS was further improved after the modification of its surface with Pd species.Among the -MnS-PdX samples, -MnS-Pd1.5 showed the highest photocatalytic activity, while the photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 was 2.03 times higher than that of pure -MnS as well as 7.68 times higher than that of commercial P25 catalyst (Table 3).Fig. S2 shows the recycling test of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-Pd1.5 samples.All the catalysts could be used repetitively for more than 3 times without a significant decrease in their activities.More than 92 of the original photocatalytic activity was retained after two recycles.And the slight decrease might be caused by the loss of photocatalysts during separation and wash processes 36.Fig. S3 shows the XRD patterns of the spent material after the reaction.Compared with the catalyst before reaction, no significant changes in the structure were observed, indicating the excellent stability during the reaction process.Those results above showed that all the catalysts exhibited good stability. The main factors affecting the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts are the surface properties of the materials, the band structure, the matching of the band structure, the redox potential of the CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 , and the effective separation of photocarriers.Thus, to explain the photocatalytic mechanism, the energy band structures of the -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX samples were determined based on the abovementioned XPS VB and absorption spectra and the VASP calculation results (Fig. 12). The mechanism of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 can be summarized as in Eqs. ( 4)- (6).More specifically, the photocatalysts generate photo-excited holes and electrons under irradiation (h) (Eq.( 4)).Then, the photo-generated holes (h ) react with H 2 O to form O 2 and H (Eq.( 5)) (E redox 0.82 V vs. NHE; pH 7.0), while the electrons react with H to produce CH 4 (Eq.( 6)) (E redox -0.24V vs. NHE; pH 7.0). Photocatalyst h e - h (4) According to the mechanism of the CO 2 -to-CH 4 photocatalytic reduction, the VBs of -MnS and -MnS (1.12 eV vs. NHE for -MnS and 1.62 eV vs. NHE for -MnS) were more positive than the redox potential of H 2 O/H (0.82 V vs. NHE), whereas their CBs (-1.57eV vs. NHE for -MnS and -1.70 eV vs. NHE for -MnS) were more negative than that of CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V vs. NHE), indicating that the photo-generated carriers can take part in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .In addition, compared to -MnS, -MnS showed higher photocatalytic activity, higher adsorption capacity, larger specific surface area, lower recombination efficiency, and longer PL lifetime, which improved its photocatalytic activity, as more photocarriers contributed to the reduction of the surface-adsorbed CO 2 molecules to CH 4 . The photocatalytic activities of the -MnS-PdX samples were further improved due to the formation of the -S-Pd-S-surface species.In particular, the formation of the -S-Pd-S-active species increased the specific surface area and the CO 2 absorption ability of the -MnS-PdX samples compared to pure -MnS, thus favoring the photocatalytic reactions on their surface.Moreover, the energy level of the -S-Pd-Ssurface species improved the absorption of visible light, produced more photocarriers, and prolonged the lifetime of the photo-generated carriers, which in turn improved the separation of the photo-generated carriers and enhanced the photocatalytic activity of -MnS-PdX.In addition, as the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species (0.91 eV vs. NHE) was 0.71 eV above the VB of -MnS, it was more consistent with the redox potential of H 2 O/H (0.82 V vs. NHE) than pure -MnS.Thus, the holes on the VB migrated to the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species and further reacted with H 2 O adsorbed on the surface to form H and O 2 (Eq.( 5)).At the same time, the electrons on the CB were transferred to the surface and reacted with the adsorbed CO 2 and H species to form CH 4 (Eq.( 6)).Hence, the photocarriers were effectively separated, implying that more photocarriers contributed to the CO 2 -to-CH 4 photoreduction, thus efficiently improving the photocatalytic activity of -MnS-PdX 373839.These results could also explain the higher photocatalytic activity of -MnS-PdX in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 compared to pure -MnS."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Thus, to investigate the photocatalytic performance of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX, their corresponding activities in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. 11 and Table 3) and CO under UV irradiation for 8 h (Fig. S1) were measured.", "context": "To investigate the morphologies and surface properties of the photocatalysts, we measured the SEM, TEM, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, pore size distribution, and CO 2 -TPD patterns of the -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX samples.More specifically, -MnS had a regular octahedral structure with an average edge size of about 5 m (Fig. 1a andb), while the measured lattice spacing was found to be 0.261 nm, corresponding to the 2 0 0 plane of -MnS (Fig. 1c).In contrast, -MnS exhibited a truncated hexagonal prism structure exposed with 1 0 0, 1 1 0, and 1 0 2 facets (Fig. 1d ande).-MnS consisted of a large number of uniform rods with hexagonal end faces.The diameter and length of the rods were about 1.0 and 2.0 m, respectively.In addition, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1f) revealed the existence of interplanar spacings of 0.345 nm, which were attributed to the 1 0 0 crystal plane of -MnS.After the introduction of the Pd ions, no change was observed in the morphological shape of -MnS-Pd1.5 compared to -MnS, as it still exhibited a truncated hexagonal prism structure (Fig. 1g andh).It is also worth noting that neither PdS nor other Pd related compounds were detected in the HRTEM images of -MnS-Pd1.5,indicating that the introduced Pd ions may exist on the -MnS surface as Pd species.Thus, the crystal structure and existing states of Pd ions on the -MnS surface were further studied by XRD and XPS.

The Pd 3d XPS spectra of -MnS-Pd1.5 and PdS (Fig. 3a) revealed that the binding energy of Pd 3d 5/2 (336.4 eV) was between the metal Pd (335.2 eV) and PdS (336.8 eV).Thus, the two peaks at 336.4 and 341.7 eV were assigned to Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 of the -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface, respectively 20,21.In the S 2p XPS spectra of -MnS-Pd1.5 (Fig. 3b), the two strong peaks at about 159.4 and 160.6 eV were assigned to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 , respectively, and were almost the same as those of pure -MnS.However, two additional peaks were observed at 160.9 and 162.0 eV, which were lower than the binding energy of PdS (162.0 and 163.2 eV) and were attributed to the unsaturated surface S 2-species generated by the introduction of the Pd species 22.Therefore, based on the XRD, XPS, and HRTEM results, it was revealed that the -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface are formed by the coupling of each Pd 2 species with two unsaturated S 2-ions 23.

The diffuse UV-Vis absorption spectra of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX were also obtained to study their response to light (Fig. 7). The absorption starting points of -MnS and -MnS appeared at 461 and 373 nm, indicating that their bandgaps were 2.69 and 3.32 eV, respectively (Fig. 7a).Based on the VBs of -MnS and -MnS (1.12 and 1.62 eV vs. NHE, respectively), their conduction bands (CBs) were found to be -1.57and -1.70 eV, respectively.After the surface modification with Pd, an additional absorption peak was observed at about 450 nm in the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the -MnS-PdX samples, which gradually increased with increasing Pd amount (Fig. 7b).This new absorption peak was attributed to the addition of the Pd species due to the transition of the -MnS-PdX electrons from the energy level of the -S-Pd-Ssurface species to the CB.

The PL spectra and time-resolved PL decay curves of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX were recorded to investigate the behavior of the photocarriers.The PL peaks at 475 and 525 nm observed for -MnS, as well as the peaks at 450 and 515 nm for -MnS were obtained by curve fitting (Fig. 9).In particular, the peak of -MnS at 475 nm and that of -MnS at 450 nm were both attributed to the transition from the CB to the VB.Similarly, the PL peaks at 525 and 515 nm observed for -MnS and -MnS, respectively, were attributed to the transition from the CB to the defect energy level 25.Thus, the photo-generated electrons in the CB could be directly combined with the holes in the VB, producing fluorescence, or they could be transferred to the defect energy level and recombine with the VB holes.Therefore, the decrease in the PL intensity suggested the reduction of the photocarriers recombination and the increase of their separation.Moreover, the fluorescence intensity of -MnS was significantly higher than that of -MnS, implying that the photocarriers separation was lower for -MnS compared to -MnS.Furthermore, the PL intensity of the Pd-modified -MnS samples was significantly suppressed as the amount of Pd species increased (Fig. 9), indicating that the formation of -S-Pd-S-species on the -MnS surface can effectively inhibit the recombination of photo-generated charge carriers. The fluorescence lifetimes ( 1 and 2 ) of all the examined samples were also obtained by double exponential decay fitting (Fig. 10 and Table 2) 26272829.In general, the fast decay process ( 1 ) is due to the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes from the CB to the VB 303132, while the slow decay process ( 2 ) is attributed to the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes from the defect energy level to the VB 333435.Here, the fluorescence lifetime of -MnS was particularly longer than that of -MnS, implying that the separation efficiency of photo-generated charge carriers was higher for -MnS than for -MnS.Moreover, after the -MnS surface modification with Pd species, the 1 and 2 values of -MnS-Pd1.5 were significantly prolonged, suggesting that the separation of the photo-generated charge carriers was further accelerated compared to pure -MnS.Thus, in addition to the intrinsic transfer pathway, the surface -S-Pd-S-active species produced a new photogenic carrier transfer pathway.Since the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-species is more negative than the VB of -MnS, the holes will be transferred to the energy level of the -S-Pd-Sspecies, thus reducing the PL intensity and increasing the PL lifetime.It is therefore clear that -MnS-Pd1.5 can effectively accelerate the photocarriers separation. It has been reported that the final product of the studied photocatalytic reaction is CH 4 , while the intermediate product is CO 30.Thus, to investigate the photocatalytic performance of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX, their corresponding activities in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. 11 and Table 3) and CO under UV irradiation for 8 h (Fig. S1) were measured.Blank experiment and commercial P25 catalyst experiment were used as control groups.-MnS showed low photocatalytic activity, where only 0.351 mol CH 4 was produced.In contrast, the photocatalytic activity of -MnS was higher than that of -MnS, while 2.5 times more CH 4 (0.870 mol) was generated in the presence of -MnS (0.351 mol).The photocatalytic activity of -MnS was further improved after the modification of its surface with Pd species.Among the -MnS-PdX samples, -MnS-Pd1.5 showed the highest photocatalytic activity, while the photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 was 2.03 times higher than that of pure -MnS as well as 7.68 times higher than that of commercial P25 catalyst (Table 3).Fig. S2 shows the recycling test of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-Pd1.5 samples.All the catalysts could be used repetitively for more than 3 times without a significant decrease in their activities.More than 92 of the original photocatalytic activity was retained after two recycles.And the slight decrease might be caused by the loss of photocatalysts during separation and wash processes 36.Fig. S3 shows the XRD patterns of the spent material after the reaction.Compared with the catalyst before reaction, no significant changes in the structure were observed, indicating the excellent stability during the reaction process.Those results above showed that all the catalysts exhibited good stability. The main factors affecting the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts are the surface properties of the materials, the band structure, the matching of the band structure, the redox potential of the CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 , and the effective separation of photocarriers.Thus, to explain the photocatalytic mechanism, the energy band structures of the -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX samples were determined based on the abovementioned XPS VB and absorption spectra and the VASP calculation results (Fig. 12). The mechanism of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 can be summarized as in Eqs. ( 4)- (6).More specifically, the photocatalysts generate photo-excited holes and electrons under irradiation (h) (Eq.( 4)).Then, the photo-generated holes (h ) react with H 2 O to form O 2 and H (Eq.( 5)) (E redox 0.82 V vs. NHE; pH 7.0), while the electrons react with H to produce CH 4 (Eq.( 6)) (E redox -0.24V vs. NHE; pH 7.0). Photocatalyst h e - h (4) According to the mechanism of the CO 2 -to-CH 4 photocatalytic reduction, the VBs of -MnS and -MnS (1.12 eV vs. NHE for -MnS and 1.62 eV vs. NHE for -MnS) were more positive than the redox potential of H 2 O/H (0.82 V vs. NHE), whereas their CBs (-1.57eV vs. NHE for -MnS and -1.70 eV vs. NHE for -MnS) were more negative than that of CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V vs. NHE), indicating that the photo-generated carriers can take part in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .In addition, compared to -MnS, -MnS showed higher photocatalytic activity, higher adsorption capacity, larger specific surface area, lower recombination efficiency, and longer PL lifetime, which improved its photocatalytic activity, as more photocarriers contributed to the reduction of the surface-adsorbed CO 2 molecules to CH 4 . The photocatalytic activities of the -MnS-PdX samples were further improved due to the formation of the -S-Pd-S-surface species.In particular, the formation of the -S-Pd-S-active species increased the specific surface area and the CO 2 absorption ability of the -MnS-PdX samples compared to pure -MnS, thus favoring the photocatalytic reactions on their surface.Moreover, the energy level of the -S-Pd-Ssurface species improved the absorption of visible light, produced more photocarriers, and prolonged the lifetime of the photo-generated carriers, which in turn improved the separation of the photo-generated carriers and enhanced the photocatalytic activity of -MnS-PdX.In addition, as the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species (0.91 eV vs. NHE) was 0.71 eV above the VB of -MnS, it was more consistent with the redox potential of H 2 O/H (0.82 V vs. NHE) than pure -MnS.Thus, the holes on the VB migrated to the energy level of the -S-Pd-S-surface species and further reacted with H 2 O adsorbed on the surface to form H and O 2 (Eq.( 5)).At the same time, the electrons on the CB were transferred to the surface and reacted with the adsorbed CO 2 and H species to form CH 4 (Eq.( 6)).Hence, the photocarriers were effectively separated, implying that more photocarriers contributed to the CO 2 -to-CH 4 photoreduction, thus efficiently improving the photocatalytic activity of -MnS-PdX 373839.These results could also explain the higher photocatalytic activity of -MnS-PdX in the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 compared to pure -MnS."}, {"llm generation": "UV light", "source": "Photocatalytic activity of commercial P25, -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX under UV light irradiation for 8 h.", "context": "A series of -MnS, -MnS, and -MnS-PdX photocatalysts were prepared.Among them, -MnS had a higher specific surface area and photocatalytic separation rate than -MnS, resulting in higher photo- The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
