Subsequently, MMT dissolved in isopropanol was added drop by drop into the titanium sol.The process of gelation was continued by stirring the mixture at 30 C for another 6 h until thick sol was formed.After aging, the slurry was dried in the oven at 80 C for 24 h under airflow.Finally, the samples were calcined in a muffle furnace at a rate of 5 C/min up to 500 C and held at this temperature for 5 h.To synthesize TiO 2 with various concentration of MMT loading, the same procedure was repeated with different MMT loading as per requirements.For comparison, pure TiO 2 nanoparticles were also prepared by applying the same procedure. In order to determine the structure and crystalinity of the photocatalysts, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on Bruker D8 advance diffractometer (Cu-K radiation, wavelength 1.54 A, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA).The scanning rate was 1.2 min -1 from 1.5 to 80 .The crystal size was calculated using Scherrer's equation.The surface morphology was examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) with Carl Zeiss Supra 35 VP FE-SEM instrument.The crystallite shape and dispersion of TiO 2 at MMT galleries were observed using TEM and HR-TEM with FEI-Tecni G2 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) at EFGO Scientific located at Kulim Hi Tech, Kedah, Malaysia.The infrared spectra were measured at room temperature in the range of 4000-400 cm -1 with Spectrum 2000 Explorer Fourier Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) Spectrometer.The nanocomposite powders were dispersed in KBr (90 wt. of all samples).Textural characterizations of the samples were carried out with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption properties were examined at 77 K.The samples were pre-dried with preliminary heat at 90 C (1 C/min) for 1 h to remove moisture and then degassed at 350 C (10 C/min) for 8 h prior to measurements.The specific surface area (S BET ) of monolayer coverage was determined using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.The pore size distribution was obtained from the adsorption branch of the isotherm by means of Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples were measured with UV-3101PC spectrophotometer.The recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs was measured by photoluminescence (PL) spectra employing PerkinElmer LS 55 Luminescence Spectrometer. The schematic photocatalytic reaction system for reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, illustrated in Fig. 1, consisted of stainless steel chamber having length of 9.5 cm, width of 3.75 cm and total volume of 106 cm 3 .The reactor was equipped with a quartz window for the passing of light irradiations.The light source used to activate the photocatalytic reactions was a 500 W mercury lamp for UV irradiations source, having maximum irradiations intensity at 365 nm.The lamp was equipped with water jacket to remove infrared light and heat.The light intensity was measured using online optical process monitor ILT OPM-1D and SED008/W sensor.The reactor was covered with aluminum foil to ensure all the light participated in reactions were from the quartz window only.About 50 mg of powdered photocatalyst was distributed uniformly inside at the bottom of the reactor.The reactor was purged using helium (He) flow and checked for leakage at 2 bar pressure for several hours.Compressed CO 2 (99.999) regulated by mass flow controller (MFC) was bubbled through water bubbler saturator to carry moisture.The concentration of CO 2 was controlled using helium as diluting gas (99.999).The reactor was purged for an hour using mixtures of CO 2 and helium prior to the start of experiment.The pressure of CO 2 and He (helium) gas mixtures up to 0.20 bars above atmospheric pressure and CO 2 concentration of 20 were maintained throughout the study. The products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890 N, USA) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionized detector FID (GC/FID/TCD).The gaseous products from the reactor were also taken using gastight syringe (Agilent, 1000 l) at regular intervals for offline analysis using the same volume as that of online.Furthermore, FID detector was connected with HP PLOT Q capillary column for separation of C 1 -C 6 hydrocarbons, alcohols and oxygenated compound while TCD detector consisted of Porapak Q, DC-200, and MS column for separation of C 1 -C 6 paraffins and olefins hydrocarbons, CO 2 , H 2 , O 2 , N 2 and CO."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2, MMT/TiO2 photocatalysts", "source": "Fig. 2 presents the XRD patterns of TiO 2 , MMT and MMT containing photocatalysts calcined at 500 C for 5 h.", "context": "Fig. 2 presents the XRD patterns of TiO 2 , MMT and MMT containing photocatalysts calcined at 500 C for 5 h.The peaks of TiO 2 revealed pure crystalline and anatase phase.With 10 wt. MMT loading into TiO 2 , pure anatase phase of TiO 2 was produced with wide diffraction peaks.In case of 20 wt. MMT loading, the diffraction peaks were more wider and weaker than those of photocatalysts prepared without MMT.The MMT XRD pattern showed basal (0 0 1) reflection around 2A 3.70 .However, MMT containing nanocomposites had dissimilar XRD patterns than the pure MMT.The eminent MMT peak at around 2A 3.70 , due to layer clays, has disappeared for all TiO 2 containing nanocomposites.This indicates that layered structures of MMT have been destroyed.Furthermore, MMT containing nanocomposites remained original reflections of anatase crystalline phase with no additional peak.However, diffraction peak around 2A 25.50 (1 0 1) of MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposites became weaker and wider and similar trends could be seen for all TiO 2 anatase peaks.These results suggested that layered structure of silicate in MMT has an effect on crystal lattice of MMT containing nanocomposites.This also reveals that addition of MMT in the system allowed the silicate layer of MMT to behave as barrier, which prevented the agglomeration and natural crystallization of TiO 2 sol. The average crystallite size of TiO 2 nanocomposites was calculated using Scherer's equation according to the (1 0 1) TiO 2 peak (Eq.( 1)) 31,32. where L is the thickness of crystallite (nm), k is a constant depending on crystallite shape (0.90 for this study), is the X-ray wavelength (nm), is full peak width at half max in radians and A is Bragg's angle of the 2A peak.The crystallite sizes of TiO 2 and 20 MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites were 18.7 and 13.87 nm respectively.The crystal size of TiO 2 decreased gradually with MMT loading (Table 1). The morphology and microscopic structure of 20 wt. MMT loading photocatalyst was investigated using SEM and FE-SEM as illustrated in Fig. 3(a-d).The SEM images of MMT plates in Fig. 3(a) were almost smooth and uniform in shape.Fig. 3(b) illustrates the FE-SEM images of TiO 2 nanoparticles dispersion on MMT plates.Fig. 3(c andd) exhibits higher magnified FE-SEM images of MMT modified TiO 2 photocatalyst.It is obvious that the MMT layers were destroyed, while TiO 2 nanoparticles were distributed over the entire surface of MMT plates. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) and highresolution electron microscopy (HR-TEM) of 20 wt. MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposite are depicted in Fig. 4(a-d The infrared (IR) spectra of TiO 2 and its composites are exhibited in Fig. 5.In the spectrum of pure anatase phase of TiO 2 , the stretching bend at 1615 cm -1 indicated chemisorbed H 2 O in TiO 2 is negligible.As shown in the IR spectrum of MMT, the broad band around 3630 cm -1 is attributed to Al 2 OH group of octahedral layer.The bands around 3460 cm -1 and 1630 cm -1 can be assigned to OH stretching and bending vibration of H 2 O molecules on the external layer.The peak at 1047 cm -1 corresponds to asymmetric vibration of SiO 2 tetrahedral in purified MMT.Several peaks between 1000 and 500 cm -1 are attributed to Al-IV tetrahedra 33.The IR spectrum of MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposites have obviously changed.The broad band around 3440 cm -1 and 1623 cm -1 corresponded to stretching vibration of OH group that are linked with titanium atoms (Ti OH) and to the bending vibration of H O H.These two bands are similar to bare TiO 2 photocatalyst.Furthermore, stretching band at about 1088 cm -1 and very weak stretching at around 550 cm -1 were observed due to asymmetric stretching vibration of SiO 2 tetrahedra 30,34. Adsorption isotherm, pore size distribution, and cumulative surface area of TiO 2 photocatalysts are depicted in Fig. 6.Fig. 6(a) exhibits the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of pure TiO 2 , and 20 wt. MMT/TiO 2 .The isotherms presents typical type IV curve of IUPAC with hysteresis loops, characteristics of mesoporous materials and associated with capillary condensation 35.The well-defined hysteresis loops with a steep desorption branches and less steep adsorption branches for all materials belongs to H1-type, indicating mesoporous structure of particles 36.The obvious formation of mesoporous TiO 2 samples without addition of surface directing agents is supposedly due to controlled hydrolysis process at normal temperature in presence of diluted acetic acid. The initial part of isotherms (at low P/Po) attributed to monolayer-multilayer adsorption on internal surface of materials.The steep increment at higher P/Po is due to capillary condensation within pores followed by saturation as the pores filled with liquid.The binding energy between adsorbate and surface for the first layer known as monolayer is taken as esoteric heat of adsorption.Binding energy of adsorption for all layers subsequent to monolayers can be referred as molar heat of condensation.The monolayer-multilayer is more dominant in TiO 2 in which capillary action started at P/Po 0.60 and 0.55, respectively.However, capillary and condensation action was more prominent in TiO 2 /MMT composite and is eminent at P/Po of 0.45.were due to MMT loading.The silicate layer of MMT can behave as barrier, which prevented the agglomeration and natural crystallization of TiO 2 sol. The surface area, pore volume and pore size of all samples are summarized in Table 1.The surface area was 47.98 m 2 g -1 and 82.62 m 2 g -1 for bare TiO 2 nanoparticles and 20 wt. MMT loading, respectively.The significant increase in TiO 2 surface area was due to highly dispersed TiO 2 over MMT layered structure and reduced TiO 2 nanoparticle size.The pore size of TiO 2 decreased from 10.12 nm to 7.05 nm with MMT loading due to the strong influence of MMT on crystal growth, resulting in smaller particle size.Similar trends were observed for BJH total pore volumes. The UV-vis absorbance spectra of all the photocatalysts and bare MMT are depicted in Fig. 7.The absorption spectrum of TiO 2 nanoparticles appeared around 398 nm, which has red shift compared with intrinsic anatase TiO 2 (energy gap is 3.20 eV).The absorption band edges of MMT modified TiO 2 samples were located at 404 and 408 nm for TiO 2 , 10 MMT and 20 MMT into TiO 2 , respectively.The light absorption of purified MMT increased to become almost transparent in the wavelength longer than 250 nm.However, in literatures, the absorption band edge for purified MMT (Na-MMT clay) was reported to be transparent in the wavelength range longer than 300 nm 30.The discrepancy in the results could be because of different types of MMT clays (Ammonium MMT clay in this study).Similar trends for light absorption are reported in literature over MMT K10 37. The absorbance spectra were used to calculate the band gap energy (eV) using Tauc equation shown in Eq. ( 2) 38. where , v, E g and A are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, band gap energy and a constant, respectively.The power 'n' characterizes the electronic transition during absorption process.The 'n' value is determined by the type of optical transition of a semiconductor especially having values 1/2, 3/2, 2, and 3 for direct allowed, direct forbidden, indirect allowed and indirect forbidden transitions, respectively.Furthermore, the most common method for the calculation of band gap energy (E bg ) involves plotting ( hv) n/2 vs. (hv).The E bg values for all samples were calculated from a plot of ( hv) 2 versus (hv) using direct method as shown in Fig. 8.The E bg estimated from the intercept of the tangents to the plots were 3.12, 3.07 and 3.04 eV for TiO 2 , 10 wt. MMT/TiO 2 and 20 wt. MMT/TiO 2 respectively.It is obvious that there is a decrease in the band gap energy compared to TiO 2 .In addition, there was blue band shift compared to TiO 2 .The absorption band gaps were shifted to shorter wavelengths, as the average particle size of TiO 2 -MMT was smaller than TiO 2 .The layered MMT structure suppressed the growth of TiO 2 , and affected the microstructure of TiO 2 and reduced the particle size. To understand the effect of modifier/sensitizers on the recombination of free electron-holes pairs, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were examined.In general, PL emission spectra can be used to envisage the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer of charges and to understand the destiny of electron-hole pairs in semiconductor materials.Fig. 9 reveals the PL spectra of bare TiO 2 , and MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposite calcined at 500 C and excited at 350 nm.MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibited PL signal with similar curve shape, demonstrating MMT did not result into new PL phenomenon.The TiO 2 nanoparticles exhibits a wide and strong PL signal in the range of 450-500 nm with the excited wavelength of 350 nm.The lower PL intensity infers lower recombination rate of photogenerated electron and holes pairs.The reduced recombination rate with addition of MMT into TiO 2 is attributed to reduced TiO 2 particle size in highly dispersed TiO 2 -MMT heterojunction.In addition, the presence of transition metal cations in MMT could also participate in trapping the electrons, resulting in reduced PL intensity 30.A significant reduction in PL intensity was observed with increasing MMT loading into the TiO 2 structure.This confirmed addition of MMT into TiO 2 efficiently stunted the photogenerated charges (electrons-holes) recombination that occurred at TiO 2 surface. Prior to CO 2 photoreduction experiments, a series of preliminary tests were conducted in the absence of CO 2 and H 2 O under UV irradiations for 4 h at 348 K for the following cases; (1) empty reactor and helium, (2) reactor with TiO 2 nanoparticles and helium and (3) MMT/TiO 2 photocatalysts and helium.In all cases, no reaction products were detected confirming no photodecomposition of organic residues in the catalyst, if any.Additional preliminary tests were conducted using H 2 O vapors and helium along with photocatalyst under UV irradiations.Again, in either case no carbon-containing compounds were present.These results confirmed photoreduction products were obtained from CO 2 source only.It reiterated that the photocatalytic reduction process require all three components i.e. catalyst, feed (CO 2 , H 2 O), light source and any carbon containing compound must be produced from CO 2 through photocatalytic reactions. Fig. 10 illustrates the effect of MMT loading on TiO 2 photocatalytic activity for transformation of CO 2 with H 2 O to CH 4 .By using pure TiO 2 , small amount of CH 4 was produced, while yield was improved by the dispersion of MMT into the TiO 2 structure.The higher yield rate is an evidence that photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 can be enhanced by increasing MMT loading up to an optimum loading of 20 wt..MMT loading beyond 20 wt. lowered the CO 2 photoreduction rate.The difference in the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 with various MMT loading mainly endorsed effective CO 2 adsorption and efficient charge production and separations over highly dispersed MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites.Furthermore, excessively high MMT loading may cause charge recombination centers and/or shield the TiO 2 surface from light absorption, both of which reduced the photocatalytic activity. In addition, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over pure MMT indicated MMT possessed the photocatalytic activity for the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapors, but its photocatalytic activity was lesser compared to TiO 2 and MMT/TiO 2 photocatalysts.Chen et al. 30 reported similar results during photocatalytic degradation of sulphorhodamine B under UV-Vis irradiations.MMT photoactivity may be due to the presence of various elements/defects at MMT layered structure and having higher capability of light absorption. Fig. 11 exhibits the relationship between CH 4 yield and H 2 O/CO 2 ratios in initial feed stream keeping all other parameters fixed.With the MMT loading of 20 wt. in TiO 2 , CH 4 yield increased with increasing H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio as the large concentration of H 2 O molecules adsorbed at the catalyst surface to react with CO 2 , resulting in high CO 2 photoreduction.Furthermore, CO 2 and H 2 O molecules were competitively activated by the charge transfer excited complexes and the values of H 2 O/CO 2 ratios influenced the selectivity for the formation of the desired products 39.The highest CH 4 yield was achieved at H 2 O/CO 2 ratio 0.35.Further increment in the feed ratios lowered the CO 2 photoreduction activity.This phenomenon was likely due to adsorption competition between CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on the active sites of MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites during photoreduction process.In presence of MMT, TiO 2 became super hydrophilic, when irradiated by UV light and H 2 O molecules would cover most of the catalyst surface.At high H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, CO 2 would have to compete with H 2 O for the active sites in order to react with adsorbed H 2 O. Thus, reducing H 2 O pressure or raising CO 2 pressure would increase CO 2 reduction rate.On the other hand, when H 2 O pressure was much lower than that of CO 2 , less H 2 O content would reduce the reaction rate.Therefore, an optimum H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio could enhance the CO 2 conversion efficiency.Similar findings have been reported in literature during photocatalytic CO 2 with H 2 O vapors using various TiO 2 based photocatalysts 40. The effect of reaction temperature on photocatalytic CO 2 reduction at 20 wt. MMT loading and H 2 O/CO 2 ratio 0.35 is shown in Fig. 12.It is obvious that CH 4 yield increased with reaction temperature.In general, higher temperature gave positive effects on photocatalytic reactions particularly in gas phase reactions and can accelerate the reaction rate.During photocatalysis process, simultaneous adsorption and desorption processes occurred at catalyst surface and rate of reaction depends on the efficiency of these processes.The increased in temperature increased desorption of reaction products from the catalyst surface and enhanced the chance of efficient collisions between the charge transfer excited state Ti 3 -O - species and reactant molecules 10.Moreover, in heterogeneous photocatalysis, reaction rates are usually determined by applying the principal of law of mass action in terms of surface concentrations.During desorption process at elevated temperature, diffusion of CO 2 toward catalyst surface could be increased to occupy vacant sites, thus probability of adsorption increases, resulting in higher reaction rates 41.Furthermore, the significant increase in reaction rate by increasing temperature indicated that activation energy decreased during course of reaction.Saladin and Alxneit 42 investigated the effect of temperature on photochemical reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O in gas phase over TiO 2 and reported similar trends. The effects of irradiation time on photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using MMT modified TiO 2 photocatalysts were investigated for the duration of 0-24 h as depicted in Figs. 13 and14.From the GC analysis, six products namely methane (CH 4 ), carbon monoxide (CO), ethane (C 2 H 6 ), ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propane (C 3 H 8 ), and propylene (C 3 H 6 ) were obtained.As shown in Fig. 13, CH 4 and CO were the main products and their yield rates increased gradually with reaction time.Significant amount of C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 6 and C 3 H 8 were also produced over MMT modified TiO 2 (Fig. 14).In addition, all products were produced continuously during the entire experiment in presence of MMT/TiO 2 and steady state was not achieved even after 24 h of irradiations.In case of TiO 2 , all the products were generated for the first 14 h (figure not shown here) before reaching steady-state condition.These results demonstrated MMT is a promising material for enhancing photoreduction efficiency as it provided more stability and reactivity to TiO 2 .Similar finding has been reported during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O over CdS-MMT photocatalyst 38. However, photo-oxidation products such as oxygen (O 2 ) were not detected in the gaseous product mixtures.O 2 was also not reported in previous studies during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 42.For this, several possibilities exist; nevertheless, it has also been reported that O 2 together with oxygen-containing compound such as CO could have been photo-adsorbed, blocking the active sites and hindering the diffusion of intermediates on the catalyst surface.Based on other related studies 43,44 which detected O 2 in the reaction products, it is likely that O 2 was also formed in this study but photoadsorption prevented it to be detected by MS column due to low concentration in gaseous product mixtures as similarly reported by other researchers 42. The average yield rates of CO 2 transformation products over TiO 2 and MMT modified TiO 2 photocatalysts are compared in Fig. 15.The presence of MMT plays an important role in efficient reduction of CO 2 to different paraffins and olefins.The total products significantly increased after MMT loading into TiO 2 .Over MMT modified TiO 2 , the largest yield of CH 4 was 441.5 mol g cat -1 h -1 ; 12 folds higher than pure TiO 2 .In addition, CO was the second largest product with yield rate of 103 mol g cat -1 h -1 .Significant amounts of C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons were also produced, which were not observed in bare TiO 2 .The photocatalytic performance of MMT modified TiO 2 was in the order of (mole per g of catalyst) CH 4 CO C 3 H 8 C 2 H 6 C 2 H 4 C 3 H 6 .Various sites of MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposites acted as oxidizing/reducing centers, providing electron to CO 2 as well as accepting electrons from H 2 O vapors in reaction mixture.Therefore, MMT served as electron traps to inhibit recombination of electron-holes pairs.On the other hand, surface hydroxyl (OH) groups over MMT/TiO 2 increased more CO 2 adsorption, which can enhance photocatalytic activity.In general, higher photoactivity of TiO 2 in the presence of MMT can be attributed to the followings: (1) The layered structure of silicate in MMT controls the crystal growth, resulting in smaller TiO 2 particle size.The TiO 2 with smaller particle sizes have higher photocatalytic activity due to more electrons being produced and are more mobile on TiO 2 surface.The smaller particle sizes also hindered recombination of electron-hole pairs.(2) The delaminated TiO 2 pillared montmorillonite has higher surface area because of its exfoliated structure.Due to this, there is possibility of higher CO 2 adsorption, efficient light harvesting/capturing and more photocatalytic reaction active sites, resulting in improved photo-efficiency.(3) In the galleries of MMT, there are possible d-orbits vacant cations that could trap electrons during TiO 2 photocatalysis, and possibly enhanced photocatalytic activity. During photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors under UV lightlight irradiations, CO, CH 4 and some higher hydrocarbons (attributed to paraffins and olefins) were detected.In these photocatalysis reactions, CO 2 reduced and H 2 O oxidized.In general, the first step in photocatalysis was the production of electrion-holes pairs when light striked on the TiO 2 surface.The electrons (e -) transferred from the TiO 2 conduction band for the photoreduction of CO 2 , yielding CO - 2 radicals.On the other hand, holes (h ) were transferred to H 2 O initiating its photooxidation, yielding hydrogen ions (H ) and hydroxyal radical ( OH) and further oxidized with OH radicals for the production of O 2 and H 44.The H radicals originated during reduction of proton reacted with carbon radicals on the catalyst surface to produce intermediates CO  During TiO 2 photocatalysis, large number of electrons would be produced due to highly dispersed nanosize TiO 2 particles over MMT layers.At the same time, electron transition of vacant d-orbits of metal ions on MMT supposedly trap charge particles (Eq.( 4)) resulting in more electron production and mobility over TiO 2 surface for CO 2 reduction. Since all of the above products were detected experimentally, CH 4 was confirmed to be produced from methyl radicals ( CH 3 ).These radicals were directly dependent on the formation of the intermediate product, CO.The production of higher CH 4 yield rate (Eq.( 8)) and other higher hydrocarbons (Eq.( 9)) also confirmed H 2 during water oxidation and carbon radicals during CO 2 reduction were produced excessively to support these reactions (Eqs.( 8) and ( 9)).Based on such observations, it could be assumed that large number of electron-hole pairs were produced over the surface of MMT modified TiO 2 , yielding CO as intermediate product, and finally C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons.Similar observations were reported by Saladin and Alxneit 42 during gas phase reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O over TiO 2 surface.Furthermore, higher hydrocarbons yield rates has confirmed that the reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 9) were more favorable over the MMT/TiO 2 surface.From the reaction summary and in view of the above observations, there is higher probability for producing hydrocarbons by improving the TiO 2 oxidation and reduction potentials.However, further investigations are required to understand the detailed reaction mechanism for predicting possible reaction products. The photocatalytic CO 2 transformation to CO and CH 4 over MMT modified TiO 2 could be further explained using energy band theory, which is based on the relative positions of conductance band, valance band and oxidation potentials.In general, photo-excited electrons can be consumed effectively, if the reduction potential of the reaction is lower than the conductance band potential of the semiconductor 45.The possible reactions that can occur during photocatalytic CO 2 with H 2 O to produce CO and CH 4 in terms of thermodynamic reduction potentials versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) can be described by reactions in Eqs. ( 10)-( 13) 464748. The conductance band potential of TiO 2 is E CB -0.50V at pH 7. CO was observed due to the reduction potential of E o (CO 2 /CO) -0.48V was lower than -0.5 V (conductane band of TiO 2 ).For CO 2 reduction to CH 4 , the lower reduction potential difference (E o (CO 2 /CH 4 ) -0.24V) also drove the reaction.Although the reduction potential of Eq. ( 10) is much lower than Eq. ( 12), eight electrons are required to produce CH 4 compared to only two for CO.Thus, significant yield rate of CO was also observed in the gaseous product mixtures. On the basis of XRD studies, TEM observations and reaction mechanism, a schematic reaction scheme is depicted in Fig. 16.During photocatalyitc CO 2 reduction, a series of reaction takes place to get valuable hydrocarbons, as portrayed in Fig. 16(a).Because of the efficient intercalation process, TiO 2 nanoparticles could penetrate and distribute over MMT layers and inside galleries to form delaminated TiO 2 pillared montmorillonite as portrayed in Fig. 16(b).Under light irraditions, there was efficient production and absoprtion of electrons over the MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites surface.Subsequently, electron transferred from the conductance band of TiO 2 , trapped by CO 2 molecules led to CO 2 reduction process.A series of reactions take place over delaminated TiO 2 pillared montmorillonite for possible higher yield rates of C 1 -C 3 paraffins and olefins.The higher CH 4 and significant C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons yield rates over MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites confirmed MMT as an efficient material for conversion of CO 2 to valuable C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons.More importantly, production of C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons have been reported for the first time over the MMT/TiO 2 photoctalyst."}, {"llm generation": "MMT modified TiO2 photocatalysts", "source": "MMT modified TiO 2 photocatalysts were synthesized by sol-gel single step method and for the first time were tested for the activity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O.", "context": "MMT modified TiO 2 photocatalysts were synthesized by sol-gel single step method and for the first time were tested for the activity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O.When MMT dispersed into TiO 2 solution, the silicate layer of MMT behaved as a barrier to prevent agglomeration formation.The layered MMT structure was destroyed during intercalation process and formed delaminated TiO 2 pillared montmorillonite.The average particle size of MMT modified TiO 2 was smaller than the bare TiO 2 nanoparticles.Therefore, loading MMT into TiO 2 structure increased surface area, reduced particle size and enabled efficient charge separation.Significant enhancement of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O to CO and C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons was observed over MMT modified TiO 2 compared to bare TiO 2 under UV irradiations.The effects of MMT loading, H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratios and reaction temperature was also investigated to maximize conversion efficiency.An optimum H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio 0.35 gave the highest yield for CH 4 .The temperature also improved the photoactivity by enhancing CO 2 adsorption rate and accelerating photogenerated species.The highest yield rates of CH 4 and CO as main products were 441.5 and 103 mol g cat -1 h -1 , respectively.The mechanism of CO 2 photoconversion with H 2 O to CH 4 and CO can be explained by energy band theory.MMT seems a promising material to improve the effectiveness and feasibility of TiO 2 as a photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction for carbon management applications.

Subsequently, MMT dissolved in isopropanol was added drop by drop into the titanium sol.The process of gelation was continued by stirring the mixture at 30 C for another 6 h until thick sol was formed.After aging, the slurry was dried in the oven at 80 C for 24 h under airflow.Finally, the samples were calcined in a muffle furnace at a rate of 5 C/min up to 500 C and held at this temperature for 5 h.To synthesize TiO 2 with various concentration of MMT loading, the same procedure was repeated with different MMT loading as per requirements.For comparison, pure TiO 2 nanoparticles were also prepared by applying the same procedure. In order to determine the structure and crystalinity of the photocatalysts, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on Bruker D8 advance diffractometer (Cu-K radiation, wavelength 1.54 A, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA).The scanning rate was 1.2 min -1 from 1.5 to 80 .The crystal size was calculated using Scherrer's equation.The surface morphology was examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) with Carl Zeiss Supra 35 VP FE-SEM instrument.The crystallite shape and dispersion of TiO 2 at MMT galleries were observed using TEM and HR-TEM with FEI-Tecni G2 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) at EFGO Scientific located at Kulim Hi Tech, Kedah, Malaysia.The infrared spectra were measured at room temperature in the range of 4000-400 cm -1 with Spectrum 2000 Explorer Fourier Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) Spectrometer.The nanocomposite powders were dispersed in KBr (90 wt. of all samples).Textural characterizations of the samples were carried out with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption properties were examined at 77 K.The samples were pre-dried with preliminary heat at 90 C (1 C/min) for 1 h to remove moisture and then degassed at 350 C (10 C/min) for 8 h prior to measurements.The specific surface area (S BET ) of monolayer coverage was determined using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.The pore size distribution was obtained from the adsorption branch of the isotherm by means of Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples were measured with UV-3101PC spectrophotometer.The recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs was measured by photoluminescence (PL) spectra employing PerkinElmer LS 55 Luminescence Spectrometer. The schematic photocatalytic reaction system for reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, illustrated in Fig. 1, consisted of stainless steel chamber having length of 9.5 cm, width of 3.75 cm and total volume of 106 cm 3 .The reactor was equipped with a quartz window for the passing of light irradiations.The light source used to activate the photocatalytic reactions was a 500 W mercury lamp for UV irradiations source, having maximum irradiations intensity at 365 nm.The lamp was equipped with water jacket to remove infrared light and heat.The light intensity was measured using online optical process monitor ILT OPM-1D and SED008/W sensor.The reactor was covered with aluminum foil to ensure all the light participated in reactions were from the quartz window only.About 50 mg of powdered photocatalyst was distributed uniformly inside at the bottom of the reactor.The reactor was purged using helium (He) flow and checked for leakage at 2 bar pressure for several hours.Compressed CO 2 (99.999) regulated by mass flow controller (MFC) was bubbled through water bubbler saturator to carry moisture.The concentration of CO 2 was controlled using helium as diluting gas (99.999).The reactor was purged for an hour using mixtures of CO 2 and helium prior to the start of experiment.The pressure of CO 2 and He (helium) gas mixtures up to 0.20 bars above atmospheric pressure and CO 2 concentration of 20 were maintained throughout the study. The products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890 N, USA) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionized detector FID (GC/FID/TCD).The gaseous products from the reactor were also taken using gastight syringe (Agilent, 1000 l) at regular intervals for offline analysis using the same volume as that of online.Furthermore, FID detector was connected with HP PLOT Q capillary column for separation of C 1 -C 6 hydrocarbons, alcohols and oxygenated compound while TCD detector consisted of Porapak Q, DC-200, and MS column for separation of C 1 -C 6 paraffins and olefins hydrocarbons, CO 2 , H 2 , O 2 , N 2 and CO."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Prior to CO 2 photoreduction experiments, a series of preliminary tests were conducted in the absence of CO 2 and H 2 O under UV irradiations for 4 h at 348 K for the following cases; (1) empty reactor and helium, (2) reactor with TiO 2 nanoparticles and helium and (3) MMT/TiO 2 photocatalysts and helium.", "context": "Fig. 2 presents the XRD patterns of TiO 2 , MMT and MMT containing photocatalysts calcined at 500 C for 5 h.The peaks of TiO 2 revealed pure crystalline and anatase phase.With 10 wt. MMT loading into TiO 2 , pure anatase phase of TiO 2 was produced with wide diffraction peaks.In case of 20 wt. MMT loading, the diffraction peaks were more wider and weaker than those of photocatalysts prepared without MMT.The MMT XRD pattern showed basal (0 0 1) reflection around 2A 3.70 .However, MMT containing nanocomposites had dissimilar XRD patterns than the pure MMT.The eminent MMT peak at around 2A 3.70 , due to layer clays, has disappeared for all TiO 2 containing nanocomposites.This indicates that layered structures of MMT have been destroyed.Furthermore, MMT containing nanocomposites remained original reflections of anatase crystalline phase with no additional peak.However, diffraction peak around 2A 25.50 (1 0 1) of MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposites became weaker and wider and similar trends could be seen for all TiO 2 anatase peaks.These results suggested that layered structure of silicate in MMT has an effect on crystal lattice of MMT containing nanocomposites.This also reveals that addition of MMT in the system allowed the silicate layer of MMT to behave as barrier, which prevented the agglomeration and natural crystallization of TiO 2 sol. The average crystallite size of TiO 2 nanocomposites was calculated using Scherer's equation according to the (1 0 1) TiO 2 peak (Eq.( 1)) 31,32. where L is the thickness of crystallite (nm), k is a constant depending on crystallite shape (0.90 for this study), is the X-ray wavelength (nm), is full peak width at half max in radians and A is Bragg's angle of the 2A peak.The crystallite sizes of TiO 2 and 20 MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites were 18.7 and 13.87 nm respectively.The crystal size of TiO 2 decreased gradually with MMT loading (Table 1). The morphology and microscopic structure of 20 wt. MMT loading photocatalyst was investigated using SEM and FE-SEM as illustrated in Fig. 3(a-d).The SEM images of MMT plates in Fig. 3(a) were almost smooth and uniform in shape.Fig. 3(b) illustrates the FE-SEM images of TiO 2 nanoparticles dispersion on MMT plates.Fig. 3(c andd) exhibits higher magnified FE-SEM images of MMT modified TiO 2 photocatalyst.It is obvious that the MMT layers were destroyed, while TiO 2 nanoparticles were distributed over the entire surface of MMT plates. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) and highresolution electron microscopy (HR-TEM) of 20 wt. MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposite are depicted in Fig. 4(a-d The infrared (IR) spectra of TiO 2 and its composites are exhibited in Fig. 5.In the spectrum of pure anatase phase of TiO 2 , the stretching bend at 1615 cm -1 indicated chemisorbed H 2 O in TiO 2 is negligible.As shown in the IR spectrum of MMT, the broad band around 3630 cm -1 is attributed to Al 2 OH group of octahedral layer.The bands around 3460 cm -1 and 1630 cm -1 can be assigned to OH stretching and bending vibration of H 2 O molecules on the external layer.The peak at 1047 cm -1 corresponds to asymmetric vibration of SiO 2 tetrahedral in purified MMT.Several peaks between 1000 and 500 cm -1 are attributed to Al-IV tetrahedra 33.The IR spectrum of MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposites have obviously changed.The broad band around 3440 cm -1 and 1623 cm -1 corresponded to stretching vibration of OH group that are linked with titanium atoms (Ti OH) and to the bending vibration of H O H.These two bands are similar to bare TiO 2 photocatalyst.Furthermore, stretching band at about 1088 cm -1 and very weak stretching at around 550 cm -1 were observed due to asymmetric stretching vibration of SiO 2 tetrahedra 30,34. Adsorption isotherm, pore size distribution, and cumulative surface area of TiO 2 photocatalysts are depicted in Fig. 6.Fig. 6(a) exhibits the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of pure TiO 2 , and 20 wt. MMT/TiO 2 .The isotherms presents typical type IV curve of IUPAC with hysteresis loops, characteristics of mesoporous materials and associated with capillary condensation 35.The well-defined hysteresis loops with a steep desorption branches and less steep adsorption branches for all materials belongs to H1-type, indicating mesoporous structure of particles 36.The obvious formation of mesoporous TiO 2 samples without addition of surface directing agents is supposedly due to controlled hydrolysis process at normal temperature in presence of diluted acetic acid. The initial part of isotherms (at low P/Po) attributed to monolayer-multilayer adsorption on internal surface of materials.The steep increment at higher P/Po is due to capillary condensation within pores followed by saturation as the pores filled with liquid.The binding energy between adsorbate and surface for the first layer known as monolayer is taken as esoteric heat of adsorption.Binding energy of adsorption for all layers subsequent to monolayers can be referred as molar heat of condensation.The monolayer-multilayer is more dominant in TiO 2 in which capillary action started at P/Po 0.60 and 0.55, respectively.However, capillary and condensation action was more prominent in TiO 2 /MMT composite and is eminent at P/Po of 0.45.were due to MMT loading.The silicate layer of MMT can behave as barrier, which prevented the agglomeration and natural crystallization of TiO 2 sol. The surface area, pore volume and pore size of all samples are summarized in Table 1.The surface area was 47.98 m 2 g -1 and 82.62 m 2 g -1 for bare TiO 2 nanoparticles and 20 wt. MMT loading, respectively.The significant increase in TiO 2 surface area was due to highly dispersed TiO 2 over MMT layered structure and reduced TiO 2 nanoparticle size.The pore size of TiO 2 decreased from 10.12 nm to 7.05 nm with MMT loading due to the strong influence of MMT on crystal growth, resulting in smaller particle size.Similar trends were observed for BJH total pore volumes. The UV-vis absorbance spectra of all the photocatalysts and bare MMT are depicted in Fig. 7.The absorption spectrum of TiO 2 nanoparticles appeared around 398 nm, which has red shift compared with intrinsic anatase TiO 2 (energy gap is 3.20 eV).The absorption band edges of MMT modified TiO 2 samples were located at 404 and 408 nm for TiO 2 , 10 MMT and 20 MMT into TiO 2 , respectively.The light absorption of purified MMT increased to become almost transparent in the wavelength longer than 250 nm.However, in literatures, the absorption band edge for purified MMT (Na-MMT clay) was reported to be transparent in the wavelength range longer than 300 nm 30.The discrepancy in the results could be because of different types of MMT clays (Ammonium MMT clay in this study).Similar trends for light absorption are reported in literature over MMT K10 37. The absorbance spectra were used to calculate the band gap energy (eV) using Tauc equation shown in Eq. ( 2) 38. where , v, E g and A are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, band gap energy and a constant, respectively.The power 'n' characterizes the electronic transition during absorption process.The 'n' value is determined by the type of optical transition of a semiconductor especially having values 1/2, 3/2, 2, and 3 for direct allowed, direct forbidden, indirect allowed and indirect forbidden transitions, respectively.Furthermore, the most common method for the calculation of band gap energy (E bg ) involves plotting ( hv) n/2 vs. (hv).The E bg values for all samples were calculated from a plot of ( hv) 2 versus (hv) using direct method as shown in Fig. 8.The E bg estimated from the intercept of the tangents to the plots were 3.12, 3.07 and 3.04 eV for TiO 2 , 10 wt. MMT/TiO 2 and 20 wt. MMT/TiO 2 respectively.It is obvious that there is a decrease in the band gap energy compared to TiO 2 .In addition, there was blue band shift compared to TiO 2 .The absorption band gaps were shifted to shorter wavelengths, as the average particle size of TiO 2 -MMT was smaller than TiO 2 .The layered MMT structure suppressed the growth of TiO 2 , and affected the microstructure of TiO 2 and reduced the particle size. To understand the effect of modifier/sensitizers on the recombination of free electron-holes pairs, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were examined.In general, PL emission spectra can be used to envisage the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer of charges and to understand the destiny of electron-hole pairs in semiconductor materials.Fig. 9 reveals the PL spectra of bare TiO 2 , and MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposite calcined at 500 C and excited at 350 nm.MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibited PL signal with similar curve shape, demonstrating MMT did not result into new PL phenomenon.The TiO 2 nanoparticles exhibits a wide and strong PL signal in the range of 450-500 nm with the excited wavelength of 350 nm.The lower PL intensity infers lower recombination rate of photogenerated electron and holes pairs.The reduced recombination rate with addition of MMT into TiO 2 is attributed to reduced TiO 2 particle size in highly dispersed TiO 2 -MMT heterojunction.In addition, the presence of transition metal cations in MMT could also participate in trapping the electrons, resulting in reduced PL intensity 30.A significant reduction in PL intensity was observed with increasing MMT loading into the TiO 2 structure.This confirmed addition of MMT into TiO 2 efficiently stunted the photogenerated charges (electrons-holes) recombination that occurred at TiO 2 surface. Prior to CO 2 photoreduction experiments, a series of preliminary tests were conducted in the absence of CO 2 and H 2 O under UV irradiations for 4 h at 348 K for the following cases; (1) empty reactor and helium, (2) reactor with TiO 2 nanoparticles and helium and (3) MMT/TiO 2 photocatalysts and helium.In all cases, no reaction products were detected confirming no photodecomposition of organic residues in the catalyst, if any.Additional preliminary tests were conducted using H 2 O vapors and helium along with photocatalyst under UV irradiations.Again, in either case no carbon-containing compounds were present.These results confirmed photoreduction products were obtained from CO 2 source only.It reiterated that the photocatalytic reduction process require all three components i.e. catalyst, feed (CO 2 , H 2 O), light source and any carbon containing compound must be produced from CO 2 through photocatalytic reactions. Fig. 10 illustrates the effect of MMT loading on TiO 2 photocatalytic activity for transformation of CO 2 with H 2 O to CH 4 .By using pure TiO 2 , small amount of CH 4 was produced, while yield was improved by the dispersion of MMT into the TiO 2 structure.The higher yield rate is an evidence that photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 can be enhanced by increasing MMT loading up to an optimum loading of 20 wt..MMT loading beyond 20 wt. lowered the CO 2 photoreduction rate.The difference in the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 with various MMT loading mainly endorsed effective CO 2 adsorption and efficient charge production and separations over highly dispersed MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites.Furthermore, excessively high MMT loading may cause charge recombination centers and/or shield the TiO 2 surface from light absorption, both of which reduced the photocatalytic activity. In addition, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over pure MMT indicated MMT possessed the photocatalytic activity for the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapors, but its photocatalytic activity was lesser compared to TiO 2 and MMT/TiO 2 photocatalysts.Chen et al. 30 reported similar results during photocatalytic degradation of sulphorhodamine B under UV-Vis irradiations.MMT photoactivity may be due to the presence of various elements/defects at MMT layered structure and having higher capability of light absorption. Fig. 11 exhibits the relationship between CH 4 yield and H 2 O/CO 2 ratios in initial feed stream keeping all other parameters fixed.With the MMT loading of 20 wt. in TiO 2 , CH 4 yield increased with increasing H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio as the large concentration of H 2 O molecules adsorbed at the catalyst surface to react with CO 2 , resulting in high CO 2 photoreduction.Furthermore, CO 2 and H 2 O molecules were competitively activated by the charge transfer excited complexes and the values of H 2 O/CO 2 ratios influenced the selectivity for the formation of the desired products 39.The highest CH 4 yield was achieved at H 2 O/CO 2 ratio 0.35.Further increment in the feed ratios lowered the CO 2 photoreduction activity.This phenomenon was likely due to adsorption competition between CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on the active sites of MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites during photoreduction process.In presence of MMT, TiO 2 became super hydrophilic, when irradiated by UV light and H 2 O molecules would cover most of the catalyst surface.At high H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, CO 2 would have to compete with H 2 O for the active sites in order to react with adsorbed H 2 O. Thus, reducing H 2 O pressure or raising CO 2 pressure would increase CO 2 reduction rate.On the other hand, when H 2 O pressure was much lower than that of CO 2 , less H 2 O content would reduce the reaction rate.Therefore, an optimum H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio could enhance the CO 2 conversion efficiency.Similar findings have been reported in literature during photocatalytic CO 2 with H 2 O vapors using various TiO 2 based photocatalysts 40. The effect of reaction temperature on photocatalytic CO 2 reduction at 20 wt. MMT loading and H 2 O/CO 2 ratio 0.35 is shown in Fig. 12.It is obvious that CH 4 yield increased with reaction temperature.In general, higher temperature gave positive effects on photocatalytic reactions particularly in gas phase reactions and can accelerate the reaction rate.During photocatalysis process, simultaneous adsorption and desorption processes occurred at catalyst surface and rate of reaction depends on the efficiency of these processes.The increased in temperature increased desorption of reaction products from the catalyst surface and enhanced the chance of efficient collisions between the charge transfer excited state Ti 3 -O - species and reactant molecules 10.Moreover, in heterogeneous photocatalysis, reaction rates are usually determined by applying the principal of law of mass action in terms of surface concentrations.During desorption process at elevated temperature, diffusion of CO 2 toward catalyst surface could be increased to occupy vacant sites, thus probability of adsorption increases, resulting in higher reaction rates 41.Furthermore, the significant increase in reaction rate by increasing temperature indicated that activation energy decreased during course of reaction.Saladin and Alxneit 42 investigated the effect of temperature on photochemical reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O in gas phase over TiO 2 and reported similar trends. The effects of irradiation time on photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using MMT modified TiO 2 photocatalysts were investigated for the duration of 0-24 h as depicted in Figs. 13 and14.From the GC analysis, six products namely methane (CH 4 ), carbon monoxide (CO), ethane (C 2 H 6 ), ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propane (C 3 H 8 ), and propylene (C 3 H 6 ) were obtained.As shown in Fig. 13, CH 4 and CO were the main products and their yield rates increased gradually with reaction time.Significant amount of C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 6 and C 3 H 8 were also produced over MMT modified TiO 2 (Fig. 14).In addition, all products were produced continuously during the entire experiment in presence of MMT/TiO 2 and steady state was not achieved even after 24 h of irradiations.In case of TiO 2 , all the products were generated for the first 14 h (figure not shown here) before reaching steady-state condition.These results demonstrated MMT is a promising material for enhancing photoreduction efficiency as it provided more stability and reactivity to TiO 2 .Similar finding has been reported during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O over CdS-MMT photocatalyst 38. However, photo-oxidation products such as oxygen (O 2 ) were not detected in the gaseous product mixtures.O 2 was also not reported in previous studies during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 42.For this, several possibilities exist; nevertheless, it has also been reported that O 2 together with oxygen-containing compound such as CO could have been photo-adsorbed, blocking the active sites and hindering the diffusion of intermediates on the catalyst surface.Based on other related studies 43,44 which detected O 2 in the reaction products, it is likely that O 2 was also formed in this study but photoadsorption prevented it to be detected by MS column due to low concentration in gaseous product mixtures as similarly reported by other researchers 42. The average yield rates of CO 2 transformation products over TiO 2 and MMT modified TiO 2 photocatalysts are compared in Fig. 15.The presence of MMT plays an important role in efficient reduction of CO 2 to different paraffins and olefins.The total products significantly increased after MMT loading into TiO 2 .Over MMT modified TiO 2 , the largest yield of CH 4 was 441.5 mol g cat -1 h -1 ; 12 folds higher than pure TiO 2 .In addition, CO was the second largest product with yield rate of 103 mol g cat -1 h -1 .Significant amounts of C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons were also produced, which were not observed in bare TiO 2 .The photocatalytic performance of MMT modified TiO 2 was in the order of (mole per g of catalyst) CH 4 CO C 3 H 8 C 2 H 6 C 2 H 4 C 3 H 6 .Various sites of MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposites acted as oxidizing/reducing centers, providing electron to CO 2 as well as accepting electrons from H 2 O vapors in reaction mixture.Therefore, MMT served as electron traps to inhibit recombination of electron-holes pairs.On the other hand, surface hydroxyl (OH) groups over MMT/TiO 2 increased more CO 2 adsorption, which can enhance photocatalytic activity.In general, higher photoactivity of TiO 2 in the presence of MMT can be attributed to the followings: (1) The layered structure of silicate in MMT controls the crystal growth, resulting in smaller TiO 2 particle size.The TiO 2 with smaller particle sizes have higher photocatalytic activity due to more electrons being produced and are more mobile on TiO 2 surface.The smaller particle sizes also hindered recombination of electron-hole pairs.(2) The delaminated TiO 2 pillared montmorillonite has higher surface area because of its exfoliated structure.Due to this, there is possibility of higher CO 2 adsorption, efficient light harvesting/capturing and more photocatalytic reaction active sites, resulting in improved photo-efficiency.(3) In the galleries of MMT, there are possible d-orbits vacant cations that could trap electrons during TiO 2 photocatalysis, and possibly enhanced photocatalytic activity. During photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors under UV lightlight irradiations, CO, CH 4 and some higher hydrocarbons (attributed to paraffins and olefins) were detected.In these photocatalysis reactions, CO 2 reduced and H 2 O oxidized.In general, the first step in photocatalysis was the production of electrion-holes pairs when light striked on the TiO 2 surface.The electrons (e -) transferred from the TiO 2 conduction band for the photoreduction of CO 2 , yielding CO - 2 radicals.On the other hand, holes (h ) were transferred to H 2 O initiating its photooxidation, yielding hydrogen ions (H ) and hydroxyal radical ( OH) and further oxidized with OH radicals for the production of O 2 and H 44.The H radicals originated during reduction of proton reacted with carbon radicals on the catalyst surface to produce intermediates CO  During TiO 2 photocatalysis, large number of electrons would be produced due to highly dispersed nanosize TiO 2 particles over MMT layers.At the same time, electron transition of vacant d-orbits of metal ions on MMT supposedly trap charge particles (Eq.( 4)) resulting in more electron production and mobility over TiO 2 surface for CO 2 reduction. Since all of the above products were detected experimentally, CH 4 was confirmed to be produced from methyl radicals ( CH 3 ).These radicals were directly dependent on the formation of the intermediate product, CO.The production of higher CH 4 yield rate (Eq.( 8)) and other higher hydrocarbons (Eq.( 9)) also confirmed H 2 during water oxidation and carbon radicals during CO 2 reduction were produced excessively to support these reactions (Eqs.( 8) and ( 9)).Based on such observations, it could be assumed that large number of electron-hole pairs were produced over the surface of MMT modified TiO 2 , yielding CO as intermediate product, and finally C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons.Similar observations were reported by Saladin and Alxneit 42 during gas phase reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O over TiO 2 surface.Furthermore, higher hydrocarbons yield rates has confirmed that the reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 9) were more favorable over the MMT/TiO 2 surface.From the reaction summary and in view of the above observations, there is higher probability for producing hydrocarbons by improving the TiO 2 oxidation and reduction potentials.However, further investigations are required to understand the detailed reaction mechanism for predicting possible reaction products. The photocatalytic CO 2 transformation to CO and CH 4 over MMT modified TiO 2 could be further explained using energy band theory, which is based on the relative positions of conductance band, valance band and oxidation potentials.In general, photo-excited electrons can be consumed effectively, if the reduction potential of the reaction is lower than the conductance band potential of the semiconductor 45.The possible reactions that can occur during photocatalytic CO 2 with H 2 O to produce CO and CH 4 in terms of thermodynamic reduction potentials versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) can be described by reactions in Eqs. ( 10)-( 13) 464748. The conductance band potential of TiO 2 is E CB -0.50V at pH 7. CO was observed due to the reduction potential of E o (CO 2 /CO) -0.48V was lower than -0.5 V (conductane band of TiO 2 ).For CO 2 reduction to CH 4 , the lower reduction potential difference (E o (CO 2 /CH 4 ) -0.24V) also drove the reaction.Although the reduction potential of Eq. ( 10) is much lower than Eq. ( 12), eight electrons are required to produce CH 4 compared to only two for CO.Thus, significant yield rate of CO was also observed in the gaseous product mixtures. On the basis of XRD studies, TEM observations and reaction mechanism, a schematic reaction scheme is depicted in Fig. 16.During photocatalyitc CO 2 reduction, a series of reaction takes place to get valuable hydrocarbons, as portrayed in Fig. 16(a).Because of the efficient intercalation process, TiO 2 nanoparticles could penetrate and distribute over MMT layers and inside galleries to form delaminated TiO 2 pillared montmorillonite as portrayed in Fig. 16(b).Under light irraditions, there was efficient production and absoprtion of electrons over the MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites surface.Subsequently, electron transferred from the conductance band of TiO 2 , trapped by CO 2 molecules led to CO 2 reduction process.A series of reactions take place over delaminated TiO 2 pillared montmorillonite for possible higher yield rates of C 1 -C 3 paraffins and olefins.The higher CH 4 and significant C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons yield rates over MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites confirmed MMT as an efficient material for conversion of CO 2 to valuable C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons.More importantly, production of C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons have been reported for the first time over the MMT/TiO 2 photoctalyst."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "Chen et al. 30 reported similar results during photocatalytic degradation of sulphorhodamine B under UV-Vis irradiations.", "context": "Fig. 2 presents the XRD patterns of TiO 2 , MMT and MMT containing photocatalysts calcined at 500 C for 5 h.The peaks of TiO 2 revealed pure crystalline and anatase phase.With 10 wt. MMT loading into TiO 2 , pure anatase phase of TiO 2 was produced with wide diffraction peaks.In case of 20 wt. MMT loading, the diffraction peaks were more wider and weaker than those of photocatalysts prepared without MMT.The MMT XRD pattern showed basal (0 0 1) reflection around 2A 3.70 .However, MMT containing nanocomposites had dissimilar XRD patterns than the pure MMT.The eminent MMT peak at around 2A 3.70 , due to layer clays, has disappeared for all TiO 2 containing nanocomposites.This indicates that layered structures of MMT have been destroyed.Furthermore, MMT containing nanocomposites remained original reflections of anatase crystalline phase with no additional peak.However, diffraction peak around 2A 25.50 (1 0 1) of MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposites became weaker and wider and similar trends could be seen for all TiO 2 anatase peaks.These results suggested that layered structure of silicate in MMT has an effect on crystal lattice of MMT containing nanocomposites.This also reveals that addition of MMT in the system allowed the silicate layer of MMT to behave as barrier, which prevented the agglomeration and natural crystallization of TiO 2 sol. The average crystallite size of TiO 2 nanocomposites was calculated using Scherer's equation according to the (1 0 1) TiO 2 peak (Eq.( 1)) 31,32. where L is the thickness of crystallite (nm), k is a constant depending on crystallite shape (0.90 for this study), is the X-ray wavelength (nm), is full peak width at half max in radians and A is Bragg's angle of the 2A peak.The crystallite sizes of TiO 2 and 20 MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites were 18.7 and 13.87 nm respectively.The crystal size of TiO 2 decreased gradually with MMT loading (Table 1). The morphology and microscopic structure of 20 wt. MMT loading photocatalyst was investigated using SEM and FE-SEM as illustrated in Fig. 3(a-d).The SEM images of MMT plates in Fig. 3(a) were almost smooth and uniform in shape.Fig. 3(b) illustrates the FE-SEM images of TiO 2 nanoparticles dispersion on MMT plates.Fig. 3(c andd) exhibits higher magnified FE-SEM images of MMT modified TiO 2 photocatalyst.It is obvious that the MMT layers were destroyed, while TiO 2 nanoparticles were distributed over the entire surface of MMT plates. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) and highresolution electron microscopy (HR-TEM) of 20 wt. MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposite are depicted in Fig. 4(a-d The infrared (IR) spectra of TiO 2 and its composites are exhibited in Fig. 5.In the spectrum of pure anatase phase of TiO 2 , the stretching bend at 1615 cm -1 indicated chemisorbed H 2 O in TiO 2 is negligible.As shown in the IR spectrum of MMT, the broad band around 3630 cm -1 is attributed to Al 2 OH group of octahedral layer.The bands around 3460 cm -1 and 1630 cm -1 can be assigned to OH stretching and bending vibration of H 2 O molecules on the external layer.The peak at 1047 cm -1 corresponds to asymmetric vibration of SiO 2 tetrahedral in purified MMT.Several peaks between 1000 and 500 cm -1 are attributed to Al-IV tetrahedra 33.The IR spectrum of MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposites have obviously changed.The broad band around 3440 cm -1 and 1623 cm -1 corresponded to stretching vibration of OH group that are linked with titanium atoms (Ti OH) and to the bending vibration of H O H.These two bands are similar to bare TiO 2 photocatalyst.Furthermore, stretching band at about 1088 cm -1 and very weak stretching at around 550 cm -1 were observed due to asymmetric stretching vibration of SiO 2 tetrahedra 30,34. Adsorption isotherm, pore size distribution, and cumulative surface area of TiO 2 photocatalysts are depicted in Fig. 6.Fig. 6(a) exhibits the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of pure TiO 2 , and 20 wt. MMT/TiO 2 .The isotherms presents typical type IV curve of IUPAC with hysteresis loops, characteristics of mesoporous materials and associated with capillary condensation 35.The well-defined hysteresis loops with a steep desorption branches and less steep adsorption branches for all materials belongs to H1-type, indicating mesoporous structure of particles 36.The obvious formation of mesoporous TiO 2 samples without addition of surface directing agents is supposedly due to controlled hydrolysis process at normal temperature in presence of diluted acetic acid. The initial part of isotherms (at low P/Po) attributed to monolayer-multilayer adsorption on internal surface of materials.The steep increment at higher P/Po is due to capillary condensation within pores followed by saturation as the pores filled with liquid.The binding energy between adsorbate and surface for the first layer known as monolayer is taken as esoteric heat of adsorption.Binding energy of adsorption for all layers subsequent to monolayers can be referred as molar heat of condensation.The monolayer-multilayer is more dominant in TiO 2 in which capillary action started at P/Po 0.60 and 0.55, respectively.However, capillary and condensation action was more prominent in TiO 2 /MMT composite and is eminent at P/Po of 0.45.were due to MMT loading.The silicate layer of MMT can behave as barrier, which prevented the agglomeration and natural crystallization of TiO 2 sol. The surface area, pore volume and pore size of all samples are summarized in Table 1.The surface area was 47.98 m 2 g -1 and 82.62 m 2 g -1 for bare TiO 2 nanoparticles and 20 wt. MMT loading, respectively.The significant increase in TiO 2 surface area was due to highly dispersed TiO 2 over MMT layered structure and reduced TiO 2 nanoparticle size.The pore size of TiO 2 decreased from 10.12 nm to 7.05 nm with MMT loading due to the strong influence of MMT on crystal growth, resulting in smaller particle size.Similar trends were observed for BJH total pore volumes. The UV-vis absorbance spectra of all the photocatalysts and bare MMT are depicted in Fig. 7.The absorption spectrum of TiO 2 nanoparticles appeared around 398 nm, which has red shift compared with intrinsic anatase TiO 2 (energy gap is 3.20 eV).The absorption band edges of MMT modified TiO 2 samples were located at 404 and 408 nm for TiO 2 , 10 MMT and 20 MMT into TiO 2 , respectively.The light absorption of purified MMT increased to become almost transparent in the wavelength longer than 250 nm.However, in literatures, the absorption band edge for purified MMT (Na-MMT clay) was reported to be transparent in the wavelength range longer than 300 nm 30.The discrepancy in the results could be because of different types of MMT clays (Ammonium MMT clay in this study).Similar trends for light absorption are reported in literature over MMT K10 37. The absorbance spectra were used to calculate the band gap energy (eV) using Tauc equation shown in Eq. ( 2) 38. where , v, E g and A are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, band gap energy and a constant, respectively.The power 'n' characterizes the electronic transition during absorption process.The 'n' value is determined by the type of optical transition of a semiconductor especially having values 1/2, 3/2, 2, and 3 for direct allowed, direct forbidden, indirect allowed and indirect forbidden transitions, respectively.Furthermore, the most common method for the calculation of band gap energy (E bg ) involves plotting ( hv) n/2 vs. (hv).The E bg values for all samples were calculated from a plot of ( hv) 2 versus (hv) using direct method as shown in Fig. 8.The E bg estimated from the intercept of the tangents to the plots were 3.12, 3.07 and 3.04 eV for TiO 2 , 10 wt. MMT/TiO 2 and 20 wt. MMT/TiO 2 respectively.It is obvious that there is a decrease in the band gap energy compared to TiO 2 .In addition, there was blue band shift compared to TiO 2 .The absorption band gaps were shifted to shorter wavelengths, as the average particle size of TiO 2 -MMT was smaller than TiO 2 .The layered MMT structure suppressed the growth of TiO 2 , and affected the microstructure of TiO 2 and reduced the particle size. To understand the effect of modifier/sensitizers on the recombination of free electron-holes pairs, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were examined.In general, PL emission spectra can be used to envisage the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer of charges and to understand the destiny of electron-hole pairs in semiconductor materials.Fig. 9 reveals the PL spectra of bare TiO 2 , and MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposite calcined at 500 C and excited at 350 nm.MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibited PL signal with similar curve shape, demonstrating MMT did not result into new PL phenomenon.The TiO 2 nanoparticles exhibits a wide and strong PL signal in the range of 450-500 nm with the excited wavelength of 350 nm.The lower PL intensity infers lower recombination rate of photogenerated electron and holes pairs.The reduced recombination rate with addition of MMT into TiO 2 is attributed to reduced TiO 2 particle size in highly dispersed TiO 2 -MMT heterojunction.In addition, the presence of transition metal cations in MMT could also participate in trapping the electrons, resulting in reduced PL intensity 30.A significant reduction in PL intensity was observed with increasing MMT loading into the TiO 2 structure.This confirmed addition of MMT into TiO 2 efficiently stunted the photogenerated charges (electrons-holes) recombination that occurred at TiO 2 surface. Prior to CO 2 photoreduction experiments, a series of preliminary tests were conducted in the absence of CO 2 and H 2 O under UV irradiations for 4 h at 348 K for the following cases; (1) empty reactor and helium, (2) reactor with TiO 2 nanoparticles and helium and (3) MMT/TiO 2 photocatalysts and helium.In all cases, no reaction products were detected confirming no photodecomposition of organic residues in the catalyst, if any.Additional preliminary tests were conducted using H 2 O vapors and helium along with photocatalyst under UV irradiations.Again, in either case no carbon-containing compounds were present.These results confirmed photoreduction products were obtained from CO 2 source only.It reiterated that the photocatalytic reduction process require all three components i.e. catalyst, feed (CO 2 , H 2 O), light source and any carbon containing compound must be produced from CO 2 through photocatalytic reactions. Fig. 10 illustrates the effect of MMT loading on TiO 2 photocatalytic activity for transformation of CO 2 with H 2 O to CH 4 .By using pure TiO 2 , small amount of CH 4 was produced, while yield was improved by the dispersion of MMT into the TiO 2 structure.The higher yield rate is an evidence that photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 can be enhanced by increasing MMT loading up to an optimum loading of 20 wt..MMT loading beyond 20 wt. lowered the CO 2 photoreduction rate.The difference in the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 with various MMT loading mainly endorsed effective CO 2 adsorption and efficient charge production and separations over highly dispersed MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites.Furthermore, excessively high MMT loading may cause charge recombination centers and/or shield the TiO 2 surface from light absorption, both of which reduced the photocatalytic activity. In addition, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over pure MMT indicated MMT possessed the photocatalytic activity for the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapors, but its photocatalytic activity was lesser compared to TiO 2 and MMT/TiO 2 photocatalysts.Chen et al. 30 reported similar results during photocatalytic degradation of sulphorhodamine B under UV-Vis irradiations.MMT photoactivity may be due to the presence of various elements/defects at MMT layered structure and having higher capability of light absorption. Fig. 11 exhibits the relationship between CH 4 yield and H 2 O/CO 2 ratios in initial feed stream keeping all other parameters fixed.With the MMT loading of 20 wt. in TiO 2 , CH 4 yield increased with increasing H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio as the large concentration of H 2 O molecules adsorbed at the catalyst surface to react with CO 2 , resulting in high CO 2 photoreduction.Furthermore, CO 2 and H 2 O molecules were competitively activated by the charge transfer excited complexes and the values of H 2 O/CO 2 ratios influenced the selectivity for the formation of the desired products 39.The highest CH 4 yield was achieved at H 2 O/CO 2 ratio 0.35.Further increment in the feed ratios lowered the CO 2 photoreduction activity.This phenomenon was likely due to adsorption competition between CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on the active sites of MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites during photoreduction process.In presence of MMT, TiO 2 became super hydrophilic, when irradiated by UV light and H 2 O molecules would cover most of the catalyst surface.At high H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, CO 2 would have to compete with H 2 O for the active sites in order to react with adsorbed H 2 O. Thus, reducing H 2 O pressure or raising CO 2 pressure would increase CO 2 reduction rate.On the other hand, when H 2 O pressure was much lower than that of CO 2 , less H 2 O content would reduce the reaction rate.Therefore, an optimum H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio could enhance the CO 2 conversion efficiency.Similar findings have been reported in literature during photocatalytic CO 2 with H 2 O vapors using various TiO 2 based photocatalysts 40. The effect of reaction temperature on photocatalytic CO 2 reduction at 20 wt. MMT loading and H 2 O/CO 2 ratio 0.35 is shown in Fig. 12.It is obvious that CH 4 yield increased with reaction temperature.In general, higher temperature gave positive effects on photocatalytic reactions particularly in gas phase reactions and can accelerate the reaction rate.During photocatalysis process, simultaneous adsorption and desorption processes occurred at catalyst surface and rate of reaction depends on the efficiency of these processes.The increased in temperature increased desorption of reaction products from the catalyst surface and enhanced the chance of efficient collisions between the charge transfer excited state Ti 3 -O - species and reactant molecules 10.Moreover, in heterogeneous photocatalysis, reaction rates are usually determined by applying the principal of law of mass action in terms of surface concentrations.During desorption process at elevated temperature, diffusion of CO 2 toward catalyst surface could be increased to occupy vacant sites, thus probability of adsorption increases, resulting in higher reaction rates 41.Furthermore, the significant increase in reaction rate by increasing temperature indicated that activation energy decreased during course of reaction.Saladin and Alxneit 42 investigated the effect of temperature on photochemical reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O in gas phase over TiO 2 and reported similar trends. The effects of irradiation time on photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using MMT modified TiO 2 photocatalysts were investigated for the duration of 0-24 h as depicted in Figs. 13 and14.From the GC analysis, six products namely methane (CH 4 ), carbon monoxide (CO), ethane (C 2 H 6 ), ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propane (C 3 H 8 ), and propylene (C 3 H 6 ) were obtained.As shown in Fig. 13, CH 4 and CO were the main products and their yield rates increased gradually with reaction time.Significant amount of C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 6 and C 3 H 8 were also produced over MMT modified TiO 2 (Fig. 14).In addition, all products were produced continuously during the entire experiment in presence of MMT/TiO 2 and steady state was not achieved even after 24 h of irradiations.In case of TiO 2 , all the products were generated for the first 14 h (figure not shown here) before reaching steady-state condition.These results demonstrated MMT is a promising material for enhancing photoreduction efficiency as it provided more stability and reactivity to TiO 2 .Similar finding has been reported during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O over CdS-MMT photocatalyst 38. However, photo-oxidation products such as oxygen (O 2 ) were not detected in the gaseous product mixtures.O 2 was also not reported in previous studies during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 42.For this, several possibilities exist; nevertheless, it has also been reported that O 2 together with oxygen-containing compound such as CO could have been photo-adsorbed, blocking the active sites and hindering the diffusion of intermediates on the catalyst surface.Based on other related studies 43,44 which detected O 2 in the reaction products, it is likely that O 2 was also formed in this study but photoadsorption prevented it to be detected by MS column due to low concentration in gaseous product mixtures as similarly reported by other researchers 42. The average yield rates of CO 2 transformation products over TiO 2 and MMT modified TiO 2 photocatalysts are compared in Fig. 15.The presence of MMT plays an important role in efficient reduction of CO 2 to different paraffins and olefins.The total products significantly increased after MMT loading into TiO 2 .Over MMT modified TiO 2 , the largest yield of CH 4 was 441.5 mol g cat -1 h -1 ; 12 folds higher than pure TiO 2 .In addition, CO was the second largest product with yield rate of 103 mol g cat -1 h -1 .Significant amounts of C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons were also produced, which were not observed in bare TiO 2 .The photocatalytic performance of MMT modified TiO 2 was in the order of (mole per g of catalyst) CH 4 CO C 3 H 8 C 2 H 6 C 2 H 4 C 3 H 6 .Various sites of MMT modified TiO 2 nanocomposites acted as oxidizing/reducing centers, providing electron to CO 2 as well as accepting electrons from H 2 O vapors in reaction mixture.Therefore, MMT served as electron traps to inhibit recombination of electron-holes pairs.On the other hand, surface hydroxyl (OH) groups over MMT/TiO 2 increased more CO 2 adsorption, which can enhance photocatalytic activity.In general, higher photoactivity of TiO 2 in the presence of MMT can be attributed to the followings: (1) The layered structure of silicate in MMT controls the crystal growth, resulting in smaller TiO 2 particle size.The TiO 2 with smaller particle sizes have higher photocatalytic activity due to more electrons being produced and are more mobile on TiO 2 surface.The smaller particle sizes also hindered recombination of electron-hole pairs.(2) The delaminated TiO 2 pillared montmorillonite has higher surface area because of its exfoliated structure.Due to this, there is possibility of higher CO 2 adsorption, efficient light harvesting/capturing and more photocatalytic reaction active sites, resulting in improved photo-efficiency.(3) In the galleries of MMT, there are possible d-orbits vacant cations that could trap electrons during TiO 2 photocatalysis, and possibly enhanced photocatalytic activity. During photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors under UV lightlight irradiations, CO, CH 4 and some higher hydrocarbons (attributed to paraffins and olefins) were detected.In these photocatalysis reactions, CO 2 reduced and H 2 O oxidized.In general, the first step in photocatalysis was the production of electrion-holes pairs when light striked on the TiO 2 surface.The electrons (e -) transferred from the TiO 2 conduction band for the photoreduction of CO 2 , yielding CO - 2 radicals.On the other hand, holes (h ) were transferred to H 2 O initiating its photooxidation, yielding hydrogen ions (H ) and hydroxyal radical ( OH) and further oxidized with OH radicals for the production of O 2 and H 44.The H radicals originated during reduction of proton reacted with carbon radicals on the catalyst surface to produce intermediates CO  During TiO 2 photocatalysis, large number of electrons would be produced due to highly dispersed nanosize TiO 2 particles over MMT layers.At the same time, electron transition of vacant d-orbits of metal ions on MMT supposedly trap charge particles (Eq.( 4)) resulting in more electron production and mobility over TiO 2 surface for CO 2 reduction. Since all of the above products were detected experimentally, CH 4 was confirmed to be produced from methyl radicals ( CH 3 ).These radicals were directly dependent on the formation of the intermediate product, CO.The production of higher CH 4 yield rate (Eq.( 8)) and other higher hydrocarbons (Eq.( 9)) also confirmed H 2 during water oxidation and carbon radicals during CO 2 reduction were produced excessively to support these reactions (Eqs.( 8) and ( 9)).Based on such observations, it could be assumed that large number of electron-hole pairs were produced over the surface of MMT modified TiO 2 , yielding CO as intermediate product, and finally C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons.Similar observations were reported by Saladin and Alxneit 42 during gas phase reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O over TiO 2 surface.Furthermore, higher hydrocarbons yield rates has confirmed that the reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 9) were more favorable over the MMT/TiO 2 surface.From the reaction summary and in view of the above observations, there is higher probability for producing hydrocarbons by improving the TiO 2 oxidation and reduction potentials.However, further investigations are required to understand the detailed reaction mechanism for predicting possible reaction products. The photocatalytic CO 2 transformation to CO and CH 4 over MMT modified TiO 2 could be further explained using energy band theory, which is based on the relative positions of conductance band, valance band and oxidation potentials.In general, photo-excited electrons can be consumed effectively, if the reduction potential of the reaction is lower than the conductance band potential of the semiconductor 45.The possible reactions that can occur during photocatalytic CO 2 with H 2 O to produce CO and CH 4 in terms of thermodynamic reduction potentials versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) can be described by reactions in Eqs. ( 10)-( 13) 464748. The conductance band potential of TiO 2 is E CB -0.50V at pH 7. CO was observed due to the reduction potential of E o (CO 2 /CO) -0.48V was lower than -0.5 V (conductane band of TiO 2 ).For CO 2 reduction to CH 4 , the lower reduction potential difference (E o (CO 2 /CH 4 ) -0.24V) also drove the reaction.Although the reduction potential of Eq. ( 10) is much lower than Eq. ( 12), eight electrons are required to produce CH 4 compared to only two for CO.Thus, significant yield rate of CO was also observed in the gaseous product mixtures. On the basis of XRD studies, TEM observations and reaction mechanism, a schematic reaction scheme is depicted in Fig. 16.During photocatalyitc CO 2 reduction, a series of reaction takes place to get valuable hydrocarbons, as portrayed in Fig. 16(a).Because of the efficient intercalation process, TiO 2 nanoparticles could penetrate and distribute over MMT layers and inside galleries to form delaminated TiO 2 pillared montmorillonite as portrayed in Fig. 16(b).Under light irraditions, there was efficient production and absoprtion of electrons over the MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites surface.Subsequently, electron transferred from the conductance band of TiO 2 , trapped by CO 2 molecules led to CO 2 reduction process.A series of reactions take place over delaminated TiO 2 pillared montmorillonite for possible higher yield rates of C 1 -C 3 paraffins and olefins.The higher CH 4 and significant C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons yield rates over MMT/TiO 2 nanocomposites confirmed MMT as an efficient material for conversion of CO 2 to valuable C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons.More importantly, production of C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons have been reported for the first time over the MMT/TiO 2 photoctalyst."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Significant enhancement of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O to CO and C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons was observed over MMT modified TiO 2 compared to bare TiO 2 under UV irradiations.", "context": "MMT modified TiO 2 photocatalysts were synthesized by sol-gel single step method and for the first time were tested for the activity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O.When MMT dispersed into TiO 2 solution, the silicate layer of MMT behaved as a barrier to prevent agglomeration formation.The layered MMT structure was destroyed during intercalation process and formed delaminated TiO 2 pillared montmorillonite.The average particle size of MMT modified TiO 2 was smaller than the bare TiO 2 nanoparticles.Therefore, loading MMT into TiO 2 structure increased surface area, reduced particle size and enabled efficient charge separation.Significant enhancement of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O to CO and C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons was observed over MMT modified TiO 2 compared to bare TiO 2 under UV irradiations.The effects of MMT loading, H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratios and reaction temperature was also investigated to maximize conversion efficiency.An optimum H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio 0.35 gave the highest yield for CH 4 .The temperature also improved the photoactivity by enhancing CO 2 adsorption rate and accelerating photogenerated species.The highest yield rates of CH 4 and CO as main products were 441.5 and 103 mol g cat -1 h -1 , respectively.The mechanism of CO 2 photoconversion with H 2 O to CH 4 and CO can be explained by energy band theory.MMT seems a promising material to improve the effectiveness and feasibility of TiO 2 as a photocatalyst for CO 2 photoreduction for carbon management applications.

Subsequently, MMT dissolved in isopropanol was added drop by drop into the titanium sol.The process of gelation was continued by stirring the mixture at 30 C for another 6 h until thick sol was formed.After aging, the slurry was dried in the oven at 80 C for 24 h under airflow.Finally, the samples were calcined in a muffle furnace at a rate of 5 C/min up to 500 C and held at this temperature for 5 h.To synthesize TiO 2 with various concentration of MMT loading, the same procedure was repeated with different MMT loading as per requirements.For comparison, pure TiO 2 nanoparticles were also prepared by applying the same procedure. In order to determine the structure and crystalinity of the photocatalysts, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on Bruker D8 advance diffractometer (Cu-K radiation, wavelength 1.54 A, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA).The scanning rate was 1.2 min -1 from 1.5 to 80 .The crystal size was calculated using Scherrer's equation.The surface morphology was examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) with Carl Zeiss Supra 35 VP FE-SEM instrument.The crystallite shape and dispersion of TiO 2 at MMT galleries were observed using TEM and HR-TEM with FEI-Tecni G2 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) at EFGO Scientific located at Kulim Hi Tech, Kedah, Malaysia.The infrared spectra were measured at room temperature in the range of 4000-400 cm -1 with Spectrum 2000 Explorer Fourier Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) Spectrometer.The nanocomposite powders were dispersed in KBr (90 wt. of all samples).Textural characterizations of the samples were carried out with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption properties were examined at 77 K.The samples were pre-dried with preliminary heat at 90 C (1 C/min) for 1 h to remove moisture and then degassed at 350 C (10 C/min) for 8 h prior to measurements.The specific surface area (S BET ) of monolayer coverage was determined using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.The pore size distribution was obtained from the adsorption branch of the isotherm by means of Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples were measured with UV-3101PC spectrophotometer.The recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs was measured by photoluminescence (PL) spectra employing PerkinElmer LS 55 Luminescence Spectrometer. The schematic photocatalytic reaction system for reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, illustrated in Fig. 1, consisted of stainless steel chamber having length of 9.5 cm, width of 3.75 cm and total volume of 106 cm 3 .The reactor was equipped with a quartz window for the passing of light irradiations.The light source used to activate the photocatalytic reactions was a 500 W mercury lamp for UV irradiations source, having maximum irradiations intensity at 365 nm.The lamp was equipped with water jacket to remove infrared light and heat.The light intensity was measured using online optical process monitor ILT OPM-1D and SED008/W sensor.The reactor was covered with aluminum foil to ensure all the light participated in reactions were from the quartz window only.About 50 mg of powdered photocatalyst was distributed uniformly inside at the bottom of the reactor.The reactor was purged using helium (He) flow and checked for leakage at 2 bar pressure for several hours.Compressed CO 2 (99.999) regulated by mass flow controller (MFC) was bubbled through water bubbler saturator to carry moisture.The concentration of CO 2 was controlled using helium as diluting gas (99.999).The reactor was purged for an hour using mixtures of CO 2 and helium prior to the start of experiment.The pressure of CO 2 and He (helium) gas mixtures up to 0.20 bars above atmospheric pressure and CO 2 concentration of 20 were maintained throughout the study. The products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890 N, USA) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionized detector FID (GC/FID/TCD).The gaseous products from the reactor were also taken using gastight syringe (Agilent, 1000 l) at regular intervals for offline analysis using the same volume as that of online.Furthermore, FID detector was connected with HP PLOT Q capillary column for separation of C 1 -C 6 hydrocarbons, alcohols and oxygenated compound while TCD detector consisted of Porapak Q, DC-200, and MS column for separation of C 1 -C 6 paraffins and olefins hydrocarbons, CO 2 , H 2 , O 2 , N 2 and CO."}], "reaction medium": [], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
