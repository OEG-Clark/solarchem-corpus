In contrast, due to the weak interlayer force and large interlayer space of talc, the introduction of g-C 3 N 4 did not influence the microstructures or SSA of talc.All the obtained composites demonstrate improved photocatalytic performance compared with g-C 3 N 4 .The enhanced photocatalytic activities of the sepiolite and talc-based composites can be ascribed to the better distribution of g-C 3 N 4 considering they have similar SSAs to g-C 3 N 4 (11.2 m 2 g -1 ).The kaolinite/g-C 3 N 4 composite exhibited the highest CO evolution rate of 3.03 mol g -1 h -1 and H 2 evolution rate of 385 mol g -1 h -1 , which were 3.3 and 4 times higher than those of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.The superior performance of kaolinite/g-C 3 N 4 can be ascribed to the large SSA and better distribution of g-C 3 N 4 in the composite, which enhanced light absorption, increased the number of active sites, and facilitated the charge transfer.By utilizing industrialized clay minerals as carriers, the present work demonstrates a facile and scale-up strategy to prepare a g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with large SSA and efficient photocatalytic activity.The distinctive coupling manners between g-C 3 N 4 and clay minerals as elucidated in this work also provide essential information for the utilization of clay minerals as catalyst carriers.

In the later characterizations, the samples of CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 are chosen as representative composites because they exhibit the best performance based on later photocatalytic measurements. The FT-IR spectroscopy was adopted to further analyze the functional groups in samples.The FT-IR spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , AK, AS, AT, CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 are shown in Fig. 1b, d, andf.For g-C 3 N 4 , the peak at 807 cm -1 corresponds to the characteristic breathing vibration of triazine units (Han et al., 2015;Liang et al., 2015).Moreover, the peaks at 1243,1325,1411,1459,1528, and 1639 cm -1 can be ascribed to the aromatic C-N and CN stretching vibrations, which match previous reports very well (Han et al., 2016;Liang et al., 2015). For the AK in Fig. 1b, the bands at 811 and 1095 cm -1 confirm the existence of Si-O and the peaks at 568 and 740 cm -1 correspond to the deformation of Si-O-Al in the AK (Wang et al., 2018).For the AS in Fig. 1d, the peaks at 3666 and 664 cm -1 can be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups (Mg 3 OH) within the Mg-O octahedron (Zhang et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2011).The peaks at 3419 and 1666 cm -1 can be assigned to the stretching vibrations of O-H and N-H bonds (Sun et al., 2013).The bands at 1026 and 792 cm -1 are associated with the stretching vibrations of Si-O bonds while the peak at 470 cm -1 can be ascribed to the bending vibration of Si-O bonds in the AS (Zhang et al., 2011).For the AT in Fig. 1f, the bands at 3674 and 1650 cm -1 are from the O-H stretching vibration and H-O-H bending vibration.The intense bands at 1020 and 784 cm -1 can be associated with the interplanar stretching of Si-O bonds which confirm the presence of a threedimensional amorphous silica phase.The intense bands at 528 and 669 cm -1 are from the Si-O-Mg bending and stretching vibrations (Prado et al., 2015).Notably, for the FT-IR spectra of CNK600, CNS500 and CNT500 composites, the top curves in Fig. 1b, d andf present a collective pattern of g-C 3 N 4 and corresponding acid-treated clay minerals, but the intensities of the main characteristic FT-IR peaks become weaker in the composites.The FT-IR spectra suggest that the obtained composites consist of g-C 3 N 4 and corresponding acid-treated clay minerals which effectively bind together with their main functional groups preserved.SEM images of the samples were taken to detect the morphology and structure details.As displayed in Fig. 2a, the g-C 3 N 4 exhibits a typical loose aggregated sheet-like structure, which is attributed to the thermal polymerization of melamine (Li et al., 2019).Fig. 2b clearly reveals that the AK has a two-dimensional layered structure, and the surface is relatively smooth.For the CNK600 in Fig. 2c, the AK layers are densely and evenly decorated with g-C 3 N 4 .Compared with bare AK and bare g-C 3 N 4 , the AK phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase in CNK600 both become much rougher.It is reported that kaolinite can be intercalated by a few chemicals, such as alkali acetates (Smith et al., 1966), formamide (Frost et al., 2001), dimethyl-sulphoxide (Abou-El-Sherbini et al., 2017), and hydrazine (Ledoux and White, 1966).Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that the AK and melamine may proceed with intercalation reactions.Upon polymerization of melamine by calcination, the in situ growth of g-C 3 N 4 within kaolinite would expand the stack of kaolinite layers.The deduction would be further supported by BET measurements which will be discussed later.Fig. 2d is the image of bare AS, suggesting the fibrous structure with long fibers (0.2-2.4 m of length and 0.2 m of diameter) and cross-linked fiber bundles.For the CNS500 in Fig. 2e, the fibrous structure of AS phase almost disappears due to the severe agglomeration caused by the high-temperature calcination.Moreover, the g-C 3 N 4 phase in CNS500 has a substantially reduced size compared with bare g-C 3 N 4 , indicating that the introduction of AS can effectively improve the distribution of g-C 3 N 4 which may ameliorate its photocatalysis.As shown in Fig. 2f, the AT exhibits a smooth lamella structure, and the widths of most lamellae are between 250 nm and 1 m with very large interlayer space because the AT lamellae are linked by week van der Waals force (Claverie et al., 2018).For the CNT500 in Fig. 2g, the AT phase preserves the lamella structure and the guest g-C 3 N 4 is randomly distributed on the surface of AT lamellae.Therefore, the introduction of g-C 3 N 4 does not influence the individual microstructure of AT or g-C 3 N 4 phase. The EDS results of CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 are shown in Tables 123, and Fig. S1, which clearly confirm the existence of g-C 3 N 4 and corresponding clay minerals in the as-prepared composites.The interior structures of CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 were further studied through TEM.As displayed in Fig. S2, the g-C 3 N 4 phase is closely attached with the clay phase (AK, AS, or AT) to construct a binary heterogeneous structure, which is in line with the observations of SEM. In a short summary, we firstly disclose that the AK, AS, and AT exhibit three different manners to couple with g-C 3 N 4 .For CNK600, the AK and melamine precursors may proceed with intercalation reactions, and the in situ growth of g-C 3 N 4 would expand the kaolinite layers.For CNS500, the fibrous structure of AS phase suffers from severe agglomeration and mostly perishes but the g-C 3 N 4 phase has a shrunk size and better distribution.For CNT500, the individual microstructure of AT or g-C 3 N 4 phase is not influenced by the introduction of g-C 3 N 4 . XPS was employed to analyze the surface chemical compositions and chemical states of CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 (Fig. 3).As shown in Fig. S3, the C, N, O, Si, and Mg are observed in CNS500 and CNT500, but the C, N, O, Si, and Al are observed in CNK600.The high-resolution C 1 s spectrum of CNS500 (Fig. 3a) can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 288.25, 287.82, and 284.52 eV.The peak at 288.25 eV is associated with the sp 2 hybridized carbon (N-CN), while the peaks at 287.82 and 284.52 eV represent the C-C bonding and surface adventitious carbon (sp 3 C-C), respectively (Shu et al., 2018).The C 1 s spectra of CNT500 and CNK600 are very similar to that of CNS500.It should be noted that the C 1 s spectra of the prepared composites are consistent with the C 1 s spectra of bare g-C 3 N 4 in previous reports (Hu et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2018).The N 1 s spectra of the composites in Fig. 3b can be deconvoluted into four peaks at around 404.00, 401.00, 399.60, and 398.60 eV. The main peaks at around 404.30, 401.00, 399.60, and 398.60 eV regions can be ascribed to the -excitation, the C-N-H groups, the N-(C 3 ) groups, and the CN-C units, respectively (Huang et al., 2017).Similar to the C 1 s spectra, the N 1 s spectra of the composites show a negligible difference from the N 1 s spectra of bare g-C 3 N 4 in previous reports (Shen et al., 2018;Zhu et al., 2015).The C 1 s and N 1 s spectra of the composites suggest that the g-C 3 N 4 phase in the composites possesses the same chemical environments as bare g-C 3 N 4 .For the clay mineral phases, the O 1 s, Si 2p, Mg 1 s, and Al 2p were further studied as shown in Fig. 3c, d, e, andf.The O 1 s spectra in Fig. 3c contain three different peaks fitted at the binding energies of around 531.60, 532.40, and 533.20 eV, which should be related to the surface -OH groups, adsorbed water, and Si-O-Si, respectively.For the high-resolution spectra of Si 2p in Fig. 3d, the peaks at 103.08 eV of CNS500, 103.80 eV of CNT500, and 103.07 eV of CNK600 can be ascribed to the Si-O bonding (Hu et al., 2020;Ullah et al., 2014).As shown in Fig. 3e, the peaks of Mg 1 s at 1303.99 eV for CNS500, and 1304.75 eV for CNT500 are assigned to the Mg-O bonding.The peak of Al 2p at 74.65 eV for CNK600 in Fig. 3f corresponds to the Al-O bonding.Notably, the XPS spectra of O 1 s, Si 2p, Mg 1 s, and Al 2p in the composites are very similar to the corresponding spectra in bare AK, AS, or AT as previous reports (Li et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2018). Conclusively, the XPS results reveal that the prepared composites contain the g-C 3 N 4 phase and corresponding clay mineral phases, which preserve the surface chemical environments as bare g-C 3 N 4 and clay minerals.It also implies that the current synthetic strategy would not influence the surface chemical environments of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and clay mineral carriers. The results of N 2 adsorption-desorption measurements and pore structures for g-C 3 N 4 , AK, CNK600, AS, CNS500, AT, and CNT500 are shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 4.The samples exhibit typical IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops, indicating the presence of mesoporous structures (Shu et al., 2018).As for the prepared composites, the mesopores come from the inter-particle spaces among the aggregates of the acid-treated clay minerals and g-C 3 N 4 .The specific surface areas (denoted as SSA) of CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 are 61.9, 16.7, and The content of elements in CNK600 powders by EDS analysis.(CNK600: AK/g-C 3 N 4 , 600 mg of AK used in synthesis).18.0 m 2 g -1 , respectively, which are all higher than 11.2 m 2 g -1 of bare g-C 3 N 4 as shown in Table 4.It indicates that the current work, especially the CNK600, demonstrates a facile and scale-up strategy to synthesize the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with large SSA.Interestingly, the SSAs of the three composites present totally different changes compared with corresponding acid-treated clay minerals.The SSA of CNK600 (61.9 m 2 g -1 ) is more than three times larger than that of bare AK (17.9 m 2 g -1 ) while the SSA of CNS500 (16.7 m 2 g -1 ) is much smaller than that of bare AS (311.2 m 2 g -1 ).The SSA of CNT500 (18.0 m 2 g -1 ) shows negligible change compared with that of AT (14.0 m 2 g -1 ).The SSA changes can be well explained by the three different coupling manners of the three composites.The SSA of CNK600 significantly increases compared with that of bare AK because the AK and melamine precursors may proceed with intercalation reactions and the in situ growth of g-C 3 N 4 would expand the kaolinite layers, leading to rougher surfaces and a more loose stack of layers.In the opposite situation, the large SSA of bare AS is mainly attributed to its fibrous structure.But in CNS500, the fibrous structure of AS phase suffers from severe agglomeration, resulting in the remarkable decrease of SSA.The SSA of CNT500 shows subtle change compared with that of AT because the introduction of g-C 3 N 4 does not influence the microstructures of either AT or g-C 3 N 4 phase.Thus, the N 2 adsorption-desorption measurements further consolidate that the three clay minerals coupled with g-C 3 N 4 in three different manners to form the corresponding composites, which is well in line with the SEM results. The light absorption properties of the obtained photocatalysts were investigated by UV-Vis DRS (Fig. 5a).The CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 display higher light absorption ability than bare g-C 3 N 4 , cham et al., 2020a).In Fig. 5b, the Eg values of CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 are 2.70, 2.63, and 2.69 eV, respectively, which are all smaller than the Eg value of g-C 3 N 4 (2.72 eV).The enhanced light absorption ability and narrowed band gaps of CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 suggest that the composites can absorb more incident photons than bare g-C 3 N 4 , which would definitely favor photocatalysis. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was applied to evaluate the separation efficiency of photoexcited carriers.A high intensity of PL usually indicates a large radiative recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers (Li et al., 2019).When excited by photons of 325 nm in wavelength, an intense PL peak centered at 450 nm appears for bare g-C 3 N 4 .In contrast, the PL intensities of CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 all become much weaker (Fig. 6), indicating the favorable separation of photogenerated electrons and holes by the cooperation of acid-treated clay minerals and g-C 3 N 4 .The CNK600 exhibits the weakest PL intensity in Fig. 6, indicating the best charge separation among the three composites.The enhanced charge separation of the composites can be ascribed to the larger SSAs and better distributions of g-C 3 N 4 in the composites, which can accelerate the charge transfer and impede the recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes. The photocatalytic reduction ability of resultant composites was estimated by photocatalytic H 2 evolution from water splitting and CO 2 reduction.It should be noted that Pt was usually adopted as co-catalysts in the g-C 3 N 4 for H 2 evolution (Wang et al., 2009).But for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, Pt co-catalysts were not always applied to the g-C 3 N 4 due to the complex reaction kinetics (Bhosale et al., 2019;Ou et al., 2018).Therefore, for rational comparison with previous reports, we also used Pt as co-catalysts for H 2 evolution but not for CO 2 reduction.The optimal amount of acid-treated clay minerals in the composites was investigated from 400 to 700 mg.Based on the photocatalytic performance as shown in Fig. S4, S5, and S6, the CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 were determined to be the representative samples.Moreover, a series of control experiments were performed to verify that the reactions were a photocatalytic process and the product of CO was from the photocatalytic reduction of pumped CO 2 .It should be noted that, in a typical The BET surface area and particle size distribution data of g-C 3 N 4 , AK, CNK600, AS, CNS500, AT, and CNT500. Surface Area (m 2 g -1 ) Pore volume (m 3 g -1 ) Average pore size (nm) AK: acid-treated kaolinite.AS: acid-treated sepiolite.AT: acid-treated talc.CNK600: AK/g-C 3 N 4 , 600 mg of AK used in synthesis.CNS500: AS/g-C 3 N 4 , 500 mg of AS used in synthesis.CNT500: AT/g-C 3 N 4 , 500 mg of AT used in synthesis.photocatalytic reaction as described in the Supplementary Material, the main reduction product of CO 2 was CO and we did not collect other carbon-containing products. As shown in Fig. 7a andb, the CO evolution rates of g-C 3 N 4 , CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 are about 0.91, 3.03, 2.21, and 2.25 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.Fig. 7c andd display that the H 2 evolution rates of g-C 3 N 4 , CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 are about 96.4,385, 242, and 267 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively.The apparent quantum yields (AQY) of CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 are 0.690, 0.559, and 0.584 at 420 nm, respectively.The synthesized composites all exhibit much higher photocatalytic activities than g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution, indicating that the present work is an effective strategy to improve the photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .The larger SSAs and better distributions of g-C 3 N 4 for the composites may contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic performance.Specifically, the CNK600 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activities for CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution compared with CNT500 and CNS500.As discussed before, the CNK600 has the largest SSA with an intercalation structure and loose stacks of layers, which can enhance light absorption, increase the number of active sites, and favor the charge separation.The UV-Vis DRS and PL results also quadrate with the assertions.The CNS500 and CNT500 show similar photocatalytic activities, but much higher than g-C 3 N 4 .It is noted that the SSAs of g-C 3 N 4 , CNS500 and CNT500 are very close.However, the introduction of AS or AT can still bestow a better distribution on g-C 3 N 4 and therefore improve the light absorption and charge separation, which contributes to the enhanced photocatalytic performance. In addition, we summarized a few recent reports on g-C 3 N 4 based composite photocatalysts with Pt as co-catalysts for photocatalytic H 2 evolution in Table S1.The clay mineral/g-C 3 N 4 composites exhibit comparable photocatalytic activity to the listed g-C 3 N 4 composites.Moreover, the clay mineral/g-C 3 N 4 composites possess the advantages of low costs and facile synthesis. Additionally, photocatalytic stability is crucial for practical applications.As shown in Fig. S4c, Fig. S5c, and Fig. S6c, after three continuous cycling H 2 evolution tests for 12 h, all the synthesized composites exhibited a stable H 2 evolution rate without any deactivation.The XRD and FT-IR of the composites after photocatalytic tests were also performed, which did not show any change compared with that of freshly prepared composites.It implies that the composites possess high photocatalytic stability (Fig. S9). The photocatalytic oxidation ability of obtained composites was evaluated by two typical measurements, e.g., photocatalytic generation of OH radicals and PEC water oxidation by adopting the composites as photoanode materials.The photoinduced holes are considered as the main substance that generates the OH radicals (Liu et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2012).The 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (TAOH) would be produced by the reaction between theOH radicals and terephthalic acid (TA), emitting a unique fluorescent peak located at around 426 nm (Yan et al., 2019b;Yang et al., 2020).The optimal amount of acid-treated clay minerals in the composites was also investigated from 400 to 700 mg.As shown in Fig. S7, the CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 also exhibited the best photocatalytic performance and were selected as the representative samples.Fig. S8 illustrates the time-dependent fluorescence intensities of g-C 3 N 4 , CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 as photocatalysts at 426 nm.The emission signal increases monotonically with the increase of irradiation time, which further demonstrates that the composites have excellent stability.As illustrated in Fig. 8, the photocatalytic generation rates of OH radicals for CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 are 3.10, 2.06, and 2.58 times higher than g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which reveals the improved oxidation ability of photoinduced holes.The higher photocatalytic oxidation ability of the three composites can be attributed to the higher optical absorption ability and better separation of photoinduced charge carriers as demonstrated by UV-Vis DRS (Fig. 5a) and PL (Fig. 6) results.In the same trend as photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution, the CNK600 also shows the highest activity for the photocatalytic generation of OH radicals compared with the other composites, which may be attributed to its largest SSA. The PEC water oxidation with g-C 3 N 4 , CNK600, CNS500, or CNT500 as photoanode materials was performed and shown in Fig. 9a.The CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 present stable photocurrent densities in six cycles, which are all higher than g-C 3 N 4 .This stable and advanced photocurrent density of the composites reveals enhanced light utilization and more efficient interfacial electron transfer (Wang et al., 2015).Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to explain the interfacial carriers' transport behaviors of g-C 3 N 4 , CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500.The EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 9b) display that the arc radius of CNK600, CNS500, and CNT500 are all smaller than that of g-C 3 N 4 .These results further suggest that the charge separation and transfer in the composites are greatly promoted, thus improving the photocatalytic performance. A possible photocatalytic mechanism for the clay minerals/g-C 3 N 4 composites is proposed in Fig. 10.The acid-treated clay minerals function as the carriers of g-C 3 N 4 that is the photocatalysts for photocatalytic reactions.Upon illumination, the excited electrons in the conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 would reduce water or CO 2 to H 2 or CO, respectively, while the photogenerated holes in the valence band of g-C 3 N 4 would oxidize the sacrificial agents.Obviously, the clay mineral carriers would effectively facilitate the distribution and light-harvesting of g-C 3 N 4 , contributing to the enhanced photocatalytic performance."}]}}
