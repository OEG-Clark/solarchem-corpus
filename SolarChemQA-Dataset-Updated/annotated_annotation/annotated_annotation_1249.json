Typically, the precursor material that has been used to prepare g-C 3 N 4 is melamine through the hydrothermal method. 18In the first step, 10 g melamine was placed in a ceramic crucible and sealed with the lid, and heated in a muffle furnace at 550 C for 2 hours.After cooling naturally, the light-yellow solid cake obtained was ground using a mortar and pestle to obtain g-C 3 N 4 . The g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite was prepared at normal temperature by an ultrasonic approach.Firstly, g-C 3 N 4 (1 g) was dispersed in 20 mL methanol and agitated for 6 hours to get exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 sheets.Secondly, a certain quantity of V 2 AlC MAX (0.1 g) is added in 10 mL of methanol and dispersed via an ultrasonic approach.Thirdly, under continuous stirring, the V 2 AlC MAX suspension is added to the g-C 3 N 4 suspension.The composite sample was further dried under airflow at 100 C and referred to as exfoliated 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite.Figure 1 demonstrates the synthesis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite using physical mixing followed by an ultrasonic approach. To evaluate the crystallinity phase, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted using the Bruker Advance D8 machine, operated with Cu K radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm.Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Hitachi SU8020 equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was utilized to identify the surface morphology and nanotextures of all the samples.Using the spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 100) with an integrated sphere, the ultravioletvisible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were obtained for the powder samples.Raman spectra of the samples were recorded using a Raman Xplore Plus Spectrophotometer (HORIBA Scientific) with a 600 nm grating and a 532 nm emitting laser as an excitation source.Similarly, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a HORIBA Scientific spectrophotometer operating with a 325 nm laser. The fixed-bed photoreactor system was used to carry out photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane via CO 2 into syngas (CO, H 2 ) under visible light irradiation, as shown in Figure 2.This system is significant for efficient photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, especially in the gas phase.The reactor consists of a cylindrical vessel made from stainless steel with a volume of 80 cm 3 and equipped with a 1 cm thick quartz window for the passage of light irradiation from the reflector lamp.For visible light irradiation, a 35 W Xenon lamp was employed having an intensity of 20 mW cm A2 .Before beginning the reactor system experiment, the photoreactor was cleaned utilizing nitrogen (N 2 ) to eliminate air and to control the leakage using pressure 2 bar.After the purging of the reactor for a half-hour, the 50 mg photocatalyst was distributed at the bottom to ensure that the light is strongly transmitted over the whole surface of the catalyst.The composite photocatalyst performance was also tested at various feed ratios.Therefore, the initial flow rates of CH 4 /CO 2 molar feed ratios were changed for this purpose.The effects of feed ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 on photocatalyst performance were investigated.The pressure inside the reactor was adjusted using a mass flow controller and manually controlling reactor valves.All the experiments were conducted at 0.3 bars of gauge pressure.The off-line GC (6890 N) connected with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector was employed for analyzing products evolved during the photocatalytic DRM process.Both the detectors were connected with the Carboxen-1010 PLOT capillary column and have the ability to separate CO, CH 4 , H 2 , and CO 2 products."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4", "source": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "V 2 AlC MAX", "source": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst", "source": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite", "source": "In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "pure g-C 3 N 4", "source": "The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4", "source": "The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4/V 2 AlC composite", "source": "By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples", "source": "Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite", "source": "Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst", "source": "The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite", "source": "The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4", "source": "Thus, the development of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst layered composite is highly stable and promising for DRM and would be beneficial for other energy-efficient fuels production.", "context": "In conclusion, g-C 3 N 4 dispersed V 2 AlC MAX composite with controlled structure and morphology was successfully designed, resulting in improved interfacial charges separation via the ultrasonic method.Benefiting from the conductive properties of V 2 AlC, the photogenerated charge carrier of g-C 3 N 4 can reduce the traveling distance of excited electrons which effectively separated and transferred electron-hole pairsfor enhanced CO and H 2 evolution.As a result, the visible light-harvesting potential and catalyst stability are excellent.Using a V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 catalyst, the rate of CO 2 reduction increases significantly.The yield of CO over V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 is 2.21 and 4.825 times more than using pure g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.Similarly, the production of H 2 detected over V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 is 1.99 and 3.25 times higher than the amount of H 2 produced over pure g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC.Furthermore, under the same reaction conditions, a higher QY and production rate were achieved by choosing the optimum feed ratio CO 2 /CH 4 of 1.0.This study also contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in photocatalytic dry reforming for the selective processing of CO and H 2 in the presence of visible light.The results of this study provide novel ideas for the design and creation of new materials for converting GHG into useful chemicals.Thus, the development of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst layered composite is highly stable and promising for DRM and would be beneficial for other energy-efficient fuels production.

The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "V 2 AlC", "source": "Benefiting from the conductive properties of V 2 AlC, the photogenerated charge carrier of g-C 3 N 4 can reduce the traveling distance of excited electrons which effectively separated and transferred electron-hole pairsfor enhanced CO and H 2 evolution.", "context": "In conclusion, g-C 3 N 4 dispersed V 2 AlC MAX composite with controlled structure and morphology was successfully designed, resulting in improved interfacial charges separation via the ultrasonic method.Benefiting from the conductive properties of V 2 AlC, the photogenerated charge carrier of g-C 3 N 4 can reduce the traveling distance of excited electrons which effectively separated and transferred electron-hole pairsfor enhanced CO and H 2 evolution.As a result, the visible light-harvesting potential and catalyst stability are excellent.Using a V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 catalyst, the rate of CO 2 reduction increases significantly.The yield of CO over V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 is 2.21 and 4.825 times more than using pure g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.Similarly, the production of H 2 detected over V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 is 1.99 and 3.25 times higher than the amount of H 2 produced over pure g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC.Furthermore, under the same reaction conditions, a higher QY and production rate were achieved by choosing the optimum feed ratio CO 2 /CH 4 of 1.0.This study also contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in photocatalytic dry reforming for the selective processing of CO and H 2 in the presence of visible light.The results of this study provide novel ideas for the design and creation of new materials for converting GHG into useful chemicals.Thus, the development of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst layered composite is highly stable and promising for DRM and would be beneficial for other energy-efficient fuels production.

The g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite was prepared at normal temperature by an ultrasonic approach.Firstly, g-C 3 N 4 (1 g) was dispersed in 20 mL methanol and agitated for 6 hours to get exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 sheets.Secondly, a certain quantity of V 2 AlC MAX (0.1 g) is added in 10 mL of methanol and dispersed via an ultrasonic approach.Thirdly, under continuous stirring, the V 2 AlC MAX suspension is added to the g-C 3 N 4 suspension.The composite sample was further dried under airflow at 100 C and referred to as exfoliated 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite.Figure 1 demonstrates the synthesis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite using physical mixing followed by an ultrasonic approach.

The fixed-bed photoreactor system was used to carry out photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane via CO 2 into syngas (CO, H 2 ) under visible light irradiation, as shown in Figure 2.This system is significant for efficient photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, especially in the gas phase.The reactor consists of a cylindrical vessel made from stainless steel with a volume of 80 cm 3 and equipped with a 1 cm thick quartz window for the passage of light irradiation from the reflector lamp.For visible light irradiation, a 35 W Xenon lamp was employed having an intensity of 20 mW cm A2 .Before beginning the reactor system experiment, the photoreactor was cleaned utilizing nitrogen (N 2 ) to eliminate air and to control the leakage using pressure 2 bar.After the purging of the reactor for a half-hour, the 50 mg photocatalyst was distributed at the bottom to ensure that the light is strongly transmitted over the whole surface of the catalyst.The composite photocatalyst performance was also tested at various feed ratios.Therefore, the initial flow rates of CH 4 /CO 2 molar feed ratios were changed for this purpose.The effects of feed ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 on photocatalyst performance were investigated.The pressure inside the reactor was adjusted using a mass flow controller and manually controlling reactor valves.All the experiments were conducted at 0.3 bars of gauge pressure.The off-line GC (6890 N) connected with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector was employed for analyzing products evolved during the photocatalytic DRM process.Both the detectors were connected with the Carboxen-1010 PLOT capillary column and have the ability to separate CO, CH 4 , H 2 , and CO 2 products."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "visible light system", "source": "All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "UV light", "source": "Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "420 nm", "source": "The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "Visible", "source": "This study also contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in photocatalytic dry reforming for the selective processing of CO and H 2 in the presence of visible light.", "context": "In conclusion, g-C 3 N 4 dispersed V 2 AlC MAX composite with controlled structure and morphology was successfully designed, resulting in improved interfacial charges separation via the ultrasonic method.Benefiting from the conductive properties of V 2 AlC, the photogenerated charge carrier of g-C 3 N 4 can reduce the traveling distance of excited electrons which effectively separated and transferred electron-hole pairsfor enhanced CO and H 2 evolution.As a result, the visible light-harvesting potential and catalyst stability are excellent.Using a V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 catalyst, the rate of CO 2 reduction increases significantly.The yield of CO over V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 is 2.21 and 4.825 times more than using pure g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.Similarly, the production of H 2 detected over V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 is 1.99 and 3.25 times higher than the amount of H 2 produced over pure g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC.Furthermore, under the same reaction conditions, a higher QY and production rate were achieved by choosing the optimum feed ratio CO 2 /CH 4 of 1.0.This study also contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in photocatalytic dry reforming for the selective processing of CO and H 2 in the presence of visible light.The results of this study provide novel ideas for the design and creation of new materials for converting GHG into useful chemicals.Thus, the development of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst layered composite is highly stable and promising for DRM and would be beneficial for other energy-efficient fuels production.

The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "fixed bed reactor", "source": "However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.", "context": "The XRD analysis of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC MAX, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst has been estimated as shown in Figure 3A.The XRD analysis of pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibited two distinct peaks at 13.1 (11 0) and 27.36 (002), which were attributed to the packing motif of tri-striazine units and stacking of conjugated aromatic rings, respectively, where the sample matched standard peak JCPDS Card no.87-1526. 19,20Similarly, V 2 AlC MAX (JCPDS No. 29-0101) has obvious peaks at 13 and 41 , which correspond to the (002) and (103) facets, respectively, and are consistent with previous reports.Furthermore, the V impurity was probably responsible for a slight peak at 75.04 and 78.73 , respectively. 21,22This is because the V 2 AlC phase is decomposed, which results in Al desorption due to a weak connection between the atoms of Al and V with high activity. 23It is worth noting that, in both the g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX samples, no F I G U R E 2 Schematic demonstration of the experimental setup for photocatalytic methane dry reforming in a fixed bed photoreactor impurity in original peaks was found, confirming good purity.In 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite, all the XRD peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC were appeared, which confirms that phase structures of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC to synthesize 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite was not altered after mixing together.The presence of obvious diffraction peaks of the V 2 AlC in the XRD patterns of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst along with strong diffraction pattern of g-C 3 N 4 further suggesting that V 2 AlC was coupled with g-C 3 N 4 without any phase change. The g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples were identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the findings are shown in Figure 3B.For g-C 3 N 4 , Raman spectra contain several bands observed in the range of 355 to 1630 cm A1 which are attributed to graphitic carbon.Additionally, the vibrations at 753, 977, 1120, 1233, and 1314 cm A1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of aromatic C-N heterocycle characteristic to melem. 24Meanwhile, the distinctive peaks of g-C 3 N 4 occur at 701 cm A1 (heptazine ring breathing mode) and 1233 cm A1 (stretching vibration modes of CN and C N heterocycles). 25The peak centered on 701 cm A1 has been also reported to be related to the breathing modes of the s-triazine ring, which exists in the g-C 3 N 4 network. 26This may be due to the impurities when the sample is carbonized under high temperatures.There are two Raman modes of D and G around 1343 and 1565 cm A1 found in the bare g-C 3 N 4 , which could be due to the interlayer stacking structure of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . 25,26The band at 1569 cm A1 is also defended as CN stretching vibration of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of a graphite-like structure.The V 2 AlC MAX exhibits characteristic Raman peaks at 158, 239, 258, and 360 cm A1 .The Raman vibration at 158 and 239 cm A1 (E 2g ) represent the in-plane vibration of V and Al atoms, while the vibrations at 258 cm A1 (E 1g ) and 360 cm A1 (A 1g ) corresponds to the inplane and out-of-plane vibration of V atoms. 21More interestingly, all the peaks of V 2 AlC, and g-C 3 N 4 appeared in the composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.This confirms the successful fabrication of composite catalysts with their good interaction and would be promising to maximize catalytic activity and products selectivity. PL is an effective and widely used method for demonstrating the separation and transfer potential of the charge carrier.The charge carrier recombination rate in pure g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX loaded g-C 3 N 4 could be determined using PL spectra, and the findings are given in Figure 4.By fabricating a g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC composite, the PL emission was dramatically reduced when compared to g-C 3 N 4 .The PL spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 includes two noticeable peaks at 445 and 487 nm, belonging to the band change and radiative recombination of the shallow trapped electrons, respectively.This demonstrates the existence of g-C 3 N 4 sub-gap defects, and similar findings have been recorded previously. 27The PL emission rate of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was reduced significantly when V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that the photogenerated e A and h can be greatly suppressed by V 2 AlC.The PL intensity reduction of pure g-C 3 N 4 was due to V 2 AlC loaded causing prolonged life of photogenerated charges.This shows how the photogenerated charges are trapped on the g-C 3 N 4 F I G U R E 3 (A) XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst and (B) Raman spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 ALC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst samples surface by V 2 AlC.Furthermore, this also confirms that V 2 AlC has further charges separation proficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 .More importantly, the electron transfers from the g-C 3 N 4 to V 2 AlC are more efficient than the single g-C 3 N 4 , confirming synergistic effects of g-C 3 N 4 on the V 2 AlC surface. The UV-vis DRS is a popular technique for studying optical absorption properties in semiconductor-based photocatalysis.As illustrated in Figure 5A, pure g-C 3 N 4 absorbs visible light due to its wavelength of more than 400 nm.On the other hand, there was no obvious evidence of the absorption edge in the UV-vis absorption spectra of V 2 AlC in the 200 to 800 nm region, which suggested the metallic existence of V 2 AlC.This was also due to the dark color of V 2 AlC, which absorbs light irradiation in the visible field. 28When V 2 AlC was combined with g-C 3 N 4 , the absorption band was further narrowed and a wavelength of more than 460 nm was achieved.The optical absorption of V 2 AlC is substantially enhanced over the visible spectrum after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with V 2 AlC by showing a redshift, resulting in improved effectiveness for gathering photons in the heterostructure sample resulting increase in the efficiency of charge separation.The composite of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 displays redshift owing to the enhancement of the edge of absorption to the lengthier wavelengths, which greatly increases the absorption spectrum capacity of the heterostructures photocatalysts over the visible light irradiation. The energy bandgaps (E g ) of pure g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 were estimated by the KubelkaAMunk (KM) function vs energy with linear extrapolation according to Equation (2).where h (the light energy) refers to the abscissa on the horizontal (x) axis, whereas ordinate refers to (h) 1/r on the vertical (y) axis, respectively, is the absorption coefficient and r refers to the semiconductor nature with shifts of direct to indirect bandgap materials. 29The wide light absorption spectrum of V 2 AlC led to its wide absorption spectrum, preventing the determination of its bandgap energy.On the contrary, it could possible to estimate the energy bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which were 2.9 and 2.85 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5B,C.The bandgap energy for both samples is close to each other, which indicates that the V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 does not have a significant effect on the g-C 3 N 4 bandgap.Even though it was demonstrated that the loading of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX in g-C 3 N 4 did not significantly change the energy gap, the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX increased light absorption within the visible range due to the black color of V 2 AlC.Promising visible-light absorption using V 2 AlC would therefore be useful to maximizing harvesting of visible light in the existence of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composites.More specifically, g-C 3 N 4 has a particularly large negative conduction band (CB) position, which means it may have a more pronounced effect on CO 2 reduction.All of these findings support the construction of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, which might be used to stimulate selective photocatalytic dry reforming (DRM) of methane to produce syngas (CO, H 2 ) under a visible light system. The electron-hole pair separation and the direction of transfer depend greatly on the CB and valence band (VB) position in addition to the energy bandgap (E g ).The determination of CB and VB has a powerful effect to identify the structure of electronics on the composite.The values of E g and CB are used to calculate the VB according to the following Equation ( 3). The g-C 3 N 4 CB was calculated from the equation based on the literature as demonstrated in Equation (4). 30here CB is the conduction band; X is the semiconductor electronegativity (EN), which is the geometric mean of the EN of the constituent atoms.On the hydrogen scale, E e (4.5 eV) is the energy of free electrons, E g is the semiconductor bandgap energy. 31 Using Equation ( 4), the calculated CB of A1.28 eV for g-C 3 N 4 was used to determine valance band VB.It is possible to use Equation ( 3) with known bandgap energy of 2.9 eV to determine VB, which was 1.62 eV.These results confirm that the optical absorption characteristics and a favorable band structure, which might help to improve the photoactivity. 32 Figure 6 demonstrates FE-SEM images of the bare g-C 3 N 4 , V 2 AlC, and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 , as can be seen from Figure 6A,B presents a typical morphology with wrinkles and folds at the edges of the lamellar stacking system, whereas V 2 AlC has layered sheets that are stacked together as explained in Figure 6C,D.V 2 AlC is a densely layered system of thick and compact sheets with a smaller interlayer gap that is closely bound and packed using metallic bonding.Treatment with methanol could cause an increase in the interlayer distance between the layered to improve dispersion.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 could couple with V 2 AlC to form 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite, where a curled structure was observed for g-C 3 N 4 , dispersed over exfoliated V 2 AlC structure as shown in Figure 6E,F.FESEM of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite shows compact stacked sheets of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, thus, enabling the construction of a 2D structure that would be beneficial to increase interfacial contacts. EDX facilitates elemental identification by calculating the amount and energy of X-rays issued from a specimen after excitation with an electron beam.To ensure that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite has an equal dispersion of V 2 AlC, the EDX mapping analysis was conducted as exhibited in Figure 7A.Obviously, all the elements of the composite are uniformly dispersed, which confirms the successful fabrication of V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 composite with their good interaction.Furthermore, EDX results of the V 2 AlC/g-C 3 N 4 in Figure 7B confirm the presence of V, Al, C, N, and O elements.The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the composite would probably be due to oxygen complexes (O 2 , OH, and H 2 O) adsorbed to the surface of the composite and similarly reported in the literature. 33All these findings confirm the successful fabrication of the composite with good interaction and distribution of elements that would be beneficial for charge carrier separation. Before evaluating the effectiveness of photocatalysts, it is important to ensure that there are no impurities in the catalyst samples and the products have been obtained only via the photocatalytic method.There are two ways to confirm that, the first is based on the use of the catalyst with an inert gas such as N 2 in the presence of light, while the second approach relies on the use of the feed gases CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of light and without the use of the catalyst materials.Noticeably, in all sets of experiments, production of either CO or H 2 (syngas) was not detected, indicating these products were originated during the photocatalysis process only. The efficiency of pristine V 2 AlC, pure g-C 3 N 4 , and V 2 AlC-loaded (5, 10, 15, and 20) onto g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated under visible light for photocatalytic DRM method to produce CO and H 2 as shown in Figure 8.The performance estimation of photocatalysts for the generation of CO through the DRM method within visible light is revealed in Figure 8A.Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , the CO production was in a smaller amount, probably due to more recombination of photo-induced charges over the bare g-C 3 N 4 surface.Although, the pristine V 2 AlC has also lower efficiency compared to g-C 3 N 4 , which works as a photocatalyst for CO production, the conductive properties of V 2 AlC are considered as an advantage when it will couple with g-C 3 N 4 because they will increase charge carrier separation.Moreover, continuous CO production was observed using all V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts over the whole irradiation period.This was due to the efficient charges separation rate over the g-C 3 N 4 surface, which resulted in good productivity.The best loading of V 2 AlC was 10 onto g-C 3 N 4 , which gives the higher product of CO compared to other loadings of V 2 AlC that were 5, 15, and 20, onto g-C 3 N 4 .The CO production is gradually increased when the V 2 AlC loading increased from 5 to 10 wt and then the yields of CO started slowly decreased when the amount of V 2 AlC loading increased from 15 to 20 wt.The declined productivity with higher V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 was probably been due to creating charge carrier recombination centers.The quantity of V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, has a vital role to improve the performance of photocatalyst. 34It is also mentioned that, as an overload of V 2 AlC leads to the light-shielding effect, thus an overloaded quantity will have negative impacts on the CO 2 reduction efficiency of photocatalytic systems.Moreover, any additional V 2 AlC loaded into g-C 3 N 4 will decrease the quantity of g-C 3 N 4 along with reducing the absorption of vis-light irradiation, therefore, suppressing the electron-producing photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . On the other hand, the improvement of photoactivity using 10 V 2 AlC loading onto g-C 3 N 4 could be attributed to good interaction among both the materials due to 2D/2D intimate contact, which evidently decreased the electron-hole recombination rate.More importantly, the 2D/2D interfaces generate a wide charge transfer pathway, which helps to accelerate electron transmission from the g-C 3 N 4 CB to the metallic V 2 AlC.V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 , however, could demonstrate the highest photocatalytic efficiency over the entire irradiation period to generate CO.As a result, the greatly increased CO production was obtained during DRM due to superior charge carrier separation and increased visible light absorption.In addition, more surface-active sites and promising electronic conductivities are also provided by V 2 AlC MAX, which is beneficial for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The photoactivity of V 2 AlC, g-C 3 N 4 , and 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite for H 2 evolution during DRM under visible light is shown in Figure 8B.The production of H 2 was lower compared to CO using different (5, 10, 15, and 20) V 2 AlC-loaded onto g-C 3 N 4 .This is probably due to less attachment of methane over the composite surface in addition to lower oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 for more production of protons.In addition, the efficiency of V 2 AlC was much varying for H 2 production, while it is higher for promoting CO production during the DRM process.This is probably due to more utilization of H and electrons for CO 2 reduction to CO instead of H 2 production. 35However, when g-C 3 N 4 was combined with V 2 AlC, the best loading of V 2 AlC was also 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 because it showed higher H 2 production.This is because of the synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 which allows good interfacial interaction for more production and separation of charges. 36urthermore, V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst has greater electron transport because of the increased activity of the various electron transport F I G U R E 7 EDX analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst sample (A) SEM showing mapping distribution and (B) EDX plots of the composite sample channels.More importantly, exfoliated V 2 AlC samples with methanol provide larger interfacial interaction which results in enhanced photocatalytic photoactivity.Since g-C 3 N 4 has good dispersion over the 2D V 2 AlC MAX structure, this will stimulate separation and transportation of charge carriers over the semiconductor, resulting in significantly increased CO and H 2 production.This shows that during photocatalytic DRM, the 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterojunction is also attractive for the development of syngas production due to good charge separation with higher light absorption.The enhanced activity could be due to visible light absorption, the speed of the migration of charging carriers, and strong interaction between composite materials. The efficiency of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was compared to prior literature, and the findings are summarized in Table 1.The photoreduction of CO 2 with CH 4 over g-C 3 N 4 -GO nanocomposite has been reported to produce CO (399.1 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (22.4 mol g A1 h A1 ), respectively. 37Likewise, under visible light irradiation, photo-induced CO 2 -CH 4 reduction over Cu-modified g-C 3 N 4 yielded 142 mol g A1 h A1 and 76 mol mol g A1 h A1 of CO and H 2 , respectively. 38In another study, it has been observed that when visible light is used to irradiate La/g-C 3 N 4 , a greater amount of CO is produced than H 2 , which was 15.4 folds higher than the yield of H 2 . 9Another study examined the DRM process using a La/TiO 2 catalyst and showed more favorable for CO generation when exposed to UV light.The CO and H 2 yield rates were 511 mol g A1 h A1 and 149 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively. 39In another work, the photocatalytic transformation of CO 2 -CH 4 in the existence of gold and rhodium-modified TNTs was investigated.The major products observed were CO and H 2 , which was CO (11.9 mol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 (104 mol g A1 h A1 ) produced in a cell-type photoreactor operating at a high temperature. 8Although prior studies reported better yields, several of them used UV light, which accounts for only 3 to 5 of solar radiation.Additionally, the majority of the research revealed a lower level of H 2 production than CO production.The present study shows a significant amount of CO and H 2 production over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , which was 118.7 mol g A1 h -1 , and 89.5 mol g A1 h A1 , respectively, at normal temperature due to the use of V 2 AlC MAX as co-catalyst.This is because V 2 AlC MAX has a rising capacity to trap electrons and excellent electronconducting characteristics, resulting in increased CO and H 2 generation.Furthermore, the usage of noble metals greatly raises the overall cost of future industrial-scale systems, making the use of la, Cu, and Pt economically inefficient.As a result, they should be replaced by lowcost, eco-friendly materials such as V 2 AlC MAX. The feed ratio between CO 2 and CH 4 could affect the selectivity and activity for the formation of syngas (CO and H 2 ) during the DRM process.To investigate feed ratios, three different CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios (CH 4 /CO 2 of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) have been employed to boost CO and H 2 production under the same operating parameters.The feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 for the generation of CO and H 2 over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite is shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the yield rates of syngas (CO, H 2 ) were different by varying CH 4 /CO 2 feed ratios, while keeping the same operating condition.The effect of the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 shows the maximum yields of CO and H 2 are observed at a feed ratio of 1:1.However, the production of CO and H 2 decreases when the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 increased or decreased than the optimal value which was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ).This is obvious, during the photocatalytic process, there would be an attachment of both the molecules for the reduction and oxidation reactions.With alternating feed ratio, there would be more or less attachment of each molecule of CO 2 and CH 4 which will result in a decline in photocatalytic activity as similarly reported in literature. 40,41or CO generation, the feed ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 1:1 was the best because of the availability of CO 2 on the surface of photocatalyst which could be equitized to the number of electrons to reduce CO 2 to generate CO.Otherwise, the production of CO is lower after the change in the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 from 1:1 to 2:1.This was probably due to increasing the number of CO 2 molecules attached to the photocatalyst surface.As a result, if the catalyst surface contains higher carbon dioxide, a greater number of electrons and protons are needed for the photocatalytic dry-reforming reaction to convert CO 2 to CO.Similarly, the CO yield was limited after utilizing a CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio of 1:2, where the greater CH 4 content was used.The lower CO production was probably due to the photocatalyst surface being saturated with CH 4 molecules, resulting in more CH 4 molecules to attach over the photocatalyst surface, whereas CO 2 molecules have to compete to contact the photocatalyst surface for utilizing electrons to produce CO. On the contrary, the H 2 production was high at CH 4 : CO 2 feed ratio 1:1 due to the contact of both the reactants at the catalyst surface but it was less than the production of CO.Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 is equivalent to the number of holes in the surface of the photocatalyst.When the CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was 1:2, the amount of H 2 produced was the lowest.This is attributable to the catalyst surface could be exposed to a higher amount of CO 2 molecules, thus decreasing the contact between the surface of the catalyst and CH 4 molecules to generate protons for H 2 production.Similarly, when a 2:1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio was used, the amount of H 2 production was also lowered.This was clear since the catalyst surface did not contain enough CO 2 molecules to react with electrons and hence contribute to increased H 2 generation through the use of electrons.Thus, for the electrons and holes to be used efficiently, an optimized feed ratio to boost oxidation and reduction reaction is required.As a result, to obtain maximum product yields, it is crucial to test the photocatalyst at different feed ratios to get an optimum concentration for maximizing productivity. The efficiency of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction photocatalysts were further examined using CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CH 4 -H 2 O as the reducing agents while maintaining all other parameters constant and the results are demonstrated in Figure 10.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using different reducing agents included dry reforming (DRM), CO 2 -H 2 O system, CO 2 -H 2 system, and bireforming of methane (BRM) could be also demonstrated in the following Equations ( 5) to (9), respectively. 8O was a major product in the CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -H 2 reaction systems, whereas the production of CO was largest at first during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, but it eventually decreased to reach a steady-state level as shown in Figure 10A.The amount of CO produced by the photocatalytic bi-reforming process (CO 2 CH 4 H 2 O) was the least when compared to the amount of CO produced by other processes using a different reducing agent.When the two oxidation reagents CH 4 and H 2 O are F I G U R E 9 Effect of CO 2 /CH 4 feed ratio on the performance of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas at different irradiation times: (A) CO evolution and (B) H 2 evolution employed in the BRM process, their attachment to the catalyst surface is boosted, resulting in a small amount of CO 2 connected to the catalyst surface, resulting in a reduced CO 2 reduction process. 40The highest CO production rate of 118.06 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved using the CO 2 -CH 4 system, which is 1.12, 1.26, and 1.61 folds higher than the CO 2 -H 2 system, CO 2 -H 2 O system, and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, respectively.When CH 4 and CO 2 were only included in the feed mixture through DRM, each molecule has an equal probability of occupying the catalyst active sites, and as a result, the CO production would be greatly increased.Furthermore, another possibility is that the 10 V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts have the ability to efficiently attach the methane molecules, hence decreasing the possibility of other molecules attaching to the catalyst surface.More interestingly, compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system and (CO 2 A CH 4 H 2 O) system, the production of CO using a CO 2 -H 2 reaction system was much higher.This is because water is a weak reducing agent, requiring more energy to oxidize than hydrogen, and similar results have been reported in the literature. 42 Among the reducing agents, the CO 2 -H 2 system was found more efficient for CH 4 production compared to the CO 2 -H 2 O system.CH 4 production rate of 97.35 mol g A1 h A1 was achieved with CO 2 -H 2 system, which is 1.04 times than it was generated with water as reducing agents.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction.In comparison to the photocatalytic CO 2 -H 2 O reduction process, the photocatalytic DRM and photocatalytic BRM processes produced much more hydrogen over a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite.Interestingly, the photocatalytic DRM process produced the highest amount of H 2 at 89.52 mol g A1 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was greater than 1.07 and 1.14 times the amounts produced by the BRM and (CO 2 H 2 ) processes, respectively.This is most likely owing to the excellent adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 molecules in the DRM, which enables greatly increased CO and H 2 generation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, when a larger number of CH 4 and CO 2 molecules connect to the surface of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, a larger number of holes (h ) are needed to convert them to protons (H ) in the DRM reaction, boosting overall photocatalytic efficiency.It is also worth mentioning that, in comparison to the CO 2 -H 2 O system, the BRM process would produce more protons (H ).This is because hydrogen production was not detected when CO 2 reduction was being conducted using CO 2 -H 2 O system.Furthermore, when BRM is used, more CH 4 and H 2 O molecules are attached to the catalyst surface than when CO 2 -H 2 O is used.Due to the increased concentrations of CH 4 and water, more protons would be produced and their hydrogen reduced, resulting in a The effect of a reductant (CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 H 2 O) over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite during photocatalytic DRM for syngas.(A) CO evolution and (B) CH 4 and H 2 evolution higher H 2 yield.As a result, adsorption competition between these molecules affects the overall efficiency of photocatalysis.All above findings confirm that both photocatalyst and reducing agents have a significant contribution in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction under visible light.Furthermore, these findings confirm that the addition of a reducing agent and V 2 AlC MAX to g-C 3 N 4 improved photocatalytic performance greatly.Additionally, all reactants, including CH 4 , H 2 O, H 2 , and CO 2 , have the ability to connect to the photocatalyst surface; nevertheless, efficiency is fully reliant on the concentration of each reactant employed in the oxidation and reduction reactions.More importantly, these results reveal that photocatalytic DRM, BRM, CO 2hydrogen, and CO 2 reduction with H 2 O systems are complex processes in which the association of reactants, illumination, and photocatalyst significantly affects the yield rate and selectivity of the products. It is necessary to determine the activity and life of the catalyst by conducting a stability analysis for the syngas (CO, H 2 ) production during photocatalytic DRM within visible light irradiation or other different practical application.The photocatalyst was added inside the photoreactor and the feed ratio (CH 4 /CO 2 ) for all cycles was fixed to 1.0.The performance of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite catalyst was investigated in three cycles to estimate its stability.The experiments were carried out for a period of 16 hours in three cycles.For the achievement of this task, after every complete cycle, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas before starting the next cycle and the results are illustrated in Figure 11.Evidently, during the entire irradiation period, CO and H 2 production were developed considerably under similar reaction conditions in all the cycles, and photocatalytic efficiency remained nearly unchanged.Such remarkable unchanged can be attributed to the photochemical stability of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite which offers a new strategy to improve solar energy performance.After the first cycle, there is a slight decrease in photoactivity for CO evolution, which is improved after the second and third cycles, indicating its greater stability for CO evolution during the DRM process, as illustrated in Figure 11A.Nevertheless, it is observed that CO yield was more prominent in the first run; marginally dropped in the second and third cyclic cycles.This is because some CO remained unabsorbed on the catalyst surface during the first cyclic run, but was desorbed during the subsequent cyclic run, increasing the overall CO evolution during the initial irradiation time.However, the stability test revealed only a minor loss of catalyst photoactivity in the first run, with a significant rise in the second and third stages.This is considered natural because they consume a part of the activity of the catalyst for the first time when the production of CO was higher than the other cycles.Therefore, it is obvious that V 2 AlC supplied stability to g-C 3 N 4 to prolong its photoactivity. In contrast, the generation of H 2 , as exhibited in Figure 11B, was higher at the start of all cycles and become gradually reduced.This reduced H 2 production which is highest at the start of CO 2 reduction with CH 4 through the DRM process was most likely due to a competing RWGS reaction, which resulted in the lowest H 2 , and highest CO production.This shows competitive reactions over the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of intermediates adsorbed over the active sites.This reduced the reactants molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface.These findings can be explained based on several reactions such as water gas shift (WGS), RWGS, and CO 2 methanation reactions, which results in Stability analysis of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic DRM under visible light (A) production of CO and H 2 and (B) yield ratios of CO/H 2 CO 2 and CH 4 being converted back to CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 as illustrated in Equations ( 10) to (12), respectively. During photocatalytic DRM, electrons are accumulated on the surface of V 2 AlC, which prevents their recombination.Due to the activation of the RWGS reaction (Equation 10), H 2 molecules can be consumed by CO 2 for the production of more CO during the DRM process at a prolonged reaction time.However, the chances for the activation of WGS reaction (Equation 11) are trivial due to less production of H 2 .However, another possible reaction should be CO methanation, enabling reversed reaction for the production of CH 4 (Equation 12).All these findings confirm that a decline in H 2 production after prolonged irradiation time would be due to activation of RWGS reaction which promotes more CO formation. The stability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction catalyst with CH 4 was further investigated by determining the efficiency and lifetime of the catalyst in different cycles under identical operating conditions using CO/H 2 yield ratios.The stability of the CO/H 2 yield ratio was decreased in the second cycle, but it was the highest in the third cycle, as shown in Figure 11B.Obviously, the stability results of the CO/H 2 yield ratio in the second second cycle were slightly lower than the results from the first and third cycles, which were improved after the third cycle, confirming its higher stability for CO/H 2 evolution during the DRM process.This was possibly owing to a partial loss of catalyst photoactivity, after which the catalyst resumed normal operation.More significantly, the maximum CO/H 2 yield ratio stability was obtained in the third cycle, which was 1.17 and 1.04 times better than it was acquired in the second and first cycle runs, respectively.This demonstrates the successful fabrication of a 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite with a large active surface area and faster charge carrier separation when used in a photocatalytic dry reforming process.More intriguingly, the increased CO/H 2 yield ratios observed over the cyclic runs may be explained by partial reduction of V 2 AlC MAX and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species on the catalyst surface, resulting in increased production of carbon-based products. In conclusion, the increased photoactivity of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to a controlled morphology caused by a 2D structure with faster charge separation, a suitable redox potential, higher light absorption, and a polymeric structure.The increased stability of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite in the current work is clearly due to the V 2 AlC layered structure, which enables effective syngas generation via photocatalytic DRM employing solar energy-assisted phototechnology. The findings of this study have been compared to previous research published by other researchers.For instance, an Ag-La modified g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was evaluated in a monolith photoreactor for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via the DRM process, however, the catalyst lost activity with time. 43In another study, a La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was examined for the photocatalytic DRM process, and the catalyst activity was found to be declining over time as well. 39Likewise, Tang et al 44 studied the performance of g-C 3 N 4 modified with Eu (III) and achieved comparable results.However, H 2 production remained constant and consistent over the three cycles, and comparable tendencies were observed for C 2 H 6 production.CO generation would be decreased as a result of its adsorption on the catalyst surface and reduced product desorption.This could also be due to La aggregation on the g-CNT surface, which could serve as charge recombination centers, as has been previously reported. 45 comparison of earlier and current results demonstrated that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite aided in product development and light distribution.All of these results indicate that the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited very high stability under visible light irradiation and can be considered a promising material for photocatalytic DRM applications utilizing solar light energy.According to the foregoing results, it is clear that the stability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CH 4 as described in the literature may be significantly enhanced using a highly efficient 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst. Photocatalytic energy efficiency or quantum efficiency is very important to evaluate different photocatalytic systems by the amounts of energy consumed and the rate of products under the same process conditions Furthermore, the intensity of light power, the illuminated surface area of the reactor, and the photon energy wavelength utilized during the CO 2 conversion method all play an important role.Calculating product yield rates could be used to compare the performance of catalysts and reactors, but since different catalyst loading and light intensity are used in photocatalytic reaction systems, this is not an acceptable method.As a result, estimating the quantum yield (QY) of various reactors and catalysts is the best approach. 46The QY can be determined using the number of electrons conducted during the photocatalysis process to produce CO or H 2 , as demonstrated in Equation (13). The light intensity of 20 mW cm A2 and a wavelength of 420 nm were employed as the source of power over an incident area of 25 cm 2 .The QY was determined using two and two electrons for the production of CO and H This demonstrates that photocatalytic dry reforming produces CO in addition to H 2 as a result of successful oxidation and reduction processes.However, DRM over V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 gave maximum QY for CO production of 0.857, which is 1.326-fold higher than QY for H 2 production in a fixed bed reactor.Simultaneously, a production rate of 89.52 mol g-cat A1 hour A1 with the selectivity of 45.54 was obtained for H 2 , which is 1.99 and 3.26 times higher than the selectivity obtained for g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.The selectivity of CO and H 2 production via 10 V 2 AlC loaded g-C 3 N 4 was increased from 54.42 to 57.01 for CO, whereas, it was increased from 45.57 to 52.78 or H 2 compared to pure g-C 3 N 4 , which has selectivity higher than V 2 AlC. The optimization feed ratio of the gas mixture has been used to increase the quantum yield.The effect of feed ratio has a powerful effect to increase the AQ yields when the feed ratio was 2:1 and 1:2 for CO, H 2 , respectively.It can be observed that the best feed ratio was 1:1 (CO 2 :CH 4 ) which gave QY of 0.857 and 0.646 for CO and H 2 over 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, which was higher than the feed ratio at 2:1and 1:2.The enhanced photocatalytic activity over the composite with significantly improved QY in this study can be attributed to good interfacial interaction due to exfoliated 2D layered structure of V 2 AlC with proficient charge carrier production and separation under visible light irradiation.All the above debates prove that 2D V 2 AlC MAX coupled g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst to maximize syngas production during photocatalytic DRM under visible light irradiation. The improvement in photocatalytic effectiveness is mostly attributable to the increase in the separation of rapid charge carriers, efficient light absorption, and enhanced surface reactions. 48By loading V 2 AlC through g-C 3 N 4 , the structure, and morphology of the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite could be further improved resulting in enhanced photoactivity.As discussed previously, 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 composite is typical for selective photocatalytic DRM towards syngas (CO, H 2 ) production.The schematic illustration for photocatalytic DRM over the 10 wt g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC MAX composite photocatalyst under visible light is presented in Figure 12.A good heterojunction was created between the V 2 AlC and g-C 3 N 4 because of the higher conductive characteristics of 2D V 2 AlC MAX, resulting in faster charge transfer and separation.Photocatalysis is a series of reactions using holes for CH 4 oxidation and electrons for CO 2 reduction that results in the formation of end products such as CO and H 2 according to the following Equations ( 14) to ( 22). 40tep 1: Photoactivation of catalyst Step 2: The process of oxidation Step 3: The process of reduction Step 4: The formation of CO and H 2 products Light irradiation strikes the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with energy equivalent to or higher than that of a bandgap of g-C 3 N 4 for charges production.A large population of electrons (e A ) is created when the g-C 3 N 4 is exposed to visible light in the excitation state. The electrons that have migrated from the VB will reach the conduction band (CB), while holes (h ) remain in the VB as demonstrated in Equation ( 14).As a result of the interaction formed between g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC MAX, electrons could simply be moved and trapped by the V 2 AlC MAX nanosheets, as demonstrated in Equation ( 15).The holes generated in the valance band of g-C 3 N 4 oxidize the CH 4 molecules, as shown in Equations (16) to (19), while the electrons on the V 2 AlC MAX surface reduce the CO 2 molecule as shown in Equation (20).Lastly, the (CO-H 2 ) syngas is generated, respectively, as shown by Equations ( 21) and (22). F I G U R E 1 2 Schematic illustration for charge carrier separation over the 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst composite under visible light for photocatalytic dry reforming of methane towards CO and H 2 production The synergistic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC has the potential to increase photocatalytic activity.Firstly, a large specific surface area could provide further absorbed and active sites, both of which could be essential in photocatalytic action.Secondly, the increased efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole separation and the transfer was also beneficial to photocatalytic performance.Finally, the photocatalytic dry reforming process may benefit from increased absorption of visible light.It was also found that the CB position of g-C 3 N 4 (CB A1.28 V vs NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO (A0.48 V vs NHE) and H /H 2 (A0.41 V vs NHE), thus, thermodynamically, production of CO and H 2 is possible.In general, the efficient charge carrier separation by V 2 AlC MAX was responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 .This is due to V 2 AlC MAX MAX is a very conductive material and hence operating as a sink to trap electrons because of the difference in work functions between the two materials.Earlier, the photocatalytic DRM process was reported on catalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 . 49Likewise, photocatalytic methane dry reforming was tested in a fixed bed system using a Ga 2 O 3 catalyst under UV-light and 314 to 673 K reaction temperature.The catalyst was advantageous for the production of CO and H 2 with smaller amounts of C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons. 50V 2 AlC is yet to be investigated using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by DRM to improve syngas generation under visible light.As a result, V 2 AlC is expected to open up new reaction pathways not available in traditional catalysts.Therefore, photocatalytic dry reforming could be enhanced using 2D/2D g-C 3 N 4 /V 2 AlC heterostructures due to efficient oxidation and reduction reactions.This is due to two primary reasons: (a) the efficient heterojunction generated by the 2D/2D nanocomposite, which greatly lowered the rate of (e A /h ) pair recombination and (b) the improved morphological and optical qualities acquired through connection with the V 2 AlC which results in greater visible light absorption."}, {"llm generation": "Fixed-bed", "source": "During the DRM process, using pure g-C 3 N 4 in a fixed bed, CO and H 2 generation rates of 53.65 and 44.92 mole g-cat A1 h A1 at selectivity 54.42 and 45.57, respectively, were achieved.", "context": "In conclusion, g-C 3 N 4 dispersed V 2 AlC MAX composite with controlled structure and morphology was successfully designed, resulting in improved interfacial charges separation via the ultrasonic method.Benefiting from the conductive properties of V 2 AlC, the photogenerated charge carrier of g-C 3 N 4 can reduce the traveling distance of excited electrons which effectively separated and transferred electron-hole pairsfor enhanced CO and H 2 evolution.As a result, the visible light-harvesting potential and catalyst stability are excellent.Using a V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 catalyst, the rate of CO 2 reduction increases significantly.The yield of CO over V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 is 2.21 and 4.825 times more than using pure g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC, respectively.Similarly, the production of H 2 detected over V 2 AlC-loaded g-C 3 N 4 is 1.99 and 3.25 times higher than the amount of H 2 produced over pure g-C 3 N 4 and V 2 AlC.Furthermore, under the same reaction conditions, a higher QY and production rate were achieved by choosing the optimum feed ratio CO 2 /CH 4 of 1.0.This study also contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in photocatalytic dry reforming for the selective processing of CO and H 2 in the presence of visible light.The results of this study provide novel ideas for the design and creation of new materials for converting GHG into useful chemicals.Thus, the development of 10 wt V 2 AlC MAX/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst layered composite is highly stable and promising for DRM and would be beneficial for other energy-efficient fuels production.
