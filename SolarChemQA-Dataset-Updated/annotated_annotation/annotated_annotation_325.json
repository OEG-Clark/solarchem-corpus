Firstly, the effect of nitrogen doping has been investigated.To do so, NT, NaT and the commercial system have been tested for carbon dioxide photoreduction.Productivity after 2, 4 and 6 h reaction has been reported in Figs. 1 and2. Under the selected reaction conditions (13.3 CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio), a complete selectivity to methane and a continuous increase in methane production along with reaction time has been observed for all the samples.Nitrogen affects positively the catalytic behaviour; in fact, NT system provides the best performance comparing to the nitrogen-free (NaT) and the commercial sample.Before considering a comparison of these results with already published works 19, it must be considered that experimental conditions are considerably milder than those from the few literature works where CO 2 photoreduction is performed in gas phase.Thus, a comparison with literature data would make a little sense. With the aim to investigate in depth the catalytic results several characterization techniques have been applied. Surface properties have been investigated by means of nitrogen physisorption and the results are reported in Tables 1 and2. All samples are mesoporous with specific surface area higher than 100 m 2 /g.Generally, a high surface area value is greatly desirable for catalysts because it is associated with a great number of superficial active sites.This enhances substrates adsorption on the catalytic surface 79.For the tested systems, this parameter seems to be significant but not essential to explain the activity results.In fact, commercial TiO 2 shows the highest surface area but not the best catalytic activity. Considering crystal properties and crystallite sizes, XRD analyses have been performed.Among the TiO 2 crystal structures, anatase seems to be the most advantageous, since the electron-hole recombination is slower in this phase than in rutile and brookite 80. XRD patterns for the three systems are reported in Fig. 3 and confirm the presence of anatase as the only crystalline TiO 2 phase in all the analyzed systems. On the other hand, the three samples show some differences in terms of anatase crystal size and sample crystallinity.The XRD bands of the reference TiO 2 are much wider than those of the other two samples due to the smaller crystal size.Furthermore, this sample is characterised by the coexistence of anatase phase (35-40 wt.) with a large fraction of amorphous titania 81.This could partially explain the worst catalytic performance of this catalyst compared to NT activity.On the contrary, NT and NaT samples exhibit the typical profile of highly crystalline systems with crystallites size in the range of 8-10 nm.The differences in these two samples found by XRD analyses do not provide a satisfactory explanation for the observed differences in photoactivity.Unfortunately, also XPS spectra do not show any difference between the samples.This means that there are not any species of nitrogen on catalytic surface and any consideration can be made on this matter. In order to shed some light on the catalytic results, the electronic properties of the samples have been investigated by Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS): a detail of the apparent band gap energy has been reported in Fig. 4. Considering the absorption spectra in the region between 300 and 500 nm, it is possible to observe that commercial TiO 2 and NaT provide only a well-defined absorption from 390 nm to lower wavelengths, ascribable to the band gap titania photoexcitation.On the other hand, NT shows another wider and less intense absorption band between 390 and 500 nm (see the inset in Fig. 4).The shift of light absorption covering now also the visible region is associated with the presence of nitrogen in titanium dioxide lattice.As reported by Dozzi et al. 47, nitrogen can either occupy lattice positions or interstitial sites.When nitrogen substitutes oxygen in lattice positions, N 2p states are mixed with O 2p ones and adsorption edge from O 2p p to Ti d xy is replaced by that from N 2p p , which requires a lower energy 82.Nitrogen can occupy also interstitial positions, favouring oxygen vacancies and inducing localized N 2p states within the band gap above the valence band 83: this also causes shift in light adsorption.In particular this band edge effect, the high adsorption in the UV-vis region, could be the reason of the highest activity of the N-doped sample in the carbon dioxide photoreduction. From DRS spectra, band gap values have been calculated: commercial TiO 2 shows a band gap of 3.25 eV while NaT shows a 3.21 eV band gap in accordance with reference works 84.Differently, NT shows a lower band bap of 3.16 eV: this means that energy radiation required for light absorption on NT is slightly lower in comparison with NaT and the commercial sample. From these experimental evidences, we can assume that the role of surface area and crystalline phase are important but not decisive: commercial TiO 2 shows the highest surface area but lower catalytic activity of NT.Only the optimal synergy between texture, crystalline structure and electronic properties provides good catalytic performances; a lead role is played by the electronic state configuration.In particular, in NT, nitrogen introduction modifies titania light absorption and this feature is reflected in its better catalytic performances. In order to provide a further improvement in catalytic performances, CuO has been added to NT systems as a co-catalyst.CuO has been selected because of its several advantages.Copper acts as a trap not only for electrons but also for holes and the energy levels introduced by impurities are near to CB and VB of TiO 2 as well.Therefore, Cu 2 ions presence could be recommended for enhancement of photocatalytic activity 77,85.Moreover, such electron-hole exchange could also occur between CuO and TiO 2 , slowing charges recombination.In this way, the probability of electron transfer to adsorbed CO 2 is increased and then the generation of reactive intermediates such as CO 2 A and HCOO A 57,86 is more probable.Copper does not only possess the required features to improve photoactivity of TiO 2 , but also it is easily available and inexpensive in comparison with noble metals (Au, Pt, Rh..) and it appears an appealing metal dopant.The first investigated system is 0.2CuNT, in which Cu loading is 0.2 wt. (determined by FAAS), in accord with Wu et al. 87. The sample has been calcined at 400 C in order to eliminate all the nitrates species derived from copper precursor.In fact, as shown in TG/DTA analysis (Fig. 5), nitrates decomposition is an exothermic process that occurs between 270 C and 350 C.Moreover, calcination at 400 C is aimed at titania phase transition from amorphous to anatase.This process is represented by an exothermic narrow peak between 350 C and 450 C in DTA curve, without any weight loss. After these preliminary considerations, 0.2CuNT has been tested for CO 2 photoreduction.In Fig. 6 the methane production after 2, 4 and 6 hour of reaction is reported and it has been compared with that obtained with NT sample.It is remarkable that, also in this case, methane is the only detected product for all the catalytic tests. Copper introduction has a beneficial effect on titania performances in CO 2 photoreduction causing an increase of about 40-50 in methane production after 4 and 6 h. As revealed by a preliminary characterization, Cu introduction has almost no influence on the resulting texture (surface area and porosity) of the oxide materials, neither it produces relevant structural differences (only anatase crystal phase has been detected also in the 0.2CuNT sample both by XRD analysis and by HRTEM images).Also the XPS spectra are inconclusive to understand the catalytic behaviour of the samples, since there are no substantial differences and the presence of copper species is not revealed due to its low content in the samples.So it would be definitely important to understand more deeply the role that copper covers on the final catalyst.Also in this case, an important answer to this issue has been given by DRS spectra in Fig. 7. Between 700 and 800 nm (section A), 0.2CuNT exhibits a broad absorption band, that is not present in NT spectrum.This phenomenon is due to the presence of copper and it is related to the photoexcitation of D-electrons from the dopant 88.Since copper oxides conduction band energy are slightly lower than titania (CuO 1.6 eV and Cu 2 O 2.4 eV) 76, excited electron can be transferred from TiO 2 conduction band to Cu oxide one: this phenomenon stabilizes the electron-hole couple and causes the reduction of excited electron-hole recombination 89,90. Focusing on the border region between UV and VIS between 350 and 500 nm (section B), the nitrogen band edge persists also in the CuO-TiO 2 sample it is even more intense.In particular 0.2CuNT has shown a higher absorption in this region than NT sample.Moreover, the apparent band gap energies have been calculated and for 0.2CuNT sample this value corresponds to 3.06 eV, which is smaller than the value of pure anatase titania (3.25 eV) and NT (3.16 eV) 91. Copper does not change the textural features of N promoted TiO 2 photocatalysts: surface area, porous structure and crystalline phase are maintained after CuO addition.The co-catalyst introduction not only preserves N doping effect but, at the same time, significantly improves the catalytic activity reducing electron-hole recombination. Afterwards, it has been investigated the effect of copper amount: this can cause variations in the interactions between dopants, co-catalysts and titania, triggering different photoactivity 92. The copper loading amount (0-0.6 wt.) has been chosen in accordance with Liu et al. 77 and the real Cu content has been determined by means of FAAS analysis.Catalytic results are shown in Figs. 8 and9. The copper amount does not have any effect on catalysts selectivity and, for all samples, methane has been the only product observed. Comparing reactivity results, it is possible to state that copper effect is not pronounced in 0.1CuNT, while the best catalytic results have been achieved with 0.2CuNT.Then this effect decreases with 0.4CuNT until copper becomes detrimental to photoactivity, like the case of 0.6CuNT.This trend in catalytic behaviour has been observed at any of the investigated reaction times, but it is more evident after six hours reactions. In order to explain the catalytic performances of the samples, some characterizations have been performed.Titania structural properties are similar in all these samples, as reported in Table 3: surface area values, from N 2 physisorption, range from 93 to 110 m 2 /g and XRD patterns show that, anatase is the only observed crystal phase with an average crystalline size of 10 nm.These last data are also confirmed by HRTEM analyses: the average particles size has been determined in the range from 12 to 14 nm for all samples.No copper metal nanoparticles have been detected, even in the sample with the highest amount of this metal.Table 3 BET surface areas and average pore diameter for NT and CuNT promoted samples.Therefore attention has been put on the nature of the copper using TPR analysis. Any hydrogen consumption ascribable to reduction species in the NT and 0.1CuNT samples has been observed: both in the NT sample, where there is not copper, and in the 0.1CuNT sample, where copper content is too low to be detected, any reduction has occurred. In the TPR profiles of the other samples it is possible to observe a band (hydrogen consumption) located at 200 C approximately, that is ascribable to the reduction of Cu 2 species to Cu 0 .This means that, in all the samples, oxidation state and interaction with titania surface are similar. In order to understand more deeply the catalytic behaviour, DRS analyses have been performed.In Fig. 10 spectra from NT (the sample doped only with nitrogen), 0.6CuNT (that has the highest amount of copper, 0.6 wt.) and 0.2CuNT (that has given the best catalytic performances) have been reported. By the inspection of the curves, it is possible to single out the following features: i) in the visible region the broad absorption between 600 and 800 nm for both 0.2CuNT and 0.6CuNT samples is ascribable to the presence of copper oxide species: in particular 0.6CuNT absorption is more intense than that of 0.2CuNT: this difference is due to a greater amount of metal 93.ii) in the UV-vis border region, between 390 and 480 nm, all the samples present an intense absorption due to nitrogen doping.As already said, copper introduction does not hinder nitrogen effect on titania's light absorption.Among them, in 0.2CuNT band-edge is the most pronounced.iii) the 0.6CuNT sample presents the worst absorption, indicating a less efficient nitrogen doping effect.This is mainly due to the presence of a great amount of copper which partially covers the titania's surface. These spectral features are in agreement with the band gap results: as a matter of fact, 0.2CuNT provided the lowest band gap (3.06 eV). Moreover, it is known that, when copper is present in great amount, Cu species act like recombination centres for photoinduced electron and hole 94,95. For both these reason there is an optimal balance in copper loading to enhance photoactivity in N doped CuO-TiO 2 photocatalysts 96.For carbon dioxide photoreduction to methane, the best results have been obtained with a sample containing 0.2 wt. of copper. The last part of the work was addressed to the investigation of the relationship between product distribution and CO 2 /H 2 O ratios in the feed stream.In fact, CO 2 and H 2 O molecules might be competitively activated by the charge transfer of titania excited states and the value of CO 2 /H 2 O ratios could influenced the selectivity for the formation of the products 78,97.The results of catalytic tests have been reported in Table 4 and in Fig. 11. The first and most evident consideration is that, decreasing CO 2 / H 2 O ratio, methane has not been the only detected product, but hydrogen has been formed as well.However, methane has been the predominant product: actually, selectivity to CH 4 stretches between 91.3 and 100. Considering methane production only, CO 2 /H 2 O ratio has had an impact definitely.In particular, decreasing CO 2 /H 2 O from 13.3 to 2.0 a continuous improvement has been reached with a peak value of 139.9 nmol CH4 /g cat at CO 2 /H 2 O ratio equal to 2.0.Afterwards, when CO 2 /H 2 O ratio has been further decreased to 1.0, TON has collapsed to 92.2 nmol CH4 /g cat . The bell-shaped trend in methane production might be interpreted remembering the presence of two competitive processes.The first one is the necessity of a mutual interaction between the two reactants on the catalyst's surface in order to reduce CO 2 .When the amount of CO 2 is low, the interactions between the two reactants is more efficient and we obtain the better catalytic performances. On the other hand when the CO 2 /H 2 O ratio is 1.0 or much lower, the main phenomenon is water splitting.In this case water is adsorbed on the photocatalyst more efficiently than CO 2 , causing H 2 production and the CH 4 selectivity decrease.The lower CO 2 amount is, the more efficiently CO 2 and H 2 O interact one with another, leading to better catalytic performances.Therefore, an optimum H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio could enhance the CO 2 conversion efficiency."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "Among the TiO 2 crystal structures, anatase seems to be the most advantageous, since the electron-hole recombination is slower in this phase than in rutile and brookite 80.", "context": "Prior to CO 2 photoreduction activity test, a series of preliminary analyses have been conducted in order to verify the quality of our results.Experiments in which the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was performed in the dark with photocatalyst or under irradiation in absence of photocatalyst were carried out and the results show that neither CH 4 nor CO were detected.

Copper does not change the textural features of N promoted TiO 2 photocatalysts: surface area, porous structure and crystalline phase are maintained after CuO addition.The co-catalyst introduction not only preserves N doping effect but, at the same time, significantly improves the catalytic activity reducing electron-hole recombination. Afterwards, it has been investigated the effect of copper amount: this can cause variations in the interactions between dopants, co-catalysts and titania, triggering different photoactivity 92. The copper loading amount (0-0.6 wt.) has been chosen in accordance with Liu et al. 77 and the real Cu content has been determined by means of FAAS analysis.Catalytic results are shown in Figs. 8 and9. The copper amount does not have any effect on catalysts selectivity and, for all samples, methane has been the only product observed.

Any hydrogen consumption ascribable to reduction species in the NT and 0.1CuNT samples has been observed: both in the NT sample, where there is not copper, and in the 0.1CuNT sample, where copper content is too low to be detected, any reduction has occurred. In the TPR profiles of the other samples it is possible to observe a band (hydrogen consumption) located at 200 C approximately, that is ascribable to the reduction of Cu 2 species to Cu 0 .This means that, in all the samples, oxidation state and interaction with titania surface are similar. In order to understand more deeply the catalytic behaviour, DRS analyses have been performed.In Fig. 10 spectra from NT (the sample doped only with nitrogen), 0.6CuNT (that has the highest amount of copper, 0.6 wt.) and 0.2CuNT (that has given the best catalytic performances) have been reported.

Considering crystal properties and crystallite sizes, XRD analyses have been performed.Among the TiO 2 crystal structures, anatase seems to be the most advantageous, since the electron-hole recombination is slower in this phase than in rutile and brookite 80. XRD patterns for the three systems are reported in Fig. 3 and confirm the presence of anatase as the only crystalline TiO 2 phase in all the analyzed systems. On the other hand, the three samples show some differences in terms of anatase crystal size and sample crystallinity.The XRD bands of the reference TiO 2 are much wider than those of the other two samples due to the smaller crystal size.Furthermore, this sample is characterised by the coexistence of anatase phase (35-40 wt.) with a large fraction of amorphous titania 81.This could partially explain the worst catalytic performance of this catalyst compared to NT activity.On the contrary, NT and NaT samples exhibit the typical profile of highly crystalline systems with crystallites size in the range of 8-10 nm.The differences in these two samples found by XRD analyses do not provide a satisfactory explanation for the observed differences in photoactivity.Unfortunately, also XPS spectra do not show any difference between the samples.This means that there are not any species of nitrogen on catalytic surface and any consideration can be made on this matter. In order to shed some light on the catalytic results, the electronic properties of the samples have been investigated by Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS): a detail of the apparent band gap energy has been reported in Fig. 4. Considering the absorption spectra in the region between 300 and 500 nm, it is possible to observe that commercial TiO 2 and NaT provide only a well-defined absorption from 390 nm to lower wavelengths, ascribable to the band gap titania photoexcitation.On the other hand, NT shows another wider and less intense absorption band between 390 and 500 nm (see the inset in Fig. 4).The shift of light absorption covering now also the visible region is associated with the presence of nitrogen in titanium dioxide lattice.As reported by Dozzi et al. 47, nitrogen can either occupy lattice positions or interstitial sites.When nitrogen substitutes oxygen in lattice positions, N 2p states are mixed with O 2p ones and adsorption edge from O 2p p to Ti d xy is replaced by that from N 2p p , which requires a lower energy 82.Nitrogen can occupy also interstitial positions, favouring oxygen vacancies and inducing localized N 2p states within the band gap above the valence band 83: this also causes shift in light adsorption.In particular this band edge effect, the high adsorption in the UV-vis region, could be the reason of the highest activity of the N-doped sample in the carbon dioxide photoreduction. From DRS spectra, band gap values have been calculated: commercial TiO 2 shows a band gap of 3.25 eV while NaT shows a 3.21 eV band gap in accordance with reference works 84.Differently, NT shows a lower band bap of 3.16 eV: this means that energy radiation required for light absorption on NT is slightly lower in comparison with NaT and the commercial sample. From these experimental evidences, we can assume that the role of surface area and crystalline phase are important but not decisive: commercial TiO 2 shows the highest surface area but lower catalytic activity of NT.Only the optimal synergy between texture, crystalline structure and electronic properties provides good catalytic performances; a lead role is played by the electronic state configuration.In particular, in NT, nitrogen introduction modifies titania light absorption and this feature is reflected in its better catalytic performances. In order to provide a further improvement in catalytic performances, CuO has been added to NT systems as a co-catalyst.CuO has been selected because of its several advantages.Copper acts as a trap not only for electrons but also for holes and the energy levels introduced by impurities are near to CB and VB of TiO 2 as well.Therefore, Cu 2 ions presence could be recommended for enhancement of photocatalytic activity 77,85.Moreover, such electron-hole exchange could also occur between CuO and TiO 2 , slowing charges recombination.In this way, the probability of electron transfer to adsorbed CO 2 is increased and then the generation of reactive intermediates such as CO 2 A and HCOO A 57,86 is more probable.Copper does not only possess the required features to improve photoactivity of TiO 2 , but also it is easily available and inexpensive in comparison with noble metals (Au, Pt, Rh..) and it appears an appealing metal dopant.The first investigated system is 0.2CuNT, in which Cu loading is 0.2 wt. (determined by FAAS), in accord with Wu et al. 87. The sample has been calcined at 400 C in order to eliminate all the nitrates species derived from copper precursor.In fact, as shown in TG/DTA analysis (Fig. 5), nitrates decomposition is an exothermic process that occurs between 270 C and 350 C.Moreover, calcination at 400 C is aimed at titania phase transition from amorphous to anatase.This process is represented by an exothermic narrow peak between 350 C and 450 C in DTA curve, without any weight loss. After these preliminary considerations, 0.2CuNT has been tested for CO 2 photoreduction.In Fig. 6 the methane production after 2, 4 and 6 hour of reaction is reported and it has been compared with that obtained with NT sample.It is remarkable that, also in this case, methane is the only detected product for all the catalytic tests. Copper introduction has a beneficial effect on titania performances in CO 2 photoreduction causing an increase of about 40-50 in methane production after 4 and 6 h. As revealed by a preliminary characterization, Cu introduction has almost no influence on the resulting texture (surface area and porosity) of the oxide materials, neither it produces relevant structural differences (only anatase crystal phase has been detected also in the 0.2CuNT sample both by XRD analysis and by HRTEM images).Also the XPS spectra are inconclusive to understand the catalytic behaviour of the samples, since there are no substantial differences and the presence of copper species is not revealed due to its low content in the samples.So it would be definitely important to understand more deeply the role that copper covers on the final catalyst.Also in this case, an important answer to this issue has been given by DRS spectra in Fig. 7. Between 700 and 800 nm (section A), 0.2CuNT exhibits a broad absorption band, that is not present in NT spectrum.This phenomenon is due to the presence of copper and it is related to the photoexcitation of D-electrons from the dopant 88.Since copper oxides conduction band energy are slightly lower than titania (CuO 1.6 eV and Cu 2 O 2.4 eV) 76, excited electron can be transferred from TiO 2 conduction band to Cu oxide one: this phenomenon stabilizes the electron-hole couple and causes the reduction of excited electron-hole recombination 89,90. Focusing on the border region between UV and VIS between 350 and 500 nm (section B), the nitrogen band edge persists also in the CuO-TiO 2 sample it is even more intense.In particular 0.2CuNT has shown a higher absorption in this region than NT sample.Moreover, the apparent band gap energies have been calculated and for 0.2CuNT sample this value corresponds to 3.06 eV, which is smaller than the value of pure anatase titania (3.25 eV) and NT (3.16 eV) 91. Copper does not change the textural features of N promoted TiO 2 photocatalysts: surface area, porous structure and crystalline phase are maintained after CuO addition.The co-catalyst introduction not only preserves N doping effect but, at the same time, significantly improves the catalytic activity reducing electron-hole recombination. Afterwards, it has been investigated the effect of copper amount: this can cause variations in the interactions between dopants, co-catalysts and titania, triggering different photoactivity 92. The copper loading amount (0-0.6 wt.) has been chosen in accordance with Liu et al. 77 and the real Cu content has been determined by means of FAAS analysis.Catalytic results are shown in Figs. 8 and9. The copper amount does not have any effect on catalysts selectivity and, for all samples, methane has been the only product observed. Comparing reactivity results, it is possible to state that copper effect is not pronounced in 0.1CuNT, while the best catalytic results have been achieved with 0.2CuNT.Then this effect decreases with 0.4CuNT until copper becomes detrimental to photoactivity, like the case of 0.6CuNT.This trend in catalytic behaviour has been observed at any of the investigated reaction times, but it is more evident after six hours reactions. In order to explain the catalytic performances of the samples, some characterizations have been performed.Titania structural properties are similar in all these samples, as reported in Table 3: surface area values, from N 2 physisorption, range from 93 to 110 m 2 /g and XRD patterns show that, anatase is the only observed crystal phase with an average crystalline size of 10 nm.These last data are also confirmed by HRTEM analyses: the average particles size has been determined in the range from 12 to 14 nm for all samples.No copper metal nanoparticles have been detected, even in the sample with the highest amount of this metal.Table 3 BET surface areas and average pore diameter for NT and CuNT promoted samples.Therefore attention has been put on the nature of the copper using TPR analysis. Any hydrogen consumption ascribable to reduction species in the NT and 0.1CuNT samples has been observed: both in the NT sample, where there is not copper, and in the 0.1CuNT sample, where copper content is too low to be detected, any reduction has occurred. In the TPR profiles of the other samples it is possible to observe a band (hydrogen consumption) located at 200 C approximately, that is ascribable to the reduction of Cu 2 species to Cu 0 .This means that, in all the samples, oxidation state and interaction with titania surface are similar. In order to understand more deeply the catalytic behaviour, DRS analyses have been performed.In Fig. 10 spectra from NT (the sample doped only with nitrogen), 0.6CuNT (that has the highest amount of copper, 0.6 wt.) and 0.2CuNT (that has given the best catalytic performances) have been reported. By the inspection of the curves, it is possible to single out the following features: i) in the visible region the broad absorption between 600 and 800 nm for both 0.2CuNT and 0.6CuNT samples is ascribable to the presence of copper oxide species: in particular 0.6CuNT absorption is more intense than that of 0.2CuNT: this difference is due to a greater amount of metal 93.ii) in the UV-vis border region, between 390 and 480 nm, all the samples present an intense absorption due to nitrogen doping.As already said, copper introduction does not hinder nitrogen effect on titania's light absorption.Among them, in 0.2CuNT band-edge is the most pronounced.iii) the 0.6CuNT sample presents the worst absorption, indicating a less efficient nitrogen doping effect.This is mainly due to the presence of a great amount of copper which partially covers the titania's surface. These spectral features are in agreement with the band gap results: as a matter of fact, 0.2CuNT provided the lowest band gap (3.06 eV). Moreover, it is known that, when copper is present in great amount, Cu species act like recombination centres for photoinduced electron and hole 94,95. For both these reason there is an optimal balance in copper loading to enhance photoactivity in N doped CuO-TiO 2 photocatalysts 96.For carbon dioxide photoreduction to methane, the best results have been obtained with a sample containing 0.2 wt. of copper. The last part of the work was addressed to the investigation of the relationship between product distribution and CO 2 /H 2 O ratios in the feed stream.In fact, CO 2 and H 2 O molecules might be competitively activated by the charge transfer of titania excited states and the value of CO 2 /H 2 O ratios could influenced the selectivity for the formation of the products 78,97.The results of catalytic tests have been reported in Table 4 and in Fig. 11. The first and most evident consideration is that, decreasing CO 2 / H 2 O ratio, methane has not been the only detected product, but hydrogen has been formed as well.However, methane has been the predominant product: actually, selectivity to CH 4 stretches between 91.3 and 100. Considering methane production only, CO 2 /H 2 O ratio has had an impact definitely.In particular, decreasing CO 2 /H 2 O from 13.3 to 2.0 a continuous improvement has been reached with a peak value of 139.9 nmol CH4 /g cat at CO 2 /H 2 O ratio equal to 2.0.Afterwards, when CO 2 /H 2 O ratio has been further decreased to 1.0, TON has collapsed to 92.2 nmol CH4 /g cat . The bell-shaped trend in methane production might be interpreted remembering the presence of two competitive processes.The first one is the necessity of a mutual interaction between the two reactants on the catalyst's surface in order to reduce CO 2 .When the amount of CO 2 is low, the interactions between the two reactants is more efficient and we obtain the better catalytic performances. On the other hand when the CO 2 /H 2 O ratio is 1.0 or much lower, the main phenomenon is water splitting.In this case water is adsorbed on the photocatalyst more efficiently than CO 2 , causing H 2 production and the CH 4 selectivity decrease.The lower CO 2 amount is, the more efficiently CO 2 and H 2 O interact one with another, leading to better catalytic performances.Therefore, an optimum H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio could enhance the CO 2 conversion efficiency."}, {"llm generation": "titania", "source": "Through a simple and inexpensive synthetic strategy, the catalytic activity of titania has been improved adding a dopant (N) and a co-catalyst (CuO).", "context": "Motivated by the two most challenging issues of our society, namely CO 2 pollution and fossil fuels depletion, this work has investigated the N doped Cu-photocatalysts suitable for carbon dioxide photoreduction with water in gas phase in very mild reaction condition.This technology is potentially a winning solution from both the environmental and the energy-efficiency viewpoints.

All the samples have been prepared by precipitation method maintaining pH constant and equal to 7. In a typical synthesis, a 1.2 M titanyl sulphate solution and a 9.0 M ammonia solution have been added drop wise and simultaneously to 200 mL of distilled water under vigorous stirring, in order to keep the desired pH.In this way the precipitation agent acts as nitrogen source as well.The Ti(OH) 4 suspension has been aged at 60 C for 20 h.Afterwards, the precipitated has been filtered, and washed with distilled water to remove sulphate ions.The absence of sulphates has been verified by means of barium chloride test 73.Wet Ti(OH) 4 has been dried overnight at 110 C and calcined at 400 C for 4 h in air flow.This sample has been labelled NT where N indicates the precipitating agent (ammonia solution) and T stands for titanium dioxide.Nitrogen amount in all the samples is 0.4 wt. as previously reported 32. Different amounts of copper have been introduced by means of incipient wetness impregnation using copper nitrate trihydrated before calcination: the chosen metal amounts are: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 wt. Cu/TiO 2 ratio.The sample obtained are labelled 0.1CuNT, 0.2CuNT, 0.4CuNT and 0.6CuNT respectively: the number represents the wt. amount of metal. Using the same methodology, a nitrogen-free sample has been synthesized using NaOH 9.0 M solution as a precipitation agent.This sample has been labelled NaT, where Na stands for the precipitating agent. Thermal analyses (TG/DTA) were performed on a NETZSCH STA 409 PC/PG instrument in air flux (20 mL/min) using a temperature rate set at 5 C/min in the 25-800 C temperature range. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected employing a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer with a sealed X-ray tube (copper anode; operating conditions, 40 kV and 40 mA) and a Si(Li) solid state detector (Sol-X) set to discriminate the Cu Ka radiation.Apertures of divergence, receiving and detector slits were 2.0 mm, 2.0 mm, and 0.2 mm respectively.Data scans were performed in the 2u range 5-75 with 0.02 stepsize and counting times of 3 s/step.Quantitative phase analysis and crystallite size determination were performed by the Rietveld method as implemented in the TOPAS v.4 program (Bruker AXS) using the fundamental parameters approach for line-profile fitting.The determination of crystallite size was accomplished by the Double-Voigt approach and calculated as volume-weighted mean column heights based on integral breadths of peaks. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at A196 C were performed using a MICROMERITICS ASAP 2000 analyzer in order to obtain information on surface area and pore volume.Prior to N 2 physisorption experiments, all samples were outgassed at 200 C for 2 h.Mesopore volume was measured as the adsorbed amount of N 2 after capillary condensation.Surface area was calculated using the standard BET 74 equation method and pore size distribution was elaborated using the BJH method applied to the isotherms desorption branch 75. The real copper amount of co-doped catalysts was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) after microwave dissolution of the samples using a PerkinElmer Analyst 100.The amount of nitrogen was obtained by elemental analyses with a Carlo Erba CNS Autoanalyser, mod.NA 1500.All analyses were replicated 2-3 times and the precision was 95. TPR experiments were carried out in a lab-made equipment: samples (50 mg) were heated at 10 C/min from 25 C to 800 C in a 5 H 2 /Ar reducing mixture (40 mL/min STP).The effluent gases were analyzed by a Gow-Mac TCD detector using a magnesium perchlorate trap to stop H 2 O. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) of carefully ground powders was performed with a Thermo Scientific Evolution 600 spectrophotometer, equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory Praying-Mantis sampling kit (Harrick Scientific Products, USA).A Spectralon 1 disk was used as reference material.The experimental absorption versus lambda plot was elaborated using the Kubelka-Munk function 76.The band gap energy (E g ) of the catalysts are determined by the intercept of a linear fit to the absorption edge and they can be estimated using the standard equation, which is based on the relationship between frequency (c/ l) and photon energy (E g 1240/l). XPS Surface characterization was performed by means of an XPS instrument (M-Probe-SSI) equipped with a monochromatic Al Ka source (1486.6 eV) with a spot size of 200 A 750 mm and a pass energy of 25 eV, providing a resolution for 0.74 eV.For all the samples, the C1s peak level was taken as internal reference at 284.6 eV.The accuracy of the reported binding energies (BE) can be estimated to be AE0.2 eV.The quantitative data were also accurately checked and reproduced several times and the percentages error is estimated to be AE1 thanks for a severe confidence in spectral decomposition. (High-Resolution) Transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were obtained employing a JEOL JEM 3010UHR (300 kV) TEM, equipped with a single crystal LaB 6 filament and an Oxford INCA Energy TEM 200 energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector.All samples were dry deposited on Cu \"holey\" carbon grids (200 mesh). Carbon dioxide photoreduction reactions have been carried out in a borate glass tubular fixed bed reactor (diameter 4 mm, length 40 mm) using in each test 400 mg of sample, that have been previously pressed, ground and sieved to 50-70 mesh (0.2-0.3 mm).Catalysts have been loaded and left under a 2 mL/min helium flow for 20 h in order to induce the desorption of adsorbed molecules from atmosphere. Samples have been lighted using a 125 W mercury UVA lamp (emission range 315-400 nm has been shielded by a special tubolar quartz, purchased from Helios Italquartz s.r.l., to select the wavelength of 366 nm), with an average irradiance of 50 W/m 2 , controlled with a Delta Ohm HD 2302.0 photo-radiometer and a LP 471 probe.In a preliminary test, it has been carefully considered light absorption provided by the reactor itself.It has been observed that irradiance in front of the reactor is the same as behind it: thus it is possible to state that the reactor walls not adsorb the light. Afterwards, a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and water has flown through the reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller was carried through a water bubbler kept at 40 C to generate CO 2 and H 2 O vapour mixture (13.3CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio).When the system reached the equilibrium state, the reactor was closed and this was taken as the beginning of the reaction.In other terms, the reaction is not performed under a continuous gas flow, but it takes place in static conditions.Within the sealed reactor, there are 9.2 mmol of CO 2 and 0.7 mmol of H 2 O. The reaction has been monitored for 2, 4 and 6 h.Reaction products have been analyzed by a gas chromatograph (HP G1540A) equipped with a Porapak Q column and a TCD detector.Analysis conditions have been carefully tuned in order to deliver a good separation of reagents and products and in all the analyses, reagents and products amount is above detection and quantification limits. Activity results are expressed in turn over numbers (TONs) in nmol CH4 /g cat , as commonly used in literature 77,78. In order to study the reaction conditions the carbon dioxide mass flow has been reduced and the water vapour flow has been preserved.To do so, CO 2 has been diluted with an inert (helium) in order to keep total gas mixture flow constant: in this way, temperature in H 2 O saturator has not been changed.The tested CO 2 /H 2 O ratios have been reported in the chart below."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis region", "source": "In particular this band edge effect, the high adsorption in the UV-vis region, could be the reason of the highest activity of the N-doped sample in the carbon dioxide photoreduction.", "context": "Prior to CO 2 photoreduction activity test, a series of preliminary analyses have been conducted in order to verify the quality of our results.Experiments in which the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was performed in the dark with photocatalyst or under irradiation in absence of photocatalyst were carried out and the results show that neither CH 4 nor CO were detected. Firstly, the effect of nitrogen doping has been investigated.To do so, NT, NaT and the commercial system have been tested for carbon dioxide photoreduction.Productivity after 2, 4 and 6 h reaction has been reported in Figs. 1 and2. Under the selected reaction conditions (13.3 CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio), a complete selectivity to methane and a continuous increase in methane production along with reaction time has been observed for all the samples.Nitrogen affects positively the catalytic behaviour; in fact, NT system provides the best performance comparing to the nitrogen-free (NaT) and the commercial sample.Before considering a comparison of these results with already published works 19, it must be considered that experimental conditions are considerably milder than those from the few literature works where CO 2 photoreduction is performed in gas phase.Thus, a comparison with literature data would make a little sense. With the aim to investigate in depth the catalytic results several characterization techniques have been applied. Surface properties have been investigated by means of nitrogen physisorption and the results are reported in Tables 1 and2. All samples are mesoporous with specific surface area higher than 100 m 2 /g.Generally, a high surface area value is greatly desirable for catalysts because it is associated with a great number of superficial active sites.This enhances substrates adsorption on the catalytic surface 79.For the tested systems, this parameter seems to be significant but not essential to explain the activity results.In fact, commercial TiO 2 shows the highest surface area but not the best catalytic activity. Considering crystal properties and crystallite sizes, XRD analyses have been performed.Among the TiO 2 crystal structures, anatase seems to be the most advantageous, since the electron-hole recombination is slower in this phase than in rutile and brookite 80. XRD patterns for the three systems are reported in Fig. 3 and confirm the presence of anatase as the only crystalline TiO 2 phase in all the analyzed systems. On the other hand, the three samples show some differences in terms of anatase crystal size and sample crystallinity.The XRD bands of the reference TiO 2 are much wider than those of the other two samples due to the smaller crystal size.Furthermore, this sample is characterised by the coexistence of anatase phase (35-40 wt.) with a large fraction of amorphous titania 81.This could partially explain the worst catalytic performance of this catalyst compared to NT activity.On the contrary, NT and NaT samples exhibit the typical profile of highly crystalline systems with crystallites size in the range of 8-10 nm.The differences in these two samples found by XRD analyses do not provide a satisfactory explanation for the observed differences in photoactivity.Unfortunately, also XPS spectra do not show any difference between the samples.This means that there are not any species of nitrogen on catalytic surface and any consideration can be made on this matter. In order to shed some light on the catalytic results, the electronic properties of the samples have been investigated by Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS): a detail of the apparent band gap energy has been reported in Fig. 4. Considering the absorption spectra in the region between 300 and 500 nm, it is possible to observe that commercial TiO 2 and NaT provide only a well-defined absorption from 390 nm to lower wavelengths, ascribable to the band gap titania photoexcitation.On the other hand, NT shows another wider and less intense absorption band between 390 and 500 nm (see the inset in Fig. 4).The shift of light absorption covering now also the visible region is associated with the presence of nitrogen in titanium dioxide lattice.As reported by Dozzi et al. 47, nitrogen can either occupy lattice positions or interstitial sites.When nitrogen substitutes oxygen in lattice positions, N 2p states are mixed with O 2p ones and adsorption edge from O 2p p to Ti d xy is replaced by that from N 2p p , which requires a lower energy 82.Nitrogen can occupy also interstitial positions, favouring oxygen vacancies and inducing localized N 2p states within the band gap above the valence band 83: this also causes shift in light adsorption.In particular this band edge effect, the high adsorption in the UV-vis region, could be the reason of the highest activity of the N-doped sample in the carbon dioxide photoreduction. From DRS spectra, band gap values have been calculated: commercial TiO 2 shows a band gap of 3.25 eV while NaT shows a 3.21 eV band gap in accordance with reference works 84.Differently, NT shows a lower band bap of 3.16 eV: this means that energy radiation required for light absorption on NT is slightly lower in comparison with NaT and the commercial sample. From these experimental evidences, we can assume that the role of surface area and crystalline phase are important but not decisive: commercial TiO 2 shows the highest surface area but lower catalytic activity of NT.Only the optimal synergy between texture, crystalline structure and electronic properties provides good catalytic performances; a lead role is played by the electronic state configuration.In particular, in NT, nitrogen introduction modifies titania light absorption and this feature is reflected in its better catalytic performances. In order to provide a further improvement in catalytic performances, CuO has been added to NT systems as a co-catalyst.CuO has been selected because of its several advantages.Copper acts as a trap not only for electrons but also for holes and the energy levels introduced by impurities are near to CB and VB of TiO 2 as well.Therefore, Cu 2 ions presence could be recommended for enhancement of photocatalytic activity 77,85.Moreover, such electron-hole exchange could also occur between CuO and TiO 2 , slowing charges recombination.In this way, the probability of electron transfer to adsorbed CO 2 is increased and then the generation of reactive intermediates such as CO 2 A and HCOO A 57,86 is more probable.Copper does not only possess the required features to improve photoactivity of TiO 2 , but also it is easily available and inexpensive in comparison with noble metals (Au, Pt, Rh..) and it appears an appealing metal dopant.The first investigated system is 0.2CuNT, in which Cu loading is 0.2 wt. (determined by FAAS), in accord with Wu et al. 87. The sample has been calcined at 400 C in order to eliminate all the nitrates species derived from copper precursor.In fact, as shown in TG/DTA analysis (Fig. 5), nitrates decomposition is an exothermic process that occurs between 270 C and 350 C.Moreover, calcination at 400 C is aimed at titania phase transition from amorphous to anatase.This process is represented by an exothermic narrow peak between 350 C and 450 C in DTA curve, without any weight loss. After these preliminary considerations, 0.2CuNT has been tested for CO 2 photoreduction.In Fig. 6 the methane production after 2, 4 and 6 hour of reaction is reported and it has been compared with that obtained with NT sample.It is remarkable that, also in this case, methane is the only detected product for all the catalytic tests. Copper introduction has a beneficial effect on titania performances in CO 2 photoreduction causing an increase of about 40-50 in methane production after 4 and 6 h. As revealed by a preliminary characterization, Cu introduction has almost no influence on the resulting texture (surface area and porosity) of the oxide materials, neither it produces relevant structural differences (only anatase crystal phase has been detected also in the 0.2CuNT sample both by XRD analysis and by HRTEM images).Also the XPS spectra are inconclusive to understand the catalytic behaviour of the samples, since there are no substantial differences and the presence of copper species is not revealed due to its low content in the samples.So it would be definitely important to understand more deeply the role that copper covers on the final catalyst.Also in this case, an important answer to this issue has been given by DRS spectra in Fig. 7. Between 700 and 800 nm (section A), 0.2CuNT exhibits a broad absorption band, that is not present in NT spectrum.This phenomenon is due to the presence of copper and it is related to the photoexcitation of D-electrons from the dopant 88.Since copper oxides conduction band energy are slightly lower than titania (CuO 1.6 eV and Cu 2 O 2.4 eV) 76, excited electron can be transferred from TiO 2 conduction band to Cu oxide one: this phenomenon stabilizes the electron-hole couple and causes the reduction of excited electron-hole recombination 89,90. Focusing on the border region between UV and VIS between 350 and 500 nm (section B), the nitrogen band edge persists also in the CuO-TiO 2 sample it is even more intense.In particular 0.2CuNT has shown a higher absorption in this region than NT sample.Moreover, the apparent band gap energies have been calculated and for 0.2CuNT sample this value corresponds to 3.06 eV, which is smaller than the value of pure anatase titania (3.25 eV) and NT (3.16 eV) 91. Copper does not change the textural features of N promoted TiO 2 photocatalysts: surface area, porous structure and crystalline phase are maintained after CuO addition.The co-catalyst introduction not only preserves N doping effect but, at the same time, significantly improves the catalytic activity reducing electron-hole recombination. Afterwards, it has been investigated the effect of copper amount: this can cause variations in the interactions between dopants, co-catalysts and titania, triggering different photoactivity 92. The copper loading amount (0-0.6 wt.) has been chosen in accordance with Liu et al. 77 and the real Cu content has been determined by means of FAAS analysis.Catalytic results are shown in Figs. 8 and9. The copper amount does not have any effect on catalysts selectivity and, for all samples, methane has been the only product observed. Comparing reactivity results, it is possible to state that copper effect is not pronounced in 0.1CuNT, while the best catalytic results have been achieved with 0.2CuNT.Then this effect decreases with 0.4CuNT until copper becomes detrimental to photoactivity, like the case of 0.6CuNT.This trend in catalytic behaviour has been observed at any of the investigated reaction times, but it is more evident after six hours reactions. In order to explain the catalytic performances of the samples, some characterizations have been performed.Titania structural properties are similar in all these samples, as reported in Table 3: surface area values, from N 2 physisorption, range from 93 to 110 m 2 /g and XRD patterns show that, anatase is the only observed crystal phase with an average crystalline size of 10 nm.These last data are also confirmed by HRTEM analyses: the average particles size has been determined in the range from 12 to 14 nm for all samples.No copper metal nanoparticles have been detected, even in the sample with the highest amount of this metal.Table 3 BET surface areas and average pore diameter for NT and CuNT promoted samples.Therefore attention has been put on the nature of the copper using TPR analysis. Any hydrogen consumption ascribable to reduction species in the NT and 0.1CuNT samples has been observed: both in the NT sample, where there is not copper, and in the 0.1CuNT sample, where copper content is too low to be detected, any reduction has occurred. In the TPR profiles of the other samples it is possible to observe a band (hydrogen consumption) located at 200 C approximately, that is ascribable to the reduction of Cu 2 species to Cu 0 .This means that, in all the samples, oxidation state and interaction with titania surface are similar. In order to understand more deeply the catalytic behaviour, DRS analyses have been performed.In Fig. 10 spectra from NT (the sample doped only with nitrogen), 0.6CuNT (that has the highest amount of copper, 0.6 wt.) and 0.2CuNT (that has given the best catalytic performances) have been reported. By the inspection of the curves, it is possible to single out the following features: i) in the visible region the broad absorption between 600 and 800 nm for both 0.2CuNT and 0.6CuNT samples is ascribable to the presence of copper oxide species: in particular 0.6CuNT absorption is more intense than that of 0.2CuNT: this difference is due to a greater amount of metal 93.ii) in the UV-vis border region, between 390 and 480 nm, all the samples present an intense absorption due to nitrogen doping.As already said, copper introduction does not hinder nitrogen effect on titania's light absorption.Among them, in 0.2CuNT band-edge is the most pronounced.iii) the 0.6CuNT sample presents the worst absorption, indicating a less efficient nitrogen doping effect.This is mainly due to the presence of a great amount of copper which partially covers the titania's surface. These spectral features are in agreement with the band gap results: as a matter of fact, 0.2CuNT provided the lowest band gap (3.06 eV). Moreover, it is known that, when copper is present in great amount, Cu species act like recombination centres for photoinduced electron and hole 94,95. For both these reason there is an optimal balance in copper loading to enhance photoactivity in N doped CuO-TiO 2 photocatalysts 96.For carbon dioxide photoreduction to methane, the best results have been obtained with a sample containing 0.2 wt. of copper. The last part of the work was addressed to the investigation of the relationship between product distribution and CO 2 /H 2 O ratios in the feed stream.In fact, CO 2 and H 2 O molecules might be competitively activated by the charge transfer of titania excited states and the value of CO 2 /H 2 O ratios could influenced the selectivity for the formation of the products 78,97.The results of catalytic tests have been reported in Table 4 and in Fig. 11. The first and most evident consideration is that, decreasing CO 2 / H 2 O ratio, methane has not been the only detected product, but hydrogen has been formed as well.However, methane has been the predominant product: actually, selectivity to CH 4 stretches between 91.3 and 100. Considering methane production only, CO 2 /H 2 O ratio has had an impact definitely.In particular, decreasing CO 2 /H 2 O from 13.3 to 2.0 a continuous improvement has been reached with a peak value of 139.9 nmol CH4 /g cat at CO 2 /H 2 O ratio equal to 2.0.Afterwards, when CO 2 /H 2 O ratio has been further decreased to 1.0, TON has collapsed to 92.2 nmol CH4 /g cat . The bell-shaped trend in methane production might be interpreted remembering the presence of two competitive processes.The first one is the necessity of a mutual interaction between the two reactants on the catalyst's surface in order to reduce CO 2 .When the amount of CO 2 is low, the interactions between the two reactants is more efficient and we obtain the better catalytic performances. On the other hand when the CO 2 /H 2 O ratio is 1.0 or much lower, the main phenomenon is water splitting.In this case water is adsorbed on the photocatalyst more efficiently than CO 2 , causing H 2 production and the CH 4 selectivity decrease.The lower CO 2 amount is, the more efficiently CO 2 and H 2 O interact one with another, leading to better catalytic performances.Therefore, an optimum H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio could enhance the CO 2 conversion efficiency."}, {"llm generation": "UV, VIS", "source": "Focusing on the border region between UV and VIS between 350 and 500 nm (section B), the nitrogen band edge persists also in the CuO-TiO 2 sample it is even more intense.", "context": "Prior to CO 2 photoreduction activity test, a series of preliminary analyses have been conducted in order to verify the quality of our results.Experiments in which the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was performed in the dark with photocatalyst or under irradiation in absence of photocatalyst were carried out and the results show that neither CH 4 nor CO were detected. Firstly, the effect of nitrogen doping has been investigated.To do so, NT, NaT and the commercial system have been tested for carbon dioxide photoreduction.Productivity after 2, 4 and 6 h reaction has been reported in Figs. 1 and2. Under the selected reaction conditions (13.3 CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio), a complete selectivity to methane and a continuous increase in methane production along with reaction time has been observed for all the samples.Nitrogen affects positively the catalytic behaviour; in fact, NT system provides the best performance comparing to the nitrogen-free (NaT) and the commercial sample.Before considering a comparison of these results with already published works 19, it must be considered that experimental conditions are considerably milder than those from the few literature works where CO 2 photoreduction is performed in gas phase.Thus, a comparison with literature data would make a little sense. With the aim to investigate in depth the catalytic results several characterization techniques have been applied.

TPR experiments were carried out in a lab-made equipment: samples (50 mg) were heated at 10 C/min from 25 C to 800 C in a 5 H 2 /Ar reducing mixture (40 mL/min STP).The effluent gases were analyzed by a Gow-Mac TCD detector using a magnesium perchlorate trap to stop H 2 O. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) of carefully ground powders was performed with a Thermo Scientific Evolution 600 spectrophotometer, equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory Praying-Mantis sampling kit (Harrick Scientific Products, USA).A Spectralon 1 disk was used as reference material.The experimental absorption versus lambda plot was elaborated using the Kubelka-Munk function 76.The band gap energy (E g ) of the catalysts are determined by the intercept of a linear fit to the absorption edge and they can be estimated using the standard equation, which is based on the relationship between frequency (c/ l) and photon energy (E g 1240/l). XPS Surface characterization was performed by means of an XPS instrument (M-Probe-SSI) equipped with a monochromatic Al Ka source (1486.6 eV) with a spot size of 200 A 750 mm and a pass energy of 25 eV, providing a resolution for 0.74 eV.For all the samples, the C1s peak level was taken as internal reference at 284.6 eV.The accuracy of the reported binding energies (BE) can be estimated to be AE0.2 eV.The quantitative data were also accurately checked and reproduced several times and the percentages error is estimated to be AE1 thanks for a severe confidence in spectral decomposition. (High-Resolution) Transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were obtained employing a JEOL JEM 3010UHR (300 kV) TEM, equipped with a single crystal LaB 6 filament and an Oxford INCA Energy TEM 200 energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector.All samples were dry deposited on Cu \"holey\" carbon grids (200 mesh). Carbon dioxide photoreduction reactions have been carried out in a borate glass tubular fixed bed reactor (diameter 4 mm, length 40 mm) using in each test 400 mg of sample, that have been previously pressed, ground and sieved to 50-70 mesh (0.2-0.3 mm).Catalysts have been loaded and left under a 2 mL/min helium flow for 20 h in order to induce the desorption of adsorbed molecules from atmosphere. Samples have been lighted using a 125 W mercury UVA lamp (emission range 315-400 nm has been shielded by a special tubolar quartz, purchased from Helios Italquartz s.r.l., to select the wavelength of 366 nm), with an average irradiance of 50 W/m 2 , controlled with a Delta Ohm HD 2302.0 photo-radiometer and a LP 471 probe.In a preliminary test, it has been carefully considered light absorption provided by the reactor itself.It has been observed that irradiance in front of the reactor is the same as behind it: thus it is possible to state that the reactor walls not adsorb the light. Afterwards, a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and water has flown through the reactor.Compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller was carried through a water bubbler kept at 40 C to generate CO 2 and H 2 O vapour mixture (13.3CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio).When the system reached the equilibrium state, the reactor was closed and this was taken as the beginning of the reaction.In other terms, the reaction is not performed under a continuous gas flow, but it takes place in static conditions.Within the sealed reactor, there are 9.2 mmol of CO 2 and 0.7 mmol of H 2 O. The reaction has been monitored for 2, 4 and 6 h.Reaction products have been analyzed by a gas chromatograph (HP G1540A) equipped with a Porapak Q column and a TCD detector.Analysis conditions have been carefully tuned in order to deliver a good separation of reagents and products and in all the analyses, reagents and products amount is above detection and quantification limits. Activity results are expressed in turn over numbers (TONs) in nmol CH4 /g cat , as commonly used in literature 77,78. In order to study the reaction conditions the carbon dioxide mass flow has been reduced and the water vapour flow has been preserved.To do so, CO 2 has been diluted with an inert (helium) in order to keep total gas mixture flow constant: in this way, temperature in H 2 O saturator has not been changed.The tested CO 2 /H 2 O ratios have been reported in the chart below."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "In this work the performances of N doped CuO-TiO 2 photocatalysts in gas phase CO 2 reduction have been studied.", "context": "Economic development should not be separated from the concept of sustainability.The goal can be pursued by means of technologically advanced materials and processes that enable environmental protection.Carbon dioxide photoreduction using water as reducing agent could be a green and effective way to pursue this aim and titania is a good photocatalyst for this reaction.In this work the performances of N doped CuO-TiO 2 photocatalysts in gas phase CO 2 reduction have been studied.We have focused the attention on both the catalysts design and the process optimization.We have investigated, in particular, the effect of the presence of nitrogen and copper amount on the final catalysts performances.In order to learn high control of the catalytic process and to manage productivity and selectivity, by operating in very mild reaction conditions, the last part of the work has been centered on tuning the process parameters (CO 2 /H 2 O ratio).It has been observed that the CH 4 formation is sensitive to copper amount and that exists a close correlation between the catalytic behavior and the reagents ratio."}, {"llm generation": "gas phase", "source": "Before considering a comparison of these results with already published works 19, it must be considered that experimental conditions are considerably milder than those from the few literature works where CO 2 photoreduction is performed in gas phase.", "context": "Prior to CO 2 photoreduction activity test, a series of preliminary analyses have been conducted in order to verify the quality of our results.Experiments in which the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was performed in the dark with photocatalyst or under irradiation in absence of photocatalyst were carried out and the results show that neither CH 4 nor CO were detected. Firstly, the effect of nitrogen doping has been investigated.To do so, NT, NaT and the commercial system have been tested for carbon dioxide photoreduction.Productivity after 2, 4 and 6 h reaction has been reported in Figs. 1 and2. Under the selected reaction conditions (13.3 CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratio), a complete selectivity to methane and a continuous increase in methane production along with reaction time has been observed for all the samples.Nitrogen affects positively the catalytic behaviour; in fact, NT system provides the best performance comparing to the nitrogen-free (NaT) and the commercial sample.Before considering a comparison of these results with already published works 19, it must be considered that experimental conditions are considerably milder than those from the few literature works where CO 2 photoreduction is performed in gas phase.Thus, a comparison with literature data would make a little sense. With the aim to investigate in depth the catalytic results several characterization techniques have been applied. Surface properties have been investigated by means of nitrogen physisorption and the results are reported in Tables 1 and2. All samples are mesoporous with specific surface area higher than 100 m 2 /g.Generally, a high surface area value is greatly desirable for catalysts because it is associated with a great number of superficial active sites.This enhances substrates adsorption on the catalytic surface 79.For the tested systems, this parameter seems to be significant but not essential to explain the activity results.In fact, commercial TiO 2 shows the highest surface area but not the best catalytic activity. Considering crystal properties and crystallite sizes, XRD analyses have been performed.Among the TiO 2 crystal structures, anatase seems to be the most advantageous, since the electron-hole recombination is slower in this phase than in rutile and brookite 80. XRD patterns for the three systems are reported in Fig. 3 and confirm the presence of anatase as the only crystalline TiO 2 phase in all the analyzed systems. On the other hand, the three samples show some differences in terms of anatase crystal size and sample crystallinity.The XRD bands of the reference TiO 2 are much wider than those of the other two samples due to the smaller crystal size.Furthermore, this sample is characterised by the coexistence of anatase phase (35-40 wt.) with a large fraction of amorphous titania 81.This could partially explain the worst catalytic performance of this catalyst compared to NT activity.On the contrary, NT and NaT samples exhibit the typical profile of highly crystalline systems with crystallites size in the range of 8-10 nm.The differences in these two samples found by XRD analyses do not provide a satisfactory explanation for the observed differences in photoactivity.Unfortunately, also XPS spectra do not show any difference between the samples.This means that there are not any species of nitrogen on catalytic surface and any consideration can be made on this matter. In order to shed some light on the catalytic results, the electronic properties of the samples have been investigated by Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS): a detail of the apparent band gap energy has been reported in Fig. 4. Considering the absorption spectra in the region between 300 and 500 nm, it is possible to observe that commercial TiO 2 and NaT provide only a well-defined absorption from 390 nm to lower wavelengths, ascribable to the band gap titania photoexcitation.On the other hand, NT shows another wider and less intense absorption band between 390 and 500 nm (see the inset in Fig. 4).The shift of light absorption covering now also the visible region is associated with the presence of nitrogen in titanium dioxide lattice.As reported by Dozzi et al. 47, nitrogen can either occupy lattice positions or interstitial sites.When nitrogen substitutes oxygen in lattice positions, N 2p states are mixed with O 2p ones and adsorption edge from O 2p p to Ti d xy is replaced by that from N 2p p , which requires a lower energy 82.Nitrogen can occupy also interstitial positions, favouring oxygen vacancies and inducing localized N 2p states within the band gap above the valence band 83: this also causes shift in light adsorption.In particular this band edge effect, the high adsorption in the UV-vis region, could be the reason of the highest activity of the N-doped sample in the carbon dioxide photoreduction. From DRS spectra, band gap values have been calculated: commercial TiO 2 shows a band gap of 3.25 eV while NaT shows a 3.21 eV band gap in accordance with reference works 84.Differently, NT shows a lower band bap of 3.16 eV: this means that energy radiation required for light absorption on NT is slightly lower in comparison with NaT and the commercial sample. From these experimental evidences, we can assume that the role of surface area and crystalline phase are important but not decisive: commercial TiO 2 shows the highest surface area but lower catalytic activity of NT.Only the optimal synergy between texture, crystalline structure and electronic properties provides good catalytic performances; a lead role is played by the electronic state configuration.In particular, in NT, nitrogen introduction modifies titania light absorption and this feature is reflected in its better catalytic performances. In order to provide a further improvement in catalytic performances, CuO has been added to NT systems as a co-catalyst.CuO has been selected because of its several advantages.Copper acts as a trap not only for electrons but also for holes and the energy levels introduced by impurities are near to CB and VB of TiO 2 as well.Therefore, Cu 2 ions presence could be recommended for enhancement of photocatalytic activity 77,85.Moreover, such electron-hole exchange could also occur between CuO and TiO 2 , slowing charges recombination.In this way, the probability of electron transfer to adsorbed CO 2 is increased and then the generation of reactive intermediates such as CO 2 A and HCOO A 57,86 is more probable.Copper does not only possess the required features to improve photoactivity of TiO 2 , but also it is easily available and inexpensive in comparison with noble metals (Au, Pt, Rh..) and it appears an appealing metal dopant.The first investigated system is 0.2CuNT, in which Cu loading is 0.2 wt. (determined by FAAS), in accord with Wu et al. 87. The sample has been calcined at 400 C in order to eliminate all the nitrates species derived from copper precursor.In fact, as shown in TG/DTA analysis (Fig. 5), nitrates decomposition is an exothermic process that occurs between 270 C and 350 C.Moreover, calcination at 400 C is aimed at titania phase transition from amorphous to anatase.This process is represented by an exothermic narrow peak between 350 C and 450 C in DTA curve, without any weight loss. After these preliminary considerations, 0.2CuNT has been tested for CO 2 photoreduction.In Fig. 6 the methane production after 2, 4 and 6 hour of reaction is reported and it has been compared with that obtained with NT sample.It is remarkable that, also in this case, methane is the only detected product for all the catalytic tests. Copper introduction has a beneficial effect on titania performances in CO 2 photoreduction causing an increase of about 40-50 in methane production after 4 and 6 h. As revealed by a preliminary characterization, Cu introduction has almost no influence on the resulting texture (surface area and porosity) of the oxide materials, neither it produces relevant structural differences (only anatase crystal phase has been detected also in the 0.2CuNT sample both by XRD analysis and by HRTEM images).Also the XPS spectra are inconclusive to understand the catalytic behaviour of the samples, since there are no substantial differences and the presence of copper species is not revealed due to its low content in the samples.So it would be definitely important to understand more deeply the role that copper covers on the final catalyst.Also in this case, an important answer to this issue has been given by DRS spectra in Fig. 7. Between 700 and 800 nm (section A), 0.2CuNT exhibits a broad absorption band, that is not present in NT spectrum.This phenomenon is due to the presence of copper and it is related to the photoexcitation of D-electrons from the dopant 88.Since copper oxides conduction band energy are slightly lower than titania (CuO 1.6 eV and Cu 2 O 2.4 eV) 76, excited electron can be transferred from TiO 2 conduction band to Cu oxide one: this phenomenon stabilizes the electron-hole couple and causes the reduction of excited electron-hole recombination 89,90. Focusing on the border region between UV and VIS between 350 and 500 nm (section B), the nitrogen band edge persists also in the CuO-TiO 2 sample it is even more intense.In particular 0.2CuNT has shown a higher absorption in this region than NT sample.Moreover, the apparent band gap energies have been calculated and for 0.2CuNT sample this value corresponds to 3.06 eV, which is smaller than the value of pure anatase titania (3.25 eV) and NT (3.16 eV) 91. Copper does not change the textural features of N promoted TiO 2 photocatalysts: surface area, porous structure and crystalline phase are maintained after CuO addition.The co-catalyst introduction not only preserves N doping effect but, at the same time, significantly improves the catalytic activity reducing electron-hole recombination. Afterwards, it has been investigated the effect of copper amount: this can cause variations in the interactions between dopants, co-catalysts and titania, triggering different photoactivity 92. The copper loading amount (0-0.6 wt.) has been chosen in accordance with Liu et al. 77 and the real Cu content has been determined by means of FAAS analysis.Catalytic results are shown in Figs. 8 and9. The copper amount does not have any effect on catalysts selectivity and, for all samples, methane has been the only product observed. Comparing reactivity results, it is possible to state that copper effect is not pronounced in 0.1CuNT, while the best catalytic results have been achieved with 0.2CuNT.Then this effect decreases with 0.4CuNT until copper becomes detrimental to photoactivity, like the case of 0.6CuNT.This trend in catalytic behaviour has been observed at any of the investigated reaction times, but it is more evident after six hours reactions. In order to explain the catalytic performances of the samples, some characterizations have been performed.Titania structural properties are similar in all these samples, as reported in Table 3: surface area values, from N 2 physisorption, range from 93 to 110 m 2 /g and XRD patterns show that, anatase is the only observed crystal phase with an average crystalline size of 10 nm.These last data are also confirmed by HRTEM analyses: the average particles size has been determined in the range from 12 to 14 nm for all samples.No copper metal nanoparticles have been detected, even in the sample with the highest amount of this metal.Table 3 BET surface areas and average pore diameter for NT and CuNT promoted samples.Therefore attention has been put on the nature of the copper using TPR analysis. Any hydrogen consumption ascribable to reduction species in the NT and 0.1CuNT samples has been observed: both in the NT sample, where there is not copper, and in the 0.1CuNT sample, where copper content is too low to be detected, any reduction has occurred. In the TPR profiles of the other samples it is possible to observe a band (hydrogen consumption) located at 200 C approximately, that is ascribable to the reduction of Cu 2 species to Cu 0 .This means that, in all the samples, oxidation state and interaction with titania surface are similar. In order to understand more deeply the catalytic behaviour, DRS analyses have been performed.In Fig. 10 spectra from NT (the sample doped only with nitrogen), 0.6CuNT (that has the highest amount of copper, 0.6 wt.) and 0.2CuNT (that has given the best catalytic performances) have been reported. By the inspection of the curves, it is possible to single out the following features: i) in the visible region the broad absorption between 600 and 800 nm for both 0.2CuNT and 0.6CuNT samples is ascribable to the presence of copper oxide species: in particular 0.6CuNT absorption is more intense than that of 0.2CuNT: this difference is due to a greater amount of metal 93.ii) in the UV-vis border region, between 390 and 480 nm, all the samples present an intense absorption due to nitrogen doping.As already said, copper introduction does not hinder nitrogen effect on titania's light absorption.Among them, in 0.2CuNT band-edge is the most pronounced.iii) the 0.6CuNT sample presents the worst absorption, indicating a less efficient nitrogen doping effect.This is mainly due to the presence of a great amount of copper which partially covers the titania's surface. These spectral features are in agreement with the band gap results: as a matter of fact, 0.2CuNT provided the lowest band gap (3.06 eV). Moreover, it is known that, when copper is present in great amount, Cu species act like recombination centres for photoinduced electron and hole 94,95. For both these reason there is an optimal balance in copper loading to enhance photoactivity in N doped CuO-TiO 2 photocatalysts 96.For carbon dioxide photoreduction to methane, the best results have been obtained with a sample containing 0.2 wt. of copper. The last part of the work was addressed to the investigation of the relationship between product distribution and CO 2 /H 2 O ratios in the feed stream.In fact, CO 2 and H 2 O molecules might be competitively activated by the charge transfer of titania excited states and the value of CO 2 /H 2 O ratios could influenced the selectivity for the formation of the products 78,97.The results of catalytic tests have been reported in Table 4 and in Fig. 11. The first and most evident consideration is that, decreasing CO 2 / H 2 O ratio, methane has not been the only detected product, but hydrogen has been formed as well.However, methane has been the predominant product: actually, selectivity to CH 4 stretches between 91.3 and 100. Considering methane production only, CO 2 /H 2 O ratio has had an impact definitely.In particular, decreasing CO 2 /H 2 O from 13.3 to 2.0 a continuous improvement has been reached with a peak value of 139.9 nmol CH4 /g cat at CO 2 /H 2 O ratio equal to 2.0.Afterwards, when CO 2 /H 2 O ratio has been further decreased to 1.0, TON has collapsed to 92.2 nmol CH4 /g cat . The bell-shaped trend in methane production might be interpreted remembering the presence of two competitive processes.The first one is the necessity of a mutual interaction between the two reactants on the catalyst's surface in order to reduce CO 2 .When the amount of CO 2 is low, the interactions between the two reactants is more efficient and we obtain the better catalytic performances. On the other hand when the CO 2 /H 2 O ratio is 1.0 or much lower, the main phenomenon is water splitting.In this case water is adsorbed on the photocatalyst more efficiently than CO 2 , causing H 2 production and the CH 4 selectivity decrease.The lower CO 2 amount is, the more efficiently CO 2 and H 2 O interact one with another, leading to better catalytic performances.Therefore, an optimum H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio could enhance the CO 2 conversion efficiency."}, {"llm generation": "gas phase", "source": "Motivated by the two most challenging issues of our society, namely CO 2 pollution and fossil fuels depletion, this work has investigated the N doped Cu-photocatalysts suitable for carbon dioxide photoreduction with water in gas phase in very mild reaction condition.", "context": "Motivated by the two most challenging issues of our society, namely CO 2 pollution and fossil fuels depletion, this work has investigated the N doped Cu-photocatalysts suitable for carbon dioxide photoreduction with water in gas phase in very mild reaction condition.This technology is potentially a winning solution from both the environmental and the energy-efficiency viewpoints. Through a simple and inexpensive synthetic strategy, the catalytic activity of titania has been improved adding a dopant (N) and a co-catalyst (CuO).In two different ways, both these modifications proved to be effective in upgrading titania catalytic performances.The catalysts selectivity (CH 4 , H 2 ) and productivity can be controlled by tuning conveniently the reactions conditions.In particular, the CO 2 /H 2 O ratio is a crucial parameter. Therefore this work opens the doors to further studies in order to exploit the enormous potentialities of CO 2 photoreduction with water. !

All the samples have been prepared by precipitation method maintaining pH constant and equal to 7. In a typical synthesis, a 1.2 M titanyl sulphate solution and a 9.0 M ammonia solution have been added drop wise and simultaneously to 200 mL of distilled water under vigorous stirring, in order to keep the desired pH.In this way the precipitation agent acts as nitrogen source as well.The Ti(OH) 4 suspension has been aged at 60 C for 20 h.Afterwards, the precipitated has been filtered, and washed with distilled water to remove sulphate ions.The absence of sulphates has been verified by means of barium chloride test 73.Wet Ti(OH) 4 has been dried overnight at 110 C and calcined at 400 C for 4 h in air flow.This sample has been labelled NT where N indicates the precipitating agent (ammonia solution) and T stands for titanium dioxide.Nitrogen amount in all the samples is 0.4 wt. as previously reported 32.
