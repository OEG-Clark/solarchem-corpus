More importantly, the obtained M-BP-OH showed excellent endurability in air and water, which can be attributed to the introduction of hydroxy functional groups during the exfoliation process.Effective and stable photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO are realized under visible light by using M-BP-OH as a main catalyst for the first time. Photocatalytic CO production rate is as high as 112.6 mol h -1 g -1 , thus the theoretical prediction on photocatalytic CO2 reduction ability of BP is experimentally proofed.The M-BP-OH showed an 8.8 times slower decomposition rate in photocatalytic CO2 reduction compared with the M-BP.DFT calculation revealed that the quantum confinement effect results in higher conduction, lower valence band, wider bandgap, and faster charge carrier transfer and the introduction of hydroxyl successfully prevent the monolayer BP from its fast oxidation.These interesting findings demonstrated in this work might provide some guidance for design and synthesis of the next-generation BP-based CO2 conversion photocatalysts or even the BP-based electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysts. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f n a l P r e -p r o o f reaction pathways via DFT means.Fig. 6e displays a possible full CO2 catalytic reduction cycle mechanism, in which two consecutive steps of proton-electron coupling with two intermediates of COOH and CO are involved.As observed Fig. 6e and Fig. S17, both of the formations of COOH and CO were highly endothermic processes, and the formation of COOH intermediate was the rate-limiting step.Interestingly, compared with the bulk BP, the M-BP-OH has a lower formation energy of COOH and CO, indicating that the reaction kinetics have been accelerated.This might be primarily attributed to the M-BP-OH possessing more negative CB position and electrons accumulation that enabled a transfer of mass of electrons to the CO2 to enhance the activation of CO2 molecule, thus reduced the energy barrier.Consequently, both theoretical and experimental results demonstrated that M-BP-OH could act as a metal free photocatalyst for CO2 reduction after enlarging the bandgap and exposing highly catalytically active sites.The stability for CO2 photoreduction of M-BP-OH is demonstrated by cycle experiments as shown in Fig. 6f, in contrast to serious decomposition observed from the M-BP, no distinctive CO production rate of M-BP-OH decrease can be found after 12 successive circulation under visible light irradiation, indicating its excellent durable property.Fig. S18 shows the stability becomes better with the enhancement of -OH concentration.In addition, except for -OH modification, the -NH2 and -F modified monolayer BP also have been conducted by turn the solutions of the exfoliation process.The CO2 reduction activities and stabilities of these different function groups modified BP monolayer sheets are summarized in Fig. 7 and Fig. S19.As observed, the M-BP-OH has the best activity and stability compared with other functional groups modified monolayer BP.The Raman and XRD analyses in Fig. S20 further demonstrate M-BP-OH structure does not show any obvious variation after photoreduction cycle test, certifying its favorable photostability.Meanwhile, Fig. 8a, b, f and g, respectively, Fig. caption Fig. 1.Charge difference of O 2 adsorbed on (a) the M-BP slab and (b) the M-BP-OH slab.The yellow and blue region indicate electron accumulation and depletion, respectively.q stands for total charge of O2.

The monolayer BP was prepared via exfoliation method assisted by liquid nitrogen. As a layered material (Fig. 2a) which was prepared via a phase transformation process, bulk BP was firstly soaked in liquid nitrogen to weaken the interlayer van der Waals force and cause cracks in each layer (Fig. 2b).Subsequently, a traditional liquid exfoliation strategy with isopropanol (IPA) solution (IPA: H2O 1: 1) as a polar solvent was used to treat these crannied BP materials.After ultrasonic processing for 2 h, a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f brown color suspension was obtained (Fig. S4a) and the M-BP-OH yield was 51.It should be noted that these suspensions can maintain stable its brown color, without any change, even stationary at room temperature for 5 days (Fig. S4b).In comparison, the unmodified monolayer BP (M-BP) was prepared by replacing isopropanol solution (IPA: H2O 1: 1) with DMSO in the same conditions.Atomic force microscope (AFM) test in Fig. 2c shows that the thickness of the exfoliated BP sheet is about 0.62 nm, revealing that the exfoliated nanosheets are only one layer.The morphologies of the M-BP-OH were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).As observed in Fig. 2d, the obtained M-BP-OH shows a nearly transparent feature and it is free-standing with a diameter of 1.0 m, which further verified its ultrathin thickness and stability. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images in Fig. 2e shows the distinct fringe of lattice, indicating its high crystallinity.And the fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns illustrate the orthorhombic structure of the BP (Fig. 2f).32 The high quality of M-BP-OH exfoliated from bulk BP was further proved by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and Raman spectrum of freeze-dried M-BP-OH powders.The XRD profile of both bulk BP and M-BP-OH can be well indexed into JCPDS card no.74-1878, confirming the orthorhombic phase of the obtained sample (Fig. 3a).The peaks of bulk BP are sharp and intense, whereas the M-BP-OH powders display a relatively lower XRD intensity, suggesting that crystalline size has been considerably reduced after exfoliation.35 Exceptionally, the intensity of (111) plane in the M-BP-OH XRD pattern exceed that of (004) plane and becomes the strongest diffraction peak, indicating that the crystalline planes along the layer direction have been severely perturbed caused by the weakening of Van-der-Waals forces between layers of BP material.The exclusively observed changes over diffraction peaks of (111) and (004), revealed the monolayer feature of the as-obtained sample.In the Raman spectra (Fig. 3b), three distinct peaks can be observed in the bulk BP sample, one out-of-plane mode at 361 cm -1 (Ag 1 ) and two inplane modes at 438 cm -1 (B2g) and 465 cm -1 (Ag 2 ).Comparing to the bulk BP, the spectrum of M-BP-OH powder shows a little red shift, which are coherent with the literature 29,36.The red-shifted Raman spectra of the M-BP-OH confirm more the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f successful exfoliation of M-BP-OH. To unveil the surface chemical composition and chemical states, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technology was applied.The survey spectra in Fig. 3c show a recognizable positive shift on M-BP-OH compare to the M-BP, the increased chemical state shift can be attributed to the electron-deficient on the surface.In other words, an electron-withdrawing group may have been grafted on the surface of M-BP-OH.The high-resolution P 2p XPS spectra of M-BP and M-BP-OH are compared in Fig. 3d, showing quite similar feature with two intense peaks.The fitted high resolution P 2p XPS spectra of M-BP in Fig. 3e reveal four deconvoluted peaks: P 2p3/2 P-P bond (129.6 eV), P 2p1/2 P-P bond (130.5 eV), P-OP dangling bonding (134.5 eV) and P2O5 (134.3 eV).The high-resolution P 2p XPS spectra of M-BP-OH shows a similar feature to that of M-BP except about 0.3 eV positive shift, and an extra P-O-P bridging bonding (133.3 eV) peak can be observed (Fig. 3f).These detected oxygenated groups in both samples are attributed to the inevitable adsorptions of oxygen and moisture on the sample surface, but the special P-O-P bridging bonding in M-BP-OH confirms the intentional introduction of oxygenated groups.To reveal this inferred oxygenated group, high resolution O 1s XPS spectra was carried out.As shown in Fig. 3g, very different profiles can be seen on the M-BP and M-BP-OH.For M-BP (Fig. 3h), the O 1s XPS spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks: PO bond (531.2eV) and P-O-P bond (532.1 eV), which are similar to the previous literatures 24.In the O 1s XPS spectrum of the M-BP-OH (Fig. 3i), beside the peaks of PO and P-O-P bond, a new peak at 533.0 eV was appeared, which can be assigned to P-OH bond 19,37.The XPS analysis verified that the -OH can be introduced into the M-BP-OH as a functional group to terminate the BP nanosheet edges and maintain its stability. To determine the relative band structure of the samples, the ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and XPS valence band (XPS-VB) spectra of the BP based materials, were carried out.The UPS in Fig. 4 show that the binding energy of the cutoff edge (EC) of bulk BP and M-BP-OH are 17.11 eV and 16.67 eV, respectively. The wavelength of the ultraviolet is 58.13 nm and the kinetic energy (h) is 21.22 eV. The work function () can be estimated by the equation: 21.22-EC.Therefore, the of bulk BP and M-BP-OH are estimated to be respectively 4.11 eV and 4.55 eV.In addition, we calculated the work functions of M-BP-OH with different hydroxyl concentration.As shown in Fig. S5, the work function decreases with the increase of hydroxyl content, which is similar to previous reports 38.According to the XPS-VB (Fig. S6 andS7), the valence band maximum (VBM) of bulk BP and M-BP-OH are estimated to be respectively 0.06 and 0.5 eV below the Fermi level (obtained by linear extrapolation of the leading edge of the XPS-VB spectrum to the extended baseline).Thus, the VBM of bulk BP and M-BP-OH are located at -4.17 eV and -5.05 eV relative to the vacuum level 39.The enlarged bandgap of M-BP-OH was measured via UV-vis absorption spectrum and corresponding Tauc plots.As shown in Fig. S8, both the bulk BP and M-BP-OH exhibit a very broad absorption ability from 200 nm to 800 nm without large differences, except a distinct absorption peak centered at about 590 nm is observed on the latter one, so this further confirmed the few-layer thin characteristic of M-BP-OH.The bandgaps of bulk BP and M-BP-OH estimated from the Tauc plots (Fig. S9) are 0.26 eV and 2.20 eV, one can deduce that the conduction band minimum (CBM) is of bulk BP and M-BP-OH located at -3.91 eV and -2.85 eV, respectively 40,41.A corresponding band structure scheme is shown in Fig. 5, it clearly indicates that the bandgap of BP can be enlarged via this liquid nitrogen assist exfoliation strategy. The enlarged bandgap of M-BP-OH makes it show a great prospect in photocatalysis.In order to evaluate the electron-hole separation efficiency of the asprepared samples, surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPV), photoluminescence (PL) spectra as well as photo-electrochemistry tests were conducted.In SPV spectra (Fig. S10), both the bulk BP and M-BP-OH showed SPV response band in the range of 300-500 nm, owning to the band-to-band transition.It is obvious that the SPV intensity for the M-BP-OH is significantly larger than its bulk matter, which indicated that the photogenerated carriers separation dynamic is much batter in the M-BP-OH.The phase spectra were showed in Fig. S11, as observed, the response region of M-BP-OH is from J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f photoinduced electrons would accumulate at surface of the M-BP-OH.PL spectra in Fig. S12 reveals that the PL intensity of M-BP-OH was weaker than that of bulk BP, thus suggesting that the batter charge separation efficiency over M-BP-OH 5,424344454647. In addition, transient state FL spectra in Fig. S13 also shows that the carrier lifetime have been prolonged after BP that was exfoliated from bulk to monolayer, which is about 1.75 times increment.Fig. S14 displays the transient photocurrent responses plots of bulk BP and M-BP-OH.It's clear that M-BP-OH possesses a stronger response signal as well as a smaller electron resistance than those of bulk BP, which verified that the charge transfer and separation of the M-BP-OH was promoted 484950.Based on all the above results, it can be rational speculated that the as-prepared M-BP-OH may exhibit a recognizable photocatalytic reduction activity. The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared bulk BP and M-BP-OH materials were, for the first time, evaluated by photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light illuminate.As observed in Fig. 6a, the bulk BP displayed moderate activity with a CO production rate of 25.3 mol g -1 h -1 .After exfoliation, the CO production rate of the M-BP-OH reached 112.6 mol g -1 h -1 .Very impressively, the selectivity to CO of the M-BP-OH is very high (90.8)and the apparent quantum efficiency of the M-BP-OH is 0.21 at 400 nm (Fig. S15).Interestingly, M-BP-OH exhibited a superior photocatalytic activity than most reported single photocatalytic systems under similar conditions, even its photocatalytic CO2-to-CO formation rate was comparable to that of 2D g-C3N4 (Fig. 6b andTable S1,).Control experiments in Fig. S16 shows that there was no CO can be produced without photocatalysts or light irradiation or CO2.To verify the origins of the generated CO, we have traced the carbon sources in the reactions using Ar as the reaction gas to replace CO2 (Fig. S16, column 5) and 13 C-labeled isotope experiments (Fig. 6c).There results provide direct evidences that CO2 is the carbon source for production, confirming the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction of the asprepared samples.Note that, a bit of H2 was detected in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process, which is correspondent with the previous reports in which BP J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f showed H2 evolution activities 4,51,52.Although the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is recognized as a competing reaction to the CO2 reduction, the HER rate in our case is much inferior to the CO production rate.The outstanding kinetics of CO2 reduction on monolayer BP should attributed to the band edge positions of VBM of monolayer BP is closer to the redox potentials of photocatalytic CO2 evolution than that of H2 evolution 53.That is why more CO rather than H2 were produced in the presence of CO2.These results underline the wonderful CO2 reduction activity of M-BP-OH, which should be related to the abundant CO2 molecule active sites and excellent carriers mobility in M-BP-OH. molecule on the M-BP-OH, we carried out in-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) to explore the key reaction intermediates in the photo-reduction process.To remove the residual contaminants, the photocatalysts was treated at 120C in vacuum for 2 h.Background was collected in the presence of the prior photocatalysts to the introduction of CO2 in dark.All the in-situ FT-IR spectra presented at Fig. 6d were obtained subtracting the background.As shown in the Fig. 6d, several bands at 1200-1700 cm -1 were observed: peaks at 1213 and 1395 cm -1 is the bicarbonate (HCO3 -) groups, peak at 1287 cm -1 is the monodentate carbonate (m-CO3 2-) groups, peak at 1349 cm -1 is the asymmetric OCO stretches of b-CO3 2-groups and the peak at 1635 and 1453 cm -1 is the bidentate carbonate CO2 -group.All the peaks intensities were enhanced with the extension of irradiation time from 0 to 45 min.Especially, the key intermediates of CO2 2-species at 1635 cm -1 was increases obviously with the reaction time.Meantime, the peak attributed to the HCO3 -and b-CO3 2-species also enhanced markedly.These results suggested that the photogenerated electrons can effectively inject in the adsorbed CO2 molecule to form CO2 -, and then the formed CO2 -would interacts with the surface protons to generate COOH, which is very similar with previous reports that COOH is one of the key intermediate during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. To the purpose of revealing the photocatalytic mechanism, we calculated the present the TEM images of the fresh M-BP, M-BP-OH and those being exposed in humid air (relative humidity 90) for 24 h.After exposure for 24 h, large and dense water droplets were observed on surface of M-BP.In contrast, the M-BP-OH remained J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f almost unchanged after exposure for 24 h.AFM test shows same results as that of TEM (Fig. 8c andh).The stability in air of M-BP and M-BP-OH was further assessed using XPS.After exposure in air conditions for 10 days, 90 of P in the M-BP was oxidized (Fig. 8e) indicating severe instability of M-BP.In comparison, M-BP-OH exposure to air for 30 days was not oxidized (Fig. 8j) compared with fresh M-BP-OH (Fig. 8i).All TEM, AFM and XPS provide direct evidence for the durability of M-BP-OH in air.At the end, experimental results and DFT show that hydroxyl group can occupy the lone pair electrons of P element, which give stability to the monolayer BP."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "Effective and stable photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO are realized under visible light by using M-BP-OH as a main catalyst for the first time.", "context": "In summary, highly stable M-BP-OH nanosheets have been in-situ prepared via a liquid nitrogen assist exfoliation method.Because of the reduction of layer, the bandgap of BP has been intensively extended and the CB band shifted to a more negative position.

Monolayer BP was obtained via a simple and green liquid nitrogen assist exfoliation method which includes the following two steps: first, 150 g bulk BP was soaked in liquid nitrogen for 1 h, then transferring the cryo-pretreated bulk BP materials to a plastic tube.Second, after the residual liquid nitrogen was volatilized, 45 mL isopropanol solution (IPA: H2O 1: 1) was added into the plastic tube, followed by ultrasonication for 2 h.After that, the resultant dispersion was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 3 min.Then, the resulting supernatant was freeze-dried to obtain a brown solid for removal of water and IPA.The brown solids were finally dried overnight at 70 C under vacuum for further removal of water and IPA.The brown solid is identified as hydroxyl modification monolayer BP nanosheets.In comparison, the unmodified monolayer BP was prepared by replacing isopropanol solution (IPA: H2O 1: 1) with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the same conditions.For the sake of convenience, the monolayer hydroxyl modified BP was labeled as M-BP-OH, the unmodified monolayer BP was labeled as M-BP.The hydroxyl concentration within exfoliation monolayer BP by 10, 50 and 100 IPA solvents is 2.4, 3.5 and 4.1, respectively.If there is no special explanation, the M-BP-OH used in this paper is 3.5 hydroxyl concentration within M-BP-OH.The absorbance of exfoliated M-BP-OH was taken at 450 nm to determine J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f exfoliation yield. The calculations were performed by the plane-wave technique implemented in the Vienna ab-initio simulation package 33.A spin-polarized GGA PBE functional 34, all-electron plane-wave basis sets with an energy cutoff of 520 eV, and a projector augmented wave method were adopted.A vacuum spacing of 10 A was considered in the calculation to prevent the interactions between the sheets in adjacent cells.The 22 supercell of BP used by 331 k-points within the Monkhorst-Pack scheme.All the atomic positions were optimized with the converging tolerance of 0.05 eV/A for the force on all atoms and the convergence criteria for energy was 10 -4 eV.The conjugate gradient algorithm was used in the optimization. The free energy change (G) for adsorptions were determined as follows: where Etotal is the total energy for the adsorption state, Esur is the energy of pure surface, EZPE is the zero-point energy change and S is the entropy change. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions were performed in a top-irradiation Pyrex vessel which was connected with an online glass closed gas circulation system (Labsolar-6A, PerfectLight, Beijing, see Fig. S21).Typically, 10 mg of photocatalyst was fully dispersed in 10 ml acetonitrile (MeCN) solution (VH2O:VMeCN 2:3), and 2 mL of sacrificial electron donor triethanolamine (TEOA) was added.15 Then, the Pyrex vessel was sealed on the circulation system, and evacuated to remove all the detectable air gas.After that, High purity CO2 (purity: 99.999) was blowing into the Pyrex vessel carefully.This operation has been repeated three times to ensure the CO2 environment.Before photocatalytic reaction, the pressure of CO2 in the system was adjusted to 0.75 KPa, and the temperature of photocatalytic CO2 reduction was set at 10 C by cooling water circulation system.The incident light was made by a 300 W Xenon lamp (PLS-SXE 300C (BF), PerfectLight, Beijing).A 420 nm cutoff filter was used to remove the ultraviolet light.To determine the source of the carbon in the product, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f isotopic experiments were conducted under the same conditions using 13 CO2 (purity: 99), and the CO evolution was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).Other reaction conditions were the same as those of the typical reaction.The selectivity in CO production was calculated according to the required electrons: selectivity (CO) 2(CO)/2(CO) 2(H2) 100, where (CO) and (H2), represent the yielding rates for (CO) and (H2), respectively.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured under the different light excitation (400, 420, 435 and 450 nm) by the same photocatalytic reaction condition using the following equation: AQE (CO) number of reacted electrons/number of incident electrons 100 number of evolved CO molecules2 / number of incident electrons 100."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid (isopropanol solution)", "source": "Second, after the residual liquid nitrogen was volatilized, 45 mL isopropanol solution (IPA: H2O 1: 1) was added into the plastic tube, followed by ultrasonication for 2 h.", "context": "Bulk black phosphorus (BP) was synthesized via a phase transformation method 32.Typically, tin powder (1,000 mg), iodine (100 mg), and red phosphorus (500 mg) in a silica glass ampoule of 100 mm length, an inner diameter of 8 mm and a wall thickness of 1 mm.The mixture was heated from room temperature to 600C in 7 h, and then kept for 5-10 h at 600C.Finally, sub-4 millimeter-sized bulk BP single crystals were obtained.
