Cobalt telluride with different morphologies was synthesized by using hydrothermal route.In a typical synthesis procedure, 0.102 g (0.1 mmol) of tellurium powder and 0.1903 g (0.1 mmol) of CoCl 2 were dissolved in 8 mL of 6 M KOH solution.Then 2 mL of hydrazine hydrate was added to the above mixture and stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature.The mixture was transferred to 12 mL Teflon-lined autoclave.The autoclave was airtight and retained at 200 C for 3 h in the oven.The autoclave was then cooled at room temperature naturally.The black precipitates were collected and washed for numerous times with deionized water and finally with ethanol.The precipitates were dried in oven at 70 C. The dried CoTe powders were grinded and stored for further characterizations.The same procedure was followed for different reaction time (i.e. 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h), KOH concentrations (i.e. 2 M, 4 M, 6 M, and 8 M) and surfactants (CTAB, ethylene glycol and sodium citrate).The detail of reactions parameters is given in Table 1. The schematic diagram of the photocatalytic system used for CO 2 reduction is shown in Fig. 1.A mixture of CO 2 and water vapors was prepared in a quartz reactor which was attached with the photoreduction system by using high purity CO 2 gas (99.999) and mill-Q water at atmospheric pressure.A positive pressure of 25 kPa for CO 2 gas was maintained in the photoreduction system with assurance of no leakage.Wet CO 2 was permitted to allow for 40 min through the photoreduction system containing photocatalyst (CoTe) in order to complete removal of air from the system which was confirmed by the GC results as well as to confirmed the maximum adsorption of gas molecules on the photocatalyst.A xenon lamp (300 W) furnished with diverse cut-off filters ( 420 nm) was turned on and yield of methane as a function of irradiation time was observed for total time period of 8 h.The distance between the light source and photoreactor was kept 6-7 cm approximately.The reaction temperature of 15 C was maintained by using water recycling system.Agilent 7890 A gas chromatography (GC) was used to analyze the methane gas produced as a result of photoreduction of CO 2 .The GC was furnished with two detectors including flame ionization detectors (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD).A controlled reaction in the absence of light was carried out to ensure that methane was produced from photocatalyst and not from any other surrounding factor. The crystal structure of the samples has been confirmed by Xray diffraction (XRD) analysis using Bruker D8 focus diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu-K radiation.The morphology of synthesized powders has been studied by using Hitachi S4800 FESEM.Lambda 750 UV-Visible spectrophotometer was employed to investigate the optical properties at room temperature with BaSO 4 as a reference.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been employed for the compositional analysis and measurement of valance band positions by using ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer.The specific surface area and pore volume of the synthesized materials was determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis (Micromeritics, tristar II 3020).The photoreduction of CO 2 has been carried out and the products were identified by using 7890A GC/LC system from Agilent Technologies.

Different parameters such as lattice constants (a and c), cell volume (V) and X-ray density ( x ) have been calculated using Eqs. (1)-( 3) and their values are given in Table 2.The results showed that the lattice parameters of samples do not change significantly and exhibit an average value of a 3.88 A and c 5.37 A which is in agreement with the work of Qian et al. 23.Cell volume shows a little increase and X-ray density exhibits a slight decrease with the increase in the KOH concentration.Whereas in case of reaction time, cell volume increases up to reaction duration of 2 h and then decreases.In case of X-ray density inverse trend is observed with slight decrease up to 2 h and then increase is observed up to 4 h of reaction time.It is due to the reason that cell volume is in inverse relation with X-ray density as given in Eq. (3). SEM analysis is used to evaluate the morphology and particle size of all the samples prepared through hydrothermal route.The SEM images of samples synthesized under different conditions such as varying molar concentration of KOH, reaction time and surfactants are displayed in Fig. 3a-j.The effect of concentration of KOH was studied on the particles size and morphology of cobalt telluride nanostructures.It was observed that as the concentration of KOH is increased the particle size and morphology changes a lot as shown in Fig. 3a-d.The increase in particle size is due of agglomeration of nanoparticles which is in accordance with the results of Niasari et al. 24.In case of 2 M KOH (R1), nanosized disks are obtained and as the concentration of KOH is changed from 2 M (R1) to 4 (R2), 6 (R2) and 8 M (R4), the morphology changes from nanobelts to irregular nanoflakes.The different morphologies may be due to growth in various planes such as in 6 (R3) and 8 M (R4) the (2 0 3) plane is more prominent than other two.The sample prepared in more alkaline condition (R4) the (1 0 0) plane is present which may be responsible for the change in morphology.The similar results have also been reported earlier by Larlus et al. 25. The growth process of CoTe nanostructures have been studied systematically by examining the samples at various reaction times via SEM.A series of samples at fixed pH and temperature (200 C) was investigated in the presence of hydrazine hydrate as reducing agent to evaluate the impact of reaction time on the morphologies of CoTe.Fig. 3e demonstrates the presence of CoTe nanospheres with average diameter of 220 nm synthesized in reaction time of 1 h (T1) keeping all other parameters constant.In Fig. 3f, CoTe nanobelts are observed with an average value of 230 nm in thickness, 800 nm in width and few micrometers in length in reaction time of 2 h (T2).The transformation of nanospheres to nanobelts can be attributed to growth in (1 1 2) plane which can be observed in XRD pattern (Fig. 2b).CoTe irregular nano-flakes (Fig. 3g) with average particle size of 240 nm in width and few hundred of nanometers in length are observed with 3 h reaction time (T4).The development of irregular nano-flakes can be attributed to the development in (2 0 1) and (2 0 3) planes which can be confirmed by XRD pattern (Fig. 2b).When reaction time of 4 h was employed (for sample T4), well-defined nano-flakes are obtained with average width of 250 nm and few micrometers in length.The progress of well-defined nano-flakes can be attributed to significant growth in (1 0 1) plane which is expressed in XRD spectra (Fig. 2b).The effects of reaction time on morphology also confirm that as reaction time is increased the particle size increases due to agglomeration of CoTe nanoparticles resulting in the higher particle sizes which is also observed by Zhenhe Xe et al. 26.Different surfactants have been employed to study the effect on morphology of the cobalt telluride.It was observed that no specific morphology is observed as shown in Fig. 3i-k. The optical properties of samples are evaluated by UV-visible studies.The respective results of UV-visible analysis of CoTe synthesized under different conditions such as different KOH concentrations, altering reaction time and employing different surfactants are shown in Fig. 4a-c, respectively.The diffuse reflectance calculations are transformed into the equivalent absorption coefficients using Kubelka-Munk function 27.The band gap values are calculated by Tauc plots which are plotted between ( h ) 2 and photon energy (h ) and are shown in Fig. 4. The band gap value of 2.05 0.01 eV is observed for all the CoTe nanostructures under various conditions.The absorption spectra exhibited two absorption peaks at approximate region of 468 nm and 515 nm.The observed peaks are broader because of band mixing and extreme anisotropy of the CoTe band structure as described by Sathyamoorthy et al. 28.The band gap value suggests that synthesized sample can be used as a photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. The XPS technique is utilized to examine the valance states of the elements, valance band position and surface composition of the synthesized CoTe.The XPS survey spectrum for the CoTe is shown in Fig. 6a which confirms the presence of Co and Te only without presence of any other element except oxygen and carbon which is due to environment.The oxides are possible because of the reaction of surface CoTe nanostructures with the atmospheric oxygen 29.The presence of carbon might be attributed to the sample preparation procedure.The XPS spectrum of CoTe exhibits binding energies at 781.The XPS spectrum for CoTe has been employed to study the valance band edges of the synthesized material as shown in Fig. 6.It is found that value of 0.24 eV is observed as valence band position for the synthesized material against standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) as shown in Fig. 7a.The value of band gap calculated from UV-visible spectroscopy is utilized to determine the conduction band position which is found to be -1.81eV for the synthesized CoTe as shown in Fig. 7b. BET analysis has been used to evaluate the surface area and maximum pore volume of the as synthesized CoTe nanostructures and their results are shown in Table 3.The results show that the BET surface area, Langmuir surface area and pore size increases as the reaction time is increased from 1 h to 4 h.This factor could be explained by the morphology observed by SEM of samples prepared in 1-4 h reaction time.In case of 4 h reaction time (T4), well-developed nanoflakes are responsible for significant increase in the surface area as compared to other nanoparticles, nanobelts and irregular nanoflakes structures prepared 1, 2 and 3 h (T1, T2 and T3), respectively.The BET analyses of samples synthesized by varying molar concentration of KOH have been studied.The results showed that surface area decrease as the concentration of KOH is increased from 2 M to 8 M (samples R1 to R4).The increase in KOH concentration resulted in increase in agglomeration resulting in less surface and less chances of active sites for the adsorption of CO 2 and hence photocatalytic activity decreases.The BET parameters for the samples synthesized by using various surfactants are almost same. The photocatalytic efficiency of samples synthesized under different reaction time and concentration of KOH is evaluated.The photoreduction of CO 2 is carried out by employing CoTe as catalyst under the irradiation of visible light.The photocatalytic efficiency of all the samples is expressed in Fig. 8.The scheme of photoreduction of CO 2 comprised of production of charge carriers as a result of excitation of catalyst on light irradiation 30.The charge carriers are generated when the energy of irradiated photons is greater or equal to the band gap energy of CoTe i.e. 2.05 eV.The photogenerated holes are produced in the valence band and electrons in the conduction band of the CoTe semiconductor.These electrons are responsible for the reduction of CO 2 in the presence of water.In the present work, we have observed methane as a major product and some traces of carbon monoxide are also observed which then consumed in the formation of methane as shown in Eq. (13).It is clear from Fig. 8a and b that the amount of methane produced increase with the increase in irradiation time and maximum value of 4.97 mol g -1 is observed for T4 sample (Fig. 8a).Morphology plays an important role in defining the photocatalytic activity of a material.The results showed that in case of T4, better morphology is observed with greater surface area and well-arranged active sites that provide greater chance for the adsorption of CO 2 and ultimately good photocatalytic activity observed.In case of 1 h reaction time i.e. sample T1, the particles are agglomerated which result in lower photocatalytic activity.In case of nanobelts for 2 h reaction time (T2) with less surface area and irregular nanoflakes with 3 h reaction time (T3) with agglomeration provide less active site for the reaction and are responsible in lowering of photocatalytic activity. As in case of samples synthesized under different concentration (2-8 M) of KOH, the photocatalytic activity decrease with the increase in KOH concentration (Fig. 8b).The maximum photocatalytic activity can be attributed to large surface area and well arranged large number of active site in case of nanodisks synthesized in 2 M KOH (R1) concentration.Whereas, in case of nanobelts, irregular nanoflakes and agglomerated particle synthesized in 4, 6 and 8 M KOH (R2, R3 and R4), respectively have resulted in lowering the photocatalytic activity due to possible decrease in active site and lowering in surface area simultaneously. The production of different hydrocarbons depends upon the band positions of the semiconductors.The conduction band should be more cathodic while the valance band should be more anodic as compared to the standard potential of the product i.e. methane.It is clear from Fig. 6 that the conduction band of CoTe (c.a.-1.80 V vs SHE) is more cathodic while the valance band is more anodic than the reduction potential of CH 4 (i.e.-0.24 V). The proposed mechanism is given in Eqs. ( 6)-( 16) for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into methane.The electron-hole pairs are produced on visible light irradiations (Eq.( 6)).The photogenerated holes in the valence band of CoTe are responsible for the absorption of H 2 O molecules to produce hydroxyl radical ( OH).These hydroxyl radicals are ultimately converted into H and O 2 (Eqs.(7) and ( 8)).The interaction of excited electrons with the H resulted in the production of H radicals (Eq.( 9)).The excited electrons in the conduction band of CoTe are responsible for the synthesis of negative and metastable superoxide ( CO 2 -) radical (Eq.( 10)) by initiating reaction with CO 2 31,32.These metastable 12)-( 14)) are formed 33. In the end, CH 3 reacts with H to end produce CH 4 (Eq.( 15)).The Eqs. ( 6)-( 15) is a proposed mechanism for the production of CH 4 in the presence of CO 2 , H 2 O and CoTe under visible light.The overall reaction for the synthesis of methane by photocatalytic reaction of CO 2 is an eight electron transfer reaction and demonstrated in Eq. (16). CO e - CO - (12) CH 3 H e - CH 4 (15) Now overall reaction can be written as, The amount of methane produced in the present work is compared with the other photocatalysts already reported in the literature and their values are given in Table 4.The most of comparable photocatalysts show activity in the UV region whereas our photocatalyst performs in the visible region with significantly higher yield than most of other single semiconductors."}, {"llm generation": "CoTe nanostructures", "source": "The present material works well under visible irradiation and produced methane with maximum efficiency of 4.97 mol g -1 .", "context": "Hydrothermal route has been employed for the synthesis of CoTe nanostructures with different morphologies by varying reaction time, KOH concentration and surfactants.The XRD analysis confirmed the formation of single phase CoTe nanostructures with crystallite size in range of 13-20 nm.The SEM analysis revealed that CoTe nanostructures are in different morphologies from nanoparticles, nanodisks, nanobelts to regular nanoflakes.The UV-visible spectroscopy exposed that CoTe have band gap value of 2.05 eV calculated via Tauc plot.The results of XPS analysis demonstrate that Co and Te are present in divalent oxidation states of Co (2) and Te (-2) with molar ratio of Co to Te is 1:1.The XPS analysis also employed to determine valence band position.The BET analysis shows maximum value of 53.4599 m 2 /g and 0.005172 cm 2 g -1 for surface area and pore volume for the sample T4, respectively.The present material works well under visible irradiation and produced methane with maximum efficiency of 4.97 mol g -1 .The amount of methane produced in the present work is higher than most of the single semiconductor photocatalysts worked under visible light.
