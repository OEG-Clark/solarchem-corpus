XRD and UV-DRS are typical techniques to study the crystal structure and optical property of nanomaterials 22,23.The XRD patterns of bulk CN, 0.5Pt-CN and 0.5Pt-XB-CN (X 2, 5 and 8) are shown in Fig. 2a.One can see that there is an obvious diffraction peak in all the samples at 2h 27.4,which is attributed to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon 24.It is noticed from the XRD patterns of Pt loaded and boric acid modified catalysts that the characteristic diffraction peaks of Pt and boric acid are not detected, which may be attributed to the very low amount.To investigate the optical behavior of the samples, UV-Vis DRS spectra were recorded.From Fig. 2b, it can be seen that the thresholds of DRS spectra of the CN based samples are about at 460 nm, corresponding to the energy bandgap of 2.7 eV.This demonstrates that the optical absorption is nearly unchanged after decorating Pt and co-modifying Pt and boric acid.This is in consistent with the results of XRD, attributed to the low loading.In this work, TEM and HRTEM were tried to show the improved dispersion of Pt on CN nanosheets via pretreated boric acid.However, it failed to directly observe the loaded Pt and modified boric acid from TEM and HRTEM images, which may due to the low amount and good dispersion.According to atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS, Thermo Elemental SOLAAR-M, limit of identification: 5 lg L -1 ), the content of Pt in 0.5Pt-5B-CN is only 0.03.Obviously, it is lower than the limitation of TEM and XPS. The visible-light activities of CN, 0.5Pt-CN and 0.5Pt-XB-CN (X 2, 5 and 8) were evaluated for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as the reducing agent.As shown in Fig. 3a, compared with bulk CN and 0.5Pt-CN, the co-catalyst free photocatalytic activities of boric acid modified 0.5Pt-CN samples for CO 2 conversion under the visible light irradiation were remarkably enhanced.The photoactivity was promoted along with the increasing amount of boric acid.However, the over amount of boric acid modification is unfavourable to improve the activity, which may be ascribed to the molecular association of boric acid molecules 20,25.The production rate of CO and CH 4 are 4.5 and 1.8 lmol h -1 g -1 , respectively, for the optimized 0.5Pt-5B-CN sample.Meanwhile, O 2 as the oxidative product of water is found to be 5.5 lmol h -1 g -1 for 0.5Pt-5B-CN, which coincides the balance of positive charge (four holes would be consumed to produce one O 2 molecule) and negative charge (two electrons would be consumed to produce one CO molecule and eight electrons would be consumed to produce one CH 4 molecule).Remarkably, the visible-light activity of CO 2 reduction for 0.5Pt-5B-CN exhibited nearly 9-times and 2-times enhancement as compared to those of bulk CN and 0.5Pt-CN, respectively.In addition, as for photocatalytic hydrogen production, the boric acid modified ones also exhibited promoted photoactivities (Fig. 3b).The produced H 2 gas over the optimized 0.5Pt-5B-CN sample is up to 165 lmol h -1 g -1 , which is 10-times and 2-times higher than those of bulk CN and 0.5Pt-CN, respectively. Exploring the photogenerated charge carrier properties of semiconductor solid materials in photocatalysis, particularly for nanosized semiconductors with the negligible built-in electric field is a great challenge, but very meaningful to the photocatalysis.Steady-state surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SS-SPS) as a highly sensitive and direct method is applied to investigate the charge separation 26,27.Generally speaking, according to the fundamental principle of SS-SPS, the strong SS-SPS response frequently corresponds to the high photogenerated charge separation for nanomaterials 28.Based on the response range and the bandgap energy of CN, it is claimed that the SS-SPS responses result from the band-band electron transitions.In Fig. 4a, the SS-SPS response of 0.5Pt-CN and 0.5Pt-XB-CN is higher than that of CN, especially that modified by boric acid, indicating the positive effect of Pt loading and boric acid modification on CN. 0.5Pt-5B-CN displays the highest SPS response, implying the best charge separation, which is in accordance with the photocatalytic activity.In addition, the decreased PL signals after the modification with Pt and boric acid, as is shown in the inset of Fig. 4a, further supports the SS-SPS results on the photophysics. Produced hydroxyl radicals (AOH) during the photocatalytic reaction is related to the separated charge, which can reflect the charge separation in photochemistry.To further investigate the charge separation, coumarin fluorescent method was used to detect the amount of AOH, in which the coumarin reacts with AOH to produce luminescent 7-hydroxycoumarin 29.It is generally accepted that the stronger is the fluorescent signal, the larger is the produced AOH amount.The amounts of produced AOH for CN, 0.5Pt-CN and 0.5Pt-XB-CN samples are shown in Fig. 4b.It is clear that the amount of produced AOH on 0.5Pt-CN is larger than that on CN, and its amount is considerably increased after decorating boric acid.Interestingly, the largest amount of produced AOH is detected for the 0.5Pt-5B-CN nanocomposite, which further proves the enhanced charge separation of CN by loading Pt on boric acid pretreated CN. Furthermore, this boric acid pretreating strategy can be extended to other noble metals such as Au and Ag to increase their dispersion so as to promote the photocatalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 5a, there is unchanged in both the crystal structure and optical properties for 0.5M-5B-CN samples when Au or Ag are loaded, compared with bulk CN. Similar to Pt loading, both Au and Ag loading can also enhance the charge separation of CN to a certain degree.The PL spectra in Fig. 5b further confirm this rule, through the decreased PL signals.Moreover, there is an enhanced charge separation of CN after loading different noble metals and the rules are further verified by the produced AOH radicals, as it is shown in Fig. 5c.In general, the enhanced charge separation leads to the promoted photocatalytic activities.The photocatalytic activities of different samples in Fig. 5d show the consistent rules of Error bar: 5 the charge separation.0.5Pt-5B-CN sample displays the highest activity for CO 2 reduction, which is higher than that of 0.5Au-5B-CN and 0.5Ag-5B-CN sample.

Produced hydroxyl radicals (AOH) during the photocatalytic reaction is related to the separated charge, which can reflect the charge separation in photochemistry.To further investigate the charge separation, coumarin fluorescent method was used to detect the amount of AOH, in which the coumarin reacts with AOH to produce luminescent 7-hydroxycoumarin 29.It is generally accepted that the stronger is the fluorescent signal, the larger is the produced AOH amount.The amounts of produced AOH for CN, 0.5Pt-CN and 0.5Pt-XB-CN samples are shown in Fig. 4b.It is clear that the amount of produced AOH on 0.5Pt-CN is larger than that on CN, and its amount is considerably increased after decorating boric acid.Interestingly, the largest amount of produced AOH is detected for the 0.5Pt-5B-CN nanocomposite, which further proves the enhanced charge separation of CN by loading Pt on boric acid pretreated CN. Furthermore, this boric acid pretreating strategy can be extended to other noble metals such as Au and Ag to increase their dispersion so as to promote the photocatalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 5a, there is unchanged in both the crystal structure and optical properties for 0.5M-5B-CN samples when Au or Ag are loaded, compared with bulk CN. Similar to Pt loading, both Au and Ag loading can also enhance the charge separation of CN to a certain degree.The PL spectra in Fig. 5b further confirm this rule, through the decreased PL signals.Moreover, there is an enhanced charge separation of CN after loading different noble metals and the rules are further verified by the produced AOH radicals, as it is shown in Fig. 5c.In general, the enhanced charge separation leads to the promoted photocatalytic activities.The photocatalytic activities of different samples in Fig. 5d show the consistent rules of Error bar: 5 the charge separation.0.5Pt-5B-CN sample displays the highest activity for CO 2 reduction, which is higher than that of 0.5Au-5B-CN and 0.5Ag-5B-CN sample. Based on these results, it is demonstrated that boric acid modification is available to improve the dispersion of Pt on CN, resulting in the enhanced charge separation and the consequently promoted photocatalytic activities for solar fuel production.A schematic is drawn to illustrate this, which is shown in Fig. 6.The modified boric acid with OH groups causes uniform Pt growth on the surface of CN, and the boric acid molecules can also act as electron acceptors to drive the charge separation.In addition, the excellent catalytic capacity of Pt accelerates the co-catalytic function to the photocatalytic solar fuel production."}, {"llm generation": "Visible light", "source": "As shown in Fig. 3a, compared with bulk CN and 0.5Pt-CN, the co-catalyst free photocatalytic activities of boric acid modified 0.5Pt-CN samples for CO 2 conversion under the visible light irradiation were remarkably enhanced.", "context": "The amount of Pt loading on g-C 3 N 4 is much important for photocatalytic solar fuel production because over-loading leads to aggregation, which is harmful to the activity.In order to confirm the optimal amount of Pt loading, different amounts of Pt were loaded on g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.As shown in Fig. 1, one can see that the photocatalytic activities of g-C 3 N 4 for H 2 production are highly improved after modifying Pt.The sample 0.5Pt-CN showed the highest activity for photocatalytic hydrogen production due to the appropriate amount of Pt loading.Thus, the following experiment the Pt loading amount kept this loading amount.

Exploring the photogenerated charge carrier properties of semiconductor solid materials in photocatalysis, particularly for nanosized semiconductors with the negligible built-in electric field is a great challenge, but very meaningful to the photocatalysis.Steady-state surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SS-SPS) as a highly sensitive and direct method is applied to investigate the charge separation 26,27.Generally speaking, according to the fundamental principle of SS-SPS, the strong SS-SPS response frequently corresponds to the high photogenerated charge separation for nanomaterials 28.Based on the response range and the bandgap energy of CN, it is claimed that the SS-SPS responses result from the band-band electron transitions.In Fig. 4a, the SS-SPS response of 0.5Pt-CN and 0.5Pt-XB-CN is higher than that of CN, especially that modified by boric acid, indicating the positive effect of Pt loading and boric acid modification on CN. 0.5Pt-5B-CN displays the highest SPS response, implying the best charge separation, which is in accordance with the photocatalytic activity.In addition, the decreased PL signals after the modification with Pt and boric acid, as is shown in the inset of Fig. 4a, further supports the SS-SPS results on the photophysics. Produced hydroxyl radicals (AOH) during the photocatalytic reaction is related to the separated charge, which can reflect the charge separation in photochemistry.To further investigate the charge separation, coumarin fluorescent method was used to detect the amount of AOH, in which the coumarin reacts with AOH to produce luminescent 7-hydroxycoumarin 29.It is generally accepted that the stronger is the fluorescent signal, the larger is the produced AOH amount.The amounts of produced AOH for CN, 0.5Pt-CN and 0.5Pt-XB-CN samples are shown in Fig. 4b.It is clear that the amount of produced AOH on 0.5Pt-CN is larger than that on CN, and its amount is considerably increased after decorating boric acid.Interestingly, the largest amount of produced AOH is detected for the 0.5Pt-5B-CN nanocomposite, which further proves the enhanced charge separation of CN by loading Pt on boric acid pretreated CN. Furthermore, this boric acid pretreating strategy can be extended to other noble metals such as Au and Ag to increase their dispersion so as to promote the photocatalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 5a, there is unchanged in both the crystal structure and optical properties for 0.5M-5B-CN samples when Au or Ag are loaded, compared with bulk CN. Similar to Pt loading, both Au and Ag loading can also enhance the charge separation of CN to a certain degree.The PL spectra in Fig. 5b further confirm this rule, through the decreased PL signals.Moreover, there is an enhanced charge separation of CN after loading different noble metals and the rules are further verified by the produced AOH radicals, as it is shown in Fig. 5c.In general, the enhanced charge separation leads to the promoted photocatalytic activities.The photocatalytic activities of different samples in Fig. 5d show the consistent rules of Error bar: 5 the charge separation.0.5Pt-5B-CN sample displays the highest activity for CO 2 reduction, which is higher than that of 0.5Au-5B-CN and 0.5Ag-5B-CN sample. Based on these results, it is demonstrated that boric acid modification is available to improve the dispersion of Pt on CN, resulting in the enhanced charge separation and the consequently promoted photocatalytic activities for solar fuel production.A schematic is drawn to illustrate this, which is shown in Fig. 6.The modified boric acid with OH groups causes uniform Pt growth on the surface of CN, and the boric acid molecules can also act as electron acceptors to drive the charge separation.In addition, the excellent catalytic capacity of Pt accelerates the co-catalytic function to the photocatalytic solar fuel production."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
