Controlled experiments (Fig. S7 ) demonstrated that only trace HCOOH and CH 4 obtained during CO 2 reduction on 2Pt-10INCN without light irradiation or CO 2 , suggesting the CO 2 reduction was mainly driven by photocatalysis.The addition of K 2 Cr 2 O 7 as an electron capture agent resulted in an abrupt decrease in CO 2 conversion efficiency, showing the photoelectrons played a key role in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Meanwhile, it was also found that the HCOOH yield greatly decreased without adding TEOA in the reaction system.TEOA was frequently used as a hole capturing agent in photocatalysis, 44 which could consume photo-induced holes from the photocatalyst through its oxidation (see Scheme S1 ) and thus could inhibit their recombination with photoelectrons.Therefore, TEOA was a necessary sacrice agent in the present photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Under UV light irradiation, the 2Pt-10INCN exhibited higher HCOOH and CH 4 yields than that under visible light irradiation (Fig. S8a ) since the UV light could generate more photoelectrons and holes.Taking into account that the sunlight contained only less than 5 UV lights, we still employed the visible light irradiation for driving the photocatalysis to simulate the natural photosynthesis.The 2Pt-10INCN exhibited extremely high selectivity to HCOOH in photocatalytic CO 2 .Only very little CH 4 could be obtained and no other side-products were detected.With the increase of reaction time to 4 h, the HCOOH yield increased rapidly and an only slight increase in CH 4 yield was observed.However, further increase in the reaction time had no signicant inuence on the CO 2 reduction efficiency (Fig. S8b ), indicating the reaction arrived equilibrium point.So, 4 h was used as the reaction time in the following activity tests.Meanwhile, the increase of CO 2 pressure could also greatly promote photocatalytic CO 2 reduction toward HCOOH (see Fig. S8c ).The HCOOH yield could reach up to 736.3 mmol g A1 h A1 at 4.0 MPa, which represented a high level in CO 2 conversion in photosynthesis.However, the increasing CO 2 pressure resulted in a rapid increase of the CH 4 yield (see Fig. S8d ), the high cost, and the difficult operation.Thus, we employed the normal CO 2 pressure (1 atm) in the following tests to meet the requirement of industrial production. Fig. 5 demonstrated that both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 could be activated by visible lights.Although the In 2 O 3 contained sufficient Lewis acid sites to absorb CO 2 molecules, it showed very low activity due to its high CB potential (A0.62 V vs. NHE) which could not efficiently generate H atoms by photocatalytic water splitting.The g-C 3 N 4 was active to produce H atoms photocatalytic water splitting owing to its low CB potential (A1.1 V vs. NHE).However, its adsorption for CO 2 molecules was very poor due to the lack of active sites together with the low surface area, leading to the poor activity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The INCN exhibited higher activity than either the In 2 O 3 or g-C 3 N 4 owing to the cooperation between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 to adsorb CO 2 molecules and produce H atoms.Meanwhile, the INCN contained narrow energy bandgap owing to the presence of intermediate energy bands and thus could be more easily and effectively activated by visible lights.More importantly, the INCN contained enriched heterojunctions between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , which facilitated the electron transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 to that of In 2 O 3 , leading to the lower photoelectron-hole recombination rate.Although the pure In 2 O 3 exhibited very poor activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the Pt/In 2 O 3 exhibited remarkable enhancement on the activity since the metallic Pt could act as a co-catalyst to produce H atoms by collecting electrons from In 2 O 3 semiconductor and plasma during photocatalytic water splitting. 45More importantly, the Pt/In 2 O 3 displayed much higher selectivity to HCOOH than the pure In 2 O 3 , which could be understood based on a plausible reaction pathway in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Scheme S1 ).The noble-metal Pt was a typical metal catalyst with low work function to activate H atoms while the In 2 O 3 could efficiently adsorb CO 2 molecules owing to the presence of enriched Lewis acid sites. 46,47The Lewis acid sites also enhanced the interaction between Pt and In 2 O 3 , which induced the unique bridged co-adsorption model of the CO 2 molecule on Pt and In 2 O 3 .Such co-adsorbed CO 2 molecules favored the reaction with active H atoms to HCOO, 484950 which was a key intermediate in determining the selectivity to HCOOH. 16Besides, the metallic Pt nanoparticles also promoted the activation of In 2 O 3 by visible lights owing to the plasma effect and facilitated the electron transfer to diminish photoelectron-hole recombination, which could further promote the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Similarly, the Pt/g-C 3 N 4 also exhibited higher activity and selectivity than the g-C 3 N 4 , which could also be explained based on the above discussions.It was noted that the Pt-loading exhibited much weaker promoting effect on the HCOOH production in g-C 3 N 4 than that in In 2 O 3 .A possible reason was that the g-C 3 N 4 could not effectively adsorb CO 2 molecules due to the absence of Lewis acid sites.Although the presence of Pt could greatly enhance the production of H atoms, no enough adsorbed CO 2 molecules could be activated and subsequently reacted with those H atoms.Meanwhile, the Pt/g-C 3 N 4 displayed poor interaction between Pt and g-C 3 N 4 due to the absence of Lewis acid sites, leading to the low number of bridge-coadsorbed CO 2 molecules on both Pt and g-C 3 N 4 , which could account for the lower selectivity to HCOOH in comparison with the Pt/In 2 O 3 . As expected, the Pt-loading onto INCN also greatly enhanced the activity and selectivity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, which could also be accounted by considering various Ptfunctions discussed above.Interestingly, the Pt-INCN exhibited a much stronger promoting effect than either the Pt/In 2 O 3 or Pt/g-C 3 N 4 possibly owing to the enhanced role of heterojunctions.The presence of metallic Pt nanoparticles facilitated By xing the In 2 O 3 -content at 10 wt, the Pt-10INCN exhibited increasing HCOOH yield and CH 4 yield with the increase of Pt-loading up to 2 wt since more Pt nanoparticles would enhance the plasma effect, the activity for activating H atoms and CO 2 molecules, the electron transfer ability to inhibit photoelectron-hole recombination.However, further increase in the Pt-loading caused slight decrease in either the HCOOH yield or the CH 4 yield due to the gathering of Pt nanoparticles to reduce above promoting effects.Besides, the large Pt nanoparticles may also block the pore channels, leading to an abrupt decrease in surface area (see Table S2 The lifetime is also a key parameter to determine the practical application of a photocatalyst.As shown in Fig. 6, both 2Pt-10INCN and 2Pt-In 2 O 3 could be used repetitively for more than 5 times without a signicant decrease in their activities.The slight decrease might be caused by the loss of photocatalysts during separation and wash processes.However, the 2Pt-g-C 3 N 4 showed a rapid decrease in photocatalytic activity during the recycling test.The XRD patterns (Fig. S9"}, {"llm generation": "Pt/In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4", "source": "We developed a Pt/In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 multifunctional catalyst by controlling the assembling method.", "context": "We developed a Pt/In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 multifunctional catalyst by controlling the assembling method.This catalyst exhibited high activity and selectivity to HCOOH during visible-light-driven photocatalytic CO 2 reduction owing to the synergetic effects in producing H atoms via water splitting, adsorbing/activating CO 2 molecules, and inhibiting photoelectron-hole recombination by accelerating electron transfer and forming heterojunctions.Besides, it also displayed a long lifetime owing to the high structural stability and the strong interaction to inhibit Pt leaching.This work supplied a promising way for designing new catalysts with multiple functions for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction at normal pressure and room temperature with a high yield of target products. Structural characteristicsAs shown in Fig.1, the XRD patterns revealed that all the samples were present in well crystalline states of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .The pure g-C 3 N 4 displayed two peaks around 13.1 and 27.4 characteristic of (100) and (002) facets.The In 2 O 3 was present in cubic structure (JCPDS card no.06-0416) with the characteristic peaks at 30 , 35 , 51 , and 60 , corresponding (111), (100), (110), (622) facets, respectively.All the Pt/In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 showed typical peaks indicative of individual In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , indicating no chemical bonding formed between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .No signicant diffraction peaks indicative of Pt were observed in Pt/In 2 O 3 , Pt/g-C 3 N 4 , or Pt-INCN owing to the low Pt-loading with high dispersion of Pt nanoparticles.The SEM and TEM images in Fig. 2 demonstrated that the In 2 O 3 was present in nanosheets with an average length of 1-2 mm and widths of 50-100 nm, while the g-C 3 N 4 was present in a lamina structure with uniform porous structure.The 10INCN composite displayed well dispersion of In 2 O 3 nanosheets onto the g-C 3 N 4 .From 2Pt-10INCN, we could see very tiny Pt nanoparticles uniformly distributed onto the In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 support.Interestingly, most of Pt nanoparticles were deposited onto the In 2 O 3 nanosheets.This could be easily understood since Pt ions would be more easily reduced on the In 2 O 3 than on the g-C 3 N 4 owing to the presence of Lewis acid sites which favored the adsorption of PtCl 6 2A ions.The HRTEM image further conrmed that the Pt nanoparticles were embedded on the interface between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in 2Pt-10INCN.Both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 were present in well-dened crystals, in good accordance with the XRD patterns.The heterojunction was formed between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .The mapping images clari-ed the existence of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in 2Pt-10INCN, together with the uniform distribution of Pt nanoparticles.The actual In 2 O 3 -contents and Pt-loading in the composite photocatalysts were determined by ICP and expressed in mass percentage (Table ).Although the similar pore volume, the In 2 O 3 exhibited higher surface area and bigger pore size than the g-C 3 N 4 owing to the porous structure constructed layer-by-layer from In 2 O 3 nanosheets.The INCN exhibited decreased surface area and pore size due to the incorporation of In 2 O 3 nanosheets into the porous g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the close package of In 2 O 3 nanosheets.The pore volume of INCN greatly increased in comparison with both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , possibly owing to the formation of new micropores during the co-assembling process of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .All the Pt-INCN displayed lower surface area and larger pore size as well as smaller pore volume, suggesting most Pt nanoparticles were embedded into the pore channels constructed layer-by-layer from In 2 O 3 nanosheets.Some micropores were blocked by those Pt nanoparticles, which could account for the increase of average pore size and abrupt decrease of pore volume. C 3 N 4 to In 3 due to the d-p feedback.Meanwhile, all the Pt species on In 2 O 3 , g-C 3 N 4 , and xINCN exhibited two principal peaks around BE of 71.4 eV and 74.5 eV in Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 energy levels (also see Fig. S2 ), indicating they were all present Fig. 1 XRD patterns of pure In 2 O 3 , pure g-C 3 N 4 and their corresponding composites with or without Pt-loading.

In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 could be activated by visible lights.The 5INCN displayed a broader adsorption area with an obvious red-shi in comparison with the pure In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , which could be understood by considering the appearance of some intermediate energy bands owing to the formation of heterojunctions between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .Further increase in the ratio of In 2 O 3 to g-C 3 N 4 (from 5INCN to 20INCN) had no signicant inuence on the light absorbance edge, suggesting no more heterojunctions formed.Meanwhile, both Pt/In 2 O 3 and Pt/g-C 3 N 4 exhibited red-shi comparing to pure In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , obviously owing to plasma effect from Pt nanoparticles, which could also account for the red-shi of light absorbance by loading Pt onto INCN.However, the change of Pt-loading from 1 wt to 2 wt had a very limited effect on the light adsorption edge, suggesting the similar size of Pt nanoparticles, and thus, the increased Ptloading could only enhance the light adsorption intensity.However, 2.5Pt-10INCN displayed a blue-shi of light absorbance wavelength due to the gathering of Pt nanoparticles, which reduced the plasma effect.All the increasing ratio of In 2 O 3 to g-C 3 N 4 had almost on effect on the light absorbance Fig. 3 XPS spectra in (a) C 1s, (b) N 1s, (c) O 1s and (d) In 3d and (e) Pt 4f levels.

Structural characteristicsAs shown in Fig.1, the XRD patterns revealed that all the samples were present in well crystalline states of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .The pure g-C 3 N 4 displayed two peaks around 13.1 and 27.4 characteristic of (100) and (002) facets.The In 2 O 3 was present in cubic structure (JCPDS card no.06-0416) with the characteristic peaks at 30 , 35 , 51 , and 60 , corresponding (111), (100), (110), (622) facets, respectively.All the Pt/In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 showed typical peaks indicative of individual In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , indicating no chemical bonding formed between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .No signicant diffraction peaks indicative of Pt were observed in Pt/In 2 O 3 , Pt/g-C 3 N 4 , or Pt-INCN owing to the low Pt-loading with high dispersion of Pt nanoparticles.The SEM and TEM images in Fig. 2 demonstrated that the In 2 O 3 was present in nanosheets with an average length of 1-2 mm and widths of 50-100 nm, while the g-C 3 N 4 was present in a lamina structure with uniform porous structure.The 10INCN composite displayed well dispersion of In 2 O 3 nanosheets onto the g-C 3 N 4 .From 2Pt-10INCN, we could see very tiny Pt nanoparticles uniformly distributed onto the In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 support.Interestingly, most of Pt nanoparticles were deposited onto the In 2 O 3 nanosheets.This could be easily understood since Pt ions would be more easily reduced on the In 2 O 3 than on the g-C 3 N 4 owing to the presence of Lewis acid sites which favored the adsorption of PtCl 6 2A ions.The HRTEM image further conrmed that the Pt nanoparticles were embedded on the interface between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in 2Pt-10INCN.Both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 were present in well-dened crystals, in good accordance with the XRD patterns.The heterojunction was formed between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .The mapping images clari-ed the existence of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in 2Pt-10INCN, together with the uniform distribution of Pt nanoparticles.The actual In 2 O 3 -contents and Pt-loading in the composite photocatalysts were determined by ICP and expressed in mass percentage (Table ).Although the similar pore volume, the In 2 O 3 exhibited higher surface area and bigger pore size than the g-C 3 N 4 owing to the porous structure constructed layer-by-layer from In 2 O 3 nanosheets.The INCN exhibited decreased surface area and pore size due to the incorporation of In 2 O 3 nanosheets into the porous g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the close package of In 2 O 3 nanosheets.The pore volume of INCN greatly increased in comparison with both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , possibly owing to the formation of new micropores during the co-assembling process of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .All the Pt-INCN displayed lower surface area and larger pore size as well as smaller pore volume, suggesting most Pt nanoparticles were embedded into the pore channels constructed layer-by-layer from In 2 O 3 nanosheets.Some micropores were blocked by those Pt nanoparticles, which could account for the increase of average pore size and abrupt decrease of pore volume.

In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 could be activated by visible lights.The 5INCN displayed a broader adsorption area with an obvious red-shi in comparison with the pure In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , which could be understood by considering the appearance of some intermediate energy bands owing to the formation of heterojunctions between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .Further increase in the ratio of In 2 O 3 to g-C 3 N 4 (from 5INCN to 20INCN) had no signicant inuence on the light absorbance edge, suggesting no more heterojunctions formed.Meanwhile, both Pt/In 2 O 3 and Pt/g-C 3 N 4 exhibited red-shi comparing to pure In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , obviously owing to plasma effect from Pt nanoparticles, which could also account for the red-shi of light absorbance by loading Pt onto INCN.However, the change of Pt-loading from 1 wt to 2 wt had a very limited effect on the light adsorption edge, suggesting the similar size of Pt nanoparticles, and thus, the increased Ptloading could only enhance the light adsorption intensity.However, 2.5Pt-10INCN displayed a blue-shi of light absorbance wavelength due to the gathering of Pt nanoparticles, which reduced the plasma effect.All the increasing ratio of In 2 O 3 to g-C 3 N 4 had almost on effect on the light absorbance Fig. 3 XPS spectra in (a) C 1s, (b) N 1s, (c) O 1s and (d) In 3d and (e) Pt 4f levels.

The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was performed in a self-made 50 mL quartz reactor.Before reaction, 20 mg catalyst was dispersed in 10 mL ultra-pure water under ultrasonication for 30 min.Then, 1 mL TEOA (Aladdin) was introduced as a sacri-cial agent.The suspension was transferred onto a 50 mL quartz reactor with two vents.High purity CO 2 (99.99) was introduced into the reactor and bubbled for 0.5 h to evacuate the air inside the reactor.Then, the reactor was sealed and lled with CO 2 to 1 atm.For each run of reactions, the reaction system was irradiated for 4 h by four 3 W LED lights with the wavelength of 420 nm at a constant temperature of 35 C and stirring rate of 800 rpm.The gas products were analyzed by a gas chromatography equipped by HP-PLOT Q column connected with the FID detector and TDX-01 connected with TCD detector.The liquid products were detected by ion chromatography (Dionex DX-320) with an analytical column (Dionex IonPac AS19-4 mm Analytical Column).S1 ), which generally matched with the theoretical contents in the mother solution.All samples displayed type-IV N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms with a hysteresis loop of type H3 characteristic of porous structure (Fig. S1 ).Based on the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, the surface area, pore size, and pore volume were calculated (Table S2 The XPS spectra in Fig. 3 revealed that all the In species were present in In 3 state, corresponding to the binding energies (BE) of 445.8 eV and 453.4 eV at In 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 levels. 33The negative BE shi suggested the strong interaction between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , in which partial electrons transferred from g- in the metallic state. 34The Pt/In 2 O 3 displayed negative BE shi of Pt and positive BE shi of In 3 , which further conrmed that most Pt nanoparticles deposited onto In 2 O 3 nanosheets, in which partial electrons transferred from In 3 to Pt owing to the strong metal-support interaction, taking into account of the higher electronegativity of Pt (2.28) than that of In 3 (1.78). 32All the O species were present in O 2A state.The peak at 531.4 eV was assigned to lattice-oxygen and the peak at 532.5 eV was ascribed to chemisorbed oxygen. 35Aer Pt-loading, the BE of lattice-oxygen showed a negative shi owing to the acceptance of partial electrons from metallic Pt.Besides, the well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles on the In 2 O 3 surface promoted the chemisorption of oxygen, leading to the enhanced intensity of the peak around 532.5 eV. 36The C species in 10INCN were mainly presented in C-N-C coordination, corresponding to the BE at 288.2 eV in C 1s level.The weak shoulder peak at 284.5 eV was ascribed to the sp 2 C-C bond. 37The N species displayed various states, corresponding to the different binding energies in the N 1s level.The main signal around 398.6 eV corresponded to the N in C-N-C bond, while the shoulder peak at 400.3 eV was ascribed to the N in the N-(C) 3 group. 38No signicant BE shi of either the C or the N was observed, possibly due to the symmetric structure in C-N-C bond."}, {"llm generation": "Four 3 W LED (420 nm)", "source": "Reaction conditions: Four 3 W LED (420 nm), 1 atm CO 2 , 20 mg catalyst, 10 mL H 2 O, 1 mL TEOA, 35 C, 4 h.", "context": "We developed a Pt/In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 multifunctional catalyst by controlling the assembling method.This catalyst exhibited high activity and selectivity to HCOOH during visible-light-driven photocatalytic CO 2 reduction owing to the synergetic effects in producing H atoms via water splitting, adsorbing/activating CO 2 molecules, and inhibiting photoelectron-hole recombination by accelerating electron transfer and forming heterojunctions.Besides, it also displayed a long lifetime owing to the high structural stability and the strong interaction to inhibit Pt leaching.This work supplied a promising way for designing new catalysts with multiple functions for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction at normal pressure and room temperature with a high yield of target products. Structural characteristicsAs shown in Fig.1, the XRD patterns revealed that all the samples were present in well crystalline states of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .The pure g-C 3 N 4 displayed two peaks around 13.1 and 27.4 characteristic of (100) and (002) facets.The In 2 O 3 was present in cubic structure (JCPDS card no.06-0416) with the characteristic peaks at 30 , 35 , 51 , and 60 , corresponding (111), (100), (110), (622) facets, respectively.All the Pt/In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 showed typical peaks indicative of individual In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , indicating no chemical bonding formed between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .No signicant diffraction peaks indicative of Pt were observed in Pt/In 2 O 3 , Pt/g-C 3 N 4 , or Pt-INCN owing to the low Pt-loading with high dispersion of Pt nanoparticles.The SEM and TEM images in Fig. 2 demonstrated that the In 2 O 3 was present in nanosheets with an average length of 1-2 mm and widths of 50-100 nm, while the g-C 3 N 4 was present in a lamina structure with uniform porous structure.The 10INCN composite displayed well dispersion of In 2 O 3 nanosheets onto the g-C 3 N 4 .From 2Pt-10INCN, we could see very tiny Pt nanoparticles uniformly distributed onto the In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 support.Interestingly, most of Pt nanoparticles were deposited onto the In 2 O 3 nanosheets.This could be easily understood since Pt ions would be more easily reduced on the In 2 O 3 than on the g-C 3 N 4 owing to the presence of Lewis acid sites which favored the adsorption of PtCl 6 2A ions.The HRTEM image further conrmed that the Pt nanoparticles were embedded on the interface between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in 2Pt-10INCN.Both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 were present in well-dened crystals, in good accordance with the XRD patterns.The heterojunction was formed between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .The mapping images clari-ed the existence of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in 2Pt-10INCN, together with the uniform distribution of Pt nanoparticles.The actual In 2 O 3 -contents and Pt-loading in the composite photocatalysts were determined by ICP and expressed in mass percentage (Table ).Although the similar pore volume, the In 2 O 3 exhibited higher surface area and bigger pore size than the g-C 3 N 4 owing to the porous structure constructed layer-by-layer from In 2 O 3 nanosheets.The INCN exhibited decreased surface area and pore size due to the incorporation of In 2 O 3 nanosheets into the porous g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the close package of In 2 O 3 nanosheets.The pore volume of INCN greatly increased in comparison with both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , possibly owing to the formation of new micropores during the co-assembling process of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .All the Pt-INCN displayed lower surface area and larger pore size as well as smaller pore volume, suggesting most Pt nanoparticles were embedded into the pore channels constructed layer-by-layer from In 2 O 3 nanosheets.Some micropores were blocked by those Pt nanoparticles, which could account for the increase of average pore size and abrupt decrease of pore volume.

Structural characteristicsAs shown in Fig.1, the XRD patterns revealed that all the samples were present in well crystalline states of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .The pure g-C 3 N 4 displayed two peaks around 13.1 and 27.4 characteristic of (100) and (002) facets.The In 2 O 3 was present in cubic structure (JCPDS card no.06-0416) with the characteristic peaks at 30 , 35 , 51 , and 60 , corresponding (111), (100), (110), (622) facets, respectively.All the Pt/In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 showed typical peaks indicative of individual In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , indicating no chemical bonding formed between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .No signicant diffraction peaks indicative of Pt were observed in Pt/In 2 O 3 , Pt/g-C 3 N 4 , or Pt-INCN owing to the low Pt-loading with high dispersion of Pt nanoparticles.The SEM and TEM images in Fig. 2 demonstrated that the In 2 O 3 was present in nanosheets with an average length of 1-2 mm and widths of 50-100 nm, while the g-C 3 N 4 was present in a lamina structure with uniform porous structure.The 10INCN composite displayed well dispersion of In 2 O 3 nanosheets onto the g-C 3 N 4 .From 2Pt-10INCN, we could see very tiny Pt nanoparticles uniformly distributed onto the In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 support.Interestingly, most of Pt nanoparticles were deposited onto the In 2 O 3 nanosheets.This could be easily understood since Pt ions would be more easily reduced on the In 2 O 3 than on the g-C 3 N 4 owing to the presence of Lewis acid sites which favored the adsorption of PtCl 6 2A ions.The HRTEM image further conrmed that the Pt nanoparticles were embedded on the interface between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in 2Pt-10INCN.Both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 were present in well-dened crystals, in good accordance with the XRD patterns.The heterojunction was formed between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .The mapping images clari-ed the existence of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 in 2Pt-10INCN, together with the uniform distribution of Pt nanoparticles.The actual In 2 O 3 -contents and Pt-loading in the composite photocatalysts were determined by ICP and expressed in mass percentage (Table ).Although the similar pore volume, the In 2 O 3 exhibited higher surface area and bigger pore size than the g-C 3 N 4 owing to the porous structure constructed layer-by-layer from In 2 O 3 nanosheets.The INCN exhibited decreased surface area and pore size due to the incorporation of In 2 O 3 nanosheets into the porous g-C 3 N 4 , leading to the close package of In 2 O 3 nanosheets.The pore volume of INCN greatly increased in comparison with both In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , possibly owing to the formation of new micropores during the co-assembling process of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .All the Pt-INCN displayed lower surface area and larger pore size as well as smaller pore volume, suggesting most Pt nanoparticles were embedded into the pore channels constructed layer-by-layer from In 2 O 3 nanosheets.Some micropores were blocked by those Pt nanoparticles, which could account for the increase of average pore size and abrupt decrease of pore volume.

In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 could be activated by visible lights.The 5INCN displayed a broader adsorption area with an obvious red-shi in comparison with the pure In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , which could be understood by considering the appearance of some intermediate energy bands owing to the formation of heterojunctions between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .Further increase in the ratio of In 2 O 3 to g-C 3 N 4 (from 5INCN to 20INCN) had no signicant inuence on the light absorbance edge, suggesting no more heterojunctions formed.Meanwhile, both Pt/In 2 O 3 and Pt/g-C 3 N 4 exhibited red-shi comparing to pure In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , obviously owing to plasma effect from Pt nanoparticles, which could also account for the red-shi of light absorbance by loading Pt onto INCN.However, the change of Pt-loading from 1 wt to 2 wt had a very limited effect on the light adsorption edge, suggesting the similar size of Pt nanoparticles, and thus, the increased Ptloading could only enhance the light adsorption intensity.However, 2.5Pt-10INCN displayed a blue-shi of light absorbance wavelength due to the gathering of Pt nanoparticles, which reduced the plasma effect.All the increasing ratio of In 2 O 3 to g-C 3 N 4 had almost on effect on the light absorbance Fig. 3 XPS spectra in (a) C 1s, (b) N 1s, (c) O 1s and (d) In 3d and (e) Pt 4f levels.

For preparing In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 , a certain amount of g-C 3 N 4 was dispersed into 20 mL aqueous solution containing a certain amount of urea and was stirred for 2 h at room temperature.Meanwhile, a certain amount of indium nitrate was added to another 20 mL aqueous solution and was stirred until transparent.Then, the solution containing In(NO 3 ) 3 was carefully added into the solution containing g-C 3 N 4 and urea.Aer being stirred for 2 h, the mixed solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teon lined autoclave and kept at 140 C for 16 h.The obtained solid product was washed by water and ethanol, followed by drying at 60 C for 12 h, and nally, calcining at 450 C for 2 h in argon atmosphere.The as-received sample was donated as xINCN, where x refers to the theoretical mass ratio of In 2 O 3 to g-C 3 N 4 , which is adjusted by the added amount of g-C 3 N 4 in mother solution.For comparison, the mechanical mixture of In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 was also prepared and was designated as INCN-mix. The Pt-deposited photocatalysts were prepared by photoreduction of Pt ions.Briey, 100 mg xINCN was dispersed in 10 mL ultra-pure water containing the desired amount of chloroplatinic acid and 1 mL TEOA (Aladdin).Then, the solution was irradiated with LED lamps for 30 min.Aer separation, the solid product was washed thoroughly with H 2 O and ethyl alcohol, followed by drying at 60 C for 8 h.The as-received sample was marked as yPt-xINCN, where y is theoretical mass ratio of Pt to xINCN. The real contents of different components in composites were determined by using Inductive Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometer (ICP, a Jarrel-Asm Atom Scan 2000).The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument in which the specic surface area (S BET ) and pore volume (V P ) were calculated by applying Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) models.X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Ka radiation at a scan rate of 0.02 s A1 .The morphologies were measured on a eld emission scanning electronic micrograph (FESEM, JEOL JSM-6380LV) and transmission electronic micrograph (TEM, JEM-2010).Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was also performed by the JSM.The surface electronic states were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; ULVAC-PHI PHI5000 VersaProbe using Al Ka radiation).UV-Vis diffuse reection spectra (DRS) were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-2450 Spectrophotometer using BaSO 4 as a reference.The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained by a Varian Cary-Eclipse 500 uorometer at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm.Photocurrents were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI660D Instruments) containing a standard three-electrode system in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte.The as-prepared sample was used as a working electrode with an active area of 20 A 20 mm 2 .The sample was prepared by traditional technology.First, 2 mg PVDF was added into 2 mL DMF solution under ultrasonic condition.Then, 20 mg catalyst was added.The suspension was obtained and treated by ultrasound for another 5 min, followed by dropping onto a FTO piece (20 A 20 mm 2 ), vacuum drying at 80 C for 8 h, and calcination at 150 C for 1 h.A Pt piece with an area of 20 A 20 mm 2 was used as a counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode was used as a reference electrode.Each run of the measurements was performed by irradiating with a 300 W Xe lamp for 30 s at an interval of 30 s. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained under the open-circuit potential condition, with an amplitude of 10 mV and frequency span from 10 kHz to 0.01 Hz. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was performed in a self-made 50 mL quartz reactor.Before reaction, 20 mg catalyst was dispersed in 10 mL ultra-pure water under ultrasonication for 30 min.Then, 1 mL TEOA (Aladdin) was introduced as a sacri-cial agent.The suspension was transferred onto a 50 mL quartz reactor with two vents.High purity CO 2 (99.99) was introduced into the reactor and bubbled for 0.5 h to evacuate the air inside the reactor.Then, the reactor was sealed and lled with CO 2 to 1 atm.For each run of reactions, the reaction system was irradiated for 4 h by four 3 W LED lights with the wavelength of 420 nm at a constant temperature of 35 C and stirring rate of 800 rpm.The gas products were analyzed by a gas chromatography equipped by HP-PLOT Q column connected with the FID detector and TDX-01 connected with TCD detector.The liquid products were detected by ion chromatography (Dionex DX-320) with an analytical column (Dionex IonPac AS19-4 mm Analytical Column).S1 ), which generally matched with the theoretical contents in the mother solution.All samples displayed type-IV N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms with a hysteresis loop of type H3 characteristic of porous structure (Fig. S1 ).Based on the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, the surface area, pore size, and pore volume were calculated (Table S2 The XPS spectra in Fig. 3 revealed that all the In species were present in In 3 state, corresponding to the binding energies (BE) of 445.8 eV and 453.4 eV at In 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 levels. 33The negative BE shi suggested the strong interaction between In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , in which partial electrons transferred from g- in the metallic state. 34The Pt/In 2 O 3 displayed negative BE shi of Pt and positive BE shi of In 3 , which further conrmed that most Pt nanoparticles deposited onto In 2 O 3 nanosheets, in which partial electrons transferred from In 3 to Pt owing to the strong metal-support interaction, taking into account of the higher electronegativity of Pt (2.28) than that of In 3 (1.78). 32All the O species were present in O 2A state.The peak at 531.4 eV was assigned to lattice-oxygen and the peak at 532.5 eV was ascribed to chemisorbed oxygen. 35Aer Pt-loading, the BE of lattice-oxygen showed a negative shi owing to the acceptance of partial electrons from metallic Pt.Besides, the well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles on the In 2 O 3 surface promoted the chemisorption of oxygen, leading to the enhanced intensity of the peak around 532.5 eV. 36The C species in 10INCN were mainly presented in C-N-C coordination, corresponding to the BE at 288.2 eV in C 1s level.The weak shoulder peak at 284.5 eV was ascribed to the sp 2 C-C bond. 37The N species displayed various states, corresponding to the different binding energies in the N 1s level.The main signal around 398.6 eV corresponded to the N in C-N-C bond, while the shoulder peak at 400.3 eV was ascribed to the N in the N-(C) 3 group. 38No signicant BE shi of either the C or the N was observed, possibly due to the symmetric structure in C-N-C bond."}]}}
