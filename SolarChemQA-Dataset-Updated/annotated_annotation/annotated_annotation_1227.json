Initially, 0.64 gm PVP was added into 80 ml of ethylene glycol solution and kept for continuous stirring.To prepare Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 , 0.063 gm of AgNO 3 (5 wt of -Ga 2 O 3 ), and 0.152 gm of Cu (NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O (5 wt of -Ga 2 O 3 ) was added to 0.8 gm of -Ga 2 O 3 in an interval of 10 min (as shown in Scheme 1).The as-prepared solution was continuously stirred for two hours at room temperature.As a result, a milky-white solution was obtained, which was further transferred to a solvothermal reactor.The reactor was subjected to 140 C (ramp rate 1 C/minute) for 10 h.A brown-colored solution was collected, once the reactor was cooled to room temperature.The solution was then washed and centrifuged with ethanol and deionized water solution.Finally, the sample was kept in a vacuum drier for 12 h at 100 C. Similar procedure was followed to prepare 2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 and 3Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 , where, the Ag content was 10 wt and 15 wt of -Ga 2 O 3 , respectively. The photo-activity of as-prepared catalysts was tested at ambient conditions to convert CO 2 into fuels by water under irradiation.Firstly, we deposited a thin film of as-synthesized photocatalyst on the concave wall of the reactor, details can be found elsewhere 27.In specific, the reactor was a two-neck round bottom quartz flask of volume 85 ml.The test gas was injected from one end and the product was analyzed from other end.The reactor was leak-free.Here, all the photocatalytic reactions were conducted for 12 h under illumination of a 500 W Xe arc lamp (Sciencetech, Canada).The lamp was stationed about 5.5 cm away from the film of photocatalyst.The reactor was completely covered with aluminum foil.Prior the start of experiment, caution was taken to avoid any oxygen contamination.In doing so, the ultrapure carbon dioxide gas stream was continuously flown through the reactor and valves were repeatedly on/off to vent off any undesired contaminants.Parallely, gases in the reactor was continuously monitored using a Gas Chromatograph (GC) (Centurion Scientific).Once the reactor was found to be oxygen-free, ultrapure carbon dioxide gas was directed through a water bubbler at room temperature.Of course, water bubbler was connected to the reactor and moist carbon dioxide gas was sent to the reactor for 30 min.Here, the flow rate was 5 ml/min, and was controlled by a mass flow controller (Aalborg Instruments, USA).After 30 min of gas supply, all valves were closed and 15 L of Milli-Q water was injected into the reactor.The reactor was further raised to 80 C for 15 min and then, the heater was turned-off to cool down the reactor to room temperature.Importantly, the reactor was then left under dark for 2 h to attain adsorption-desorption equilibrium of moist carbon dioxide gas with the thin film of as-prepared catalyst.Then, the reactor was illuminated and products were tested by GC.The GC is equipped with flame ionized detector, methanizer and thermal conductivity detector.Here, argon gas and molecular sieve was chosen was carrier gas and column material, respectively. To understand the interfacial behavior of the water-rich solution of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) at hydrophilic/hydrophobic surfaces at the molecular level, we considered a fully flexible model for CO 2 and water with TIP4P/2005.We modeled the non-bonded interaction between substrate and fluid by a 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential.Here, we considered graphite (AB stacking) as a substrate.The carbon-carbon non-bonded interaction parameters were taken from the ref.28 with CC 0.34 nm and CC 0.0556 kcal mol -1 .To address the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of a substrate, we varied the interaction strengths between carbon in graphite and oxygen in water ( COw 0.07, 0.105, 0.128, 0.148 kcal mol -1 ) with fixed COw 0.319 nm, 29 resulting different contact angle.Substrate/carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water/ carbon dioxide interaction parameters were computed using the Lorentz-Berthelot arithmetic mixing rules.We considered a long range van der Waals tail correction to the total energy and pressure 30.A particle-particle particle-mesh (PPPM) K-space solver for TIP4P water was used to compute long-range Coulombic interactions with a precision of 10 -4 31.A cut-off distance of 0.85 nm was specified to the shortrange intermolecular potential terms.The bonds and angle of water were reset to the equilibrium length and angular values using the SHAKE algorithm. The model graphitic surface consists of four parallel graphene sheets with interlayer spacing and carbon-carbon bond distances: 0.335 nm and 0.142 nm, respectively.We placed water-CO 2 mixture on both sides of the surface with a box dimension of 5.156 nm 5.112 nm 8.75 nm.The simulation cell contained 66 CO 2 molecules and 6000 water molecules, resulting in a global mole fraction x CO2 0.011.We also performed a bulk simulation of water-rich aqueous CO 2 solution at x CO2 0.011 using 33 CO 2 molecules and 3000 water molecules.To determine to contact angle of water on graphene sheets, we built a surface with box dimensions of 20.168 nm 20.022 nm 20.00 nm and then placed 8000 water molecules on the surface. We carried out the constant volume and temperature (NVT) MD simulation with the different interaction strengths between water and surface to determine the contact angle of water on graphitic sheets.All the simulations were performed at 300 K with 4 ns equilibration and followed by additional 2 ns was used to compute the contact angle of water.The bulk density of aqueous CO 2 solution at x CO2 0.011 was evaluated using an isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble at pressure P 25 atm and temperature T 304 K.We first equilibrated the system for 4 ns and an additional 2 ns production run was used to determine the density of the solution.The microscopic contact angle of a water droplet on a graphitic surface was computed using a graphical binning approach 32 and details were given in ref. 33. We performed the isochoric-isothermal ensemble (NVT) simulation to investigate the interfacial behavior of water-rich aqueous CO 2 solution on hydrophilic/ hydrophobic surfaces.Based on the bulk density at x CO2 0.011, the initial configuration for MD simulations of CO 2 -water mixture is generated by PACKMOL.Each simulation was carried out for 6 ns equilibrium and followed by 4 ns production run was used to analyze the density and orientation distributions. All the simulations were conducted using LAMMPS molecular dynamics Simulator 31.We used an integration time step of 2 fs for all the simulations.The pressure and temperature in the simulation cell was controlled through Nose-Hoover barostat and thermostat with a pressure and temperature damping parameter of 0.1 ps and 1 ps, respectively.The periodic boundary conditions (PBS) were applied in all the three directions and surface atoms were fixed during simulations."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Herein, we inserted Ag and Cu nanoparticles in -Ga 2 O 3 to photo reduce CO 2 by water.", "context": "Plasmonic metals can substantially promote the photo-activity of the conventional photocatalyst.Herein, we inserted Ag and Cu nanoparticles in -Ga 2 O 3 to photo reduce CO 2 by water.The relative content of Ag and Cu governs the photo-activity.2Ag: Cu/ -Ga 2 O 3 exhibits the optimum activity, which was 1.81, 1.57, 1.5 times higher than using pristine -Ga 2 O 3 for CO, H 2 , and CH 4 , respectively.Ag and Cu favored the production of CO and CH 4 , respectively.Bimetals improved the optical and electronic properties and increased the photocurrent responses by 8-folds.In situ DRIFTS for isotopic-labelled 13 CO 2 and ESR spectroscopy provided insight into the charge transfer mechanism and key intermediates.The molecular dynamics simulation indicates that bimetals induced hydrophobicity in -Ga 2 O 3 helped to populate CO 2 molecules near the surface which slowly diffuse along the axial direction.Combining these findings, a plausible mechanism is given which could help in engineering catalysts for other solar energy applications."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Hence, our approach for gas-phase CO 2 photoreduction can be applied for a wide range of plasmonic metal systems; furthermore, can be directly utilized in engineering effective photocatalyst for other solar energy applications.", "context": "In this contribution, we demonstrated the effect of doping two plasmonic co-catalysts (Ag, Cu) into -Ga 2 O 3 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by water.Here, we studied the formation process of catalysts, synthesized in a hydrothermal reactor, to investigate the relative content of copper oxides in the catalysts by extensive characterizations.The combined use of inexpensive metals remarkably reduced the bandgap of pristine -Ga 2 O 3 , increased electron-hole separation and as a result, the photo-activity was enhanced.During the reaction, O 2 was found to replenish oxygen vacancies in the catalyst, a fact experimentally confirmed with measurements of deconvoluted photoluminescence peaks of spent catalysts.The information from in situ DRIFTS analysis with isotopic-labelled 13 CO 2 was imperative in understanding the reaction intermediates and proposing possible pathways for product formation.Additionally, the molecular dynamics simulation, employed to determine the population density of CO 2 near the surface of different hydrophobicity and unveiled interesting insights into the mechanism, which is seemingly new perspective.Hence, our approach for gas-phase CO 2 photoreduction can be applied for a wide range of plasmonic metal systems; furthermore, can be directly utilized in engineering effective photocatalyst for other solar energy applications.
