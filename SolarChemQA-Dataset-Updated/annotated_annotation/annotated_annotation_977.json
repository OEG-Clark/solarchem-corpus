The crystallinity of the CNTs, UIO-66-NH 2 and UIO-66-NH 2 / 2 wt CNTs composites were evaluated by XRD.The XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 1(a), the diffraction peaks of UIO-66-NH 2 were found at 2q values of 7.36 (111), 8.48 (002), 12.04 (022), 17.08 (004), 22.25 (115), 25.68 (224) and 33.12 (137), well agreeing with that of previous reports, all the characteristic peaks are sharp and intensive which implied that the UIO-66-NH 2 had an excellent purity and crystallinity 15,16,27,47.As for the CNTs, the strong and wide diffraction peaks found at 2q values of 26.24 (002) reflected the hexagonal graphite structure and the weak peak at 43.90 (100) associated with graphite, which is corresponded to the MWCNTs 48. In the composites, all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to planes of crystalline phase of UIO-66-NH 2 .There is no apparent characteristic peaks of CNTs in composites which due to its low content and shield with the peaks of UIO-66-NH 2 .It shows the same tendency as other composites which are shown in Fig. S1(a).We also compared the nanocomposites obtained through various synthesis routes.The XRD patterns of UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs samples prepared with hydrothermal method and mechanical method are shown in Fig. S2(a), which illustrates the samples that fabricated through hydrothermal method had a higher purity and crystallinity than the samples prepared with the mechanical method.It is beneficial to enhance the photocatalytic performance.As shown in Fig. 1(b), the pure CNTs exhibited a typical in-phase vibration of the graphite lattice (G band) at 1575 cm A1 and a disorder band owing to the graphite edges (D band) at approximately 1355 cm A1 49,50.The G band results from inplane stretching motion of symmetric sp 2 CeC bonds and the D band appear because of disruption of symmetrical hexagonal graphitic lattice 51.Upon loading UIO-66-NH 2 crystals, it was observed that both G and D bands of composites were broadened.These results showed that there has a strong interaction function between UIO-66-NH 2 and the CNTs during the synthesis process 52.The similar phenomenon can be found in other samples (Fig. S1(b)).Fig. 1(c) shows the pure UIO-66-NH 2 particles, which present a cube structure with severe aggregation.Fig. 1(d) shows the diameter of CNTs is about 20e30 nm.In contrast, as shown in Fig. 1(e), after introducing the CNTs, UIO-66-NH 2 nanoparticles were uniformly grew on its surface.The uniform loading of UIO-66-NH 2 particles may strengthen the multiple reflections between crystals under visible light, which is more favorable to the conduction of electrons and beneficial to promote the photocatalysis reaction process.The SEM image of UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs sample prepared with the mechanical method is shown in Fig. S2(b).It is obvious that the UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs are just a physical mixture, scattering independently in the system and there is no synergistic effect between them. To further analyse the structure of samples, the TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) measurements are carried out.The N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3(c)) of the composite sample is located at 399.2 eV, while no difference has been observed compared with that of UIO-66-NH 2 57, suggesting that the NH 2 groups on the organic linkers can be retained after loaded CNTs.The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the O1s orbital in the UIO-66-NH 2 can be fitted by two peaks at binding energies of around 531.5 and 531.0 eV (Fig. 3(d)), which are attributed to oxygen components on the carboxylate groups of the ATA linkers and the ZreO bonds of UIO-66-NH 2 , respectively 41,47 been replaced by the CNTs.The curves of Zr 3d region (Fig. 3(e)) can be deconvoluted into two peaks for Zr 3d 5/2 and Zr 3d 3/2 located at around 182.6 eV and 185.1 eV respectively, which indicates the existence of Zr 4 58. Fig. 4(a) and (b) shows the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution of the different samples.The materials show type IV isotherms suggested a mesoporous structure of composite materials.The sample of CNTs has the type H 3 hysteresis loop while the others have H 1 hysteresis loop, which is related to a compact structure of aggregated particles with uniform size and high connectivity between pores.The pore size distribution further confirmed that the samples had well-defined mesopores.The mesoporous structure could improve the adsorption capacity and photocatalysis performance because they provide high surface area, homogeneously porous structure and tunable framework 59e61. The unique porous characteristics are favorable for transporting ions and electrons.Therefore, the photocatalytic reactions will be efficiently improved.The N 2 adsorption/ desorption curves and pore size distribution of other samples are shown in Fig. S3(a) and (b). Table 1 summarizes the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the samples.CNTs have a BET surface area of 82.10 m 2 /g, while pure UIO-66-NH 2 exhibited a large surface area of 448.7 m 2 /g.It is found that when the content of CNTs is 2 wt, the specific area of the composite is the highest, as well as the pore volume and average pore size.This inferred that the content of CNTs has an optimal value.The appropriate content of CNTs not only disperse UIO-66-NH 2 , but also increase the surface area, pore volume and average pore size of the composite materials.As increasing the surface area of composites, contact areas between active sites and target substrates are also increased thus causing superior photocatalytic performance.Besides, the studies showed that the increase of surface area could promote the acceptance of electrons and make the photocatalysts have a strong contact with active molecules.Thus the high surface area of composites would be conducive to supplying more reaction sites 62. To provide further investigation, the optical properties of different samples are measured through the UVevis spectra.As Fig. 5(a) shown, there is a slight blue shift in wavelength of absorption peak of composites.This phenomenon is attributed to the fact that UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs are two different organic and inorganic phases.The composite samples possessed an obviously enhanced absorption intensity in the visible light region compared to the sample of UIO-66-NH 2 which is due to presence of black CNTs.The pure UIO-66-NH 2 exhibited a response with a wavelength below 440 nm.The weak absorption of visible light possibly ascribed to the aggregation of UIO-66-NH 2 which is also demonstrated in SEM image mentioned above.The enhanced light harvesting of composites due to the good assembly of UIO-66-NH 2 particles along the surface of CNTs, thus raising the multiple light reflections in the materials.All of the samples show similar light absorbance attributed to their similar structure and based on the UIO-66-NH 2 (Fig. S4).Besides, the higher light absorption capacity of composites than UIO-66-NH 2 corresponding to the color change from greenish-yellow to grayish brown.Furthermore, it is dued to the CNTs could effectively disperse UIO-66-NH 2 and enhance its absorption strength of visible light 63.The FTIR spectra of adsorbents presents three noticeable characteristic bonds, which locates at 1655 cm A1 , 1580 cm A1 and 1400 cm A1 , respectively (see in Fig. 5(b)).These three peaks are attributed to aromatic CC stretching vibration, the vibration of carboxyl groups and CeH deformation vibration from eCH 3 and eCH 2 64.Besides, the spectra of UIO-66-NH 2 also shows the typical peaks of NeH stretching at 1260 cm A1 and 788 cm A1 , demonstrating the existence of eNH 2 group 65.After combining the UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs, the peak at 1655 cm A1 has a noticeable change, portending the p-p interactions between them 66.Comparing with the pure UIO-66-NH 2 , the spectra of composites is relatively unchanged, while the strength of the peak decreased.There are some small changes in the composites, this is dued to the introduction of functional groups that are brought with the surface of CNTs, moreover, carboxyl coordinated with metal ion altered the chemical circumstance of the ligand slightly 67. The photocatalytic activities of various photocatalysts were evaluated under visible light illumination displayed in Fig. 6.In Fig. 6(a), it is evident that photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction increased firstly and then decreased while the generation of hydrogen shows the opposite trend.When the loading amount of CNTs is 2 wt, the reduction of CO 2 reaches a maximum of 28.8 mmol while the H 2 generation shows a minimal amount of 2.0 mmol.The reduction of CO 2 and evolution of hydrogen are two electrons reaction process.They compete for the electrons in the photocatalytic system at the same time.The detailed data are shown in Table 2, all nanocomposites exhibit superior photocatalytic performance compared to the pure UIO-66-NH 2 which presents the synergistic effect of CNTs in these samples and the fact that CNTs improve the activity and selectivity of photocatalysts.With massive loading content of CNTs, the photocatalytic performance decrease, this is due to the fact that photons are further absorbed and scattered in the existence of CNTs.Besides, the excessive CNTs can play as a kind of recombination center instead of supplying an electron pathway. Furthermore, we pursued selectivity of HCOOH changes.From Fig. 6(b), when the CNTs loading content changes from 0 to 2 wt, the yield of HCOOH changes from 1.84 mmol to 18.2 mmol and the selectivity changes from 38.3 to 63.1.When the CNTs loading content continues to increase from 2 wt to 5 wt, the yield of HCOOH has a gradual downward trend, while the selectivity also decreased.When the loading content of CNTs is 2 wt, the yield of HCOOH and the selectivity reached a maximum value of 63.1.The selectivity is almost 2 times higher than the pure UIO-66-NH 2 .The improved selectivity is dued to the absence of eNH 2 , the physical adsorption sites and chemical reaction adsorption sites increased, the absorption reaction between CO 2 and eNH 2 enhanced the adsorption capacity of CO 2 significantly, therefore improve the selectivity of HCOOH.This has also been demonstrated by previous reports 68.In addition, we obtained composite samples through mechanical mixing method and thus demonstrated the advantages of hydrothermal synthesis (Table S1). As listed in Table S1, the UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs sample was fabricated through hydrothermal method and exhibited higher HCOOH evolution amount (28.8 mmol), which is 2.1 times higher than the mechanical mixing sample (13.6 mmol).The selectivity of HCOOH is also nearly 2 times higher than the mechanical mixing sample.The hydrothermal process induced shaping UIO-66-NH 2 crystals on the surface of CNTs, increased its dispersibility and strengthened the contact between the UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs.These merits supplied a short pathway for charge transfer and low charge transfer resistance during the photocatalysis process. Most studies showed there exist two reaction pathways in the process of reducing CO 2 , hydrogenation and deoxygenation of CO 2 .On the basis of our experiments, we propose the photoreduction of CO 2 with water over UIO-66-NH 2 /CNTs occurs via hydrogenation reactions, because the HCOOH is finally observed which consistent with previous reports 69.The proposed reaction pathways are as following equations ((1)e( 6)), which is similar to the relevant studies 70.The represents absorbed species, hv indicates a photon under visible light.Under illumination, the UIO-66-NH 2 produced photogenerated electron (e A )-hole (h )pairs.The holes will react with water molecules, forming OH and H intermediates.Then the H react with the electrons and generate the H 2 .The generation of HCOOH is based on a fast hydrogenation process of CO 2 on the interface of UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs.With the H intermediates, the HCOOH forms mainly because it is two electrons reaction process, easily than generates the other products, such as CH 4 , CH 3 OH.Besides, in this photocatalytic reaction system, the TEOA was used as sacrifice agent.According to previous reports, TEOA can also facilitate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction because of its more basic nature, the presence of TEOA supports the hydrogenation of CO 2 to formate 71.Effective hydrogen transfer catalysts should also be effective in the reduction of CO 2 and therefore inhibit the production of hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 6(c), after six cycles of CO 2 photoreduction under visible light irradiation, the reduction of CO 2 was well maintained.This indicated the activity of composites kept relatively stable.These results indicated that the photocatalyst prepared with hydrothermal method has higher chemical stability to reduce CO 2 at ambiance conditions.The morphology of photocatalyst and valence state of the elements after the reusability test show no clearly change, as shown in Fig. S5, the numerous UIO-66-NH 2 particles are deposited on the surface of CNTs, this demonstrates the stability of composites.As for the XPS, The survey spectrum (Fig. S6 The charge transfer properties are further demonstrated by a series of measurements.As shown in Fig. 7(a), the photocurrent responses of different samples were measured under visible-light (l 400 nm) irradiation at a constant potential of 0.5 V (vs.SCE).The UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs composite possesses enhanced light currents, indicating that the composite photocatalyst can utilize more photoinduced electrons, thus exhibiting superior CO 2 photoreduction activity.It was superior than the UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs sample obtained through the mechanical mixing method (Fig. S7(a)).These i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y x x x ( x x x x ) x x x results demonstrated that the hydrothermal method induced the samples display a higher photocurrent intensity, which indicated a strong visible-light absorption capability and low rate of recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.To get a deeper understanding of the changes in the conductivity of different samples, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in Fig. 7(b).Electrical equivalent circuits are determined to explain charge transfer processes occurring in the photocatalysis system, the sample of UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs exhibited a smaller capacitance arc than the pure UIO-66-NH 2 , implying that the introduction of CNTs could enhance the electron mobility by reducing the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of UIO-66-NH 2 , improve the conductivity of the materials and reduce the compound rate of the photovoltaic carrier.It was also smaller than the mechanical mixing sample (Fig. S7(b)), the advantages of hydrothermal synthesis is further demonstrated.These results indicate that the composite photocatalysts are active for reducing CO 2 at ambiance conditions with superior photocatalytic performance.The enhanced photocatalytic performance may be caused by the effective interfacial charge transfer between UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs through the heterojunction which is evidenced in Fig. 7(c), the Time-resolved PL spectra decays reveal the average lifetime of UIO-66-NH 2 (0.642 ns) and UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs (0.924 ns).UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs shows an increased long (t1), short (t2), and increased intensity-average (t) PL lifetimes in comparison to UIO-66-NH 2 , further verified that the introducing of CNTs can effectively suppress the charge recombination and elongate the lifetime of charge carriers 72.Moreover, the longer PL lifetime of composites confirms the fast transfer of electrons from UIO-66-NH 2 to CNTs, thus suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and improve the photocatalytic performance. Based on the above experiments and results, a possible mechanism for the high photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction and selectivity of HCOOH over composites has been proposed (Fig. S8).The enhancement of the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of combining the UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs can be attributed to the following reasons: (1) UIO-66-NH 2 has a large surface area and pore capacity which provide more adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers.This led to superior adsorption of CO 2 and improvement of the photocatalytic selectivity.(2) CNTs can improve the dispersion of MOFs and have excellent electronic conduction performance.The composites have large surface area which is also benefit to absorb the sacrificial reagent and thus capture and consume the holes effectively in the photocatalytic system.Besides, a newly Schottky barriers formed at the contact interface between the UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs, which could act as electron trapping centers and thus separate the photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The electrons migrate to the interface and thus the interface could act as a reduction site due to the rich electrons, which could facilitate the reduction of CO 2 , the formed heterostructures could harvest visible light energy and facilitate photocatalytic reactions at lower energies.The composites notably enhance both the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction and selectivity of HCOOH 73."}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "A 500 W Xe lamp with a cutoff glass (l 400 nm) as the light source.", "context": "The CNTs were treated with acid solution.The specific steps are as follows: the 1 g CNTs were dispersed in the 40 mL mixed acid solution, wherein the volume ratio of concentrated nitric acid to concentrated sulfuric acid was 3:1 and heated it at 80 C for 2 h under reflux condition in an oil bath.After that the sample was washed with deionized water and dried overnight in an oven at 80 C.

The crystallinity of the CNTs, UIO-66-NH 2 and UIO-66-NH 2 / 2 wt CNTs composites were evaluated by XRD.The XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 1(a), the diffraction peaks of UIO-66-NH 2 were found at 2q values of 7.36 (111), 8.48 (002), 12.04 (022), 17.08 (004), 22.25 (115), 25.68 (224) and 33.12 (137), well agreeing with that of previous reports, all the characteristic peaks are sharp and intensive which implied that the UIO-66-NH 2 had an excellent purity and crystallinity 15,16,27,47.As for the CNTs, the strong and wide diffraction peaks found at 2q values of 26.24 (002) reflected the hexagonal graphite structure and the weak peak at 43.90 (100) associated with graphite, which is corresponded to the MWCNTs 48. In the composites, all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to planes of crystalline phase of UIO-66-NH 2 .There is no apparent characteristic peaks of CNTs in composites which due to its low content and shield with the peaks of UIO-66-NH 2 .It shows the same tendency as other composites which are shown in Fig. S1(a).We also compared the nanocomposites obtained through various synthesis routes.The XRD patterns of UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs samples prepared with hydrothermal method and mechanical method are shown in Fig. S2(a), which illustrates the samples that fabricated through hydrothermal method had a higher purity and crystallinity than the samples prepared with the mechanical method.It is beneficial to enhance the photocatalytic performance.As shown in Fig. 1(b), the pure CNTs exhibited a typical in-phase vibration of the graphite lattice (G band) at 1575 cm A1 and a disorder band owing to the graphite edges (D band) at approximately 1355 cm A1 49,50.The G band results from inplane stretching motion of symmetric sp 2 CeC bonds and the D band appear because of disruption of symmetrical hexagonal graphitic lattice 51.Upon loading UIO-66-NH 2 crystals, it was observed that both G and D bands of composites were broadened.These results showed that there has a strong interaction function between UIO-66-NH 2 and the CNTs during the synthesis process 52.The similar phenomenon can be found in other samples (Fig. S1(b)).Fig. 1(c) shows the pure UIO-66-NH 2 particles, which present a cube structure with severe aggregation.Fig. 1(d) shows the diameter of CNTs is about 20e30 nm.In contrast, as shown in Fig. 1(e), after introducing the CNTs, UIO-66-NH 2 nanoparticles were uniformly grew on its surface.The uniform loading of UIO-66-NH 2 particles may strengthen the multiple reflections between crystals under visible light, which is more favorable to the conduction of electrons and beneficial to promote the photocatalysis reaction process.The SEM image of UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs sample prepared with the mechanical method is shown in Fig. S2(b).It is obvious that the UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs are just a physical mixture, scattering independently in the system and there is no synergistic effect between them. To further analyse the structure of samples, the TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) measurements are carried out.The N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3(c)) of the composite sample is located at 399.2 eV, while no difference has been observed compared with that of UIO-66-NH 2 57, suggesting that the NH 2 groups on the organic linkers can be retained after loaded CNTs.The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the O1s orbital in the UIO-66-NH 2 can be fitted by two peaks at binding energies of around 531.5 and 531.0 eV (Fig. 3(d)), which are attributed to oxygen components on the carboxylate groups of the ATA linkers and the ZreO bonds of UIO-66-NH 2 , respectively 41,47 been replaced by the CNTs.The curves of Zr 3d region (Fig. 3(e)) can be deconvoluted into two peaks for Zr 3d 5/2 and Zr 3d 3/2 located at around 182.6 eV and 185.1 eV respectively, which indicates the existence of Zr 4 58. Fig. 4(a) and (b) shows the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution of the different samples.The materials show type IV isotherms suggested a mesoporous structure of composite materials.The sample of CNTs has the type H 3 hysteresis loop while the others have H 1 hysteresis loop, which is related to a compact structure of aggregated particles with uniform size and high connectivity between pores.The pore size distribution further confirmed that the samples had well-defined mesopores.The mesoporous structure could improve the adsorption capacity and photocatalysis performance because they provide high surface area, homogeneously porous structure and tunable framework 59e61. The unique porous characteristics are favorable for transporting ions and electrons.Therefore, the photocatalytic reactions will be efficiently improved.The N 2 adsorption/ desorption curves and pore size distribution of other samples are shown in Fig. S3(a) and (b). Table 1 summarizes the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the samples.CNTs have a BET surface area of 82.10 m 2 /g, while pure UIO-66-NH 2 exhibited a large surface area of 448.7 m 2 /g.It is found that when the content of CNTs is 2 wt, the specific area of the composite is the highest, as well as the pore volume and average pore size.This inferred that the content of CNTs has an optimal value.The appropriate content of CNTs not only disperse UIO-66-NH 2 , but also increase the surface area, pore volume and average pore size of the composite materials.As increasing the surface area of composites, contact areas between active sites and target substrates are also increased thus causing superior photocatalytic performance.Besides, the studies showed that the increase of surface area could promote the acceptance of electrons and make the photocatalysts have a strong contact with active molecules.Thus the high surface area of composites would be conducive to supplying more reaction sites 62. To provide further investigation, the optical properties of different samples are measured through the UVevis spectra.As Fig. 5(a) shown, there is a slight blue shift in wavelength of absorption peak of composites.This phenomenon is attributed to the fact that UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs are two different organic and inorganic phases.The composite samples possessed an obviously enhanced absorption intensity in the visible light region compared to the sample of UIO-66-NH 2 which is due to presence of black CNTs.The pure UIO-66-NH 2 exhibited a response with a wavelength below 440 nm.The weak absorption of visible light possibly ascribed to the aggregation of UIO-66-NH 2 which is also demonstrated in SEM image mentioned above.The enhanced light harvesting of composites due to the good assembly of UIO-66-NH 2 particles along the surface of CNTs, thus raising the multiple light reflections in the materials.All of the samples show similar light absorbance attributed to their similar structure and based on the UIO-66-NH 2 (Fig. S4).Besides, the higher light absorption capacity of composites than UIO-66-NH 2 corresponding to the color change from greenish-yellow to grayish brown.Furthermore, it is dued to the CNTs could effectively disperse UIO-66-NH 2 and enhance its absorption strength of visible light 63.The FTIR spectra of adsorbents presents three noticeable characteristic bonds, which locates at 1655 cm A1 , 1580 cm A1 and 1400 cm A1 , respectively (see in Fig. 5(b)).These three peaks are attributed to aromatic CC stretching vibration, the vibration of carboxyl groups and CeH deformation vibration from eCH 3 and eCH 2 64.Besides, the spectra of UIO-66-NH 2 also shows the typical peaks of NeH stretching at 1260 cm A1 and 788 cm A1 , demonstrating the existence of eNH 2 group 65.After combining the UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs, the peak at 1655 cm A1 has a noticeable change, portending the p-p interactions between them 66.Comparing with the pure UIO-66-NH 2 , the spectra of composites is relatively unchanged, while the strength of the peak decreased.There are some small changes in the composites, this is dued to the introduction of functional groups that are brought with the surface of CNTs, moreover, carboxyl coordinated with metal ion altered the chemical circumstance of the ligand slightly 67. The photocatalytic activities of various photocatalysts were evaluated under visible light illumination displayed in Fig. 6.In Fig. 6(a), it is evident that photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction increased firstly and then decreased while the generation of hydrogen shows the opposite trend.When the loading amount of CNTs is 2 wt, the reduction of CO 2 reaches a maximum of 28.8 mmol while the H 2 generation shows a minimal amount of 2.0 mmol.The reduction of CO 2 and evolution of hydrogen are two electrons reaction process.They compete for the electrons in the photocatalytic system at the same time.The detailed data are shown in Table 2, all nanocomposites exhibit superior photocatalytic performance compared to the pure UIO-66-NH 2 which presents the synergistic effect of CNTs in these samples and the fact that CNTs improve the activity and selectivity of photocatalysts.With massive loading content of CNTs, the photocatalytic performance decrease, this is due to the fact that photons are further absorbed and scattered in the existence of CNTs.Besides, the excessive CNTs can play as a kind of recombination center instead of supplying an electron pathway. Furthermore, we pursued selectivity of HCOOH changes.From Fig. 6(b), when the CNTs loading content changes from 0 to 2 wt, the yield of HCOOH changes from 1.84 mmol to 18.2 mmol and the selectivity changes from 38.3 to 63.1.When the CNTs loading content continues to increase from 2 wt to 5 wt, the yield of HCOOH has a gradual downward trend, while the selectivity also decreased.When the loading content of CNTs is 2 wt, the yield of HCOOH and the selectivity reached a maximum value of 63.1.The selectivity is almost 2 times higher than the pure UIO-66-NH 2 .The improved selectivity is dued to the absence of eNH 2 , the physical adsorption sites and chemical reaction adsorption sites increased, the absorption reaction between CO 2 and eNH 2 enhanced the adsorption capacity of CO 2 significantly, therefore improve the selectivity of HCOOH.This has also been demonstrated by previous reports 68.In addition, we obtained composite samples through mechanical mixing method and thus demonstrated the advantages of hydrothermal synthesis (Table S1). As listed in Table S1, the UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs sample was fabricated through hydrothermal method and exhibited higher HCOOH evolution amount (28.8 mmol), which is 2.1 times higher than the mechanical mixing sample (13.6 mmol).The selectivity of HCOOH is also nearly 2 times higher than the mechanical mixing sample.The hydrothermal process induced shaping UIO-66-NH 2 crystals on the surface of CNTs, increased its dispersibility and strengthened the contact between the UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs.These merits supplied a short pathway for charge transfer and low charge transfer resistance during the photocatalysis process. Most studies showed there exist two reaction pathways in the process of reducing CO 2 , hydrogenation and deoxygenation of CO 2 .On the basis of our experiments, we propose the photoreduction of CO 2 with water over UIO-66-NH 2 /CNTs occurs via hydrogenation reactions, because the HCOOH is finally observed which consistent with previous reports 69.The proposed reaction pathways are as following equations ((1)e( 6)), which is similar to the relevant studies 70.The represents absorbed species, hv indicates a photon under visible light.Under illumination, the UIO-66-NH 2 produced photogenerated electron (e A )-hole (h )pairs.The holes will react with water molecules, forming OH and H intermediates.Then the H react with the electrons and generate the H 2 .The generation of HCOOH is based on a fast hydrogenation process of CO 2 on the interface of UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs.With the H intermediates, the HCOOH forms mainly because it is two electrons reaction process, easily than generates the other products, such as CH 4 , CH 3 OH.Besides, in this photocatalytic reaction system, the TEOA was used as sacrifice agent.According to previous reports, TEOA can also facilitate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction because of its more basic nature, the presence of TEOA supports the hydrogenation of CO 2 to formate 71.Effective hydrogen transfer catalysts should also be effective in the reduction of CO 2 and therefore inhibit the production of hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 6(c), after six cycles of CO 2 photoreduction under visible light irradiation, the reduction of CO 2 was well maintained.This indicated the activity of composites kept relatively stable.These results indicated that the photocatalyst prepared with hydrothermal method has higher chemical stability to reduce CO 2 at ambiance conditions.The morphology of photocatalyst and valence state of the elements after the reusability test show no clearly change, as shown in Fig. S5, the numerous UIO-66-NH 2 particles are deposited on the surface of CNTs, this demonstrates the stability of composites.As for the XPS, The survey spectrum (Fig. S6 The charge transfer properties are further demonstrated by a series of measurements.As shown in Fig. 7(a), the photocurrent responses of different samples were measured under visible-light (l 400 nm) irradiation at a constant potential of 0.5 V (vs.SCE).The UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs composite possesses enhanced light currents, indicating that the composite photocatalyst can utilize more photoinduced electrons, thus exhibiting superior CO 2 photoreduction activity.It was superior than the UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs sample obtained through the mechanical mixing method (Fig. S7(a)).These i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y x x x ( x x x x ) x x x results demonstrated that the hydrothermal method induced the samples display a higher photocurrent intensity, which indicated a strong visible-light absorption capability and low rate of recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.To get a deeper understanding of the changes in the conductivity of different samples, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in Fig. 7(b).Electrical equivalent circuits are determined to explain charge transfer processes occurring in the photocatalysis system, the sample of UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs exhibited a smaller capacitance arc than the pure UIO-66-NH 2 , implying that the introduction of CNTs could enhance the electron mobility by reducing the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of UIO-66-NH 2 , improve the conductivity of the materials and reduce the compound rate of the photovoltaic carrier.It was also smaller than the mechanical mixing sample (Fig. S7(b)), the advantages of hydrothermal synthesis is further demonstrated.These results indicate that the composite photocatalysts are active for reducing CO 2 at ambiance conditions with superior photocatalytic performance.The enhanced photocatalytic performance may be caused by the effective interfacial charge transfer between UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs through the heterojunction which is evidenced in Fig. 7(c), the Time-resolved PL spectra decays reveal the average lifetime of UIO-66-NH 2 (0.642 ns) and UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs (0.924 ns).UIO-66-NH 2 /2 wt CNTs shows an increased long (t1), short (t2), and increased intensity-average (t) PL lifetimes in comparison to UIO-66-NH 2 , further verified that the introducing of CNTs can effectively suppress the charge recombination and elongate the lifetime of charge carriers 72.Moreover, the longer PL lifetime of composites confirms the fast transfer of electrons from UIO-66-NH 2 to CNTs, thus suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and improve the photocatalytic performance. Based on the above experiments and results, a possible mechanism for the high photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction and selectivity of HCOOH over composites has been proposed (Fig. S8).The enhancement of the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of combining the UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs can be attributed to the following reasons: (1) UIO-66-NH 2 has a large surface area and pore capacity which provide more adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers.This led to superior adsorption of CO 2 and improvement of the photocatalytic selectivity.(2) CNTs can improve the dispersion of MOFs and have excellent electronic conduction performance.The composites have large surface area which is also benefit to absorb the sacrificial reagent and thus capture and consume the holes effectively in the photocatalytic system.Besides, a newly Schottky barriers formed at the contact interface between the UIO-66-NH 2 and CNTs, which could act as electron trapping centers and thus separate the photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The electrons migrate to the interface and thus the interface could act as a reduction site due to the rich electrons, which could facilitate the reduction of CO 2 , the formed heterostructures could harvest visible light energy and facilitate photocatalytic reactions at lower energies.The composites notably enhance both the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction and selectivity of HCOOH 73."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was performed in a homemade glass reactor with 40 mL DMF (solvent of CO 2 ), 5 mL triethanolamine (TEOA-sacrificial agent), 3 mL H 2 O (proton source).", "context": "The CNTs were treated with acid solution.The specific steps are as follows: the 1 g CNTs were dispersed in the 40 mL mixed acid solution, wherein the volume ratio of concentrated nitric acid to concentrated sulfuric acid was 3:1 and heated it at 80 C for 2 h under reflux condition in an oil bath.After that the sample was washed with deionized water and dried overnight in an oven at 80 C.
