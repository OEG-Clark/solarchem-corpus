In a typical procedure, 1.6 g of NaOH (0.33 M) was dissolved in 120 mL of Milli-Q water.Then 0.1485 g of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (4 mM) and 0.1064 g of Na 2 TeO 3 (1 mM) were added to this clear solution under constant stirring.Finally, 0.7566 g of NaBH 4 (0.17 M) was added to the above mixture and was kept for stirring until a clear transparent solution was formed, followed by being transferred into a 150 mL Teon-lined stainless steel autoclave.The autoclave was held at 160 C for 24 h and then cooled in air at room temperature.The dark reddish brown precipitates of ZnTe were collected via centrifugation, and were washed several times with Milli-Q water and nally with absolute ethanol.The obtained ZnTe precipitates were then dried in an oven at 60 C for 8 h under vacuum. The crystal structure of as-synthesized products has been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Bruker D8 focus diffractometer with Ni-ltered Cu-Ka radiation.The diffractograms were recorded in the 2q range of 20 to 80 at a scan rate of 0.1 min A1 .Lambda 750 UV-visible spectrophotometer was used to investigate the optical properties using wavelength in the range of 250-800 nm at room temperature with BaSO 4 as a reference.The hollow structure, morphology and composition of the synthesized ZnTe have been analyzed by using Hitachi S4800 eld-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and both of them were equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer.The pore size and mesoporous texture of the microspheres were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis (Micromeritics, tristar II 3020).Xray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) has been used to determine the valence band position by using ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The photoreduction system has been described previously. 45ighly puried CO 2 (99.999)gas was bubbled through the photocatalyst dispersed in Milli-Q water (10 mg/80 mL) in the quartz reactor attached with the photoreaction system to produce a mixture of CO 2 and water.The positive pressure of CO 2 inside the photoreaction system was maintained at 25 kPa and was assured before the irradiation that there was no leakage in the system.Before the visible-light irradiation (l 420 nm), wet CO 2 was allowed to ow through the photoreaction system loaded with the ZnTe microsphere for around 40 minutes to ensure the complete removal of air from the system, followed by the maximum adsorption of the gas molecules on the active sites of the photocatalyst.Aer CO 2 -ow was stopped, the 300 W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cut-off lter was turned on and the product yield as a function of irradiation time was determined for a total time period of 8 h.An approximate distance of 14.5 cm was maintained between the light source and the solution surface in the photoreactor.The system was constantly recycled with tap water (15 C) through a water recycling machine during the entire course of the photoreaction so as to maintain the temperature. The CH 4 produced as a result of photoreduction of CO 2 via photocatalysts was identied by an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (GC) via an automated gas valve using helium (He) as the carrier gas.The GC was equipped with two (front and back) ame ionization detectors (FID) and one thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Four different control experiments were carried out to conrm that the CH 4 being produced in the present work is from the photocatalysts under visible light and not from any impurities, i.e., blank reactor with and without irradiation, dark experiment with the photocatalyst, and with the same experimental conditions but using N 2 instead of CO 2 .No CH 4 was produced during these controlled reactions, indicating that the CH 4 was indeed from the photoconversion of CO 2 using the photocatalysts under visible-light irradiation and not from any impurities.The solar energy conversion efficiency can be determined by using the converted amount of energy contained in CH 4 relative to the irradiated solar power (l 420 nm).The latter was measured to be 1.3 W with ILT 950 spectrodiometer (International Light Technologies), and the former was calculated by using the amount of CH 4 produced upon photoreduction of CO 2 and the energy density of CH 4 (55.6 MJ kg A1 ).To minimize the inuence from the side reactions during the photoreduction (such as photocorrosion of the catalyst), the reaction time of half an hour was used for the calculation.The detailed calculation was presented in the ESI."}, {"llm generation": "ZnTe microspheres and ZnTe nanocrystals", "source": "The as-synthesized hollow and mesoporous ZnTe microspheres (Fig. 3) and ZnTe nanocrystals (Fig. 5a) have been used to photoreduce CO 2 into CH 4 under visible-light irradiation (l 420 nm).", "context": "The ZnTe is formed via a series of chemical reactions.Zinc hydroxide (Zn(OH) 2 ) is produced once Zn(NO 3 ) 2 is added to an aqueous solution of NaOH, which is dissolved by the excess of NaOH in the reaction mixture, and is dissociated into respective zinc and hydroxyl ions.When Na 2 TeO 3 is added into the above alkaline solution, it is dissociated into tellurite ions, which can be reduced to Te and Te 2A by a strong reducing agent like NaBH 4 .The ZnTe is obtained at an optimum pH and reaction temperature via the reactions between the ions of zinc(II) and tellurium(II). The structural phase and purity of the as-synthesized products were studied by the XRD pattern.A typical XRD pattern of the as-synthesized ZnTe at 160 C for 24 h is shown in Fig. 1a.All the diffraction peaks can be assigned to the cubic ZnTe with a lattice constant of 6.1273 A, which is in good agreement with the available standard pattern (powder diffraction le (PDF) no.15-0746).No impurity peaks (i.e., any metallic tellurium or zinc) were observed, which also conrms the purity of the product.The narrow and sharp peaks from the XRD patterns indicate the high crystalline nature of the obtained ZnTe.The purity and composition of the products are also conrmed by the EDX analysis.The EDX spectrum of single ZnTe is shown in Fig. 1b.Almost all the peaks in the spectrum correspond to tellurium and zinc with an atomic ratio of 1 : 1.2, supporting the impurity free synthesis of the product.Two small peaks of carbon and copper appear in the EDX spectrum and are ascribed to come from the instrument and the sample preparing procedure, i.e., copper grid used for the sample preparation. The texture of the as-synthesized ZnTe has been investigated by the nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis.Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen sorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution curve of the as-prepared product.The BET sorption isotherms are found to be of reverse \"S\" shape, which displays type IV isotherm with H-3 hysteresis loop (at 0.2 P/P 0 1) in accordance with the IUPAC classication. 46his indicates the characteristics of the mesoporous materials with pore size ranging from 2 to 50 nm. 47,48The corresponding pore size distribution can also be conrmed by adsorption and desorption analysis using Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2.There are four characteristic peaks that indicate the existence of mesopores in the hollow microspheres.The BJH curve also shows the presence of some macropores of diameter 80 nm, while with very low density.The respective average pore diameter of BJH adsorption and desorption is around 16.3 and 20.9 nm, which are in good agreement with the SEM results discussed later.The BET surface area of the obtained ZnTe microspheres calculated from nitrogen adsorption is 5 m 2 g A1 and the pore volume is 0.019 cm 3 g A1 .The relatively low surface area is due to the very highly crystalline nature and larger size of the microspheres.So the as-prepared ZnTe microspheres are mesoporous in texture. Fig. 3 represents the morphological images of hydrothermally synthesized mesoporous ZnTe microspheres at 160 C for 24 h in terms of SEM.From the low magnication image, it is evident that the ZnTe is uniformly composed of the microspheres with an average diameter of 1.6 mm with the absence of any other signicant morphology (Fig. 3a).It can clearly be seen from the zoom-in image that the microspheres are hollow in structure, as shown by the arrow heads for some broken spheres with rough surface (Fig. 3b).It can be conrmed from the high magnication images that these microspheres are mesoporous in texture, specically as indicated in Fig. 3d.The detailed mechanism for the formation of these 3D structures is discussed later. To further investigate the surface and structure of the products, the as-synthesized hollow and mesoporous ZnTe microspheres have been characterized with TEM images, as shown in Fig. 4.These results are found to be in good agreement with the above discussed SEM data.It can be clearly seen from Fig. 4a that for a single ZnTe microsphere, it is hollow in structure with a thick shell and rough surface, as already illustrated by the SEM images.Fig. 4b represents the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern for the microspheres with diffractional rings, indicating that these hollow microspheres are polycrystalline in nature.Fig. 4c is the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image taken from the rectangular fringe of a single microsphere in Fig. 4a.These data conrm the polycrystalline nature of these hollow microspheres too, representing the lattice interplanar spacing from different crystal planes of cubic ZnTe, as indicated in Fig. 4c.It also provides additional evidence for the ultra high crystalline nature of these 3D hierarchical hollow and mesoporous microspheres. The detailed growth mechanism of these hollow and mesoporous microspheres has been investigated.It is suggested that NaOH plays a critical role in the formation of the hierarchical structures synthesized at 160 C for 24 h.The effect of the concentration of NaOH has been shown in Fig. 5.No microspheres, i.e., only the aggregates of ZnTe nanocrystals with irregular morphology were formed in the absence of NaOH (Fig. 5a).The morphology of ZnTe hardly changes with increase in NaOH to 0.1 M (Fig. 5b), while some microspherical structures started appearing as the NaOH concentration increased to 0.2 M (Fig. 5c).When the NaOH concentration further increased to 0.33 M, the uniformly distributed hollow and mesoporous ZnTe microspheres were formed, as shown in Fig. 5d.The effect of NaOH might be attributed to the fact that it plays a crucial role during the nucleation process of these microstructures. Another important factor that plays a signicant role in the formation of these hierarchical microspheres is the reaction time.To gure out this formation mechanism, time-dependent reactions were carried out and their corresponding SEM and EDX results have been shown in Fig. 6 and7, respectively.In the rst half an hour of the reaction, only the tellurium nuclei in the form of rods were observed (Fig. 6a), for which the composition was conrmed by the EDX spectrum (Fig. 7a).The peak of Si in the EDX spectra (Fig. 7) is attributed to the Si substrate used for the sample preparation.The nucleation of this tellurium continues with increase in the reaction time to 1 h, while some of them change into spherical tellurium oxide (Fig. 6b).The elemental composition of one of the spheres was conrmed by the EDX analysis as shown in Fig. 7b, which supports the previous claim.It can be seen from Fig. 6c that the spheres of tellurium oxide became larger and more uniform with an increase in the reaction time to 2 h, whereas less rod-like tellurium based structures were observed.Again, the elemental composition of the product was conrmed by the EDX data (Fig. 7c).This nucleation process is followed by Ostwald ripening, where the zinc from Zn(OH) 2 rst dissolved in the excess of aqueous NaOH solution, re-depositing on to the large spherical and rod-like crystals of tellurium oxides, as indicated by the black outline of rods and spheres in the schematic illustration in Fig. 8. Accordingly, the bi-structural ZnTe was formed, i.e., rod-like structures and microspheres.This mechanism can be endorsed on the basis of the EDX spectrum of the sample shown in Fig. 7c, in which a small peak of zinc appeared for the rst time aer two-hour reaction and then increased with further increase in the reaction time to four hours, as shown in the Fig. 7d. Once ZnTe was formed, the peak corresponding to zinc became stable as shown in the Fig. 7(e andf).Aer 4 hours, the large rods were broken into small ones, followed by their selfassembly/dispersion on the spheres (Fig. 6d).These small rods then penetrated into the spheres as a result of the inward diffusion process as shown in Fig. 6e and8, resulting in the release of oxygen gas and, thus, eventually making the spheres hollow and mesoporous in texture (Fig. 6f).The quality and uniformity of these hollow and mesoporous microspheres were improved with further increase in the reaction time and nally aer 24 hours uniform hollow and mesoporous ZnTe microspheres are formed (Fig. 6g).The schematic illustration for the formation of these hollow and mesoporous microspheres are shown in Fig. 8. The concentration of tellurium precursor (i.e., Na 2 TeO 3 ) also plays an important role in controlling the size of the microspheres.The microspheres with different concentration of tellurium precursor, with respect to zinc, have been synthesized (Fig. 9).It is found that when tellurium is in equimolar ratio with zinc (i.e., 1 : 1), the size of these microspheres is around 3.5 to 4 mm, as shown in Fig. 9a.While the size of the microspheres decreased almost by 50 (Fig. 9b) when the tellurium concentration decreased to 25.This may be explained by the already proposed mechanism.In case of high concentration of tellurium, more ZnTe rods could undergo inward diffusion process, leading to a larger size and vice versa. The reaction temperature is another essential parameter that plays an important role in the formation of the microspheres.For the detailed investigation, these microspheres were synthesized at different reaction temperatures and the results are shown in Fig. 10.At a low temperature of 120 C, the temperature was not high enough for complete reduction and the inward diffusion of tellurium based rod-like structures.Thus, both the structures of spheres and rods were visible at such a low temperature (Fig. 10a).As the temperature increased to 140 C, the yield of the microspheres became relatively large, while the quality of the product in terms of uniformity was still not good (Fig. 10b).Homogeneous and uniform hollow and mesoporous microspheres were formed at a reaction temperature of 160 C (Fig. 10c), which was found to be the optimum temperature in this study.As the temperature increased to 180 C, it resulted in the nucleation of relatively large ZnTe crystals along with the microspheres (Fig. 10d).At a further high temperature of 200 C, only large ZnTe crystals could be observed (Fig. 10e), which might be due to agglomeration at such an elevated temperature. The photocatalytic properties of a catalyst are strongly dependent on the alignment of its energy levels, which can be determined in terms of valence band position and band gap energy.The XPS spectroscopy has been employed to calculate the valence band position of ZnTe.The work function of the XPS instrument in the present case was 4.62 eV and the result is shown in Fig. 11a.The inset of Fig. 11a represents zoom-in plot of the measured valence band position, which is 0.49 eV (0.51 V against standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)). UV-visible diffuse reectance spectroscopy was used to study the optical properties and the band gap of these microspheres.The Kubelka-Munk function was employed to convert the diffuse reectance spectrum into the equivalent absorption coefficient. 49Fig. 11b is the UV-visible spectrum of the ZnTe microspheres, which clearly indicates that the ZnTe microspheres exhibit a strong absorption in the green region of the visible light at 559 nm.The optical band gap for the hollow and mesoporous ZnTe microspheres was determined to be 2.22 eV via the Tauc plot, as shown in the inset of Fig. 11b. The alignment of energy levels for the microspheres can thus be drawn (Fig. 12).Clearly, the conduction band minimum (A1.71V vs. SHE) is signicantly negative than the redox potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V vs. SHE).So the obtained microspheres are considered suitable photocatalyst for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into CH 4 . The as-synthesized hollow and mesoporous ZnTe microspheres (Fig. 3) and ZnTe nanocrystals (Fig. 5a) have been used to photoreduce CO 2 into CH 4 under visible-light irradiation (l 420 nm).No CH 4 was observed in all the four controlled experiments (Fig. 13), suggesting that the CH 4 produced in this work is the direct result of photoconversion of CO 2 over the photocatalysts under visible-light irradiation (l 420 nm).As shown in Fig. 12, the electrons can be excited from the valence band of ZnTe into conduction band upon illumination of visible light, leaving holes behind in the valence band.Due to the suitable potential of the conduction band, the photogenerated electrons can reduce CO 2 into superoxide radicals (cCO 2 A ) and reduce H to cH radicals, which can then react with each other and eventually lead to the formation of CH 4 . 5051152 In addition, the peak intensity increases with time in terms of the GC plots for the reduction of CO 2 over hollow and mesoporous microspheres aer different time intervals (Fig. S1 in ESI ), indicating the continuous production of CH 4 .Since the potential of the holes le in the valence band may not be positive enough to oxidize the H 2 O, they may react with other reducible photoreduction product (such as CH 3 OH and HCHO) in the solution, as no O 2 and such products are detected in this work.So the activity and, specically, the selectivity could be improved greatly once upon the introduction of hole scavenger into the system.The oxidation of these reducible products may result in the generation of H , which can participate in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 .The H can also come from the acidic aqueous solution due to the dissolution of CO 2 in water.The maximum CH 4 yield was 8.40 mmol g A1 aer 8 h for the hollow and mesoporous microspheres, and was 5.60 mmol g A1 for the nanocrystals (Fig. 13).By using the converted amount of fuel energy (CH 4 ) in the rst half an hour relative to the irradiated solar power (l 420 nm), the solar energy conversion efficiency was determined to be 0.072 and 0.034 for the microspheres and nanocrystals, respectively.The value for the microspheres is found to be similar to or higher than some of the already reported ones in the literature. 51522535455565758 The relatively high efficiency for the microspheres may be ascribed to the superior nature of hollow and mesoporous microspheres, such as the low density, large fraction of voids and the capability to store large amount of CO 2 compared to the aggregated nanocrystals.Furthermore, the as-synthesized hollow microspheres may have some surface defects and step edges due to their surface roughness caused by the formation of mesopores, which are believed to be the active sites for photoreaction. 59his may also explain their relatively high photocatalytic activity.As for the nanocrystals, the agglomeration could seriously reduce the available catalytic active sites, leading to low yield of CH 4 production.In addition, it is noted that the rate of CH 4 production is relatively high in the initial stage, while decreases slightly thereaer.It may be due to the destruction of the spherical structures aer photoreduction because of the photocorrosion of ZnTe upon the oxidization by photogenerated holes, as manifested in the SEM image of the spheres aer photoreduction (Fig. 14).This also results in decreased photocatalytic activity, where a decrease of 15 in the CH 4 production yield is observed aer each run (Fig. S2 in ESI ). In addition, the inuence of different amount of mesoporous photocatalysts on the production of CH 4 has also been investigated (Fig. 13).The maximum yield of CH 4 produced by using 5, 10 and 20 mg of the photocatalysts was 4.43, 8.40 and 5.94 mmol g A1 , respectively.The system with 10 mg of the photocatalyst exhibited the highest yield, followed by the one with 20 mg of the photocatalyst.The system with 5 mg of the photocatalyst was the lowest.All these are closely related to the insufficiency and excess of the catalysts.When the amount of photocatalyst is insufficient, the yield would become lower; while it becomes lower too in the case of excess photocatalyst due to the possible agglomeration/poor dispersion of the large amount of photocatalysts.The difference in the maximum amount of CH 4 produced with different amount of photocatalyst also conrms that the CH 4 produced in the present case is the direct result of CO 2 photoreduction over as-synthesized ZnTe photocatalysts, and not from any organic contaminations."}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [{"llm generation": "visible-light", "source": "Hollow and mesoporous ZnTe microspheres: synthesis and visible-light photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide into methane", "context": "Hollow and mesoporous ZnTe microspheres: synthesis and visible-light photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide into methane"}, {"llm generation": "visible-light", "source": "These hollow and mesoporous microspheres are also used for the photoreduction of carbon dioxide into methane under visible-light illumination (l 420 nm) with a solar energy conversion efficiency of 0.072.", "context": "Hollow and mesoporous microstructures have been found to be an attractive class of materials due to their superior physical properties and potential applications.In the present work, a hydrothermal method has been used to synthesize hollow and mesoporous ZnTe hierarchical microspheres.The as-synthesized microspheres are characterized by a variety of techniques, including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy.Nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements and the curve of relative pore size distribution via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis confirm the existence of mesopores in the obtained nanomaterials.Different reaction parameters such as NaOH concentration, reaction temperature and time, and concentration of the tellurium precursor have been studied and the detailed growth mechanism has been proposed.These hollow and mesoporous microspheres are also used for the photoreduction of carbon dioxide into methane under visible-light illumination (l 420 nm) with a solar energy conversion efficiency of 0.072."}, {"llm generation": "Visible light (l 420 nm)", "source": "The as-synthesized hollow and mesoporous ZnTe microspheres (Fig. 3) and ZnTe nanocrystals (Fig. 5a) have been used to photoreduce CO 2 into CH 4 under visible-light irradiation (l 420 nm).", "context": "The ZnTe is formed via a series of chemical reactions.Zinc hydroxide (Zn(OH) 2 ) is produced once Zn(NO 3 ) 2 is added to an aqueous solution of NaOH, which is dissolved by the excess of NaOH in the reaction mixture, and is dissociated into respective zinc and hydroxyl ions.When Na 2 TeO 3 is added into the above alkaline solution, it is dissociated into tellurite ions, which can be reduced to Te and Te 2A by a strong reducing agent like NaBH 4 .The ZnTe is obtained at an optimum pH and reaction temperature via the reactions between the ions of zinc(II) and tellurium(II).

The reaction temperature is another essential parameter that plays an important role in the formation of the microspheres.For the detailed investigation, these microspheres were synthesized at different reaction temperatures and the results are shown in Fig. 10.At a low temperature of 120 C, the temperature was not high enough for complete reduction and the inward diffusion of tellurium based rod-like structures.Thus, both the structures of spheres and rods were visible at such a low temperature (Fig. 10a).As the temperature increased to 140 C, the yield of the microspheres became relatively large, while the quality of the product in terms of uniformity was still not good (Fig. 10b).Homogeneous and uniform hollow and mesoporous microspheres were formed at a reaction temperature of 160 C (Fig. 10c), which was found to be the optimum temperature in this study.As the temperature increased to 180 C, it resulted in the nucleation of relatively large ZnTe crystals along with the microspheres (Fig. 10d).At a further high temperature of 200 C, only large ZnTe crystals could be observed (Fig. 10e), which might be due to agglomeration at such an elevated temperature. The photocatalytic properties of a catalyst are strongly dependent on the alignment of its energy levels, which can be determined in terms of valence band position and band gap energy.The XPS spectroscopy has been employed to calculate the valence band position of ZnTe.The work function of the XPS instrument in the present case was 4.62 eV and the result is shown in Fig. 11a.The inset of Fig. 11a represents zoom-in plot of the measured valence band position, which is 0.49 eV (0.51 V against standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)). UV-visible diffuse reectance spectroscopy was used to study the optical properties and the band gap of these microspheres.The Kubelka-Munk function was employed to convert the diffuse reectance spectrum into the equivalent absorption coefficient. 49Fig. 11b is the UV-visible spectrum of the ZnTe microspheres, which clearly indicates that the ZnTe microspheres exhibit a strong absorption in the green region of the visible light at 559 nm.The optical band gap for the hollow and mesoporous ZnTe microspheres was determined to be 2.22 eV via the Tauc plot, as shown in the inset of Fig. 11b. The alignment of energy levels for the microspheres can thus be drawn (Fig. 12).Clearly, the conduction band minimum (A1.71V vs. SHE) is signicantly negative than the redox potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V vs. SHE).So the obtained microspheres are considered suitable photocatalyst for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into CH 4 . The as-synthesized hollow and mesoporous ZnTe microspheres (Fig. 3) and ZnTe nanocrystals (Fig. 5a) have been used to photoreduce CO 2 into CH 4 under visible-light irradiation (l 420 nm).No CH 4 was observed in all the four controlled experiments (Fig. 13), suggesting that the CH 4 produced in this work is the direct result of photoconversion of CO 2 over the photocatalysts under visible-light irradiation (l 420 nm).As shown in Fig. 12, the electrons can be excited from the valence band of ZnTe into conduction band upon illumination of visible light, leaving holes behind in the valence band.Due to the suitable potential of the conduction band, the photogenerated electrons can reduce CO 2 into superoxide radicals (cCO 2 A ) and reduce H to cH radicals, which can then react with each other and eventually lead to the formation of CH 4 . 5051152 In addition, the peak intensity increases with time in terms of the GC plots for the reduction of CO 2 over hollow and mesoporous microspheres aer different time intervals (Fig. S1 in ESI ), indicating the continuous production of CH 4 .Since the potential of the holes le in the valence band may not be positive enough to oxidize the H 2 O, they may react with other reducible photoreduction product (such as CH 3 OH and HCHO) in the solution, as no O 2 and such products are detected in this work.So the activity and, specically, the selectivity could be improved greatly once upon the introduction of hole scavenger into the system.The oxidation of these reducible products may result in the generation of H , which can participate in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 .The H can also come from the acidic aqueous solution due to the dissolution of CO 2 in water.The maximum CH 4 yield was 8.40 mmol g A1 aer 8 h for the hollow and mesoporous microspheres, and was 5.60 mmol g A1 for the nanocrystals (Fig. 13).By using the converted amount of fuel energy (CH 4 ) in the rst half an hour relative to the irradiated solar power (l 420 nm), the solar energy conversion efficiency was determined to be 0.072 and 0.034 for the microspheres and nanocrystals, respectively.The value for the microspheres is found to be similar to or higher than some of the already reported ones in the literature. 51522535455565758 The relatively high efficiency for the microspheres may be ascribed to the superior nature of hollow and mesoporous microspheres, such as the low density, large fraction of voids and the capability to store large amount of CO 2 compared to the aggregated nanocrystals.Furthermore, the as-synthesized hollow microspheres may have some surface defects and step edges due to their surface roughness caused by the formation of mesopores, which are believed to be the active sites for photoreaction. 59his may also explain their relatively high photocatalytic activity.As for the nanocrystals, the agglomeration could seriously reduce the available catalytic active sites, leading to low yield of CH 4 production.In addition, it is noted that the rate of CH 4 production is relatively high in the initial stage, while decreases slightly thereaer.It may be due to the destruction of the spherical structures aer photoreduction because of the photocorrosion of ZnTe upon the oxidization by photogenerated holes, as manifested in the SEM image of the spheres aer photoreduction (Fig. 14).This also results in decreased photocatalytic activity, where a decrease of 15 in the CH 4 production yield is observed aer each run (Fig. S2 in ESI ). In addition, the inuence of different amount of mesoporous photocatalysts on the production of CH 4 has also been investigated (Fig. 13).The maximum yield of CH 4 produced by using 5, 10 and 20 mg of the photocatalysts was 4.43, 8.40 and 5.94 mmol g A1 , respectively.The system with 10 mg of the photocatalyst exhibited the highest yield, followed by the one with 20 mg of the photocatalyst.The system with 5 mg of the photocatalyst was the lowest.All these are closely related to the insufficiency and excess of the catalysts.When the amount of photocatalyst is insufficient, the yield would become lower; while it becomes lower too in the case of excess photocatalyst due to the possible agglomeration/poor dispersion of the large amount of photocatalysts.The difference in the maximum amount of CH 4 produced with different amount of photocatalyst also conrms that the CH 4 produced in the present case is the direct result of CO 2 photoreduction over as-synthesized ZnTe photocatalysts, and not from any organic contaminations."}, {"llm generation": "Visible-light", "source": "The as-synthesized microspheres exhibit relatively high photocatalytic activity for the photoconversion of CO 2 into CH 4 under visible-light irradiation (l 420 nm) mainly due to the characteristic nature of the hollow and mesoporous nanomaterials.", "context": "The hollow and mesoporous ZnTe microspheres have been successfully synthesized via the hydrothermal approach using NaOH as the structure directing agent.Some reaction parameters like the reaction temperature and time are found to play an important role in the formation of such microstructures.The as-synthesized microspheres exhibit relatively high photocatalytic activity for the photoconversion of CO 2 into CH 4 under visible-light irradiation (l 420 nm) mainly due to the characteristic nature of the hollow and mesoporous nanomaterials.
