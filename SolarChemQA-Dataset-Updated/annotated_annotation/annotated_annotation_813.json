The UV-vis absorption diffuse reflectance spectra were collected from the NiAl-LDH and NiAl-x photocatalysts to gauge their light absorption behaviour for subsequent photocatalytic experiments (Fig. 1B).The NiAl-LDH precursor and NiAl-200 showed an absorption feature at visible wavelengths due to the presence of Ni 2 ions 56.After calcination NiAl-LDH from 200 to 800 C, the UV-vis absorption became much stronger through the whole range, while NiAl-275 and NiAl-400 showed the strongest visible light absorption, in accordance with their black appearance (Fig. S2) 57,58.With further increasing the calcination temperature, the intensity of light absorption for NiAl-600 and NiAl-800 was getting lower, which was consistent with the color change from black to green (Fig. S2). These NiAl-x photocatalysts, as well as the precursor NiAl-LDH and referenced pure NiO sample, were tested in CO 2 PR under visible light.The sole Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O without adding LDH photocatalysts showed poor activity with the yield of 20.3 mol g -1 h -1 for CO and undetectable CH 4 .(Fig. S3A).In Fig. 2A andB, NiAl-275 showed the best selectivity of CH 4 (22.8 ) in all products (CH 4 , CO, H 2 ) with the highest CH 4 production rate (95 mol g -1 h -1 ) among various samples.Further increasing the calcination temperature, the selectivity of CH 4 for NiAl-400 and NiAl-600 dropped to 8.4 and 1.4 respectively, while the NiO and NiAl-800 catalysts showed almost no CH 4 evolved (less then 1).It was noteworthy that the photocatalytic performance increased firstly and then decreased from 400 to 600 nm (Fig. 2A), which may be due to the light absorbance of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O photosensitizer (Fig. S6).Moreover, an isotopic labeling experiment using 13 CO 2 as the substrate (Fig. 2C) confirmed that the CO and CH 4 indeed originated from photocatalytic CO 2 by NiAl-275.After 5 times cycle, NiAl-275 showed no obviously reduce of selective and productivity, proving the stability of this photocatalyst (Fig. 2D, Figure S3B).Since NiAl-275 was composed by NiO and amorphous Al 2 O 3 phase, in order to detect the corresponding role in the CO 2 reduction, we prepared four reference samples to give a detailed study of the photoreduction CO 2 reaction (Fig. S4,S5 In recent years, most photocatalysts exhibited activity around 400-500 nm, limiting the solar energy-utilization efficiency since most of the visible light (500-800 nm) did not make full use.It is important to explore the photocatalytic activity under a wider absorption range (ideally near-infrared excitation ( 600 nm)) based on the utilized effective utilization of solar energy.Thus, we investigated the performance of NiAl-x under different wavelengths.Different filters for CO 2 PR over LDHs were presented in Fig. S7 and Table S2.As shown in Fig. 2E, F, the selectivity of CH 4 for NiAl-275 can be further optimized upto 38.0 ( 600 nm).More importantly, the H 2 can be totally suppressed under irradiation at 600 nm (Fig. 2E).This work not only widened the working wavelength of photocatalyst from visible light to 600 nm but also completely suppressed the competition H 2 evolution reaction. In order to elucidate the catalytic performance for NiAl-x in the photoreduction CO 2 reaction, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) were used to probe the local atomic structure of Ni in NiAl-x (x 275, 400, 600, 800) photocatalysts.As shown in Figs.S8 and S9, Ni K-edge XANES and K 1, 3 peaks in XES of NiAl-275 were shifted to higher energies compared with NiAl-x (x 400, 600, 800) and reference NiO, indicating the Ni atoms in NiAl-275 possessed a higher average oxidation ( 2), consistent with the Ni 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S10).From the k-space plot (Fig. 1C), the oscillation spectra of NiAl-200 and NiAl-250 were similar to NiAl-LDH, suggesting the LDH structure still maintained its structure even calcination at 250 C.However, the k-space spectrum of NiAl-275 showed different oscillations position at 8.8 A -1 and 9.9 A -1 compared with NiAl-LDH, but much similar to NiO, further indicating that NiAl-LDH has been converted to cubic NiO structure when calcination temperature higher than 275 C.concentration, positron annihilation spectrometry (PAS) was performed (Fig. S14).From the PAS analysis result (Table S4), we can give a conclusion that the concentration of vacancy in NiAl-x was decreasing with increasing the calcination temperature from 270 C to 800 C (NiAl-x, x 400, 600, 800).Moreover, compared with the Ni(OH) 2 -275 and the B-NiAl-275, the NiAl-275 also showed the highest oxidation state based on Ni adsorption edge and the lower N for Ni-O Ni-Ni shell, demonstrating NiAl-275 possess the highest structure disorder (Fig. S15) as mainly due to the special structure of NiAl-LDH precursor. The O 1s X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were also used to probe the fine structure of NiAl-x (x 275, 400, 600, 800).The O 1s XAS spectra directly related to unoccupied O p states mixed with metal-3d and metal-4sp states via hybridization, thus allow us to detect the Ni 3d state in the nanostructure NiO system 59.As shown in Fig. 1E, NiAl-LDH, NiAl-400, NiAl-600, and NiAl-800 showed a peak at 532 eV, which related to empty O 2p states covalently mixed with Ni 2 3d states 60.While NiAl-275 gave a new peak at 533 eV, which can be attributed to the formation of pyramidal symmetry NiO 5 structure in NiAl-275 rather than normal NiO 6 (Fig. S13B) 59,60.The abundant vacancy and pyramidal symmetry NiO structure in NiAl-275 influence the electronic state and could contribute to the catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 1F, the obervation that NiAl-275 containing V Ni and V O had the highest vacancy concentration amongst NiAl-x during the topological transformation process of NiAl-LDH has important implication, since NiAl-275 exhibited the highest selectivity of CH 4 in all products.The important role of vacancy concentration in NiO structure to the CO 2 PR is firmly confirmed. Wavelet transform (WT) analysis of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) was a powerful tool to analysis EXAFS data, which can provide not only radial distance resolution but also the resolution in k-space, could be used further to shed light on the position of Al atoms in NiAl-x during the topological transformation process 616263.In Fig. S16, the intensity maxima at the region 2 (R ) 3 A, 6 k 8 A -1 can be assign to the Ni-Ni/Al shell in NiO nanostructure.It's worth noting that the position of Ni-Ni/Al shell intensity maxima was 6.9 A -1 (NiAl-275), 7.2 A -1 (NiAl-400), 7.7 A -1 (NiAl-600), 8.0 A -1 (NiAl-800) and 8.0 A -1 (NiO) (Figs.S16,S17), demonstrate the atomic number of the surrounding atom for Ni at the second shell (Ni-Al or Ni-Ni) was getting increasing from NiAl-275 to NiAl-800.This phenomenon indicated that the Al atom was gradually separated out from the NiAl-x structure with increasing the calcination temperature. Since the NiAl-x catalysts were derived from NiAl-LDH precursor, the stepwise evolution of nanosheets morphology at different calcination temperatures was of particular interest regarding the possible active sites for photoreaction.A detail transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation was undertaken to identify the morphology and surface geometry of the NiAl-LDH precursor and NiAl-x.NiAl-LDH precursor showed a lateral size of 30 nm and the thickness of 5 nm with the lattice fringe spacing was 0.25 nm, which was referenced to the (012) planes of the LDH structure (Figs.S18,S19A) 64,65.After calcination at 275 C, the particle size of NiAl-275 was kept as 30 nm (Fig. 3A), and lattice fringe spacing was 0.24 nm and 0.21 nm, which was referenced to the (111) and (200) face of NiO (Fig. 3D) with an interfacial angle of 55.0, respectively, confirmed that the geometry of NiO crystals in NiAl-275 was dominated by the exposed 110 facets 66.Interestingly, the NiAl-275 showed uniformly distributed nanopores with a size of 1-3 nm (Fig. 3B,C).TEM data for NiAl-400 were similar to NiAl-275 (Fig. S20), they both have exposed facets 110 and the nanopores (2-5 nm).Further increased calcination temperature to 600 C, the nanopores was disappeared and small NiO ( 10 nm) was formed with exposing facet of 110 (Fig. S21).After calcination at 800 C, the size of the nanoparticles maintained at 10 nm (Fig. S22), besides the 110 faceted NiO, a new phase can be assigned to NiAl 2 O 4 31. Based on the information above, we can give a glimpse of the topologic transformation process for the NiAl-LDH: LDH layered structure was maintained when calcination temperature increase from room temperature to 250 C and part of the surface hydroxyl and intercalated water molecules, carbonate species of LDH were decomposed.When the calcined temperature increased to 275 C, along with the collapse of the LDH's layered structure, NiO was formed with the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies and nickel vacancies.Under this process, due to the loss of the surface hydroxyl, the pyramid structure NiO 5 was formed (Fig. S13B).Further increased the calcined temperature, the crystal structural was repaired and the defect concentration was geradually decreased.The Al atom was separated out and gave the formation of amorphous Al 2 O 3 during the whole process (Fig. S23). To reveal the optoelectronic properties of NiAl-x, the electrochemical impedance spectra and charge current density of defective NiAl-275 and NiAl-800 were investigated.As shown in the electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. 4A), NiAl-275 provided a significantly decreased charge-transfer resistance compared with NiAl-800, which is beneficial for the transfer and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in photocatalysis.The energy gap of NiAl-275 was determined by cyclic voltammetry.In Fig. 4B and Fig. S24, the cyclic voltammogram of NiAl-275 showed the oxidation peak at 0.63 eV and the reduction peak at -0.83 eV.And the corresponding band gap of NiAl-275 can be determined to be 1.46 eV, which was lower than NiAl-400 (1.63 eV), NiAl-600 (2.57eV), NiAl-800 (3.05 eV), and NiO standard sample (3.4-3.6 eV) 46.The decreased energy gap can be assigned to the contribution of V NiO .The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of NiAl-800 was also detected (0.40 m F cm -1 , Fig. S25 and Fig. 4C), higher than that of NiAl-275 (0.3 m F cm -1 ).The higher ECSA of NiAl-800 well explained the higher conversion in photo-reduction CO 2 reaction (Fig. 2A), while the higher selectivity for CH 4 in NiAl-275 with lower ECSA further indicated the selectivity to CH 4 is much related to the defect state rather than the ECAS, as discussed below.Moreover, in Fig. 4D, the NiAl-275 had an enhanced photocurrent intensity compared to the NiAl-800, confirming the better charge transfer ability of NiAl-275, in accordance with EIS result (Fig. 4A).Above all, it can be concluded that NiAl-275 containing abundant of V NiO can decrease charge-transfer resistance and enhance the photocurrent so that facilitate the CO 2 PR. Spin-polarized and Hubbard-corrected DFT U calculations were performed to explain the selectivity to CH 4 and also complete suppressed hydrogen evolution on NiO (V NiO ) under irradiation above 600 nm.At first, the geometries of the CO 2 reduction intermediates for NiO (no defect) and NiO (V NiO ) were optimized and displayed in Fig. 5A.The Gibbs free energy change (G) of each elementary step of CO 2 reduction on each model was calculated and listed in Fig. S26.Thus, the optimal reaction pathway of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 was screened, as shown in Fig. 5A.The Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction was 0.628 eV and 0.448 eV for NiO (no defect) and NiO (V NiO ), respectively.As shown in Fig. 5B, the Ni and O vacancies derived from the calcination of NiAl-LDH lowered the Gibbs free energy barrier for CO 2 reduction on NiO (V NiO ).On the other hand, the Gibbs free energy barriers of hydrogen evolution were calculated to be 0.538 eV, and 0.605 eV for NiO (no defect), and NiO (V NiO ), respectively. After that, the density of states for these 2 models was calculated and displayed in Fig. 5C.The bandgap energy of NiO (no defect) was calculated to be 1.370 eV.As highlighted in Fig. 5C, the introduction of Ni and O vacancies resulted in a defect state, mainly composed of Ni-3d orbitals, in the original forbidden zone of NiO (no defect).Then, with the work functions in Fig. S27, the band edge placement of the unoccupied defect state of NiO (V NiO ) was obtained with Equation (2).Thus, the driving force toward both CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution for the photogenerated electron located on the defect state of NiO (V NiO ) was calculated with Equation (4), being 0.519 eV, which was sufficient to overcome the Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction (0.448 eV), but not that for hydrogen evolution (0.605 eV).Above all, the whole mechanism for the complete prohibition of hydrogen evolution on NiO (V NiO ) was well explained in Fig. 5D.Under irradiation wavelength above 600 nm, the photogenerated electron of photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 transferred to the defect state of NiO (V NiO ), instead of the original CBM.The photogenerated electron located on the defect state of NiO (V NiO ) possessed a driving force (0.519 eV) that could only overcome the Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO.This character was not observed in NiO (no defect) since its driving force (0.695 eV) can conquer the Gibbs free energy barrier for both CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution."}, {"llm generation": "NiAl-x photocatalysts, as well as the precursor NiAl-LDH and referenced pure NiO sample", "source": "These NiAl-x photocatalysts, as well as the precursor NiAl-LDH and referenced pure NiO sample, were tested in CO 2 PR under visible light.", "context": "The NiO photocatalyst was synthesized through the topological transformation of NiAl-LDH precursor in the air atmosphere from 200 to 800 C.The thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to track the calcination process of NiAl-LDH.The TG-DTA showed two steps of consecutive weight-loss (Fig. S1), the first step from 30 to 250 C corresponding to the loss of adsorbed and intercalated water molecules, the second step of weight-loss can be assigned to the decomposition of the interlayered carbonate species and the collapse of the layered structure 32.The XRD pattern of NiAl-LDH precursor (Fig. 1A) showed typical (00l) basal reflection which can be indexed to a characteristic feature of layered structure NiAl-LDH phase 55.After calcination at a higher temperature, the d 003 of NiAl-200 and NiAl-250 shifted to 0.71 nm and 0.68 nm, respectively (the basal spacing d 003 of the precursor NiAl-LDH was 0.78 nm), which can be assigned to the release of interlayer water.The XRD pattern of NiAl-275 gave the absence of the characteristic (00l) reflections of the LDH precursor, indicating the LDH layer was collapse during heating at 275 C for 6 h.With further increasing the calcination temperature from 275 to 800 C, the intensity of NiO phases was getting higher.From the above XRD patterns, no spinel-like NiAl 2 O 4 (JCPDS 10-0339) phase was formed.And no crystal Al 2 O 3 phase can be detected, indicating the amorphous Al 2 O 3 phase in NiAl-x.

To reveal the optoelectronic properties of NiAl-x, the electrochemical impedance spectra and charge current density of defective NiAl-275 and NiAl-800 were investigated.As shown in the electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. 4A), NiAl-275 provided a significantly decreased charge-transfer resistance compared with NiAl-800, which is beneficial for the transfer and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in photocatalysis.The energy gap of NiAl-275 was determined by cyclic voltammetry.In Fig. 4B and Fig. S24, the cyclic voltammogram of NiAl-275 showed the oxidation peak at 0.63 eV and the reduction peak at -0.83 eV.And the corresponding band gap of NiAl-275 can be determined to be 1.46 eV, which was lower than NiAl-400 (1.63 eV), NiAl-600 (2.57eV), NiAl-800 (3.05 eV), and NiO standard sample (3.4-3.6 eV) 46.The decreased energy gap can be assigned to the contribution of V NiO .The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of NiAl-800 was also detected (0.40 m F cm -1 , Fig. S25 and Fig. 4C), higher than that of NiAl-275 (0.3 m F cm -1 ).The higher ECSA of NiAl-800 well explained the higher conversion in photo-reduction CO 2 reaction (Fig. 2A), while the higher selectivity for CH 4 in NiAl-275 with lower ECSA further indicated the selectivity to CH 4 is much related to the defect state rather than the ECAS, as discussed below.Moreover, in Fig. 4D, the NiAl-275 had an enhanced photocurrent intensity compared to the NiAl-800, confirming the better charge transfer ability of NiAl-275, in accordance with EIS result (Fig. 4A).Above all, it can be concluded that NiAl-275 containing abundant of V NiO can decrease charge-transfer resistance and enhance the photocurrent so that facilitate the CO 2 PR. Spin-polarized and Hubbard-corrected DFT U calculations were performed to explain the selectivity to CH 4 and also complete suppressed hydrogen evolution on NiO (V NiO ) under irradiation above 600 nm.At first, the geometries of the CO 2 reduction intermediates for NiO (no defect) and NiO (V NiO ) were optimized and displayed in Fig. 5A.The Gibbs free energy change (G) of each elementary step of CO 2 reduction on each model was calculated and listed in Fig. S26.Thus, the optimal reaction pathway of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 was screened, as shown in Fig. 5A.The Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction was 0.628 eV and 0.448 eV for NiO (no defect) and NiO (V NiO ), respectively.As shown in Fig. 5B, the Ni and O vacancies derived from the calcination of NiAl-LDH lowered the Gibbs free energy barrier for CO 2 reduction on NiO (V NiO ).On the other hand, the Gibbs free energy barriers of hydrogen evolution were calculated to be 0.538 eV, and 0.605 eV for NiO (no defect), and NiO (V NiO ), respectively. After that, the density of states for these 2 models was calculated and displayed in Fig. 5C.The bandgap energy of NiO (no defect) was calculated to be 1.370 eV.As highlighted in Fig. 5C, the introduction of Ni and O vacancies resulted in a defect state, mainly composed of Ni-3d orbitals, in the original forbidden zone of NiO (no defect).Then, with the work functions in Fig. S27, the band edge placement of the unoccupied defect state of NiO (V NiO ) was obtained with Equation (2).Thus, the driving force toward both CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution for the photogenerated electron located on the defect state of NiO (V NiO ) was calculated with Equation (4), being 0.519 eV, which was sufficient to overcome the Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction (0.448 eV), but not that for hydrogen evolution (0.605 eV).Above all, the whole mechanism for the complete prohibition of hydrogen evolution on NiO (V NiO ) was well explained in Fig. 5D.Under irradiation wavelength above 600 nm, the photogenerated electron of photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 transferred to the defect state of NiO (V NiO ), instead of the original CBM.The photogenerated electron located on the defect state of NiO (V NiO ) possessed a driving force (0.519 eV) that could only overcome the Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO.This character was not observed in NiO (no defect) since its driving force (0.695 eV) can conquer the Gibbs free energy barrier for both CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution."}, {"llm generation": "NiO (V NiO )", "source": "Spin-polarized and Hubbard-corrected DFT U calculations were performed to explain the selectivity to CH 4 and also complete suppressed hydrogen evolution on NiO (V NiO ) under irradiation above 600 nm.", "context": "The NiO photocatalyst was synthesized through the topological transformation of NiAl-LDH precursor in the air atmosphere from 200 to 800 C.The thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to track the calcination process of NiAl-LDH.The TG-DTA showed two steps of consecutive weight-loss (Fig. S1), the first step from 30 to 250 C corresponding to the loss of adsorbed and intercalated water molecules, the second step of weight-loss can be assigned to the decomposition of the interlayered carbonate species and the collapse of the layered structure 32.The XRD pattern of NiAl-LDH precursor (Fig. 1A) showed typical (00l) basal reflection which can be indexed to a characteristic feature of layered structure NiAl-LDH phase 55.After calcination at a higher temperature, the d 003 of NiAl-200 and NiAl-250 shifted to 0.71 nm and 0.68 nm, respectively (the basal spacing d 003 of the precursor NiAl-LDH was 0.78 nm), which can be assigned to the release of interlayer water.The XRD pattern of NiAl-275 gave the absence of the characteristic (00l) reflections of the LDH precursor, indicating the LDH layer was collapse during heating at 275 C for 6 h.With further increasing the calcination temperature from 275 to 800 C, the intensity of NiO phases was getting higher.From the above XRD patterns, no spinel-like NiAl 2 O 4 (JCPDS 10-0339) phase was formed.And no crystal Al 2 O 3 phase can be detected, indicating the amorphous Al 2 O 3 phase in NiAl-x. The UV-vis absorption diffuse reflectance spectra were collected from the NiAl-LDH and NiAl-x photocatalysts to gauge their light absorption behaviour for subsequent photocatalytic experiments (Fig. 1B).The NiAl-LDH precursor and NiAl-200 showed an absorption feature at visible wavelengths due to the presence of Ni 2 ions 56.After calcination NiAl-LDH from 200 to 800 C, the UV-vis absorption became much stronger through the whole range, while NiAl-275 and NiAl-400 showed the strongest visible light absorption, in accordance with their black appearance (Fig. S2) 57,58.With further increasing the calcination temperature, the intensity of light absorption for NiAl-600 and NiAl-800 was getting lower, which was consistent with the color change from black to green (Fig. S2). These NiAl-x photocatalysts, as well as the precursor NiAl-LDH and referenced pure NiO sample, were tested in CO 2 PR under visible light.The sole Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O without adding LDH photocatalysts showed poor activity with the yield of 20.3 mol g -1 h -1 for CO and undetectable CH 4 .(Fig. S3A).In Fig. 2A andB, NiAl-275 showed the best selectivity of CH 4 (22.8 ) in all products (CH 4 , CO, H 2 ) with the highest CH 4 production rate (95 mol g -1 h -1 ) among various samples.Further increasing the calcination temperature, the selectivity of CH 4 for NiAl-400 and NiAl-600 dropped to 8.4 and 1.4 respectively, while the NiO and NiAl-800 catalysts showed almost no CH 4 evolved (less then 1).It was noteworthy that the photocatalytic performance increased firstly and then decreased from 400 to 600 nm (Fig. 2A), which may be due to the light absorbance of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O photosensitizer (Fig. S6).Moreover, an isotopic labeling experiment using 13 CO 2 as the substrate (Fig. 2C) confirmed that the CO and CH 4 indeed originated from photocatalytic CO 2 by NiAl-275.After 5 times cycle, NiAl-275 showed no obviously reduce of selective and productivity, proving the stability of this photocatalyst (Fig. 2D, Figure S3B).Since NiAl-275 was composed by NiO and amorphous Al 2 O 3 phase, in order to detect the corresponding role in the CO 2 reduction, we prepared four reference samples to give a detailed study of the photoreduction CO 2 reaction (Fig. S4,S5 In recent years, most photocatalysts exhibited activity around 400-500 nm, limiting the solar energy-utilization efficiency since most of the visible light (500-800 nm) did not make full use.It is important to explore the photocatalytic activity under a wider absorption range (ideally near-infrared excitation ( 600 nm)) based on the utilized effective utilization of solar energy.Thus, we investigated the performance of NiAl-x under different wavelengths.Different filters for CO 2 PR over LDHs were presented in Fig. S7 and Table S2.As shown in Fig. 2E, F, the selectivity of CH 4 for NiAl-275 can be further optimized upto 38.0 ( 600 nm).More importantly, the H 2 can be totally suppressed under irradiation at 600 nm (Fig. 2E).This work not only widened the working wavelength of photocatalyst from visible light to 600 nm but also completely suppressed the competition H 2 evolution reaction. In order to elucidate the catalytic performance for NiAl-x in the photoreduction CO 2 reaction, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) were used to probe the local atomic structure of Ni in NiAl-x (x 275, 400, 600, 800) photocatalysts.As shown in Figs.S8 and S9, Ni K-edge XANES and K 1, 3 peaks in XES of NiAl-275 were shifted to higher energies compared with NiAl-x (x 400, 600, 800) and reference NiO, indicating the Ni atoms in NiAl-275 possessed a higher average oxidation ( 2), consistent with the Ni 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S10).From the k-space plot (Fig. 1C), the oscillation spectra of NiAl-200 and NiAl-250 were similar to NiAl-LDH, suggesting the LDH structure still maintained its structure even calcination at 250 C.However, the k-space spectrum of NiAl-275 showed different oscillations position at 8.8 A -1 and 9.9 A -1 compared with NiAl-LDH, but much similar to NiO, further indicating that NiAl-LDH has been converted to cubic NiO structure when calcination temperature higher than 275 C.concentration, positron annihilation spectrometry (PAS) was performed (Fig. S14).From the PAS analysis result (Table S4), we can give a conclusion that the concentration of vacancy in NiAl-x was decreasing with increasing the calcination temperature from 270 C to 800 C (NiAl-x, x 400, 600, 800).Moreover, compared with the Ni(OH) 2 -275 and the B-NiAl-275, the NiAl-275 also showed the highest oxidation state based on Ni adsorption edge and the lower N for Ni-O Ni-Ni shell, demonstrating NiAl-275 possess the highest structure disorder (Fig. S15) as mainly due to the special structure of NiAl-LDH precursor. The O 1s X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were also used to probe the fine structure of NiAl-x (x 275, 400, 600, 800).The O 1s XAS spectra directly related to unoccupied O p states mixed with metal-3d and metal-4sp states via hybridization, thus allow us to detect the Ni 3d state in the nanostructure NiO system 59.As shown in Fig. 1E, NiAl-LDH, NiAl-400, NiAl-600, and NiAl-800 showed a peak at 532 eV, which related to empty O 2p states covalently mixed with Ni 2 3d states 60.While NiAl-275 gave a new peak at 533 eV, which can be attributed to the formation of pyramidal symmetry NiO 5 structure in NiAl-275 rather than normal NiO 6 (Fig. S13B) 59,60.The abundant vacancy and pyramidal symmetry NiO structure in NiAl-275 influence the electronic state and could contribute to the catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 1F, the obervation that NiAl-275 containing V Ni and V O had the highest vacancy concentration amongst NiAl-x during the topological transformation process of NiAl-LDH has important implication, since NiAl-275 exhibited the highest selectivity of CH 4 in all products.The important role of vacancy concentration in NiO structure to the CO 2 PR is firmly confirmed. Wavelet transform (WT) analysis of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) was a powerful tool to analysis EXAFS data, which can provide not only radial distance resolution but also the resolution in k-space, could be used further to shed light on the position of Al atoms in NiAl-x during the topological transformation process 616263.In Fig. S16, the intensity maxima at the region 2 (R ) 3 A, 6 k 8 A -1 can be assign to the Ni-Ni/Al shell in NiO nanostructure.It's worth noting that the position of Ni-Ni/Al shell intensity maxima was 6.9 A -1 (NiAl-275), 7.2 A -1 (NiAl-400), 7.7 A -1 (NiAl-600), 8.0 A -1 (NiAl-800) and 8.0 A -1 (NiO) (Figs.S16,S17), demonstrate the atomic number of the surrounding atom for Ni at the second shell (Ni-Al or Ni-Ni) was getting increasing from NiAl-275 to NiAl-800.This phenomenon indicated that the Al atom was gradually separated out from the NiAl-x structure with increasing the calcination temperature. Since the NiAl-x catalysts were derived from NiAl-LDH precursor, the stepwise evolution of nanosheets morphology at different calcination temperatures was of particular interest regarding the possible active sites for photoreaction.A detail transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation was undertaken to identify the morphology and surface geometry of the NiAl-LDH precursor and NiAl-x.NiAl-LDH precursor showed a lateral size of 30 nm and the thickness of 5 nm with the lattice fringe spacing was 0.25 nm, which was referenced to the (012) planes of the LDH structure (Figs.S18,S19A) 64,65.After calcination at 275 C, the particle size of NiAl-275 was kept as 30 nm (Fig. 3A), and lattice fringe spacing was 0.24 nm and 0.21 nm, which was referenced to the (111) and (200) face of NiO (Fig. 3D) with an interfacial angle of 55.0, respectively, confirmed that the geometry of NiO crystals in NiAl-275 was dominated by the exposed 110 facets 66.Interestingly, the NiAl-275 showed uniformly distributed nanopores with a size of 1-3 nm (Fig. 3B,C).TEM data for NiAl-400 were similar to NiAl-275 (Fig. S20), they both have exposed facets 110 and the nanopores (2-5 nm).Further increased calcination temperature to 600 C, the nanopores was disappeared and small NiO ( 10 nm) was formed with exposing facet of 110 (Fig. S21).After calcination at 800 C, the size of the nanoparticles maintained at 10 nm (Fig. S22), besides the 110 faceted NiO, a new phase can be assigned to NiAl 2 O 4 31.

The O 1s X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were also used to probe the fine structure of NiAl-x (x 275, 400, 600, 800).The O 1s XAS spectra directly related to unoccupied O p states mixed with metal-3d and metal-4sp states via hybridization, thus allow us to detect the Ni 3d state in the nanostructure NiO system 59.As shown in Fig. 1E, NiAl-LDH, NiAl-400, NiAl-600, and NiAl-800 showed a peak at 532 eV, which related to empty O 2p states covalently mixed with Ni 2 3d states 60.While NiAl-275 gave a new peak at 533 eV, which can be attributed to the formation of pyramidal symmetry NiO 5 structure in NiAl-275 rather than normal NiO 6 (Fig. S13B) 59,60.The abundant vacancy and pyramidal symmetry NiO structure in NiAl-275 influence the electronic state and could contribute to the catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 1F, the obervation that NiAl-275 containing V Ni and V O had the highest vacancy concentration amongst NiAl-x during the topological transformation process of NiAl-LDH has important implication, since NiAl-275 exhibited the highest selectivity of CH 4 in all products.The important role of vacancy concentration in NiO structure to the CO 2 PR is firmly confirmed. Wavelet transform (WT) analysis of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) was a powerful tool to analysis EXAFS data, which can provide not only radial distance resolution but also the resolution in k-space, could be used further to shed light on the position of Al atoms in NiAl-x during the topological transformation process 616263.In Fig. S16, the intensity maxima at the region 2 (R ) 3 A, 6 k 8 A -1 can be assign to the Ni-Ni/Al shell in NiO nanostructure.It's worth noting that the position of Ni-Ni/Al shell intensity maxima was 6.9 A -1 (NiAl-275), 7.2 A -1 (NiAl-400), 7.7 A -1 (NiAl-600), 8.0 A -1 (NiAl-800) and 8.0 A -1 (NiO) (Figs.S16,S17), demonstrate the atomic number of the surrounding atom for Ni at the second shell (Ni-Al or Ni-Ni) was getting increasing from NiAl-275 to NiAl-800.This phenomenon indicated that the Al atom was gradually separated out from the NiAl-x structure with increasing the calcination temperature. Since the NiAl-x catalysts were derived from NiAl-LDH precursor, the stepwise evolution of nanosheets morphology at different calcination temperatures was of particular interest regarding the possible active sites for photoreaction.A detail transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation was undertaken to identify the morphology and surface geometry of the NiAl-LDH precursor and NiAl-x.NiAl-LDH precursor showed a lateral size of 30 nm and the thickness of 5 nm with the lattice fringe spacing was 0.25 nm, which was referenced to the (012) planes of the LDH structure (Figs.S18,S19A) 64,65.After calcination at 275 C, the particle size of NiAl-275 was kept as 30 nm (Fig. 3A), and lattice fringe spacing was 0.24 nm and 0.21 nm, which was referenced to the (111) and (200) face of NiO (Fig. 3D) with an interfacial angle of 55.0, respectively, confirmed that the geometry of NiO crystals in NiAl-275 was dominated by the exposed 110 facets 66.Interestingly, the NiAl-275 showed uniformly distributed nanopores with a size of 1-3 nm (Fig. 3B,C).TEM data for NiAl-400 were similar to NiAl-275 (Fig. S20), they both have exposed facets 110 and the nanopores (2-5 nm).Further increased calcination temperature to 600 C, the nanopores was disappeared and small NiO ( 10 nm) was formed with exposing facet of 110 (Fig. S21).After calcination at 800 C, the size of the nanoparticles maintained at 10 nm (Fig. S22), besides the 110 faceted NiO, a new phase can be assigned to NiAl 2 O 4 31. Based on the information above, we can give a glimpse of the topologic transformation process for the NiAl-LDH: LDH layered structure was maintained when calcination temperature increase from room temperature to 250 C and part of the surface hydroxyl and intercalated water molecules, carbonate species of LDH were decomposed.When the calcined temperature increased to 275 C, along with the collapse of the LDH's layered structure, NiO was formed with the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies and nickel vacancies.Under this process, due to the loss of the surface hydroxyl, the pyramid structure NiO 5 was formed (Fig. S13B).Further increased the calcined temperature, the crystal structural was repaired and the defect concentration was geradually decreased.The Al atom was separated out and gave the formation of amorphous Al 2 O 3 during the whole process (Fig. S23). To reveal the optoelectronic properties of NiAl-x, the electrochemical impedance spectra and charge current density of defective NiAl-275 and NiAl-800 were investigated.As shown in the electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. 4A), NiAl-275 provided a significantly decreased charge-transfer resistance compared with NiAl-800, which is beneficial for the transfer and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in photocatalysis.The energy gap of NiAl-275 was determined by cyclic voltammetry.In Fig. 4B and Fig. S24, the cyclic voltammogram of NiAl-275 showed the oxidation peak at 0.63 eV and the reduction peak at -0.83 eV.And the corresponding band gap of NiAl-275 can be determined to be 1.46 eV, which was lower than NiAl-400 (1.63 eV), NiAl-600 (2.57eV), NiAl-800 (3.05 eV), and NiO standard sample (3.4-3.6 eV) 46.The decreased energy gap can be assigned to the contribution of V NiO .The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of NiAl-800 was also detected (0.40 m F cm -1 , Fig. S25 and Fig. 4C), higher than that of NiAl-275 (0.3 m F cm -1 ).The higher ECSA of NiAl-800 well explained the higher conversion in photo-reduction CO 2 reaction (Fig. 2A), while the higher selectivity for CH 4 in NiAl-275 with lower ECSA further indicated the selectivity to CH 4 is much related to the defect state rather than the ECAS, as discussed below.Moreover, in Fig. 4D, the NiAl-275 had an enhanced photocurrent intensity compared to the NiAl-800, confirming the better charge transfer ability of NiAl-275, in accordance with EIS result (Fig. 4A).Above all, it can be concluded that NiAl-275 containing abundant of V NiO can decrease charge-transfer resistance and enhance the photocurrent so that facilitate the CO 2 PR. Spin-polarized and Hubbard-corrected DFT U calculations were performed to explain the selectivity to CH 4 and also complete suppressed hydrogen evolution on NiO (V NiO ) under irradiation above 600 nm.At first, the geometries of the CO 2 reduction intermediates for NiO (no defect) and NiO (V NiO ) were optimized and displayed in Fig. 5A.The Gibbs free energy change (G) of each elementary step of CO 2 reduction on each model was calculated and listed in Fig. S26.Thus, the optimal reaction pathway of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 was screened, as shown in Fig. 5A.The Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction was 0.628 eV and 0.448 eV for NiO (no defect) and NiO (V NiO ), respectively.As shown in Fig. 5B, the Ni and O vacancies derived from the calcination of NiAl-LDH lowered the Gibbs free energy barrier for CO 2 reduction on NiO (V NiO ).On the other hand, the Gibbs free energy barriers of hydrogen evolution were calculated to be 0.538 eV, and 0.605 eV for NiO (no defect), and NiO (V NiO ), respectively. After that, the density of states for these 2 models was calculated and displayed in Fig. 5C.The bandgap energy of NiO (no defect) was calculated to be 1.370 eV.As highlighted in Fig. 5C, the introduction of Ni and O vacancies resulted in a defect state, mainly composed of Ni-3d orbitals, in the original forbidden zone of NiO (no defect).Then, with the work functions in Fig. S27, the band edge placement of the unoccupied defect state of NiO (V NiO ) was obtained with Equation (2).Thus, the driving force toward both CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution for the photogenerated electron located on the defect state of NiO (V NiO ) was calculated with Equation (4), being 0.519 eV, which was sufficient to overcome the Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction (0.448 eV), but not that for hydrogen evolution (0.605 eV).Above all, the whole mechanism for the complete prohibition of hydrogen evolution on NiO (V NiO ) was well explained in Fig. 5D.Under irradiation wavelength above 600 nm, the photogenerated electron of photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 transferred to the defect state of NiO (V NiO ), instead of the original CBM.The photogenerated electron located on the defect state of NiO (V NiO ) possessed a driving force (0.519 eV) that could only overcome the Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO.This character was not observed in NiO (no defect) since its driving force (0.695 eV) can conquer the Gibbs free energy barrier for both CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution."}, {"llm generation": "NiO", "source": "Here in, we successfully synthesized a series of NiO with different amounts of V NiO by using the topological transformation of the NiAl-LDH.", "context": "Here in, we successfully synthesized a series of NiO with different amounts of V NiO by using the topological transformation of the NiAl-LDH.As increasing the concertation of V NiO , the selectivity of CH 4 increased from 0.4 to 22.8.More importantly under irradiation with 600 nm, the H 2 evolution reaction has completely suppressed and the selectivity of CH 4 can be further improved to 38.5.Further, DFT U calculations revealed that the Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 decreased from 0.628 eV to 0.448 eV due to the existence of V NiO in NiAl-275.Under 600 nm, NiO with V NiO possessed a driving force (0.519 eV) that could only overcome the Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO (0.448 eV), rather than that for H 2 evolution (0.605 eV).This work may pave a way for the rational design defect materials toward the photo-reduction CO 2 reaction.The density of states for NiO (no defect), and NiO (V NiO ), where the defect state is highlighted; D) Schematic illustration for the complete suppressed of hydrogen evolution on NiO (V NiO ) under irradiation above 600 nm.

The supercell of bulk NiO was 2 2 2 in the a-, b-, and cdirections.Thus, the chemical formula of bulk NiO was Ni 32 O 32 .Then, the model of NiO (no defect) was built by cleaving the 110 facet of bulk NiO since the 110 facet was found to be the preferably exposed facet by experimental observation.The model of NiO (no defect) contained 4 layers of Ni and O atoms and a vacuum layer of 15 A.Thus, the chemical formula of NiO (no defect) was Ni 16 O 16 .The model of NiO (V NiO ) was constructed through creating 1 Ni vacancy and 1 O vacancy in model NiO (no defect), thus possessing the chemical formula of Ni 15 O 15 . ): 1.

Ni(OH) 2 calcinated at 275 C (denoted as Ni(OH) 2 -275); 4.

Visible-light CO 2 reduction experiments of CO 2 with H 2 O were carried out in a closed stainless reactor (volume: 50 mL) with a top window for light irradiation.The catalytic system contained H 2 O/ACN (acetonitrile) mixture, using Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (bpy 2'2-bipyridine) as photosensitizer and TEOA (triethanolamine) as a sacrificial agent under 0.18 MPa CO 2 , referring to the typical testing condition 40,41.First of all, NiAl-x (10 mg) were dispersed in solution (10 mL) with H 2 O: CH 3 CN: TEOA 1:3:1 (v/v/v), and then 3.3 mg Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O was added into the mixture solution.Before the reduction experiments, the reactor was evacuated by a pump and refilled with pure CO 2 3 times in total.Finally, CO 2 (Beijing Beiwen Gas Comp.99.999) was filled into the reactor until the pressure of 0.18 MPa.The performance of all catalysts was tested under the irradiation of 300 W Xe lamp with the wavelength from 400-800 nm under stirring.The optical density was 568 mWcm 2 and the distance was 11 cm between the reaction equipment and light.The produced gas was analyzed by Shimadzu GC-2014 chromatography, which was equipped with both FID and TCD detectors.The isotopic experiments were designed under the same conditions as above using 13 CO 2 and the products were checked by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, QP2020).Scheme 1.

In order to illustrate the intriguing CO 2 reduction performance on NiAl-LDH and NiAl-x under irradiation above 600 nm, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to shed light on the theoretical view of Gibbs free energy barrier and photocatalytic driving force.First of all, according to the experimental measurement, the calcined product of NiAl-LDH at the calcining temperature of 275 C (NiAl-275) was determined to be NiO containing Ni and O vacancies (the model was denoted as NiO (V NiO )).In order to reveal the essential role of Ni and O defects, NiO without defect was taken into consideration as comparison and named as NiO (no defect). The model of bulk NiO was built using the space group of Fm 3 m, with the lattice parameters of a b c 4.17 A, 90o 42 The spin-polarized and Hubbard-corrected DFT (DFT U) calculations were carried out in the CASTEP code in Accelrys Materials Studio version 6.1 software package (Accelrys Software Inc., San Diego, CA) 43.The plane wave implementation 44 at the level of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) 45 was used.The Hubbard correction was employed to Ni, with the value of U -J (U eff ) set as 3.8 eV referred to the unrestricted Hartree-Fock theory calculations 46.The norm-conserving pseudopotential was used to describe the ionic core in calculating the Kohn-Sham equations 47.The Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm was employed in searching for the potential energy surface 48.The cutoff energy of 660 eV was set.The geometry optimization was based on the following points: (1) an energy tolerance of 2.0 10 -6 eV per atom, (2) a maximum displacement tolerance of 1.0 10 -4 A, and (3) a maximum force tolerance of 0.01 eV/A.When calculating the density of states, the -point-centered k-point mesh for the Brillouin zone integration was 6 6 3 in the a-, b-, and c-directions. Firstly, the bandgap energies (E g ) and Fermi levels (E F ) of NiO (no defect) and NiO (V NiO ) were obtained through their density of states.The work function (W) can be obtained with Eq. ( 1) 49: Where e was the charge of the electron, was the electrostatic potential away from the surface at the distance where the potential energy had reached its asymptotic value (i.e., vacuum level).Thus the band edge placements of the conduction band minimum (E CBM ) and valence band maximum (E VBM ) were obtained with Equition 2 and 3 50,51: The driving force, E df , for both photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction was assumed to be the difference between E CBM of photocatalyst and the reversible hydrogen electrode potential at pH 7 51,52.Therefore, the E df could be calculated with Equition 4: The possible elementary steps for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO were displayed in Scheme S1.Then the reaction formula for each elementary step was listed in Table S1.Typically, the Gibbs free energy change (G) of each elementary step equalled the difference between the Gibbs free energy of product and that of reactant.The detailed equations were listed in Table S1, too.The G for the elementary step in hydrogen evolution reaction was calculated with Equition 5 and 6, respectively. The Gibbs free energy barrier for the whole CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction, G CO2PR and G HER were equal to the G of the most difficult elementary step in the optimal reaction pathway.The computational standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) approximation was applied so that the Gibbs free energy of H e -could be replaced with that of 0.5H 2 at U 0 V vs SHE 53.The Gibbs free energies of molecules and intermediates were obtained by calculating their phonon density of states 54. The energy levels of the excited state for photosensitizer Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 were the same as our previous work 12."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "These NiAl-x photocatalysts, as well as the precursor NiAl-LDH and referenced pure NiO sample, were tested in CO 2 PR under visible light.", "context": "The NiO photocatalyst was synthesized through the topological transformation of NiAl-LDH precursor in the air atmosphere from 200 to 800 C.The thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to track the calcination process of NiAl-LDH.The TG-DTA showed two steps of consecutive weight-loss (Fig. S1), the first step from 30 to 250 C corresponding to the loss of adsorbed and intercalated water molecules, the second step of weight-loss can be assigned to the decomposition of the interlayered carbonate species and the collapse of the layered structure 32.The XRD pattern of NiAl-LDH precursor (Fig. 1A) showed typical (00l) basal reflection which can be indexed to a characteristic feature of layered structure NiAl-LDH phase 55.After calcination at a higher temperature, the d 003 of NiAl-200 and NiAl-250 shifted to 0.71 nm and 0.68 nm, respectively (the basal spacing d 003 of the precursor NiAl-LDH was 0.78 nm), which can be assigned to the release of interlayer water.The XRD pattern of NiAl-275 gave the absence of the characteristic (00l) reflections of the LDH precursor, indicating the LDH layer was collapse during heating at 275 C for 6 h.With further increasing the calcination temperature from 275 to 800 C, the intensity of NiO phases was getting higher.From the above XRD patterns, no spinel-like NiAl 2 O 4 (JCPDS 10-0339) phase was formed.And no crystal Al 2 O 3 phase can be detected, indicating the amorphous Al 2 O 3 phase in NiAl-x. The UV-vis absorption diffuse reflectance spectra were collected from the NiAl-LDH and NiAl-x photocatalysts to gauge their light absorption behaviour for subsequent photocatalytic experiments (Fig. 1B).The NiAl-LDH precursor and NiAl-200 showed an absorption feature at visible wavelengths due to the presence of Ni 2 ions 56.After calcination NiAl-LDH from 200 to 800 C, the UV-vis absorption became much stronger through the whole range, while NiAl-275 and NiAl-400 showed the strongest visible light absorption, in accordance with their black appearance (Fig. S2) 57,58.With further increasing the calcination temperature, the intensity of light absorption for NiAl-600 and NiAl-800 was getting lower, which was consistent with the color change from black to green (Fig. S2). These NiAl-x photocatalysts, as well as the precursor NiAl-LDH and referenced pure NiO sample, were tested in CO 2 PR under visible light.The sole Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O without adding LDH photocatalysts showed poor activity with the yield of 20.3 mol g -1 h -1 for CO and undetectable CH 4 .(Fig. S3A).In Fig. 2A andB, NiAl-275 showed the best selectivity of CH 4 (22.8 ) in all products (CH 4 , CO, H 2 ) with the highest CH 4 production rate (95 mol g -1 h -1 ) among various samples.Further increasing the calcination temperature, the selectivity of CH 4 for NiAl-400 and NiAl-600 dropped to 8.4 and 1.4 respectively, while the NiO and NiAl-800 catalysts showed almost no CH 4 evolved (less then 1).It was noteworthy that the photocatalytic performance increased firstly and then decreased from 400 to 600 nm (Fig. 2A), which may be due to the light absorbance of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O photosensitizer (Fig. S6).Moreover, an isotopic labeling experiment using 13 CO 2 as the substrate (Fig. 2C) confirmed that the CO and CH 4 indeed originated from photocatalytic CO 2 by NiAl-275.After 5 times cycle, NiAl-275 showed no obviously reduce of selective and productivity, proving the stability of this photocatalyst (Fig. 2D, Figure S3B).Since NiAl-275 was composed by NiO and amorphous Al 2 O 3 phase, in order to detect the corresponding role in the CO 2 reduction, we prepared four reference samples to give a detailed study of the photoreduction CO 2 reaction (Fig. S4,S5 In recent years, most photocatalysts exhibited activity around 400-500 nm, limiting the solar energy-utilization efficiency since most of the visible light (500-800 nm) did not make full use.It is important to explore the photocatalytic activity under a wider absorption range (ideally near-infrared excitation ( 600 nm)) based on the utilized effective utilization of solar energy.Thus, we investigated the performance of NiAl-x under different wavelengths.Different filters for CO 2 PR over LDHs were presented in Fig. S7 and Table S2.As shown in Fig. 2E, F, the selectivity of CH 4 for NiAl-275 can be further optimized upto 38.0 ( 600 nm).More importantly, the H 2 can be totally suppressed under irradiation at 600 nm (Fig. 2E).This work not only widened the working wavelength of photocatalyst from visible light to 600 nm but also completely suppressed the competition H 2 evolution reaction. In order to elucidate the catalytic performance for NiAl-x in the photoreduction CO 2 reaction, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) were used to probe the local atomic structure of Ni in NiAl-x (x 275, 400, 600, 800) photocatalysts.As shown in Figs.S8 and S9, Ni K-edge XANES and K 1, 3 peaks in XES of NiAl-275 were shifted to higher energies compared with NiAl-x (x 400, 600, 800) and reference NiO, indicating the Ni atoms in NiAl-275 possessed a higher average oxidation ( 2), consistent with the Ni 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S10).From the k-space plot (Fig. 1C), the oscillation spectra of NiAl-200 and NiAl-250 were similar to NiAl-LDH, suggesting the LDH structure still maintained its structure even calcination at 250 C.However, the k-space spectrum of NiAl-275 showed different oscillations position at 8.8 A -1 and 9.9 A -1 compared with NiAl-LDH, but much similar to NiO, further indicating that NiAl-LDH has been converted to cubic NiO structure when calcination temperature higher than 275 C.concentration, positron annihilation spectrometry (PAS) was performed (Fig. S14).From the PAS analysis result (Table S4), we can give a conclusion that the concentration of vacancy in NiAl-x was decreasing with increasing the calcination temperature from 270 C to 800 C (NiAl-x, x 400, 600, 800).Moreover, compared with the Ni(OH) 2 -275 and the B-NiAl-275, the NiAl-275 also showed the highest oxidation state based on Ni adsorption edge and the lower N for Ni-O Ni-Ni shell, demonstrating NiAl-275 possess the highest structure disorder (Fig. S15) as mainly due to the special structure of NiAl-LDH precursor. The O 1s X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were also used to probe the fine structure of NiAl-x (x 275, 400, 600, 800).The O 1s XAS spectra directly related to unoccupied O p states mixed with metal-3d and metal-4sp states via hybridization, thus allow us to detect the Ni 3d state in the nanostructure NiO system 59.As shown in Fig. 1E, NiAl-LDH, NiAl-400, NiAl-600, and NiAl-800 showed a peak at 532 eV, which related to empty O 2p states covalently mixed with Ni 2 3d states 60.While NiAl-275 gave a new peak at 533 eV, which can be attributed to the formation of pyramidal symmetry NiO 5 structure in NiAl-275 rather than normal NiO 6 (Fig. S13B) 59,60.The abundant vacancy and pyramidal symmetry NiO structure in NiAl-275 influence the electronic state and could contribute to the catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 1F, the obervation that NiAl-275 containing V Ni and V O had the highest vacancy concentration amongst NiAl-x during the topological transformation process of NiAl-LDH has important implication, since NiAl-275 exhibited the highest selectivity of CH 4 in all products.The important role of vacancy concentration in NiO structure to the CO 2 PR is firmly confirmed. Wavelet transform (WT) analysis of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) was a powerful tool to analysis EXAFS data, which can provide not only radial distance resolution but also the resolution in k-space, could be used further to shed light on the position of Al atoms in NiAl-x during the topological transformation process 616263.In Fig. S16, the intensity maxima at the region 2 (R ) 3 A, 6 k 8 A -1 can be assign to the Ni-Ni/Al shell in NiO nanostructure.It's worth noting that the position of Ni-Ni/Al shell intensity maxima was 6.9 A -1 (NiAl-275), 7.2 A -1 (NiAl-400), 7.7 A -1 (NiAl-600), 8.0 A -1 (NiAl-800) and 8.0 A -1 (NiO) (Figs.S16,S17), demonstrate the atomic number of the surrounding atom for Ni at the second shell (Ni-Al or Ni-Ni) was getting increasing from NiAl-275 to NiAl-800.This phenomenon indicated that the Al atom was gradually separated out from the NiAl-x structure with increasing the calcination temperature. Since the NiAl-x catalysts were derived from NiAl-LDH precursor, the stepwise evolution of nanosheets morphology at different calcination temperatures was of particular interest regarding the possible active sites for photoreaction.A detail transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation was undertaken to identify the morphology and surface geometry of the NiAl-LDH precursor and NiAl-x.NiAl-LDH precursor showed a lateral size of 30 nm and the thickness of 5 nm with the lattice fringe spacing was 0.25 nm, which was referenced to the (012) planes of the LDH structure (Figs.S18,S19A) 64,65.After calcination at 275 C, the particle size of NiAl-275 was kept as 30 nm (Fig. 3A), and lattice fringe spacing was 0.24 nm and 0.21 nm, which was referenced to the (111) and (200) face of NiO (Fig. 3D) with an interfacial angle of 55.0, respectively, confirmed that the geometry of NiO crystals in NiAl-275 was dominated by the exposed 110 facets 66.Interestingly, the NiAl-275 showed uniformly distributed nanopores with a size of 1-3 nm (Fig. 3B,C).TEM data for NiAl-400 were similar to NiAl-275 (Fig. S20), they both have exposed facets 110 and the nanopores (2-5 nm).Further increased calcination temperature to 600 C, the nanopores was disappeared and small NiO ( 10 nm) was formed with exposing facet of 110 (Fig. S21).After calcination at 800 C, the size of the nanoparticles maintained at 10 nm (Fig. S22), besides the 110 faceted NiO, a new phase can be assigned to NiAl 2 O 4 31. Based on the information above, we can give a glimpse of the topologic transformation process for the NiAl-LDH: LDH layered structure was maintained when calcination temperature increase from room temperature to 250 C and part of the surface hydroxyl and intercalated water molecules, carbonate species of LDH were decomposed.When the calcined temperature increased to 275 C, along with the collapse of the LDH's layered structure, NiO was formed with the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies and nickel vacancies.Under this process, due to the loss of the surface hydroxyl, the pyramid structure NiO 5 was formed (Fig. S13B).Further increased the calcined temperature, the crystal structural was repaired and the defect concentration was geradually decreased.The Al atom was separated out and gave the formation of amorphous Al 2 O 3 during the whole process (Fig. S23). To reveal the optoelectronic properties of NiAl-x, the electrochemical impedance spectra and charge current density of defective NiAl-275 and NiAl-800 were investigated.As shown in the electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. 4A), NiAl-275 provided a significantly decreased charge-transfer resistance compared with NiAl-800, which is beneficial for the transfer and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in photocatalysis.The energy gap of NiAl-275 was determined by cyclic voltammetry.In Fig. 4B and Fig. S24, the cyclic voltammogram of NiAl-275 showed the oxidation peak at 0.63 eV and the reduction peak at -0.83 eV.And the corresponding band gap of NiAl-275 can be determined to be 1.46 eV, which was lower than NiAl-400 (1.63 eV), NiAl-600 (2.57eV), NiAl-800 (3.05 eV), and NiO standard sample (3.4-3.6 eV) 46.The decreased energy gap can be assigned to the contribution of V NiO .The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of NiAl-800 was also detected (0.40 m F cm -1 , Fig. S25 and Fig. 4C), higher than that of NiAl-275 (0.3 m F cm -1 ).The higher ECSA of NiAl-800 well explained the higher conversion in photo-reduction CO 2 reaction (Fig. 2A), while the higher selectivity for CH 4 in NiAl-275 with lower ECSA further indicated the selectivity to CH 4 is much related to the defect state rather than the ECAS, as discussed below.Moreover, in Fig. 4D, the NiAl-275 had an enhanced photocurrent intensity compared to the NiAl-800, confirming the better charge transfer ability of NiAl-275, in accordance with EIS result (Fig. 4A).Above all, it can be concluded that NiAl-275 containing abundant of V NiO can decrease charge-transfer resistance and enhance the photocurrent so that facilitate the CO 2 PR. Spin-polarized and Hubbard-corrected DFT U calculations were performed to explain the selectivity to CH 4 and also complete suppressed hydrogen evolution on NiO (V NiO ) under irradiation above 600 nm.At first, the geometries of the CO 2 reduction intermediates for NiO (no defect) and NiO (V NiO ) were optimized and displayed in Fig. 5A.The Gibbs free energy change (G) of each elementary step of CO 2 reduction on each model was calculated and listed in Fig. S26.Thus, the optimal reaction pathway of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 was screened, as shown in Fig. 5A.The Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction was 0.628 eV and 0.448 eV for NiO (no defect) and NiO (V NiO ), respectively.As shown in Fig. 5B, the Ni and O vacancies derived from the calcination of NiAl-LDH lowered the Gibbs free energy barrier for CO 2 reduction on NiO (V NiO ).On the other hand, the Gibbs free energy barriers of hydrogen evolution were calculated to be 0.538 eV, and 0.605 eV for NiO (no defect), and NiO (V NiO ), respectively. After that, the density of states for these 2 models was calculated and displayed in Fig. 5C.The bandgap energy of NiO (no defect) was calculated to be 1.370 eV.As highlighted in Fig. 5C, the introduction of Ni and O vacancies resulted in a defect state, mainly composed of Ni-3d orbitals, in the original forbidden zone of NiO (no defect).Then, with the work functions in Fig. S27, the band edge placement of the unoccupied defect state of NiO (V NiO ) was obtained with Equation (2).Thus, the driving force toward both CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution for the photogenerated electron located on the defect state of NiO (V NiO ) was calculated with Equation (4), being 0.519 eV, which was sufficient to overcome the Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction (0.448 eV), but not that for hydrogen evolution (0.605 eV).Above all, the whole mechanism for the complete prohibition of hydrogen evolution on NiO (V NiO ) was well explained in Fig. 5D.Under irradiation wavelength above 600 nm, the photogenerated electron of photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 transferred to the defect state of NiO (V NiO ), instead of the original CBM.The photogenerated electron located on the defect state of NiO (V NiO ) possessed a driving force (0.519 eV) that could only overcome the Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO.This character was not observed in NiO (no defect) since its driving force (0.695 eV) can conquer the Gibbs free energy barrier for both CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "In recent years, most photocatalysts exhibited activity around 400-500 nm, limiting the solar energy-utilization efficiency since most of the visible light (500-800 nm) did not make full use.", "context": "The NiO photocatalyst was synthesized through the topological transformation of NiAl-LDH precursor in the air atmosphere from 200 to 800 C.The thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to track the calcination process of NiAl-LDH.The TG-DTA showed two steps of consecutive weight-loss (Fig. S1), the first step from 30 to 250 C corresponding to the loss of adsorbed and intercalated water molecules, the second step of weight-loss can be assigned to the decomposition of the interlayered carbonate species and the collapse of the layered structure 32.The XRD pattern of NiAl-LDH precursor (Fig. 1A) showed typical (00l) basal reflection which can be indexed to a characteristic feature of layered structure NiAl-LDH phase 55.After calcination at a higher temperature, the d 003 of NiAl-200 and NiAl-250 shifted to 0.71 nm and 0.68 nm, respectively (the basal spacing d 003 of the precursor NiAl-LDH was 0.78 nm), which can be assigned to the release of interlayer water.The XRD pattern of NiAl-275 gave the absence of the characteristic (00l) reflections of the LDH precursor, indicating the LDH layer was collapse during heating at 275 C for 6 h.With further increasing the calcination temperature from 275 to 800 C, the intensity of NiO phases was getting higher.From the above XRD patterns, no spinel-like NiAl 2 O 4 (JCPDS 10-0339) phase was formed.And no crystal Al 2 O 3 phase can be detected, indicating the amorphous Al 2 O 3 phase in NiAl-x.

Based on the information above, we can give a glimpse of the topologic transformation process for the NiAl-LDH: LDH layered structure was maintained when calcination temperature increase from room temperature to 250 C and part of the surface hydroxyl and intercalated water molecules, carbonate species of LDH were decomposed.When the calcined temperature increased to 275 C, along with the collapse of the LDH's layered structure, NiO was formed with the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies and nickel vacancies.Under this process, due to the loss of the surface hydroxyl, the pyramid structure NiO 5 was formed (Fig. S13B).Further increased the calcined temperature, the crystal structural was repaired and the defect concentration was geradually decreased.The Al atom was separated out and gave the formation of amorphous Al 2 O 3 during the whole process (Fig. S23). To reveal the optoelectronic properties of NiAl-x, the electrochemical impedance spectra and charge current density of defective NiAl-275 and NiAl-800 were investigated.As shown in the electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. 4A), NiAl-275 provided a significantly decreased charge-transfer resistance compared with NiAl-800, which is beneficial for the transfer and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in photocatalysis.The energy gap of NiAl-275 was determined by cyclic voltammetry.In Fig. 4B and Fig. S24, the cyclic voltammogram of NiAl-275 showed the oxidation peak at 0.63 eV and the reduction peak at -0.83 eV.And the corresponding band gap of NiAl-275 can be determined to be 1.46 eV, which was lower than NiAl-400 (1.63 eV), NiAl-600 (2.57eV), NiAl-800 (3.05 eV), and NiO standard sample (3.4-3.6 eV) 46.The decreased energy gap can be assigned to the contribution of V NiO .The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of NiAl-800 was also detected (0.40 m F cm -1 , Fig. S25 and Fig. 4C), higher than that of NiAl-275 (0.3 m F cm -1 ).The higher ECSA of NiAl-800 well explained the higher conversion in photo-reduction CO 2 reaction (Fig. 2A), while the higher selectivity for CH 4 in NiAl-275 with lower ECSA further indicated the selectivity to CH 4 is much related to the defect state rather than the ECAS, as discussed below.Moreover, in Fig. 4D, the NiAl-275 had an enhanced photocurrent intensity compared to the NiAl-800, confirming the better charge transfer ability of NiAl-275, in accordance with EIS result (Fig. 4A).Above all, it can be concluded that NiAl-275 containing abundant of V NiO can decrease charge-transfer resistance and enhance the photocurrent so that facilitate the CO 2 PR. Spin-polarized and Hubbard-corrected DFT U calculations were performed to explain the selectivity to CH 4 and also complete suppressed hydrogen evolution on NiO (V NiO ) under irradiation above 600 nm.At first, the geometries of the CO 2 reduction intermediates for NiO (no defect) and NiO (V NiO ) were optimized and displayed in Fig. 5A.The Gibbs free energy change (G) of each elementary step of CO 2 reduction on each model was calculated and listed in Fig. S26.Thus, the optimal reaction pathway of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 was screened, as shown in Fig. 5A.The Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction was 0.628 eV and 0.448 eV for NiO (no defect) and NiO (V NiO ), respectively.As shown in Fig. 5B, the Ni and O vacancies derived from the calcination of NiAl-LDH lowered the Gibbs free energy barrier for CO 2 reduction on NiO (V NiO ).On the other hand, the Gibbs free energy barriers of hydrogen evolution were calculated to be 0.538 eV, and 0.605 eV for NiO (no defect), and NiO (V NiO ), respectively. After that, the density of states for these 2 models was calculated and displayed in Fig. 5C.The bandgap energy of NiO (no defect) was calculated to be 1.370 eV.As highlighted in Fig. 5C, the introduction of Ni and O vacancies resulted in a defect state, mainly composed of Ni-3d orbitals, in the original forbidden zone of NiO (no defect).Then, with the work functions in Fig. S27, the band edge placement of the unoccupied defect state of NiO (V NiO ) was obtained with Equation (2).Thus, the driving force toward both CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution for the photogenerated electron located on the defect state of NiO (V NiO ) was calculated with Equation (4), being 0.519 eV, which was sufficient to overcome the Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction (0.448 eV), but not that for hydrogen evolution (0.605 eV).Above all, the whole mechanism for the complete prohibition of hydrogen evolution on NiO (V NiO ) was well explained in Fig. 5D.Under irradiation wavelength above 600 nm, the photogenerated electron of photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 transferred to the defect state of NiO (V NiO ), instead of the original CBM.The photogenerated electron located on the defect state of NiO (V NiO ) possessed a driving force (0.519 eV) that could only overcome the Gibbs free energy barrier of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO.This character was not observed in NiO (no defect) since its driving force (0.695 eV) can conquer the Gibbs free energy barrier for both CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution."}, {"llm generation": "600 nm", "source": "More importantly, the H 2 can be totally suppressed under irradiation at 600 nm (Fig. 2E).", "context": "The NiO photocatalyst was synthesized through the topological transformation of NiAl-LDH precursor in the air atmosphere from 200 to 800 C.The thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to track the calcination process of NiAl-LDH.The TG-DTA showed two steps of consecutive weight-loss (Fig. S1), the first step from 30 to 250 C corresponding to the loss of adsorbed and intercalated water molecules, the second step of weight-loss can be assigned to the decomposition of the interlayered carbonate species and the collapse of the layered structure 32.The XRD pattern of NiAl-LDH precursor (Fig. 1A) showed typical (00l) basal reflection which can be indexed to a characteristic feature of layered structure NiAl-LDH phase 55.After calcination at a higher temperature, the d 003 of NiAl-200 and NiAl-250 shifted to 0.71 nm and 0.68 nm, respectively (the basal spacing d 003 of the precursor NiAl-LDH was 0.78 nm), which can be assigned to the release of interlayer water.The XRD pattern of NiAl-275 gave the absence of the characteristic (00l) reflections of the LDH precursor, indicating the LDH layer was collapse during heating at 275 C for 6 h.With further increasing the calcination temperature from 275 to 800 C, the intensity of NiO phases was getting higher.From the above XRD patterns, no spinel-like NiAl 2 O 4 (JCPDS 10-0339) phase was formed.And no crystal Al 2 O 3 phase can be detected, indicating the amorphous Al 2 O 3 phase in NiAl-x. The UV-vis absorption diffuse reflectance spectra were collected from the NiAl-LDH and NiAl-x photocatalysts to gauge their light absorption behaviour for subsequent photocatalytic experiments (Fig. 1B).The NiAl-LDH precursor and NiAl-200 showed an absorption feature at visible wavelengths due to the presence of Ni 2 ions 56.After calcination NiAl-LDH from 200 to 800 C, the UV-vis absorption became much stronger through the whole range, while NiAl-275 and NiAl-400 showed the strongest visible light absorption, in accordance with their black appearance (Fig. S2) 57,58.With further increasing the calcination temperature, the intensity of light absorption for NiAl-600 and NiAl-800 was getting lower, which was consistent with the color change from black to green (Fig. S2). These NiAl-x photocatalysts, as well as the precursor NiAl-LDH and referenced pure NiO sample, were tested in CO 2 PR under visible light.The sole Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O without adding LDH photocatalysts showed poor activity with the yield of 20.3 mol g -1 h -1 for CO and undetectable CH 4 .(Fig. S3A).In Fig. 2A andB, NiAl-275 showed the best selectivity of CH 4 (22.8 ) in all products (CH 4 , CO, H 2 ) with the highest CH 4 production rate (95 mol g -1 h -1 ) among various samples.Further increasing the calcination temperature, the selectivity of CH 4 for NiAl-400 and NiAl-600 dropped to 8.4 and 1.4 respectively, while the NiO and NiAl-800 catalysts showed almost no CH 4 evolved (less then 1).It was noteworthy that the photocatalytic performance increased firstly and then decreased from 400 to 600 nm (Fig. 2A), which may be due to the light absorbance of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O photosensitizer (Fig. S6).Moreover, an isotopic labeling experiment using 13 CO 2 as the substrate (Fig. 2C) confirmed that the CO and CH 4 indeed originated from photocatalytic CO 2 by NiAl-275.After 5 times cycle, NiAl-275 showed no obviously reduce of selective and productivity, proving the stability of this photocatalyst (Fig. 2D, Figure S3B).Since NiAl-275 was composed by NiO and amorphous Al 2 O 3 phase, in order to detect the corresponding role in the CO 2 reduction, we prepared four reference samples to give a detailed study of the photoreduction CO 2 reaction (Fig. S4,S5 In recent years, most photocatalysts exhibited activity around 400-500 nm, limiting the solar energy-utilization efficiency since most of the visible light (500-800 nm) did not make full use.It is important to explore the photocatalytic activity under a wider absorption range (ideally near-infrared excitation ( 600 nm)) based on the utilized effective utilization of solar energy.Thus, we investigated the performance of NiAl-x under different wavelengths.Different filters for CO 2 PR over LDHs were presented in Fig. S7 and Table S2.As shown in Fig. 2E, F, the selectivity of CH 4 for NiAl-275 can be further optimized upto 38.0 ( 600 nm).More importantly, the H 2 can be totally suppressed under irradiation at 600 nm (Fig. 2E).This work not only widened the working wavelength of photocatalyst from visible light to 600 nm but also completely suppressed the competition H 2 evolution reaction. In order to elucidate the catalytic performance for NiAl-x in the photoreduction CO 2 reaction, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) were used to probe the local atomic structure of Ni in NiAl-x (x 275, 400, 600, 800) photocatalysts.As shown in Figs.S8 and S9, Ni K-edge XANES and K 1, 3 peaks in XES of NiAl-275 were shifted to higher energies compared with NiAl-x (x 400, 600, 800) and reference NiO, indicating the Ni atoms in NiAl-275 possessed a higher average oxidation ( 2), consistent with the Ni 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S10).From the k-space plot (Fig. 1C), the oscillation spectra of NiAl-200 and NiAl-250 were similar to NiAl-LDH, suggesting the LDH structure still maintained its structure even calcination at 250 C.However, the k-space spectrum of NiAl-275 showed different oscillations position at 8.8 A -1 and 9.9 A -1 compared with NiAl-LDH, but much similar to NiO, further indicating that NiAl-LDH has been converted to cubic NiO structure when calcination temperature higher than 275 C.concentration, positron annihilation spectrometry (PAS) was performed (Fig. S14).From the PAS analysis result (Table S4), we can give a conclusion that the concentration of vacancy in NiAl-x was decreasing with increasing the calcination temperature from 270 C to 800 C (NiAl-x, x 400, 600, 800).Moreover, compared with the Ni(OH) 2 -275 and the B-NiAl-275, the NiAl-275 also showed the highest oxidation state based on Ni adsorption edge and the lower N for Ni-O Ni-Ni shell, demonstrating NiAl-275 possess the highest structure disorder (Fig. S15) as mainly due to the special structure of NiAl-LDH precursor. The O 1s X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were also used to probe the fine structure of NiAl-x (x 275, 400, 600, 800).The O 1s XAS spectra directly related to unoccupied O p states mixed with metal-3d and metal-4sp states via hybridization, thus allow us to detect the Ni 3d state in the nanostructure NiO system 59.As shown in Fig. 1E, NiAl-LDH, NiAl-400, NiAl-600, and NiAl-800 showed a peak at 532 eV, which related to empty O 2p states covalently mixed with Ni 2 3d states 60.While NiAl-275 gave a new peak at 533 eV, which can be attributed to the formation of pyramidal symmetry NiO 5 structure in NiAl-275 rather than normal NiO 6 (Fig. S13B) 59,60.The abundant vacancy and pyramidal symmetry NiO structure in NiAl-275 influence the electronic state and could contribute to the catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 1F, the obervation that NiAl-275 containing V Ni and V O had the highest vacancy concentration amongst NiAl-x during the topological transformation process of NiAl-LDH has important implication, since NiAl-275 exhibited the highest selectivity of CH 4 in all products.The important role of vacancy concentration in NiO structure to the CO 2 PR is firmly confirmed. Wavelet transform (WT) analysis of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) was a powerful tool to analysis EXAFS data, which can provide not only radial distance resolution but also the resolution in k-space, could be used further to shed light on the position of Al atoms in NiAl-x during the topological transformation process 616263.In Fig. S16, the intensity maxima at the region 2 (R ) 3 A, 6 k 8 A -1 can be assign to the Ni-Ni/Al shell in NiO nanostructure.It's worth noting that the position of Ni-Ni/Al shell intensity maxima was 6.9 A -1 (NiAl-275), 7.2 A -1 (NiAl-400), 7.7 A -1 (NiAl-600), 8.0 A -1 (NiAl-800) and 8.0 A -1 (NiO) (Figs.S16,S17), demonstrate the atomic number of the surrounding atom for Ni at the second shell (Ni-Al or Ni-Ni) was getting increasing from NiAl-275 to NiAl-800.This phenomenon indicated that the Al atom was gradually separated out from the NiAl-x structure with increasing the calcination temperature.

The model of bulk NiO was built using the space group of Fm 3 m, with the lattice parameters of a b c 4.17 A, 90o 42 The spin-polarized and Hubbard-corrected DFT (DFT U) calculations were carried out in the CASTEP code in Accelrys Materials Studio version 6.1 software package (Accelrys Software Inc., San Diego, CA) 43.The plane wave implementation 44 at the level of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) 45 was used.The Hubbard correction was employed to Ni, with the value of U -J (U eff ) set as 3.8 eV referred to the unrestricted Hartree-Fock theory calculations 46.The norm-conserving pseudopotential was used to describe the ionic core in calculating the Kohn-Sham equations 47.The Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm was employed in searching for the potential energy surface 48.The cutoff energy of 660 eV was set.The geometry optimization was based on the following points: (1) an energy tolerance of 2.0 10 -6 eV per atom, (2) a maximum displacement tolerance of 1.0 10 -4 A, and (3) a maximum force tolerance of 0.01 eV/A.When calculating the density of states, the -point-centered k-point mesh for the Brillouin zone integration was 6 6 3 in the a-, b-, and c-directions. Firstly, the bandgap energies (E g ) and Fermi levels (E F ) of NiO (no defect) and NiO (V NiO ) were obtained through their density of states.The work function (W) can be obtained with Eq. ( 1) 49: Where e was the charge of the electron, was the electrostatic potential away from the surface at the distance where the potential energy had reached its asymptotic value (i.e., vacuum level).Thus the band edge placements of the conduction band minimum (E CBM ) and valence band maximum (E VBM ) were obtained with Equition 2 and 3 50,51: The driving force, E df , for both photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction was assumed to be the difference between E CBM of photocatalyst and the reversible hydrogen electrode potential at pH 7 51,52.Therefore, the E df could be calculated with Equition 4: The possible elementary steps for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO were displayed in Scheme S1.Then the reaction formula for each elementary step was listed in Table S1.Typically, the Gibbs free energy change (G) of each elementary step equalled the difference between the Gibbs free energy of product and that of reactant.The detailed equations were listed in Table S1, too.The G for the elementary step in hydrogen evolution reaction was calculated with Equition 5 and 6, respectively. The Gibbs free energy barrier for the whole CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction, G CO2PR and G HER were equal to the G of the most difficult elementary step in the optimal reaction pathway.The computational standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) approximation was applied so that the Gibbs free energy of H e -could be replaced with that of 0.5H 2 at U 0 V vs SHE 53.The Gibbs free energies of molecules and intermediates were obtained by calculating their phonon density of states 54.
