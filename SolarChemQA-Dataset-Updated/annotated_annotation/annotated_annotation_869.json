B-doped g-C 3 N 4 (B-CN).4 g of dicyandiamide was first mixed in 200 ml deionized water and stirred for 15 minutes at 80 C.The color of the solution changed from cloudy to clear.Further, 0.5 g H 3 BO 3 (Merck, 99.9 purity) was mixed in the solution and again stirred at 80 C for 15 minutes at 500 rpm.Then, the resulting solution (A) was kept in a hot dryer oven at 80 C for 10 h.The obtained solid material was transferred in a crucible and put in a furnace for 1 h at 520 C (ramp rate 2.75 C per minute) and the resulting material was ground, washed thoroughly, and dried overnight at 80 C to prepare B-doped g-C 3 N 4 .

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fresh and used samples were recorded using a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer at a voltage of 10 kV using Cu K radiation flux ( 0.1518 nm).Scans were performed from 10to 80(2) at a scan rate of 2min -1 .After that, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, average pore width, and corresponding nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 analyzer at -196 C.Prior to measurements, samples were degassed at 250 C under a continuous nitrogen flow for 4 h to ensure complete removal of moisture and adventitious hydrocarbons.The morphology and corresponding elemental mapping of samples were recorded using a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Gemini500, SEM Hitachi S-4800) equipped with energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).The lattice structure with electron-diffraction patterns was observed using high- resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) on a JEOL-JEM 2100 plus electron microscope operated at 200 keV electrons with 0.14 nm lattice resolution. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was done using a PHI 5000 Versa Prob II spectrometer (FEI) equipped with an Al K anode (hv 1486 eV).All the binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak at 284.8 eV, which belongs to the adventitious carbon signals resulting from the instrument or from the catalyst surface.The C1s, N1s, B2p, Fe2p, and Cr2p core level narrow spectra were recorded using a pass energy of 20 eV for high resolution.The electron spin resonance (ESR) signals were collected using a Jeol JES -FA200 ESR spectrometer in the dark and under irradiation from a 500 W Xe lamp for approximately five minutes.

Electrochemical tests were performed using an SP-150 potentiostat (Biologics).The working electrodes were prepared as follows: 20 mg of the photocatalyst was mixed with 4 mL of absolute ethanol (Merck) and 20 L of Nafion solution (5 w/w in water, Alfa Aesar) to form a slurry.The slurry was drop casted on the conducting side of an FTO glass substrate with an active area of about 1 cm 2 .After that, the FTO was kept in an oven at 80 C overnight.The three-electrode configuration was made by immersing the working (FTO), counter (Pt wire), and reference (saturated Ag/AgCl) electrodes in the electrolyte (0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 , pH 6.67).A 300 W xenon lamp (Sciencetech, Canada) was used to simulate visible light to study the chronoamperometry or photo transient response, which was measured by applying a constant potential of 0.2 V. Potentioelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also analyzed from 1 Hz to 900 kHz under a constant bias of 0.2 V and an (R1 C1) circuit was used to fit the data points.Lastly, a Mott-Schottky study was performed at the same bias voltage and the flat band potential was calculated at nearly 1 kHz frequency. In situ DRIFTS studies were performed on the as-synthesized catalyst at room temperature under a moist CO 2 gas atmosphere.All experimental conditions were kept the same for all the tested catalysts and each experiment was repeated to confirm the consistency in the spectral features.We used a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a HARRICK Praying Mantis high-temperature reaction chamber.Liquid nitrogen cooled MCT-A (mercury cadmium telluride) was employed as a detector with a resolution of 4 cm -1 and over 32 scans.Absorbance data from the sample (in the dark and under light) were acquired in the wavenumber range of 4000- 650 cm -1 .The background spectrum was collected for KBr powder kept in the reaction chamber using 4 cm -1 resolution and 64 scans.Further, the photo-catalyst was diluted in KBr (75 mg) and placed inside the chamber.The mixture was heated to 150 C for 2 hours under vacuum to remove adsorbed contaminants/species.After cooling to 30 C, high-purity CO 2 (99.999 purity) gas was continuously fed through a water bubbler (kept at room temperature) into the cell at a flow rate of 5 ml min -1 for 15 minutes.Then, all inlet and outlet valves connected to the reaction chamber were closed and IR data were collected.The data were collected every 15 minutes until no change in spectral features was observed.Once saturation was achieved, the catalyst was illuminated with a 500 W Xe arc lamp and the spectra were collected every 15 minutes."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "A 300 W xenon lamp (Sciencetech, Canada) was used to simulate visible light to study the chronoamperometry or photo transient response, which was measured by applying a constant potential of 0.2 V.", "context": "Catalyst preparation g-C 3 N 4 (CN).Dicyandiamide (5 g) (Sigma Aldrich, 99 purity) was calcined at 520 C (ramp rate 2.75 C min -1 ) for 1 h to synthesize g-C 3 N 4 .

To carry out the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, we have used the same experimental setup as illustrated in our previous report. 25Briefly, 25 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 10 mL of Milli-Q water and then the solution was sonicated for 30 minutes.The highly dispersed catalyst solution was poured onto the concave surface of a horizontally placed three-neck borosilicate glass (volume of 175 ml) and then dried at 80 C in an oven for 10 hours.Consequently, a thin film of the catalyst was uniformly formed on the concave wall of the reactor.Notably, the other two openings of the borosilicate glass were sealed using a silicone rubber septum.Ultrapure carbon dioxide gas (99.99 purity) was continuously passed through the reactor to maintain an anaerobic condition.Prior to conducting any experiment, we confirmed the anaerobic condition inside the reactor using a gas chromatograph (Model-5800, Centurion Scientific). Next, ultrapure carbon dioxide gas (99.99 purity) was passed through Milli-Q water (at 25 C) at a flow rate of 5 ml min -1 .The thus obtained moist CO 2 gas stream was sent to the reactor for 30 minutes.We supplied an additional 15 L of Milli-Q water via a syringe and heated the reactor for 15 minutes at 80 C.Then, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and kept in the dark for nearly 30 minutes to achieve adsorption-desorption equilibrium for moist CO 2 gas on the catalyst surface.Here, we employed a 500 W Xe arc lamp (Sciencetech, Canada) as the irradiation source, and the lamp was kept 7 cm away from the catalyst surface.In all experiments, the film of catalysts was irradiated for a total of four hours.After completion of the reaction, the gaseous samples were collected from the reactor using a 1 ml gastight Hamilton syringe.These samples were examined using our gas chromatograph (GC), which is equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID), a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a methanizer to precisely detect the amount of CH 4 and CO gases.In this study, only a molecular sieve column (length 2 m, ID 2.1 mm) was used to identify as well as quantify the gaseous products.Here, argon was used as a carrier gas.At the start of each experiment, the retention time of all involved species was recorded using a standard gas mixture (200 ppm of each gas of CH 4 , CO, H 2 , O 2 and the rest argon gas).Moreover, several blank tests were carefully performed to understand the nature of the photocatalytic reaction as well as the source of C1 products. Electrochemical tests were performed using an SP-150 potentiostat (Biologics).The working electrodes were prepared as follows: 20 mg of the photocatalyst was mixed with 4 mL of absolute ethanol (Merck) and 20 L of Nafion solution (5 w/w in water, Alfa Aesar) to form a slurry.The slurry was drop casted on the conducting side of an FTO glass substrate with an active area of about 1 cm 2 .After that, the FTO was kept in an oven at 80 C overnight.The three-electrode configuration was made by immersing the working (FTO), counter (Pt wire), and reference (saturated Ag/AgCl) electrodes in the electrolyte (0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 , pH 6.67).A 300 W xenon lamp (Sciencetech, Canada) was used to simulate visible light to study the chronoamperometry or photo transient response, which was measured by applying a constant potential of 0.2 V. Potentioelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also analyzed from 1 Hz to 900 kHz under a constant bias of 0.2 V and an (R1 C1) circuit was used to fit the data points.Lastly, a Mott-Schottky study was performed at the same bias voltage and the flat band potential was calculated at nearly 1 kHz frequency. In situ DRIFTS studies were performed on the as-synthesized catalyst at room temperature under a moist CO 2 gas atmosphere.All experimental conditions were kept the same for all the tested catalysts and each experiment was repeated to confirm the consistency in the spectral features.We used a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a HARRICK Praying Mantis high-temperature reaction chamber.Liquid nitrogen cooled MCT-A (mercury cadmium telluride) was employed as a detector with a resolution of 4 cm -1 and over 32 scans.Absorbance data from the sample (in the dark and under light) were acquired in the wavenumber range of 4000- 650 cm -1 .The background spectrum was collected for KBr powder kept in the reaction chamber using 4 cm -1 resolution and 64 scans.Further, the photo-catalyst was diluted in KBr (75 mg) and placed inside the chamber.The mixture was heated to 150 C for 2 hours under vacuum to remove adsorbed contaminants/species.After cooling to 30 C, high-purity CO 2 (99.999 purity) gas was continuously fed through a water bubbler (kept at room temperature) into the cell at a flow rate of 5 ml min -1 for 15 minutes.Then, all inlet and outlet valves connected to the reaction chamber were closed and IR data were collected.The data were collected every 15 minutes until no change in spectral features was observed.Once saturation was achieved, the catalyst was illuminated with a 500 W Xe arc lamp and the spectra were collected every 15 minutes."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The three-electrode configuration was made by immersing the working (FTO), counter (Pt wire), and reference (saturated Ag/AgCl) electrodes in the electrolyte (0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 , pH 6.67).", "context": "Catalyst preparation g-C 3 N 4 (CN).Dicyandiamide (5 g) (Sigma Aldrich, 99 purity) was calcined at 520 C (ramp rate 2.75 C min -1 ) for 1 h to synthesize g-C 3 N 4 .
