procedure, 19 and the micro-rods were formed by the aggregated nanowires as shown in SEM and TEM images ( Fig. 1 a and Fig. S1a).Atomic HAADF-STEM images ( Fig. 1 b andc) clearly show the lattice structures of WO 3-x -0 nanowire with a lattice space of 0.378 nm corresponding to 010 facets.While, an amorphous surface with the thickness of 1.5-2.0nm are observed as disordered structure caused by abundant oxygen vacancies.Acid (HCl) was introduced into precursor W(CO) 6 ethanol solution for varying crystal growth process.Tungsten oxides labelled as WO 3-x -0.5, WO 3-x -1, WO 3-x -2, WO 3-x -3, WO 3-x -4 and WO 3-x -5 were obtained with the assistance of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 mL HCl, respectively.And their morphologies were shown in TEM and SEM images of Fig. S1-S2.Tungsten oxides WO 3-x -2 with abundant oxygen vacancies exhibits sea-urchin shaped morphologies ( Fig. 1 d) formed by the nanowires aggregation, and which can attribute to the increased growth rate of tungsten oxides caused by HCl.As HCl increases, the obtained samples remain sea-urchin shapes with the size increasing (Fig. S2).Atomic HAADF-STEM images ( Fig. 1 e andf) show the clear ordered lattice structures of WO 3-x -2 corresponding to 010 facets, and more interesting is a thin amorphous structure existed on surface with a thickness of 0.4-0.5 nm, much thinner than that of WO 3-x -0.Consequently, WO 3-x -2 owns the thin amorphous surface and abundant oxygen vacancies, facilitating the plasmonic hot electron transfer and surface catalytic reaction.37 Crystal structures of WO 3-x -0 and WO 3-x -2 are assigned to that of W 18 O 49 confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns ( Fig. 2 a), indicating the preferential overgrowth along 010 direction.From Fig. S2f, the obtained tungsten oxides show being stronger peaks in XRD patterns as the added HCl volume increases, indicating the being better crystallinity.WO 3-x -2 has better crystallinity than WO 3-x -0, consistence with HAADF-STEM images.Ra- W-O-W).While, for of WO 3-x -2, those peaks have a shift toward low wavelength number region, implying the more oxygen vacancies existence. 38 , 39 With abundant oxygen vacancies, the free electron in WO 3-x -0 occurs oscillation with incident light resulting in strong surface plasmon res-onance (SPR) 37 as shown in diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS, Fig. 2 c).UV-Vis-NIR DRS of the other samples were shown in Fig. S3.Contrast to WO 3-x -0, WO 3-x -2 has stronger SPR effect verifying the more oxygen vacancies and higher free electron density.Chemical state of elements in the samples was measured by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).W 4f XPS of WO 3-x -0 and WO 3-x -2 ( Fig. 2 d) have two peaks assignable to 4f 5/2 and 4f 7/2 of W element, and which are divided to three peaks of W 6 , W 5 and W 4 , respectively.W 4f XPS in the other different tungsten oxides samples were analysed in Fig. S4.The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were applied to identify the oxygen vacancies in tungsten oxides, as shown in Fig. S5, and the signal intensity around g 2.0 corresponds to the unpaired electrons trapped by oxygen vacancies.The EPR signal intensity of WO 3-x -2 is stronger than that of WO 3-x -0, indicating the more oxygen vacancies in WO 3-x -2.And W 5 and W 4 in WO 3-x -0 is estimated to be 21 and 2.4 mol, respectively.(Table S1) While, WO 3-x -2 has the maximum amount of oxygen vacancies, meanwhile, W 5 and W 4 is 26.1 and 7.4 mol, respectively.W 4 is resulted from two adjacent oxygen vacancies around one W-atom, and which can provide adjacent active sites for reaction.WO 3-x -2 has thin amorphous surface, and the maximum oxygen vacancies lead to a lot of adjacent vacancies formation.However, for WO 3-x -0 with thick amorphous surface, the oxygen vacancies are single vacancy leading to formation of W 5 .After photocatalysis, W 5 in WO 3-x -2 is increased to be 26.3 from 26.1 mol, while, W 4 is increased to be 8.8 from 7.4 mol, indicating light-induced more adjacent oxygen vacancies generation (Fig. S6). Photocatalytic activities of the obtained samples were tested by CO 2 -RR.In our previous work, CH 4 and CO was demonstrated as main products over WO 3-x -0 for CO 2 -RR under UV-visible light irradiation but only about 1.0 mol g -1 C2 compounds were detected.19 In the present research, under full-spectrum (UV-Vis-NIR) light irradiation, the ethylene production ( Fig. 3 a) is improved to be 9.1 mol g -1 in 3 h over plasmonic WO 3-x -0 as photocatalysts, demonstrating that the NIR light facilities ethylene generation during CO 2 -RR.One possible reason is that the plasmonic thermal heating boosts reaction and desorption of C -C coupling on surface of WO 3-x -0.To our surprise, ethylene generation over WO 3-x -2 was greatly enhanced to be 184.9mol g -1 (in 3 h), 20-fold higher than that of WO 3-x -0.To confirm the oxygen vacancies promoting ethylene production, the ethylene generation rate ( Fig. 3 b) over different tungsten oxides WO 3-x -0, WO 3-x -0.5, WO 3-x -1, WO 3-x -2, WO 3-x -3, WO 3-x -4 and WO 3-x -5 is tested to be 3.0, 9.1, 18.4, 61.6, 28.4,20.0 and 13.3 mol g -1 h -1 , with a selectivity ( Fig. 3 c) of 17.5, 50.8, 63.7, 89.3, 70.8, 63.7 and 61.7, respectively, and their activities on ethylene generation are consistence with the trend of their oxygen vacancies contents.Meanwhile, their CO (CH 4 ) generation rate is 8.6 (5.6), 6.7 (2.1), 8.3 (2.2), 5.1 (2.3), 9.0 (2.7), 8.6 (2.8) and 6.5 (1.8) mol g -1 h -1 , with a selectivity of 50.1 (32.5), 37.5 (11.7), 28.6 (7.8), 7.3 (3.4), 22.5 (6.7), 27.3 (9.0) and 30.0 (8.2), respectively.Consequently, WO 3-x -2 with maximum oxygen vacancies exhibits an optimal activity and selectivity on ethylene generation during photocatalytic CO 2 -RR under UV-Vis-NIR irradiation.Stability of WO 3-x -2 on photocatalytic CO 2 -RR was repeated for three times as shown in Fig. S7, and their activity has a little decrease due to the high sensitivity of oxygen vacancies.The photocatalytic activity (Fig. S8) of HCl-washed WO 3-x -0 on CO 2 -RR was reduced, especially for ethylene generation, excluding the influence of HCl treatment on photocatalytic activity.When the oxygen vacancies were completely removed from WO 3-x -2 under H 2 O 2 treatment, no ethylene production was observed in Fig. 3 d, supporting the conclusion that the oxygen vacancies of plasmonic tungsten oxides determine their highly efficient and selective ethylene generation during CO 2 -RR. Plasmonic WO 3-x -2 has a broadband light absorption in UV-Vis-NIR region ( Fig. 4 a).Therefore, different light irradiation of UV (200 nm 400 nm), Vis (400 nm 780 nm), UV-Vis ( 780 nm), NIR ( 780 nm), Vis-NIR ( 400 nm) and UV-Vis-NIR (fullspectrum) was applied to test the CO 2 -RR over WO 3-x -2 ( Fig. 4 b), leading to none, none, 5.5, 2.74, 43.5 and 184.9 mol g -1 ethylene generation in 3 h, respectively.Methane and carbon monoxide were obtained simultaneously as products with enhancement under UV-Vis-NIR light irradiation, while their amounts were much lower than ethylene.(Fig. S9) Ethylene generation rate ( Fig. 4 c) over WO 3-x -2 is measured to be 0, 0, 1.8, 0.9, 14.5 and 61.6 mol g -1 h -1 , with a selectivity ( Fig. 4 d) of 1.8, 0, 29.0, 82.3, 92.4 and 89.3, under UV, Vis, UV-Vis, NIR, Vis-NIR and UV-Vis-NIR light irradiation, respectively.Vis-irradiation only generates CO and CH 4 , and UV-irradiation enhances CO and CH 4 generation, while, NIRirradiation promotes ethylene generation.Ethylene generation rate (61.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) induced by UV-Vis-NIR-irradiation is 4fold higher than that induced by Vis-NIR-irradiation, meanwhile, is much higher than that induced by UV-, Vis-, NIR-or UV-Visirradiation.Moreover, NIR-, Vis-NIR-and UV-Vis-NIR-irradiation leads to high selectivity of 82.3, 92.4 and 89.3 on ethylene generation, respectively.In order to investigate the effect of light irradiation, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE) over WO 3-x -2 was measured as shown in Fig. S10.The estimated AQE of monochromic NIR-excitation and UV-excitation are higher than that of monochromic Vis-excitation, indicating the SPR coupled with band structures excitation to enhance CO 2 conversion under UV-Vis-NIR irradiation.Consequently, a strong synergetic effect exists between UV, Vis and NIR irradiation leading to a greatly enhanced activity and selectivity of plasmonic WO 3-x -2 on ethylene production. Due to the abundant oxygen vacancies, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of plasmonic tungsten oxides are weak, 19 , 26 while, the advanced laser-confocal PL microscopy is used to detect the time-resolved PL spectra and images as show in Fig. 5 a and Fig. S11.For WO 3-x -2, the brightness of PL image is stronger than WO 3-x -0, indicating the more excited charges generation.The possible reason is the better crystallinity and larger size of WO 3-x -2.The average excited electron decay time ( ) is calculated to be 1.43 ns for WO 3-x -2, and which is longer than 0.22 ns of WO 3-x -0, suggesting the efficient charge separation.As described in schematic diagram of Fig. 5 b, abundant oxygen vacancies induced defect band (DB) state on the bottom of conduct band (CB), and the free electrons are loaded on DB.Under UV-irradiation, the electron on valence band (VB) can be excited and transfer to CB, and then has decay to DB and leave one hole on VB for water oxida-tion.While, under Vis-NIR irradiation, the free electron loaded DB can be excited by SPR to be hot electron on different energy levels because of the broad SPR band.The hot electrons on low energy level have no enough energy for reduction reaction and have nonradiative decay to DB, resulting in photothermal effect.While, the hot electrons excited on high energy level are highly active for CO 2 -RR.Therefore, UV-excitation injects photoelectrons to DB of plasmonic tungsten oxides leading to high density of free electrons, and Vis-NIR-excitation can generate plasmonic hot electrons and photothermal heating to profiting multi-electron CO 2 -RR. The detailed pathway of CO 2 -RR for ethylene generation was studied by the Raman and IR spectra as shown in Fig. 5 c andd.As the reaction time prolongs, two new Raman peak around 1358 and 1573 cm -1 assignable to the sp 2 and sp 3 of carbon are observed, 40 suggesting the generation of \"C C \" and \"C -C\" on the surface.Another weak peak around 1980 cm -1 which is assigned to adsorbed CO are observed at 1 h, indicating CO generation during CO 2 -RR. 41 , 42 More intermediates are detected by IR spectra ( Fig. 5 d), and the adsorbed CO 2 is observed around 2350 cm -1 .Moreover, the two negative peaks around 1400 and 1620 cm -1 are observed, corresponding to surface bicarbonate. 36 , 43 C -OH bond was observed around 930 cm -1 in IR spectra.Based on the intermediates, a possible reaction pathway of ethylene production over plasmonic tungsten oxides is described in Scheme 1 .The content of W 4 are demonstrated to be crucial on ethylene production.Therefore, the adjacent oxygen vacancies in tungsten oxides are believed as active sites for ethylene generation.Under the assistance of HCl, adjacent oxygen vacancies (Vo) are generated on the surface of plasmonic tungsten oxides.CO 2 and OH-were simultaneously adsorbed on two adjacent Vo, resulting in the formation of bicarbonate (HOCOO) as the main intermediate during ethylene generation.Meanwhile, another CO 2 is coordinated with the surface H-atom (H -O on Vo) for adsorption.Similarly, with CH 3 COOH generation from CO 2 -RR over 5 c).To exclude the influence of residual ethanol on ethylene generation, samples was washed by water for three times and dried in vacuum oven for 24 h before CO 2 -RR measurement, and no ethanol was detected by IR (Fig. S12).XPS (Fig. S6) have demonstrated that the light irradiation induced oxy-gen vacancies generation, especially for adjacent oxygen vacancies, therefore, Vo-adsorbed O-atom (HO-) can be removed to leave the Vo on tungsten oxides.Single Vo as active site for CO 2 -RR over tungsten oxides is described in Scheme 1 as the possible CH 4 and CO generation pathway, CO 2 adsorbed on Vo can accept photoelectrons to be CO or has more proton-coupled electrons transfer to be CH 4 .Consequently, for tungsten oxides, the synergetic effect of adjacent active sites, plasmonic hot electrons and photothermal heating promotes the two CO 2 coupling to generate ethylene."}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "Subsequently, the suspension was irradiated under UV-Vis-NIR light ((NBT, HSX-F/UV300).", "context": "Tungsten hexacarbonyl (W(CO) 6 , 97, Sigma-Aldrich), ethanol (99.8) and carbon dioxides ( 99.999), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36 wt), Milli-Q water (18.2M ).All the chemical reagents were used as purchased without any further purification. In a typical procedure, 75 mg of W(CO) 6 powder was dissolved into 28 mL ethanol, which was vigorously stirred to obtain a yellow suspension.Then, adding 2 ml of HCl solution dropwise with constant stirring.Subsequently, the mixture was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, heated and maintained at 160 C for 12 h.After naturally cooled down to room temperature, the blue product was separated by centrifugation, washed with ethanol three times and dried in a vacuum oven.The obtained sample was labelled as WO 3-x -2 and the WO 3-x -0, WO 3-x -0.5, WO 3-x -1, WO 3-x -3, WO 3-x -4, WO 3-x -5 were synthesized following the above experiment set, with different HCl solution volumes of 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 4 and 5 ml, respectively, and the total solution volume kept as 30 mL. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the sample were carried out by a Rigaku Rint-2500 diffractometer with Cu K radiation at a scanning rate of 0.1 s -1 .The morphology was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, 2100, operated at 100 KV), and scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-6330FT).The high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM images were collected on a Spherical aberration corrected transmission electronic microscopy (JEM-2100 F, JEOL), equipped with double spherical aberration (Cs) correctors for both the probe-forming and imageforming objective lenses.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed at a Thermo Fisher Scientific K-ALPHA spectrometer.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal were detected by Bruker A300 spectrometer.The binding energy was referenced to the C1s peak at 284.6 eV of the adventi-tious carbon.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded in a JASO V-570 UV-Vis/NIR spectrophotometer.Raman spectra were obtained on a HORIBA XPLORA PLUS, with a 532 nm excitation laser line.Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected by a THERMO spectrometer employing the KBr disk method.

Photocatalytic activities of the obtained samples were tested by CO 2 -RR.In our previous work, CH 4 and CO was demonstrated as main products over WO 3-x -0 for CO 2 -RR under UV-visible light irradiation but only about 1.0 mol g -1 C2 compounds were detected.19 In the present research, under full-spectrum (UV-Vis-NIR) light irradiation, the ethylene production ( Fig. 3 a) is improved to be 9.1 mol g -1 in 3 h over plasmonic WO 3-x -0 as photocatalysts, demonstrating that the NIR light facilities ethylene generation during CO 2 -RR.One possible reason is that the plasmonic thermal heating boosts reaction and desorption of C -C coupling on surface of WO 3-x -0.To our surprise, ethylene generation over WO 3-x -2 was greatly enhanced to be 184.9mol g -1 (in 3 h), 20-fold higher than that of WO 3-x -0.To confirm the oxygen vacancies promoting ethylene production, the ethylene generation rate ( Fig. 3 b) over different tungsten oxides WO 3-x -0, WO 3-x -0.5, WO 3-x -1, WO 3-x -2, WO 3-x -3, WO 3-x -4 and WO 3-x -5 is tested to be 3.0, 9.1, 18.4, 61.6, 28.4,20.0 and 13.3 mol g -1 h -1 , with a selectivity ( Fig. 3 c) of 17.5, 50.8, 63.7, 89.3, 70.8, 63.7 and 61.7, respectively, and their activities on ethylene generation are consistence with the trend of their oxygen vacancies contents.Meanwhile, their CO (CH 4 ) generation rate is 8.6 (5.6), 6.7 (2.1), 8.3 (2.2), 5.1 (2.3), 9.0 (2.7), 8.6 (2.8) and 6.5 (1.8) mol g -1 h -1 , with a selectivity of 50.1 (32.5), 37.5 (11.7), 28.6 (7.8), 7.3 (3.4), 22.5 (6.7), 27.3 (9.0) and 30.0 (8.2), respectively.Consequently, WO 3-x -2 with maximum oxygen vacancies exhibits an optimal activity and selectivity on ethylene generation during photocatalytic CO 2 -RR under UV-Vis-NIR irradiation.Stability of WO 3-x -2 on photocatalytic CO 2 -RR was repeated for three times as shown in Fig. S7, and their activity has a little decrease due to the high sensitivity of oxygen vacancies.The photocatalytic activity (Fig. S8) of HCl-washed WO 3-x -0 on CO 2 -RR was reduced, especially for ethylene generation, excluding the influence of HCl treatment on photocatalytic activity.When the oxygen vacancies were completely removed from WO 3-x -2 under H 2 O 2 treatment, no ethylene production was observed in Fig. 3 d, supporting the conclusion that the oxygen vacancies of plasmonic tungsten oxides determine their highly efficient and selective ethylene generation during CO 2 -RR. Plasmonic WO 3-x -2 has a broadband light absorption in UV-Vis-NIR region ( Fig. 4 a).Therefore, different light irradiation of UV (200 nm 400 nm), Vis (400 nm 780 nm), UV-Vis ( 780 nm), NIR ( 780 nm), Vis-NIR ( 400 nm) and UV-Vis-NIR (fullspectrum) was applied to test the CO 2 -RR over WO 3-x -2 ( Fig. 4 b), leading to none, none, 5.5, 2.74, 43.5 and 184.9 mol g -1 ethylene generation in 3 h, respectively.Methane and carbon monoxide were obtained simultaneously as products with enhancement under UV-Vis-NIR light irradiation, while their amounts were much lower than ethylene.(Fig. S9) Ethylene generation rate ( Fig. 4 c) over WO 3-x -2 is measured to be 0, 0, 1.8, 0.9, 14.5 and 61.6 mol g -1 h -1 , with a selectivity ( Fig. 4 d) of 1.8, 0, 29.0, 82.3, 92.4 and 89.3, under UV, Vis, UV-Vis, NIR, Vis-NIR and UV-Vis-NIR light irradiation, respectively.Vis-irradiation only generates CO and CH 4 , and UV-irradiation enhances CO and CH 4 generation, while, NIRirradiation promotes ethylene generation.Ethylene generation rate (61.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) induced by UV-Vis-NIR-irradiation is 4fold higher than that induced by Vis-NIR-irradiation, meanwhile, is much higher than that induced by UV-, Vis-, NIR-or UV-Visirradiation.Moreover, NIR-, Vis-NIR-and UV-Vis-NIR-irradiation leads to high selectivity of 82.3, 92.4 and 89.3 on ethylene generation, respectively.In order to investigate the effect of light irradiation, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE) over WO 3-x -2 was measured as shown in Fig. S10.The estimated AQE of monochromic NIR-excitation and UV-excitation are higher than that of monochromic Vis-excitation, indicating the SPR coupled with band structures excitation to enhance CO 2 conversion under UV-Vis-NIR irradiation.Consequently, a strong synergetic effect exists between UV, Vis and NIR irradiation leading to a greatly enhanced activity and selectivity of plasmonic WO 3-x -2 on ethylene production. Due to the abundant oxygen vacancies, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of plasmonic tungsten oxides are weak, 19 , 26 while, the advanced laser-confocal PL microscopy is used to detect the time-resolved PL spectra and images as show in Fig. 5 a and Fig. S11.For WO 3-x -2, the brightness of PL image is stronger than WO 3-x -0, indicating the more excited charges generation.The possible reason is the better crystallinity and larger size of WO 3-x -2.The average excited electron decay time ( ) is calculated to be 1.43 ns for WO 3-x -2, and which is longer than 0.22 ns of WO 3-x -0, suggesting the efficient charge separation.As described in schematic diagram of Fig. 5 b, abundant oxygen vacancies induced defect band (DB) state on the bottom of conduct band (CB), and the free electrons are loaded on DB.Under UV-irradiation, the electron on valence band (VB) can be excited and transfer to CB, and then has decay to DB and leave one hole on VB for water oxida-tion.While, under Vis-NIR irradiation, the free electron loaded DB can be excited by SPR to be hot electron on different energy levels because of the broad SPR band.The hot electrons on low energy level have no enough energy for reduction reaction and have nonradiative decay to DB, resulting in photothermal effect.While, the hot electrons excited on high energy level are highly active for CO 2 -RR.Therefore, UV-excitation injects photoelectrons to DB of plasmonic tungsten oxides leading to high density of free electrons, and Vis-NIR-excitation can generate plasmonic hot electrons and photothermal heating to profiting multi-electron CO 2 -RR. The detailed pathway of CO 2 -RR for ethylene generation was studied by the Raman and IR spectra as shown in Fig. 5 c andd.As the reaction time prolongs, two new Raman peak around 1358 and 1573 cm -1 assignable to the sp 2 and sp 3 of carbon are observed, 40 suggesting the generation of \"C C \" and \"C -C\" on the surface.Another weak peak around 1980 cm -1 which is assigned to adsorbed CO are observed at 1 h, indicating CO generation during CO 2 -RR. 41 , 42 More intermediates are detected by IR spectra ( Fig. 5 d), and the adsorbed CO 2 is observed around 2350 cm -1 .Moreover, the two negative peaks around 1400 and 1620 cm -1 are observed, corresponding to surface bicarbonate. 36 , 43 C -OH bond was observed around 930 cm -1 in IR spectra.Based on the intermediates, a possible reaction pathway of ethylene production over plasmonic tungsten oxides is described in Scheme 1 .The content of W 4 are demonstrated to be crucial on ethylene production.Therefore, the adjacent oxygen vacancies in tungsten oxides are believed as active sites for ethylene generation.Under the assistance of HCl, adjacent oxygen vacancies (Vo) are generated on the surface of plasmonic tungsten

coordinated with the surface H-atom (H -O on Vo) for adsorption.Similarly, with CH 3 COOH generation from CO 2 -RR over 5 c).To exclude the influence of residual ethanol on ethylene generation, samples was washed by water for three times and dried in vacuum oven for 24 h before CO 2 -RR measurement, and no ethanol was detected by IR (Fig. S12).XPS (Fig. S6) have demonstrated that the light irradiation induced oxy-gen vacancies generation, especially for adjacent oxygen vacancies, therefore, Vo-adsorbed O-atom (HO-) can be removed to leave the Vo on tungsten oxides.Single Vo as active site for CO 2 -RR over tungsten oxides is described in Scheme 1 as the possible CH 4 and CO generation pathway, CO 2 adsorbed on Vo can accept photoelectrons to be CO or has more proton-coupled electrons transfer to be CH 4 .Consequently, for tungsten oxides, the synergetic effect of adjacent active sites, plasmonic hot electrons and photothermal heating promotes the two CO 2 coupling to generate ethylene."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Therefore, different light irradiation of UV (200 nm 400 nm), Vis (400 nm 780 nm), UV-Vis ( 780 nm), NIR ( 780 nm), Vis-NIR ( 400 nm) and

"Tungsten oxides (WO 3-x -0) were synthesized by the W(CO) 6 in ethanol via solvothermal procedure, 19 and the micro-rods were formed by the aggregated nanowires as shown in SEM and TEM images ( Fig. 1 a and Fig. S1a).Atomic HAADF-STEM images ( Fig. 1 b andc) clearly show the lattice structures of WO 3-x -0 nanowire with a lattice space of 0.378 nm corresponding to 010 facets.While, an amorphous surface with the thickness of 1.5-2.0nm are observed as disordered structure caused by abundant oxygen vacancies.Acid (HCl) was introduced into precursor W(CO) 6 ethanol solution for varying crystal growth process.Tungsten oxides labelled as WO 3-x -0.5, WO 3-x -1, WO 3-x -2, WO 3-x -3, WO 3-x -4 and WO 3-x -5 were obtained with the assistance of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 mL HCl, respectively.And their morphologies were shown in TEM and SEM images of Fig. S1-S2.Tungsten oxides WO 3-x -2 with abundant oxygen vacancies exhibits sea-urchin shaped morphologies ( Fig. 1 d) formed by the nanowires aggregation, and which can attribute to the increased growth rate of tungsten oxides caused by HCl.As HCl increases, the obtained samples remain sea-urchin shapes with the size increasing (Fig. S2).Atomic HAADF-STEM images ( Fig. 1 e andf) show the clear ordered lattice structures of WO 3-x -2 corresponding to 010 facets, and more interesting is a thin amorphous structure existed on surface with a thickness of 0.4-0.5 nm, much thinner than that of WO 3-x -0.Consequently, WO 3-x -2 owns the thin amorphous surface and abundant oxygen vacancies, facilitating the plasmonic hot electron transfer and surface catalytic reaction.37 Crystal structures of WO 3-x -0 and WO 3-x -2 are assigned to that of W 18 O 49 confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns ( Fig. 2 a), indicating the preferential overgrowth along 010 direction.From Fig. S2f, the obtained tungsten oxides show being stronger peaks in XRD patterns as the added HCl volume increases, indicating the being better crystallinity.WO 3-x -2 has better crystallinity than WO 3-x -0, consistence with HAADF-STEM images.Ra- W-O-W).While, for of WO 3-x -2, those peaks have a shift toward low wavelength number region, implying the more oxygen vacancies existence. 38 , 39 With abundant oxygen vacancies, the free electron in WO 3-x -0 occurs oscillation with incident light resulting in strong surface plasmon res-onance (SPR) 37 as shown in diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS, Fig. 2 c).UV-Vis-NIR DRS of the other samples were shown in Fig. S3.Contrast to WO 3-x -0, WO 3-x -2 has stronger SPR effect verifying the more oxygen vacancies and higher free electron density.Chemical state of elements in the samples was measured by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).W 4f XPS of WO 3-x -0 and WO 3-x -2 ( Fig. 2 d) have two peaks assignable to 4f 5/2 and 4f 7/2 of W element, and which are divided to three peaks of W 6 , W 5 and W 4 , respectively.W 4f XPS in the other different tungsten oxides samples were analysed in Fig. S4.The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were applied to identify the oxygen vacancies in tungsten oxides, as shown in Fig. S5, and the signal intensity around g 2.0 corresponds to the unpaired electrons trapped by oxygen vacancies.The EPR signal intensity of WO 3-x -2 is stronger than that of WO 3-x -0, indicating the more oxygen vacancies in WO 3-x -2.And W 5 and W 4 in WO 3-x -0 is estimated to be 21 and 2.4 mol, respectively.(Table S1) While, WO 3-x -2 has the maximum amount of oxygen vacancies, meanwhile, W 5 and W 4 is 26.1 and 7.4 mol, respectively.W 4 is resulted from two adjacent oxygen vacancies around one W-atom, and which can provide adjacent active sites for reaction.WO 3-x -2 has thin amorphous surface, and the maximum oxygen vacancies lead to a lot of adjacent vacancies formation.However, for WO 3-x -0 with thick amorphous surface, the oxygen vacancies are single vacancy leading to formation of W 5 .After photocatalysis, W 5 in WO 3-x -2 is increased to be 26.3 from 26.1 mol, while, W 4 is increased to be 8.8 from 7.4 mol, indicating light-induced more adjacent oxygen vacancies generation (Fig. S6). Photocatalytic activities of the obtained samples were tested by CO 2 -RR.In our previous work, CH 4 and CO was demonstrated as main products over WO 3-x -0 for CO 2 -RR under UV-visible light irradiation but only about 1.0 mol g -1 C2 compounds were detected.19 In the present research, under full-spectrum (UV-Vis-NIR) light irradiation, the ethylene production ( Fig. 3 a) is improved to be 9.1 mol g -1 in 3 h over plasmonic WO 3-x -0 as photocatalysts, demonstrating that the NIR light facilities ethylene generation during CO 2 -RR.One possible reason is that the plasmonic thermal heating boosts reaction and desorption of C -C coupling on surface of WO 3-x -0.To our surprise, ethylene generation over WO 3-x -2 was greatly enhanced to be 184.9mol g -1 (in 3 h), 20-fold higher than that of WO 3-x -0.To confirm the oxygen vacancies promoting ethylene production, the ethylene generation rate ( Fig. 3 b) over different tungsten oxides WO 3-x -0, WO 3-x -0.5, WO 3-x -1, WO 3-x -2, WO 3-x -3, WO 3-x -4 and WO 3-x -5 is tested to be 3.0, 9.1, 18.4, 61.6, 28.4,20.0 and 13.3 mol g -1 h -1 , with a selectivity ( Fig. 3 c) of 17.5, 50.8, 63.7, 89.3, 70.8, 63.7 and 61.7, respectively, and their activities on ethylene generation are consistence with the trend of their oxygen vacancies contents.Meanwhile, their CO (CH 4 ) generation rate is 8.6 (5.6), 6.7 (2.1), 8.3 (2.2), 5.1 (2.3), 9.0 (2.7), 8.6 (2.8) and 6.5 (1.8) mol g -1 h -1 , with a selectivity of 50.1 (32.5), 37.5 (11.7), 28.6 (7.8), 7.3 (3.4), 22.5 (6.7), 27.3 (9.0) and 30.0 (8.2), respectively.Consequently, WO 3-x -2 with maximum oxygen vacancies exhibits an optimal activity and selectivity on ethylene generation during photocatalytic CO 2 -RR under UV-Vis-NIR irradiation.Stability of WO 3-x -2 on photocatalytic CO 2 -RR was repeated for three times as shown in Fig. S7, and their activity has a little decrease due to the high sensitivity of oxygen vacancies.The photocatalytic activity (Fig. S8) of HCl-washed WO 3-x -0 on CO 2 -RR was reduced, especially for ethylene generation, excluding the influence of HCl treatment on photocatalytic activity.When the oxygen vacancies were completely removed from WO 3-x -2 under H 2 O 2 treatment, no ethylene production was observed in Fig. 3 d, supporting the conclusion that the oxygen vacancies of plasmonic tungsten oxides determine their highly efficient and selective ethylene generation during CO 2 -RR. Plasmonic WO 3-x -2 has a broadband light absorption in UV-Vis-NIR region ( Fig. 4 a).Therefore, different light irradiation of UV (200 nm 400 nm), Vis (400 nm 780 nm), UV-Vis ( 780 nm), NIR ( 780 nm), Vis-NIR ( 400 nm) and UV-Vis-NIR (fullspectrum) was applied to test the CO 2 -RR over WO 3-x -2 ( Fig. 4 b), leading to none, none, 5.5, 2.74, 43.5 and 184.9 mol g -1 ethylene generation in 3 h, respectively.Methane and carbon monoxide were obtained simultaneously as products with enhancement under UV-Vis-NIR light irradiation, while their amounts were much lower than ethylene.(Fig. S9) Ethylene generation rate ( Fig. 4 c) over WO 3-x -2 is measured to be 0, 0, 1.8, 0.9, 14.5 and 61.6 mol g -1 h -1 , with a selectivity ( Fig. 4 d) of 1.8, 0, 29.0, 82.3, 92.4 and 89.3, under UV, Vis, UV-Vis, NIR, Vis-NIR and UV-Vis-NIR light irradiation, respectively.Vis-irradiation only generates CO and CH 4 , and UV-irradiation enhances CO and CH 4 generation, while, NIRirradiation promotes ethylene generation.Ethylene generation rate (61.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) induced by UV-Vis-NIR-irradiation is 4fold higher than that induced by Vis-NIR-irradiation, meanwhile, is much higher than that induced by UV-, Vis-, NIR-or UV-Visirradiation.Moreover, NIR-, Vis-NIR-and UV-Vis-NIR-irradiation leads to high selectivity of 82.3, 92.4 and 89.3 on ethylene generation, respectively.In order to investigate the effect of light irradiation, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE) over WO 3-x -2 was measured as shown in Fig. S10.The estimated AQE of monochromic NIR-excitation and UV-excitation are higher than that of monochromic Vis-excitation, indicating the SPR coupled with band structures excitation to enhance CO 2 conversion under UV-Vis-NIR irradiation.Consequently, a strong synergetic effect exists between UV, Vis and NIR irradiation leading to a greatly enhanced activity and selectivity of plasmonic WO 3-x -2 on ethylene production. Due to the abundant oxygen vacancies, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of plasmonic tungsten oxides are weak, 19 , 26 while, the advanced laser-confocal PL microscopy is used to detect the time-resolved PL spectra and images as show in Fig. 5 a and Fig. S11.For WO 3-x -2, the brightness of PL image is stronger than WO 3-x -0, indicating the more excited charges generation.The possible reason is the better crystallinity and larger size of WO 3-x -2.The average excited electron decay time ( ) is calculated to be 1.43 ns for WO 3-x -2, and which is longer than 0.22 ns of WO 3-x -0, suggesting the efficient charge separation.As described in schematic diagram of Fig. 5 b, abundant oxygen vacancies induced defect band (DB) state on the bottom of conduct band (CB), and the free electrons are loaded on DB.Under UV-irradiation, the electron on valence band (VB) can be excited and transfer to CB, and then has decay to DB and leave one hole on VB for water oxida-tion.While, under Vis-NIR irradiation, the free electron loaded DB can be excited by SPR to be hot electron on different energy levels because of the broad SPR band.The hot electrons on low energy level have no enough energy for reduction reaction and have nonradiative decay to DB, resulting in photothermal effect.While, the hot electrons excited on high energy level are highly active for CO 2 -RR.Therefore, UV-excitation injects photoelectrons to DB of plasmonic tungsten oxides leading to high density of free electrons, and Vis-NIR-excitation can generate plasmonic hot electrons and photothermal heating to profiting multi-electron CO 2 -RR. The detailed pathway of CO 2 -RR for ethylene generation was studied by the Raman and IR spectra as shown in Fig. 5 c andd.As the reaction time prolongs, two new Raman peak around 1358 and 1573 cm -1 assignable to the sp 2 and sp 3 of carbon are observed, 40 suggesting the generation of \"C C \" and \"C -C\" on the surface.Another weak peak around 1980 cm -1 which is assigned to adsorbed CO are observed at 1 h, indicating CO generation during CO 2 -RR. 41 , 42 More intermediates are detected by IR spectra ( Fig. 5 d), and the adsorbed CO 2 is observed around 2350 cm -1 .Moreover, the two negative peaks around 1400 and 1620 cm -1 are observed, corresponding to surface bicarbonate. 36 , 43 C -OH bond was observed around 930 cm -1 in IR spectra.Based on the intermediates, a possible reaction pathway of ethylene production over plasmonic tungsten oxides is described in Scheme 1 .The content of W 4 are demonstrated to be crucial on ethylene production.Therefore, the adjacent oxygen vacancies in tungsten oxides are believed as active sites for ethylene generation.Under the assistance of HCl, adjacent oxygen vacancies (Vo) are generated on the surface of plasmonic tungsten oxides.CO 2 and OH-were simultaneously adsorbed on two adjacent Vo, resulting in the formation of bicarbonate (HOCOO) as the main intermediate during ethylene generation.Meanwhile, another CO 2 is coordinated with the surface H-atom (H -O on Vo) for adsorption.Similarly, with CH 3 COOH generation from CO 2 -RR over 5 c).To exclude the influence of residual ethanol on ethylene generation, samples was washed by water for three times and dried in vacuum oven for 24 h before CO 2 -RR measurement, and no ethanol was detected by IR (Fig. S12).XPS (Fig. S6) have demonstrated that the light irradiation induced oxy-gen vacancies generation, especially for adjacent oxygen vacancies, therefore, Vo-adsorbed O-atom (HO-) can be removed to leave the Vo on tungsten oxides.Single Vo as active site for CO 2 -RR over tungsten oxides is described in Scheme 1 as the possible CH 4 and CO generation pathway, CO 2 adsorbed on Vo can accept photoelectrons to be CO or has more proton-coupled electrons transfer to be CH 4 .Consequently, for tungsten oxides, the synergetic effect of adjacent active sites, plasmonic hot electrons and photothermal heating promotes the two CO 2 coupling to

Plasmonic WO 3-x -2 has a broadband light absorption in UV-Vis-NIR region ( Fig. 4 a).Therefore, different light irradiation of UV (200 nm 400 nm), Vis (400 nm 780 nm), UV-Vis ( 780 nm), NIR ( 780 nm), Vis-NIR ( 400 nm) and UV-Vis-NIR (fullspectrum) was applied to test the CO 2 -RR over WO 3-x -2 ( Fig. 4 b), leading to none, none, 5.5, 2.74, 43.5 and 184.9 mol g -1 ethylene generation in 3 h, respectively.Methane and carbon monoxide were obtained simultaneously as products with enhancement under UV-Vis-NIR light irradiation, while their amounts were much lower than ethylene.(Fig. S9) Ethylene generation rate ( Fig. 4 c) over WO 3-x -2 is measured to be 0, 0, 1.8, 0.9, 14.5 and 61.6 mol g -1 h -1 , with a selectivity ( Fig. 4 d) of 1.8, 0, 29.0, 82.3, 92.4 and 89.3, under UV, Vis, UV-Vis, NIR, Vis-NIR and UV-Vis-NIR light irradiation, respectively.Vis-irradiation only generates CO and CH 4 , and UV-irradiation enhances CO and CH 4 generation, while, NIRirradiation promotes ethylene generation.Ethylene generation rate (61.6 mol g -1 h -1 ) induced by UV-Vis-NIR-irradiation is 4fold higher than that induced by Vis-NIR-irradiation, meanwhile, is much higher than that induced by UV-, Vis-, NIR-or UV-Visirradiation.Moreover, NIR-, Vis-NIR-and UV-Vis-NIR-irradiation leads to high selectivity of 82.3, 92.4 and 89.3 on ethylene generation, respectively.In order to investigate the effect of light irradiation, the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE) over WO 3-x -2 was measured as shown in Fig. S10.The estimated AQE of monochromic NIR-excitation and UV-excitation are higher than that of monochromic Vis-excitation, indicating the SPR coupled with band structures excitation to enhance CO 2 conversion under UV-Vis-NIR irradiation.Consequently, a strong synergetic effect exists between UV, Vis and NIR irradiation leading to a greatly enhanced activity and selectivity of plasmonic WO 3-x -2 on ethylene production.
