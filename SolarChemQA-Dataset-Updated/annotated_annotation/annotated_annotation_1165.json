The present work indicates that the highly dispersed Pt NPs loaded over exfoliated LDH can achieve high photocatalytic activity by using a low content of Pt.This strategy has proposed a novel method for the application of LDH and noble metals in the photocatalytic region, which reduces the cost of noble metals, and we think it is instructive for the future utilization of solar energy.Discussions of materials characterization and photoelectrochemical measurement, tables of Pt content of catalysts revealed by ICP-AES analysis and potential, and figures of AFM images, height profiles, N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, and blank controlled experiment of 0.1-Pt/ex-LDH under high-purity Ar (PDF) State Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China; orcid.org/0000-0003-3970-1309;Phone: 86 2787546631; Email: xwliuhust.edu.cnState Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China Zijian Zhou -State Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China Lidan Deng -State Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China Lei Liu -State Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China Minghou Xu -State Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China; orcid.org/0000-0001-5180-279XComplete contact information is available at: https://pubs.acs.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00820This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51922045 and 51906078) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (2020M672350).The Analytical and Testing Center at Huazhong University of Science Technology is appreciated for providing analysis and characterization results.Activity Comparison of Pt-Loaded Catalysts for CO 2 Photoreduction s Supporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00820.AuthorsJie Xu -NotesThe authors declare no competing financial interest.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00820Energy Fuels 2021, 35, 10820-10831 Downloaded via CALIFORNIA INST OF TECHNOLOGY on August 13, 2021 at 12:37:21 (UTC).See https://pubs.acs.org/sharingguidelines for options on how to legitimately share published articles. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00820EnergyFuels 2021, 35, 10820-10831 Energy Fuels"}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "UV light was provided by a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300, Perfectlight) with a filter.", "context": "The details of materials characterization and photoelectrochemical measurement are described in the Supporting Information. 2.1.Synthesis of Exfoliated Mg-Al LDH Nanosheets.MgCl 2 6H 2 O (0.02 mol) and AlCl 3 6H 2 O (0.01 mol) were dissolved in deionized water (30 mL).NaOH solution (2 mol/L) was added into the mixed solution drop by drop until the pH reached 12.With the addition of NaOH solution, a large amount of white flocculent precipitation was observed.Then, the suspension was aged in the autoclave at 100 C for 36 h.The solid product was filtered and washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol.After that, the obtained samples were dried at 60 C and Mg-Al carbonate LDH was obtained.
