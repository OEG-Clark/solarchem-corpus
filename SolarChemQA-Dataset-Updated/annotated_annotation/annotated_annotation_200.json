X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was employed to investigate the crystal phase.The XRD patterns of pure Graphite, GO and RGO are shown in Fig. 2a.The (0 0 2) reflection peak of pure graphite appears at 2h 26.5withhigher intensity, indicating that the spatial arrangement of graphite crystal layers is extremely regular.After oxidation of graphite, the (0 0 2) reflection peak is shifted to a lower angle (2h 10.6), which corresponds to the (0 0 1) reflection of GO.This is due to the generation of oxygen functionalities in the interlayer spacing of graphite.However, the (0 0 1) reflection peak of GO is absent after ultrasonic treatment because of the reduction of GO during the ultrasonic process and the exfoliation of the layered structure of the GO.The peak of RGO is around 2h 23.2,which is close to the (0 0 2) reflection of graphite, however, the diffraction peak becomes wider and weaker.These show that the integrity of the crystalline structure declines and the randomness increases from the graphite to RGO. Fig. 2b shows the XRD patterns of ZnO-RGO and pure ZnO nanoparticles.It can be seen that the diffraction peaks of ZnO-RGO composites are well agreement with the similar spherical structure (PDF No. 65-3411) of ZnO.However, no typical diffraction peak of graphite (0 0 2) or GO (0 0 1) is observable in the XRD pattern for ZnO-RGO nanocomposites.The disappearance of the (0 0 1) diffraction peak is due to the fact that the regular layer stacking of GO was destroyed by the crystal growth of ZnO between the interlayers during the hydrothermal reaction, leading to the exfoliation of GO.On the other hand, as reported previously, graphite oxide sheets can be reduced under hydrothermal conditions, and the exfoliated reduced graphene oxide sheets show no visible sign of the (0 0 2) peak 33.The pure ZnO particles prepared in same process as ZnO-RGO have poor crystallinity and need calcination (Supplementary material).However, the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites do not need calcination process, demonstrating that RGO can promote the crystallization of ZnO. Raman scattering is highly sensitive to the electronic structure of carbon based materials, especially for the changes in the CC, CAC, edges, defects and the randomness of C. The Raman spectra of Graphite, GO, RGO and ZnO-RGO are shown in Fig. 3.The spectrum of pure Graphite has two bands at 1570 cm A1 and 1330 cm A1 , which correspond to the graphite (G) and diamondoid (D) bands, respectively.The appearance of the G band is due to the first-order scattering of E 2g phonons by sp 2 carbon atoms, the D band is attributed to the breathing mode of j-point photons of A 1g symmetry 34.However, these two peaks appear at 1578 cm A1 and 1345 cm A1 in GO.The shift of the peak position indicates the destruction of sp 2 bonds and the formation of defects in the sheets due to oxidation.The Raman spectrum of GO has been used to compare the degree of defects in RGO.The I D /I G ratio increases from 0.91 in GO to 1.20 in RGO is attributed to the removal of oxygen functionalities and the decrease of the average size of the sp 2 domains formed in the RGO 35.The I D /I G value of ZnO-RGO is 0.96.The values of the nanocomposites are less than RGO, showing that the RGO in the nanocomposites has fewer defects, hinting that the formation of ZnO particles may promote the reduction of GO. The FT-IR spectra of GO, RGO and ZnO-RGO are shown in Fig. 4. The stretching and bending vibration of the hydroxyl groups of GO appears at 3404 cm A1 .The broad absorption peaks at around 2930 cm A1 are attributed to the characteristic stretching vibration of CH 2 , a strong peak at 1730 cm A1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of carboxyl groups (ACOOH) or the conjugate groups 36.A peak at 1656 cm A1 is due to the presence of sp 2 bond of graphite in GO.The two peaks at 1385 and 1100 cm A1 are an evidence of epoxy and alkoxy functional groups in GO.The presence of these oxygen-containing groups illustrates that graphite has been oxidized, and the polar groups, especially the presence of surface hydroxyl groups, make the GO easily form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and appear good hydrophilic.It is noteworthy that the characteristic peaks of GO either vanish or appear with significantly lower intensities after reduction.However, for the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites, the absorption peaks of OAH group (3404 cm A1 ) and epoxide groups (1385 cm A1 ) become weak, the absorption peaks of CAO, and CO oriented from COOH groups at 1100 cm A1 and 1730 cm A1 are absent.These results indicate that the GO has been reduced to a great extent (theoretical model predicted that the complete reduction may be difficult 37).Furthermore, the absorption band in the range of 440-590 cm A1 for the ZnO-RGO can be assigned to the stretching vibration of Zn-O, which is blue shifted from 410 cm A1 of Zn-O in the bulk ZnO.The blue shift probably results from the coordination between the residual hydroxyl, epoxy groups on the RGO sheets and the nano ZnO self-assembled spheres. UV-vis spectroscopy is an informative and important technique to determine the change in the absorption of photo-catalyst.Fig. 5 displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of ZnO-RGO nanocomposites and ZnO nanoparticles.According to the spectra, ZnO presents its characteristic absorption sharp edge rising at 400 nm, while the ZnO-RGO sample shows an intense, broad background absorption in the visible light region, and its characteristic absorption sharp edge red shift to 520 nm.The band gap (Eg) of ZnO is estimated to be about 3.2 eV from the absorption edge.However, the band gap of the nanocomposites is reduced to 2.5 eV.Thus, the solar energy may be utilized more efficiently, and the photo-catalytic activity is expected to be enhanced. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum is widely used to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer, and reflect the lifetime of photogenerated electronhole pairs from semiconductor particles under light illumination.The PL spectra of the ZnO-RGO composite and pure ZnO are shown in Fig. 6.The spectra exhibit a broad emission band in the range of 340-600 nm, which is ascribed to luminescence from localized surface states due to recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs.As displayed in Fig. 6, the ZnO sample emits strong PL signals with peaks at 344, 360, 450, 468, and 484 nm.The introduction of RGO leads to a significant decrease in the emission intensity of the PL spectrum.It indicates that the synergistic effects between these two components can effectively reduce the recombination rate of photo-induced electrons-holes and lead to an increased separation of electrons and holes.In conclusion, the RGO can serve as an effective electron-accepting material and hinder the direct recombination of e A -h pairs in ZnO. The photo-degradation of Rhodamine B dye and photo-catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide are used to study the photo-catalytic reactivity of the ZnO-RGO composites.In order to evaluate the photo-degradation efficiency of ZnO and ZnO-RGO composites, a model reaction of RhB is employed for the photo-degradation experiments under simulated sunlight irradiation.The normalized temporal concentration changes (C 0 AC/C 0 ) of RhB during photodegradation are shown in Fig. 7.It can be seen that an approximate 92.9 of RhB was removed from the solution after 2.5 h in the presence of ZnO-RGO composites while only about 54.6 of RhB was decomposed for pure ZnO nanoparticles.Besides higher photo-catalytic activity, it should be pointed out that ZnO-RGO composites also present higher dye adsorption efficiency than ZnO nanoparticles before irradiation.These results indicate that the introduction of RGO support plays an active part in the adsorption and catalytic degradation process of dyes.Three reasons may account for the enhanced catalytic activity of the semiconductor-RGO nanocomposites: (1) RGO can adsorb more dye molecules on its surface.(2) Due to its two-dimensional p-conjugation structure, RGO can act as an electron acceptor allowing for the photo-excited electrons of ZnO in the composites to be quickly transferred from the conduction band of ZnO to RGO. (3) The introduction of RGO enlarges the light adsorption scope enhancing the using efficiency of simulated sunlight.In the photo-catalytic reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reacts in the presence of photo-catalyst and light to form a variety of products, such as methane, methanol, and some higher hydrocarbons.In order to test the photo-reduction capability of our products, methanol was chosen as the target product.Fig. 8 shows the changes in methanol yield with the increase in irradiation time.The largest yields of methanol for ZnO and ZnO-RGO photo-catalysts under simulated sunlight irradiation for 10 h were 26.2 and 45.8 lmol/g-cat respectively.The results clearly indicate that the photo-catalytic reduction performances of ZnO can be greatly improved by incorporating the RGO sheets. On the basis of the above results, the probable mechanism of the photo-degradation reaction is proposed as in Fig. 9.The mechanism considers that the dye acts as a sensitizer of simulated sunlight.The excited electrons are transferred from the dye to an electron acceptor and the dye is changed to a cationic dye radical followed by self-degradation or degradation by the reactive oxidation species.According to previous works 19,38,39, the CB and VB of ZnO are A4.05 and A7.25 eV respectively, RhB 3.08 and A5.45 eV respectively and the work function of RGO is A4.42 eV.The order of the energy levels of the three materials is RhB(CB) ZnO(CB) R-GO.Because the energy level of RGO is slightly lower than the conduction band of pure ZnO, the photo-generated electrons from the excited RhB absorbed on RGO cannot be transferred to the surface of pure ZnO and easily recombine with the ground state of RhB, leading the photo-catalytic activity being reduced.However, the band gap narrowing of ZnO in the ZnO-RGO composites changes the energy level between RGO and ZnO and allows electron from the excited RhB to move to the conduction band of ZnO (path 1).Valence electron of ZnO can also be excited to the conduction band by absorbing light due to the narrow band gap of ZnO-RGO composites, and then transferred to the surface of RGO or RhB (path 2).However, the photo electron in the pure ZnO nanoparticles can only be transferred from the conduction band to the RhB, thus, the electron-hole recombination rate greatly increases.The excited electron can be trapped by oxygen molecules to create oxygen peroxide radicals.These oxygen peroxide radical and hydroxyl radical generated from ZnO-RGO composites make the oxidative decomposition of RhB getting CO 2 and H 2 O.Moreover, RGO has excellent conductivity, which boosts an effective charge separation. In addition, though the detailed mechanism of the CO 2 photoreduction has not been fully understood, some basic processes and major steps have been proposed 6,32,40.The energy-level diagrams of ZnO, RGO, CH 3 OH, and CO 2 are shown in Fig. 10.A series of free radical reactions can be initiated by photon-excited electrons and valence band holes which are created by excited ZnO-RGO under simulated sunlight irradiation.In the photo-reduction, the photo-generated electrons are migrated to the RGO surface serving as the reducing sites and react with the absorbed CO 2. Because the reduction potential of e -in the RGO surface is A4.42 eV, which is lower than the potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (A0.38 eV), the e -can act as a donor.The hole in the ZnO valence band reacts with H 2 O producing O 2 and H .H , e and CO 2 react to create CH 3 OH.The details are as followings: Though the excited electrons in the conduction band of pure ZnO can also reduce CO 2 to create CH 3 OH, the holes and electrons are easy to recombine without RGO.The RGO not only enhances the separation of holes and electrons but also increases the reaction site of e -and CO 2 .As a result, the photo-efficiency can be significantly promoted.In our CO 2 photo-reduction process, only CH 3 OH was detected, although there are possibilities for the formation of other products, such as CO, HCHO and CH 4 .The photo-catalytic performance data, herein, potentially support our hypothetical interpretation of the CO 2 reduction mechanism."}, {"llm generation": "ZnO nanoparticles", "source": "Fig. 5 displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of ZnO-RGO nanocomposites and ZnO nanoparticles.", "context": "The morphology and microstructure of the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites and ZnO nanoparticles were investigated by TEM.Fig. 1(a) shows a typical TEM image of ZnO-RGO composites.It can be clearly seen that the reduced graphene oxide sheets are decorated by spherical ZnO particles.These ZnO particles, with an average particle diameter of 150 nm by analyzing 100 individual particles, randomly distributed on the surfaces and edges of the RGO sheets without apparent aggregation.Fig. 1(b) confirms that the ZnO nanoparticles aggregate to large particles in absence of RGO.Fig. 1(c) presents the representative view of free-standing RGO, revealing a crumpled and rippled structure as a result of deformation upon the exfoliation and restacking process.It is deduced that such combination of ZnO and RGO not only alleviates the agglomeration of semiconductor nanoparticles but also enables fast electron transport through the RGO layers, guaranteeing the efficient electrochemical performance.Fig. 1(d) shows a typical HRTEM image of ZnO in the nanocomposites, it can be found that ZnO sphere is made through the self-assembly of ZnO nanorods, which has an average diameter of 5 nm.

UV-vis spectroscopy is an informative and important technique to determine the change in the absorption of photo-catalyst.Fig. 5 displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of ZnO-RGO nanocomposites and ZnO nanoparticles.According to the spectra, ZnO presents its characteristic absorption sharp edge rising at 400 nm, while the ZnO-RGO sample shows an intense, broad background absorption in the visible light region, and its characteristic absorption sharp edge red shift to 520 nm.The band gap (Eg) of ZnO is estimated to be about 3.2 eV from the absorption edge.However, the band gap of the nanocomposites is reduced to 2.5 eV.Thus, the solar energy may be utilized more efficiently, and the photo-catalytic activity is expected to be enhanced. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum is widely used to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer, and reflect the lifetime of photogenerated electronhole pairs from semiconductor particles under light illumination.The PL spectra of the ZnO-RGO composite and pure ZnO are shown in Fig. 6.The spectra exhibit a broad emission band in the range of 340-600 nm, which is ascribed to luminescence from localized surface states due to recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs.As displayed in Fig. 6, the ZnO sample emits strong PL signals with peaks at 344, 360, 450, 468, and 484 nm.The introduction of RGO leads to a significant decrease in the emission intensity of the PL spectrum.It indicates that the synergistic effects between these two components can effectively reduce the recombination rate of photo-induced electrons-holes and lead to an increased separation of electrons and holes.In conclusion, the RGO can serve as an effective electron-accepting material and hinder the direct recombination of e A -h pairs in ZnO.

The Raman spectra of Graphite, GO, RGO and ZnO-RGO are shown in Fig. 3.The spectrum of pure Graphite has two bands at 1570 cm A1 and 1330 cm A1 , which correspond to the graphite (G) and diamondoid (D) bands, respectively.The appearance of the G band is due to the first-order scattering of E 2g phonons by sp 2 carbon atoms, the D band is attributed to the breathing mode of j-point photons of A 1g symmetry 34.However, these two peaks appear at 1578 cm A1 and 1345 cm A1 in GO.The shift of the peak position indicates the destruction of sp 2 bonds and the formation of defects in the sheets due to oxidation.The Raman spectrum of GO has been used to compare the degree of defects in RGO.The I D /I G ratio increases from 0.91 in GO to 1.20 in RGO is attributed to the removal of oxygen functionalities and the decrease of the average size of the sp 2 domains formed in the RGO 35.The I D /I G value of ZnO-RGO is 0.96.The values of the nanocomposites are less than RGO, showing that the RGO in the nanocomposites has fewer defects, hinting that the formation of ZnO particles may promote the reduction of GO. The FT-IR spectra of GO, RGO and ZnO-RGO are shown in Fig. 4. The stretching and bending vibration of the hydroxyl groups of GO appears at 3404 cm A1 .The broad absorption peaks at around 2930 cm A1 are attributed to the characteristic stretching vibration of CH 2 , a strong peak at 1730 cm A1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of carboxyl groups (ACOOH) or the conjugate groups 36.A peak at 1656 cm A1 is due to the presence of sp 2 bond of graphite in GO.The two peaks at 1385 and 1100 cm A1 are an evidence of epoxy and alkoxy functional groups in GO.The presence of these oxygen-containing groups illustrates that graphite has been oxidized, and the polar groups, especially the presence of surface hydroxyl groups, make the GO easily form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and appear good hydrophilic.It is noteworthy that the characteristic peaks of GO either vanish or appear with significantly lower intensities after reduction.However, for the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites, the absorption peaks of OAH group (3404 cm A1 ) and epoxide groups (1385 cm A1 ) become weak, the absorption peaks of CAO, and CO oriented from COOH groups at 1100 cm A1 and 1730 cm A1 are absent.These results indicate that the GO has been reduced to a great extent (theoretical model predicted that the complete reduction may be difficult 37).Furthermore, the absorption band in the range of 440-590 cm A1 for the ZnO-RGO can be assigned to the stretching vibration of Zn-O, which is blue shifted from 410 cm A1 of Zn-O in the bulk ZnO.The blue shift probably results from the coordination between the residual hydroxyl, epoxy groups on the RGO sheets and the nano ZnO self-assembled spheres. UV-vis spectroscopy is an informative and important technique to determine the change in the absorption of photo-catalyst.Fig. 5 displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of ZnO-RGO nanocomposites and ZnO nanoparticles.According to the spectra, ZnO presents its characteristic absorption sharp edge rising at 400 nm, while the ZnO-RGO sample shows an intense, broad background absorption in the visible light region, and its characteristic absorption sharp edge red shift to 520 nm.The band gap (Eg) of ZnO is estimated to be about 3.2 eV from the absorption edge.However, the band gap of the nanocomposites is reduced to 2.5 eV.Thus, the solar energy may be utilized more efficiently, and the photo-catalytic activity is expected to be enhanced. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum is widely used to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer, and reflect the lifetime of photogenerated electronhole pairs from semiconductor particles under light illumination.The PL spectra of the ZnO-RGO composite and pure ZnO are shown in Fig. 6.The spectra exhibit a broad emission band in the range of 340-600 nm, which is ascribed to luminescence from localized surface states due to recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs.As displayed in Fig. 6, the ZnO sample emits strong PL signals with peaks at 344, 360, 450, 468, and 484 nm.The introduction of RGO leads to a significant decrease in the emission intensity of the PL spectrum.It indicates that the synergistic effects between these two components can effectively reduce the recombination rate of photo-induced electrons-holes and lead to an increased separation of electrons and holes.In conclusion, the RGO can serve as an effective electron-accepting material and hinder the direct recombination of e A -h pairs in ZnO. The photo-degradation of Rhodamine B dye and photo-catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide are used to study the photo-catalytic reactivity of the ZnO-RGO composites.In order to evaluate the photo-degradation efficiency of ZnO and ZnO-RGO composites, a model reaction of RhB is employed for the photo-degradation experiments under simulated sunlight irradiation.The normalized temporal concentration changes (C 0 AC/C 0 ) of RhB during photodegradation are shown in Fig. 7.It can be seen that an approximate 92.9 of RhB was removed from the solution after 2.5 h in the presence of ZnO-RGO composites while only about 54.6 of RhB was decomposed for pure ZnO nanoparticles.Besides higher photo-catalytic activity, it should be pointed out that ZnO-RGO composites also present higher dye adsorption efficiency than ZnO nanoparticles before irradiation.These results indicate that the introduction of RGO support plays an active part in the adsorption and catalytic degradation process of dyes.Three reasons may account for the enhanced catalytic activity of the semiconductor-RGO nanocomposites: (1) RGO can adsorb more dye molecules on its surface.(2) Due to its two-dimensional p-conjugation structure, RGO can act as an electron acceptor allowing for the photo-excited electrons of ZnO in the composites to be quickly transferred from the conduction band of ZnO to RGO. (3) The introduction of RGO enlarges the light adsorption scope enhancing the using efficiency of simulated sunlight.In the photo-catalytic reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reacts in the presence of photo-catalyst and light to form a variety of products, such as methane, methanol, and some higher hydrocarbons.In order to test the photo-reduction capability of our products, methanol was chosen as the target product.Fig. 8 shows the changes in methanol yield with the increase in irradiation time.The largest yields of methanol for ZnO and ZnO-RGO photo-catalysts under simulated sunlight irradiation for 10 h were 26.2 and 45.8 lmol/g-cat respectively.The results clearly indicate that the photo-catalytic reduction performances of ZnO can be greatly improved by incorporating the RGO sheets. On the basis of the above results, the probable mechanism of the photo-degradation reaction is proposed as in Fig. 9.The mechanism considers that the dye acts as a sensitizer of simulated sunlight.The excited electrons are transferred from the dye to an electron acceptor and the dye is changed to a cationic dye radical followed by self-degradation or degradation by the reactive oxidation species.According to previous works 19,38,39, the CB and VB of ZnO are A4.05 and A7.25 eV respectively, RhB 3.08 and A5.45 eV respectively and the work function of RGO is A4.42 eV.The order of the energy levels of the three materials is RhB(CB) ZnO(CB) R-GO.Because the energy level of RGO is slightly lower than the conduction band of pure ZnO, the photo-generated electrons from the excited RhB absorbed on RGO cannot be transferred to the surface of pure ZnO and easily recombine with the ground state of RhB, leading the photo-catalytic activity being reduced.However, the band gap narrowing of ZnO in the ZnO-RGO composites changes the energy level between RGO and ZnO and allows electron from the excited RhB to move to the conduction band of ZnO (path 1).Valence electron of ZnO can also be excited to the conduction band by absorbing light due to the narrow band gap of ZnO-RGO composites, and then transferred to the surface of RGO or RhB (path 2).However, the photo electron in the pure ZnO nanoparticles can only be transferred from the conduction band to the RhB, thus, the electron-hole recombination rate greatly increases.The excited electron can be trapped by oxygen molecules to create oxygen peroxide radicals.These oxygen peroxide radical and hydroxyl radical generated from ZnO-RGO composites make the oxidative decomposition of RhB getting CO 2 and H 2 O.Moreover, RGO has excellent conductivity, which boosts an effective charge separation. In addition, though the detailed mechanism of the CO 2 photoreduction has not been fully understood, some basic processes and major steps have been proposed 6,32,40.The energy-level diagrams of ZnO, RGO, CH 3 OH, and CO 2 are shown in Fig. 10.A series of free radical reactions can be initiated by photon-excited electrons and valence band holes which are created by excited ZnO-RGO under simulated sunlight irradiation.In the photo-reduction, the photo-generated electrons are migrated to the RGO surface serving as the reducing sites and react with the absorbed CO 2. Because the reduction potential of e -in the RGO surface is A4.42 eV, which is lower than the potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (A0.38 eV), the e -can act as a donor.The hole in the ZnO valence band reacts with H 2 O producing O 2 and H .H , e and CO 2 react to create CH 3 OH.The details are as followings: Though the excited electrons in the conduction band of pure ZnO can also reduce CO 2 to create CH 3 OH, the holes and electrons are easy to recombine without RGO.The RGO not only enhances the separation of holes and electrons but also increases the reaction site of e -and CO 2 .As a result, the photo-efficiency can be significantly promoted.In our CO 2 photo-reduction process, only CH 3 OH was detected, although there are possibilities for the formation of other products, such as CO, HCHO and CH 4 .The photo-catalytic performance data, herein, potentially support our hypothetical interpretation of the CO 2 reduction mechanism."}, {"llm generation": "ZnO-RGO photo-catalysts", "source": "The largest yields of methanol for ZnO and ZnO-RGO photo-catalysts under simulated sunlight irradiation for 10 h were 26.2 and 45.8 lmol/g-cat respectively.", "context": "The morphology and microstructure of the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites and ZnO nanoparticles were investigated by TEM.Fig. 1(a) shows a typical TEM image of ZnO-RGO composites.It can be clearly seen that the reduced graphene oxide sheets are decorated by spherical ZnO particles.These ZnO particles, with an average particle diameter of 150 nm by analyzing 100 individual particles, randomly distributed on the surfaces and edges of the RGO sheets without apparent aggregation.Fig. 1(b) confirms that the ZnO nanoparticles aggregate to large particles in absence of RGO.Fig. 1(c) presents the representative view of free-standing RGO, revealing a crumpled and rippled structure as a result of deformation upon the exfoliation and restacking process.It is deduced that such combination of ZnO and RGO not only alleviates the agglomeration of semiconductor nanoparticles but also enables fast electron transport through the RGO layers, guaranteeing the efficient electrochemical performance.Fig. 1(d) shows a typical HRTEM image of ZnO in the nanocomposites, it can be found that ZnO sphere is made through the self-assembly of ZnO nanorods, which has an average diameter of 5 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was employed to investigate the crystal phase.The XRD patterns of pure Graphite, GO and RGO are shown in Fig. 2a.The (0 0 2) reflection peak of pure graphite appears at 2h 26.5withhigher intensity, indicating that the spatial arrangement of graphite crystal layers is extremely regular.After oxidation of graphite, the (0 0 2) reflection peak is shifted to a lower angle (2h 10.6), which corresponds to the (0 0 1) reflection of GO.This is due to the generation of oxygen functionalities in the interlayer spacing of graphite.However, the (0 0 1) reflection peak of GO is absent after ultrasonic treatment because of the reduction of GO during the ultrasonic process and the exfoliation of the layered structure of the GO.The peak of RGO is around 2h 23.2,which is close to the (0 0 2) reflection of graphite, however, the diffraction peak becomes wider and weaker.These show that the integrity of the crystalline structure declines and the randomness increases from the graphite to RGO. Fig. 2b shows the XRD patterns of ZnO-RGO and pure ZnO nanoparticles.It can be seen that the diffraction peaks of ZnO-RGO composites are well agreement with the similar spherical structure (PDF No. 65-3411) of ZnO.However, no typical diffraction peak of graphite (0 0 2) or GO (0 0 1) is observable in the XRD pattern for ZnO-RGO nanocomposites.The disappearance of the (0 0 1) diffraction peak is due to the fact that the regular layer stacking of GO was destroyed by the crystal growth of ZnO between the interlayers during the hydrothermal reaction, leading to the exfoliation of GO.On the other hand, as reported previously, graphite oxide sheets can be reduced under hydrothermal conditions, and the exfoliated reduced graphene oxide sheets show no visible sign of the (0 0 2) peak 33.The pure ZnO particles prepared in same process as ZnO-RGO have poor crystallinity and need calcination (Supplementary material).However, the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites do not need calcination process, demonstrating that RGO can promote the crystallization of ZnO.

The stretching and bending vibration of the hydroxyl groups of GO appears at 3404 cm A1 .The broad absorption peaks at around 2930 cm A1 are attributed to the characteristic stretching vibration of CH 2 , a strong peak at 1730 cm A1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of carboxyl groups (ACOOH) or the conjugate groups 36.A peak at 1656 cm A1 is due to the presence of sp 2 bond of graphite in GO.The two peaks at 1385 and 1100 cm A1 are an evidence of epoxy and alkoxy functional groups in GO.The presence of these oxygen-containing groups illustrates that graphite has been oxidized, and the polar groups, especially the presence of surface hydroxyl groups, make the GO easily form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and appear good hydrophilic.It is noteworthy that the characteristic peaks of GO either vanish or appear with significantly lower intensities after reduction.However, for the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites, the absorption peaks of OAH group (3404 cm A1 ) and epoxide groups (1385 cm A1 ) become weak, the absorption peaks of CAO, and CO oriented from COOH groups at 1100 cm A1 and 1730 cm A1 are absent.These results indicate that the GO has been reduced to a great extent (theoretical model predicted that the complete reduction may be difficult 37).Furthermore, the absorption band in the range of 440-590 cm A1 for the ZnO-RGO can be assigned to the stretching vibration of Zn-O, which is blue shifted from 410 cm A1 of Zn-O in the bulk ZnO.The blue shift probably results from the coordination between the residual hydroxyl, epoxy groups on the RGO sheets and the nano ZnO self-assembled spheres. UV-vis spectroscopy is an informative and important technique to determine the change in the absorption of photo-catalyst.Fig. 5 displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of ZnO-RGO nanocomposites and ZnO nanoparticles.According to the spectra, ZnO presents its characteristic absorption sharp edge rising at 400 nm, while the ZnO-RGO sample shows an intense, broad background absorption in the visible light region, and its characteristic absorption sharp edge red shift to 520 nm.The band gap (Eg) of ZnO is estimated to be about 3.2 eV from the absorption edge.However, the band gap of the nanocomposites is reduced to 2.5 eV.Thus, the solar energy may be utilized more efficiently, and the photo-catalytic activity is expected to be enhanced. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum is widely used to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer, and reflect the lifetime of photogenerated electronhole pairs from semiconductor particles under light illumination.The PL spectra of the ZnO-RGO composite and pure ZnO are shown in Fig. 6.The spectra exhibit a broad emission band in the range of 340-600 nm, which is ascribed to luminescence from localized surface states due to recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs.As displayed in Fig. 6, the ZnO sample emits strong PL signals with peaks at 344, 360, 450, 468, and 484 nm.The introduction of RGO leads to a significant decrease in the emission intensity of the PL spectrum.It indicates that the synergistic effects between these two components can effectively reduce the recombination rate of photo-induced electrons-holes and lead to an increased separation of electrons and holes.In conclusion, the RGO can serve as an effective electron-accepting material and hinder the direct recombination of e A -h pairs in ZnO. The photo-degradation of Rhodamine B dye and photo-catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide are used to study the photo-catalytic reactivity of the ZnO-RGO composites.In order to evaluate the photo-degradation efficiency of ZnO and ZnO-RGO composites, a model reaction of RhB is employed for the photo-degradation experiments under simulated sunlight irradiation.The normalized temporal concentration changes (C 0 AC/C 0 ) of RhB during photodegradation are shown in Fig. 7.It can be seen that an approximate 92.9 of RhB was removed from the solution after 2.5 h in the presence of ZnO-RGO composites while only about 54.6 of RhB was decomposed for pure ZnO nanoparticles.Besides higher photo-catalytic activity, it should be pointed out that ZnO-RGO composites also present higher dye adsorption efficiency than ZnO nanoparticles before irradiation.These results indicate that the introduction of RGO support plays an active part in the adsorption and catalytic degradation process of dyes.Three reasons may account for the enhanced catalytic activity of the semiconductor-RGO nanocomposites: (1) RGO can adsorb more dye molecules on its surface.(2) Due to its two-dimensional p-conjugation structure, RGO can act as an electron acceptor allowing for the photo-excited electrons of ZnO in the composites to be quickly transferred from the conduction band of ZnO to RGO.

On the basis of the above results, the probable mechanism of the photo-degradation reaction is proposed as in Fig. 9.The mechanism considers that the dye acts as a sensitizer of simulated sunlight.The excited electrons are transferred from the dye to an electron acceptor and the dye is changed to a cationic dye radical followed by self-degradation or degradation by the reactive oxidation species.According to previous works 19,38,39, the CB and VB of ZnO are A4.05 and A7.25 eV respectively, RhB 3.08 and A5.45 eV respectively and the work function of RGO is A4.42 eV.The order of the energy levels of the three materials is RhB(CB) ZnO(CB) R-GO.Because the energy level of RGO is slightly lower than the conduction band of pure ZnO, the photo-generated electrons from the excited RhB absorbed on RGO cannot be transferred to the surface of pure ZnO and easily recombine with the ground state of RhB, leading the photo-catalytic activity being reduced.However, the band gap narrowing of ZnO in the ZnO-RGO composites changes the energy level between RGO and ZnO and allows electron from the excited RhB to move to the conduction band of ZnO (path 1).Valence electron of ZnO can also be excited to the conduction band by absorbing light due to the narrow band gap of ZnO-RGO composites, and then transferred to the surface of RGO or RhB (path 2).However, the photo electron in the pure ZnO nanoparticles can only be transferred from the conduction band to the RhB, thus, the electron-hole recombination rate greatly increases.The excited electron can be trapped by oxygen molecules to create oxygen peroxide radicals.These oxygen peroxide radical and hydroxyl radical generated from ZnO-RGO composites make the oxidative decomposition of RhB getting CO 2 and H 2 O.Moreover, RGO has excellent conductivity, which boosts an effective charge separation. In addition, though the detailed mechanism of the CO 2 photoreduction has not been fully understood, some basic processes and major steps have been proposed 6,32,40.The energy-level diagrams of ZnO, RGO, CH 3 OH, and CO 2 are shown in Fig. 10.A series of free radical reactions can be initiated by photon-excited electrons and valence band holes which are created by excited ZnO-RGO under simulated sunlight irradiation.In the photo-reduction, the photo-generated electrons are migrated to the RGO surface serving as the reducing sites and react with the absorbed CO 2. Because the reduction potential of e -in the RGO surface is A4.42 eV, which is lower than the potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (A0.38 eV), the e -can act as a donor.The hole in the ZnO valence band reacts with H 2 O producing O 2 and H .H , e and CO 2 react to create CH 3 OH.The details are as followings: Though the excited electrons in the conduction band of pure ZnO can also reduce CO 2 to create CH 3 OH, the holes and electrons are easy to recombine without RGO.The RGO not only enhances the separation of holes and electrons but also increases the reaction site of e -and CO 2 .As a result, the photo-efficiency can be significantly promoted.In our CO 2 photo-reduction process, only CH 3 OH was detected, although there are possibilities for the formation of other products, such as CO, HCHO and CH 4 .The photo-catalytic performance data, herein, potentially support our hypothetical interpretation of the CO 2 reduction mechanism."}, {"llm generation": "RGO", "source": "The order of the energy levels of the three materials is RhB(CB) ZnO(CB) R-GO.", "context": "The morphology and microstructure of the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites and ZnO nanoparticles were investigated by TEM.Fig. 1(a) shows a typical TEM image of ZnO-RGO composites.It can be clearly seen that the reduced graphene oxide sheets are decorated by spherical ZnO particles.These ZnO particles, with an average particle diameter of 150 nm by analyzing 100 individual particles, randomly distributed on the surfaces and edges of the RGO sheets without apparent aggregation.Fig. 1(b) confirms that the ZnO nanoparticles aggregate to large particles in absence of RGO.Fig. 1(c) presents the representative view of free-standing RGO, revealing a crumpled and rippled structure as a result of deformation upon the exfoliation and restacking process.It is deduced that such combination of ZnO and RGO not only alleviates the agglomeration of semiconductor nanoparticles but also enables fast electron transport through the RGO layers, guaranteeing the efficient electrochemical performance.Fig. 1(d) shows a typical HRTEM image of ZnO in the nanocomposites, it can be found that ZnO sphere is made through the self-assembly of ZnO nanorods, which has an average diameter of 5 nm.

The photo-degradation of Rhodamine B dye and photo-catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide are used to study the photo-catalytic reactivity of the ZnO-RGO composites.In order to evaluate the photo-degradation efficiency of ZnO and ZnO-RGO composites, a model reaction of RhB is employed for the photo-degradation experiments under simulated sunlight irradiation.The normalized temporal concentration changes (C 0 AC/C 0 ) of RhB during photodegradation are shown in Fig. 7.It can be seen that an approximate 92.9 of RhB was removed from the solution after 2.5 h in the presence of ZnO-RGO composites while only about 54.6 of RhB was decomposed for pure ZnO nanoparticles.Besides higher photo-catalytic activity, it should be pointed out that ZnO-RGO composites also present higher dye adsorption efficiency than ZnO nanoparticles before irradiation.These results indicate that the introduction of RGO support plays an active part in the adsorption and catalytic degradation process of dyes.Three reasons may account for the enhanced catalytic activity of the semiconductor-RGO nanocomposites: (1) RGO can adsorb more dye molecules on its surface.(2) Due to its two-dimensional p-conjugation structure, RGO can act as an electron acceptor allowing for the photo-excited electrons of ZnO in the composites to be quickly transferred from the conduction band of ZnO to RGO. (3) The introduction of RGO enlarges the light adsorption scope enhancing the using efficiency of simulated sunlight.In the photo-catalytic reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reacts in the presence of photo-catalyst and light to form a variety of products, such as methane, methanol, and some higher hydrocarbons.In order to test the photo-reduction capability of our products, methanol was chosen as the target product.Fig. 8 shows the changes in methanol yield with the increase in irradiation time.The largest yields of methanol for ZnO and ZnO-RGO photo-catalysts under simulated sunlight irradiation for 10 h were 26.2 and 45.8 lmol/g-cat respectively.The results clearly indicate that the photo-catalytic reduction performances of ZnO can be greatly improved by incorporating the RGO sheets. On the basis of the above results, the probable mechanism of the photo-degradation reaction is proposed as in Fig. 9.The mechanism considers that the dye acts as a sensitizer of simulated sunlight.The excited electrons are transferred from the dye to an electron acceptor and the dye is changed to a cationic dye radical followed by self-degradation or degradation by the reactive oxidation species.According to previous works 19,38,39, the CB and VB of ZnO are A4.05 and A7.25 eV respectively, RhB 3.08 and A5.45 eV respectively and the work function of RGO is A4.42 eV.The order of the energy levels of the three materials is RhB(CB) ZnO(CB) R-GO.Because the energy level of RGO is slightly lower than the conduction band of pure ZnO, the photo-generated electrons from the excited RhB absorbed on RGO cannot be transferred to the surface of pure ZnO and easily recombine with the ground state of RhB, leading the photo-catalytic activity being reduced.However, the band gap narrowing of ZnO in the ZnO-RGO composites changes the energy level between RGO and ZnO and allows electron from the excited RhB to move to the conduction band of ZnO (path 1).Valence electron of ZnO can also be excited to the conduction band by absorbing light due to the narrow band gap of ZnO-RGO composites, and then transferred to the surface of RGO or RhB (path 2).However, the photo electron in the pure ZnO nanoparticles can only be transferred from the conduction band to the RhB, thus, the electron-hole recombination rate greatly increases.The excited electron can be trapped by oxygen molecules to create oxygen peroxide radicals.These oxygen peroxide radical and hydroxyl radical generated from ZnO-RGO composites make the oxidative decomposition of RhB getting CO 2 and H 2 O.Moreover, RGO has excellent conductivity, which boosts an effective charge separation. In addition, though the detailed mechanism of the CO 2 photoreduction has not been fully understood, some basic processes and major steps have been proposed 6,32,40.The energy-level diagrams of ZnO, RGO, CH 3 OH, and CO 2 are shown in Fig. 10.A series of free radical reactions can be initiated by photon-excited electrons and valence band holes which are created by excited ZnO-RGO under simulated sunlight irradiation.In the photo-reduction, the photo-generated electrons are migrated to the RGO surface serving as the reducing sites and react with the absorbed CO 2. Because the reduction potential of e -in the RGO surface is A4.42 eV, which is lower than the potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (A0.38 eV), the e -can act as a donor.The hole in the ZnO valence band reacts with H 2 O producing O 2 and H .H , e and CO 2 react to create CH 3 OH.The details are as followings: Though the excited electrons in the conduction band of pure ZnO can also reduce CO 2 to create CH 3 OH, the holes and electrons are easy to recombine without RGO.The RGO not only enhances the separation of holes and electrons but also increases the reaction site of e -and CO 2 .As a result, the photo-efficiency can be significantly promoted.In our CO 2 photo-reduction process, only CH 3 OH was detected, although there are possibilities for the formation of other products, such as CO, HCHO and CH 4 .The photo-catalytic performance data, herein, potentially support our hypothetical interpretation of the CO 2 reduction mechanism."}, {"llm generation": "R-GO", "source": "The order of the energy levels of the three materials is RhB(CB) ZnO(CB) R-GO.", "context": "The morphology and microstructure of the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites and ZnO nanoparticles were investigated by TEM.Fig. 1(a) shows a typical TEM image of ZnO-RGO composites.It can be clearly seen that the reduced graphene oxide sheets are decorated by spherical ZnO particles.These ZnO particles, with an average particle diameter of 150 nm by analyzing 100 individual particles, randomly distributed on the surfaces and edges of the RGO sheets without apparent aggregation.Fig. 1(b) confirms that the ZnO nanoparticles aggregate to large particles in absence of RGO.Fig. 1(c) presents the representative view of free-standing RGO, revealing a crumpled and rippled structure as a result of deformation upon the exfoliation and restacking process.It is deduced that such combination of ZnO and RGO not only alleviates the agglomeration of semiconductor nanoparticles but also enables fast electron transport through the RGO layers, guaranteeing the efficient electrochemical performance.Fig. 1(d) shows a typical HRTEM image of ZnO in the nanocomposites, it can be found that ZnO sphere is made through the self-assembly of ZnO nanorods, which has an average diameter of 5 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was employed to investigate the crystal phase.The XRD patterns of pure Graphite, GO and RGO are shown in Fig. 2a.The (0 0 2) reflection peak of pure graphite appears at 2h 26.5withhigher intensity, indicating that the spatial arrangement of graphite crystal layers is extremely regular.After oxidation of graphite, the (0 0 2) reflection peak is shifted to a lower angle (2h 10.6), which corresponds to the (0 0 1) reflection of GO.This is due to the generation of oxygen functionalities in the interlayer spacing of graphite.However, the (0 0 1) reflection peak of GO is absent after ultrasonic treatment because of the reduction of GO during the ultrasonic process and the exfoliation of the layered structure of the GO.The peak of RGO is around 2h 23.2,which is close to the (0 0 2) reflection of graphite, however, the diffraction peak becomes wider and weaker.These show that the integrity of the crystalline structure declines and the randomness increases from the graphite to RGO. Fig. 2b shows the XRD patterns of ZnO-RGO and pure ZnO nanoparticles.It can be seen that the diffraction peaks of ZnO-RGO composites are well agreement with the similar spherical structure (PDF No. 65-3411) of ZnO.However, no typical diffraction peak of graphite (0 0 2) or GO (0 0 1) is observable in the XRD pattern for ZnO-RGO nanocomposites.The disappearance of the (0 0 1) diffraction peak is due to the fact that the regular layer stacking of GO was destroyed by the crystal growth of ZnO between the interlayers during the hydrothermal reaction, leading to the exfoliation of GO.On the other hand, as reported previously, graphite oxide sheets can be reduced under hydrothermal conditions, and the exfoliated reduced graphene oxide sheets show no visible sign of the (0 0 2) peak 33.The pure ZnO particles prepared in same process as ZnO-RGO have poor crystallinity and need calcination (Supplementary material).However, the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites do not need calcination process, demonstrating that RGO can promote the crystallization of ZnO. Raman scattering is highly sensitive to the electronic structure of carbon based materials, especially for the changes in the CC, CAC, edges, defects and the randomness of C. The Raman spectra of Graphite, GO, RGO and ZnO-RGO are shown in Fig. 3.The spectrum of pure Graphite has two bands at 1570 cm A1 and 1330 cm A1 , which correspond to the graphite (G) and diamondoid (D) bands, respectively.The appearance of the G band is due to the first-order scattering of E 2g phonons by sp 2 carbon atoms, the D band is attributed to the breathing mode of j-point photons of A 1g symmetry 34.However, these two peaks appear at 1578 cm A1 and 1345 cm A1 in GO.The shift of the peak position indicates the destruction of sp 2 bonds and the formation of defects in the sheets due to oxidation.The Raman spectrum of GO has been used to compare the degree of defects in RGO.The I D /I G ratio increases from 0.91 in GO to 1.20 in RGO is attributed to the removal of oxygen functionalities and the decrease of the average size of the sp 2 domains formed in the RGO 35.The I D /I G value of ZnO-RGO is 0.96.The values of the nanocomposites are less than RGO, showing that the RGO in the nanocomposites has fewer defects, hinting that the formation of ZnO particles may promote the reduction of GO. The FT-IR spectra of GO, RGO and ZnO-RGO are shown in Fig. 4. The stretching and bending vibration of the hydroxyl groups of GO appears at 3404 cm A1 .The broad absorption peaks at around 2930 cm A1 are attributed to the characteristic stretching vibration of CH 2 , a strong peak at 1730 cm A1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of carboxyl groups (ACOOH) or the conjugate groups 36.A peak at 1656 cm A1 is due to the presence of sp 2 bond of graphite in GO.The two peaks at 1385 and 1100 cm A1 are an evidence of epoxy and alkoxy functional groups in GO.The presence of these oxygen-containing groups illustrates that graphite has been oxidized, and the polar groups, especially the presence of surface hydroxyl groups, make the GO easily form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and appear good hydrophilic.It is noteworthy that the characteristic peaks of GO either vanish or appear with significantly lower intensities after reduction.However, for the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites, the absorption peaks of OAH group (3404 cm A1 ) and epoxide groups (1385 cm A1 ) become weak, the absorption peaks of CAO, and CO oriented from COOH groups at 1100 cm A1 and 1730 cm A1 are absent.These results indicate that the GO has been reduced to a great extent (theoretical model predicted that the complete reduction may be difficult 37).Furthermore, the absorption band in the range of 440-590 cm A1 for the ZnO-RGO can be assigned to the stretching vibration of Zn-O, which is blue shifted from 410 cm A1 of Zn-O in the bulk ZnO.The blue shift probably results from the coordination between the residual hydroxyl, epoxy groups on the RGO sheets and the nano ZnO self-assembled spheres. UV-vis spectroscopy is an informative and important technique to determine the change in the absorption of photo-catalyst.Fig. 5 displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of ZnO-RGO nanocomposites and ZnO nanoparticles.According to the spectra, ZnO presents its characteristic absorption sharp edge rising at 400 nm, while the ZnO-RGO sample shows an intense, broad background absorption in the visible light region, and its characteristic absorption sharp edge red shift to 520 nm.The band gap (Eg) of ZnO is estimated to be about 3.2 eV from the absorption edge.However, the band gap of the nanocomposites is reduced to 2.5 eV.Thus, the solar energy may be utilized more efficiently, and the photo-catalytic activity is expected to be enhanced. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum is widely used to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer, and reflect the lifetime of photogenerated electronhole pairs from semiconductor particles under light illumination.The PL spectra of the ZnO-RGO composite and pure ZnO are shown in Fig. 6.The spectra exhibit a broad emission band in the range of 340-600 nm, which is ascribed to luminescence from localized surface states due to recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs.As displayed in Fig. 6, the ZnO sample emits strong PL signals with peaks at 344, 360, 450, 468, and 484 nm.The introduction of RGO leads to a significant decrease in the emission intensity of the PL spectrum.It indicates that the synergistic effects between these two components can effectively reduce the recombination rate of photo-induced electrons-holes and lead to an increased separation of electrons and holes.In conclusion, the RGO can serve as an effective electron-accepting material and hinder the direct recombination of e A -h pairs in ZnO. The photo-degradation of Rhodamine B dye and photo-catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide are used to study the photo-catalytic reactivity of the ZnO-RGO composites.In order to evaluate the photo-degradation efficiency of ZnO and ZnO-RGO composites, a model reaction of RhB is employed for the photo-degradation experiments under simulated sunlight irradiation.The normalized temporal concentration changes (C 0 AC/C 0 ) of RhB during photodegradation are shown in Fig. 7.It can be seen that an approximate 92.9 of RhB was removed from the solution after 2.5 h in the presence of ZnO-RGO composites while only about 54.6 of RhB was decomposed for pure ZnO nanoparticles.Besides higher photo-catalytic activity, it should be pointed out that ZnO-RGO composites also present higher dye adsorption efficiency than ZnO nanoparticles before irradiation.These results indicate that the introduction of RGO support plays an active part in the adsorption and catalytic degradation process of dyes.Three reasons may account for the enhanced catalytic activity of the semiconductor-RGO nanocomposites: (1) RGO can adsorb more dye molecules on its surface.(2) Due to its two-dimensional p-conjugation structure, RGO can act as an electron acceptor allowing for the photo-excited electrons of ZnO in the composites to be quickly transferred from the conduction band of ZnO to RGO. (3) The introduction of RGO enlarges the light adsorption scope enhancing the using efficiency of simulated sunlight.In the photo-catalytic reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reacts in the presence of photo-catalyst and light to form a variety of products, such as methane, methanol, and some higher hydrocarbons.In order to test the photo-reduction capability of our products, methanol was chosen as the target product.Fig. 8 shows the changes in methanol yield with the increase in irradiation time.The largest yields of methanol for ZnO and ZnO-RGO photo-catalysts under simulated sunlight irradiation for 10 h were 26.2 and 45.8 lmol/g-cat respectively.The results clearly indicate that the photo-catalytic reduction performances of ZnO can be greatly improved by incorporating the RGO sheets. On the basis of the above results, the probable mechanism of the photo-degradation reaction is proposed as in Fig. 9.The mechanism considers that the dye acts as a sensitizer of simulated sunlight.The excited electrons are transferred from the dye to an electron acceptor and the dye is changed to a cationic dye radical followed by self-degradation or degradation by the reactive oxidation species.According to previous works 19,38,39, the CB and VB of ZnO are A4.05 and A7.25 eV respectively, RhB 3.08 and A5.45 eV respectively and the work function of RGO is A4.42 eV.The order of the energy levels of the three materials is RhB(CB) ZnO(CB) R-GO.Because the energy level of RGO is slightly lower than the conduction band of pure ZnO, the photo-generated electrons from the excited RhB absorbed on RGO cannot be transferred to the surface of pure ZnO and easily recombine with the ground state of RhB, leading the photo-catalytic activity being reduced.However, the band gap narrowing of ZnO in the ZnO-RGO composites changes the energy level between RGO and ZnO and allows electron from the excited RhB to move to the conduction band of ZnO (path 1).Valence electron of ZnO can also be excited to the conduction band by absorbing light due to the narrow band gap of ZnO-RGO composites, and then transferred to the surface of RGO or RhB (path 2).However, the photo electron in the pure ZnO nanoparticles can only be transferred from the conduction band to the RhB, thus, the electron-hole recombination rate greatly increases.The excited electron can be trapped by oxygen molecules to create oxygen peroxide radicals.These oxygen peroxide radical and hydroxyl radical generated from ZnO-RGO composites make the oxidative decomposition of RhB getting CO 2 and H 2 O.Moreover, RGO has excellent conductivity, which boosts an effective charge separation. In addition, though the detailed mechanism of the CO 2 photoreduction has not been fully understood, some basic processes and major steps have been proposed 6,32,40.The energy-level diagrams of ZnO, RGO, CH 3 OH, and CO 2 are shown in Fig. 10.A series of free radical reactions can be initiated by photon-excited electrons and valence band holes which are created by excited ZnO-RGO under simulated sunlight irradiation.In the photo-reduction, the photo-generated electrons are migrated to the RGO surface serving as the reducing sites and react with the absorbed CO 2. Because the reduction potential of e -in the RGO surface is A4.42 eV, which is lower than the potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (A0.38 eV), the e -can act as a donor.The hole in the ZnO valence band reacts with H 2 O producing O 2 and H .H , e and CO 2 react to create CH 3 OH.The details are as followings: Though the excited electrons in the conduction band of pure ZnO can also reduce CO 2 to create CH 3 OH, the holes and electrons are easy to recombine without RGO.The RGO not only enhances the separation of holes and electrons but also increases the reaction site of e -and CO 2 .As a result, the photo-efficiency can be significantly promoted.In our CO 2 photo-reduction process, only CH 3 OH was detected, although there are possibilities for the formation of other products, such as CO, HCHO and CH 4 .The photo-catalytic performance data, herein, potentially support our hypothetical interpretation of the CO 2 reduction mechanism."}, {"llm generation": "pure ZnO", "source": "Because the energy level of RGO is slightly lower than the conduction band of pure ZnO, the photo-generated electrons from the excited RhB absorbed on RGO cannot be transferred to the surface of pure ZnO and easily recombine with the ground state of RhB, leading the photo-catalytic activity being reduced.", "context": "The morphology and microstructure of the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites and ZnO nanoparticles were investigated by TEM.Fig. 1(a) shows a typical TEM image of ZnO-RGO composites.It can be clearly seen that the reduced graphene oxide sheets are decorated by spherical ZnO particles.These ZnO particles, with an average particle diameter of 150 nm by analyzing 100 individual particles, randomly distributed on the surfaces and edges of the RGO sheets without apparent aggregation.Fig. 1(b) confirms that the ZnO nanoparticles aggregate to large particles in absence of RGO.Fig. 1(c) presents the representative view of free-standing RGO, revealing a crumpled and rippled structure as a result of deformation upon the exfoliation and restacking process.It is deduced that such combination of ZnO and RGO not only alleviates the agglomeration of semiconductor nanoparticles but also enables fast electron transport through the RGO layers, guaranteeing the efficient electrochemical performance.Fig. 1(d) shows a typical HRTEM image of ZnO in the nanocomposites, it can be found that ZnO sphere is made through the self-assembly of ZnO nanorods, which has an average diameter of 5 nm.

The FT-IR spectra of GO, RGO and ZnO-RGO are shown in Fig. 4. The stretching and bending vibration of the hydroxyl groups of GO appears at 3404 cm A1 .The broad absorption peaks at around 2930 cm A1 are attributed to the characteristic stretching vibration of CH 2 , a strong peak at 1730 cm A1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of carboxyl groups (ACOOH) or the conjugate groups 36.A peak at 1656 cm A1 is due to the presence of sp 2 bond of graphite in GO.The two peaks at 1385 and 1100 cm A1 are an evidence of epoxy and alkoxy functional groups in GO.The presence of these oxygen-containing groups illustrates that graphite has been oxidized, and the polar groups, especially the presence of surface hydroxyl groups, make the GO easily form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and appear good hydrophilic.It is noteworthy that the characteristic peaks of GO either vanish or appear with significantly lower intensities after reduction.However, for the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites, the absorption peaks of OAH group (3404 cm A1 ) and epoxide groups (1385 cm A1 ) become weak, the absorption peaks of CAO, and CO oriented from COOH groups at 1100 cm A1 and 1730 cm A1 are absent.These results indicate that the GO has been reduced to a great extent (theoretical model predicted that the complete reduction may be difficult 37).Furthermore, the absorption band in the range of 440-590 cm A1 for the ZnO-RGO can be assigned to the stretching vibration of Zn-O, which is blue shifted from 410 cm A1 of Zn-O in the bulk ZnO.The blue shift probably results from the coordination between the residual hydroxyl, epoxy groups on the RGO sheets and the nano ZnO self-assembled spheres. UV-vis spectroscopy is an informative and important technique to determine the change in the absorption of photo-catalyst.Fig. 5 displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of ZnO-RGO nanocomposites and ZnO nanoparticles.According to the spectra, ZnO presents its characteristic absorption sharp edge rising at 400 nm, while the ZnO-RGO sample shows an intense, broad background absorption in the visible light region, and its characteristic absorption sharp edge red shift to 520 nm.The band gap (Eg) of ZnO is estimated to be about 3.2 eV from the absorption edge.However, the band gap of the nanocomposites is reduced to 2.5 eV.Thus, the solar energy may be utilized more efficiently, and the photo-catalytic activity is expected to be enhanced.

In addition, though the detailed mechanism of the CO 2 photoreduction has not been fully understood, some basic processes and major steps have been proposed 6,32,40.The energy-level diagrams of ZnO, RGO, CH 3 OH, and CO 2 are shown in Fig. 10.A series of free radical reactions can be initiated by photon-excited electrons and valence band holes which are created by excited ZnO-RGO under simulated sunlight irradiation.In the photo-reduction, the photo-generated electrons are migrated to the RGO surface serving as the reducing sites and react with the absorbed CO 2. Because the reduction potential of e -in the RGO surface is A4.42 eV, which is lower than the potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (A0.38 eV), the e -can act as a donor.The hole in the ZnO valence band reacts with H 2 O producing O 2 and H .H , e and CO 2 react to create CH 3 OH.The details are as followings: Though the excited electrons in the conduction band of pure ZnO can also reduce CO 2 to create CH 3 OH, the holes and electrons are easy to recombine without RGO.The RGO not only enhances the separation of holes and electrons but also increases the reaction site of e -and CO 2 .As a result, the photo-efficiency can be significantly promoted.In our CO 2 photo-reduction process, only CH 3 OH was detected, although there are possibilities for the formation of other products, such as CO, HCHO and CH 4 .The photo-catalytic performance data, herein, potentially support our hypothetical interpretation of the CO 2 reduction mechanism."}, {"llm generation": "ZnO-RGO composites", "source": "In summary, we provided a convenient, environmentally friendly one-step hydrothermal approach to synthesize ZnO-RGO composites for photo-catalysis applications.", "context": "In summary, we provided a convenient, environmentally friendly one-step hydrothermal approach to synthesize ZnO-RGO composites for photo-catalysis applications.The advantage of this method is that it does not require toxic solvents or chemicals to reduce graphite oxide.The reduced graphene oxide sheets were decorated by spherical ZnO particles with an average diameter of 150 nm, and these spherical crystals were distributed randomly on the surface and edges of the RGO sheets.The synthesized ZnO-RGO composites showed better photo-catalytic activity toward the degradation of RhB dye and the reduction of CO 2 under the irradiation of simulated sunlight than the pure ZnO particles and the efficiency of the nanocomposites for the photo-degradation of RhB was increased about 39 and the yield of methanol from the reduction of CO 2 was improved by 75.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was employed to investigate the crystal phase.The XRD patterns of pure Graphite, GO and RGO are shown in Fig. 2a.The (0 0 2) reflection peak of pure graphite appears at 2h 26.5withhigher intensity, indicating that the spatial arrangement of graphite crystal layers is extremely regular.After oxidation of graphite, the (0 0 2) reflection peak is shifted to a lower angle (2h 10.6), which corresponds to the (0 0 1) reflection of GO.This is due to the generation of oxygen functionalities in the interlayer spacing of graphite.However, the (0 0 1) reflection peak of GO is absent after ultrasonic treatment because of the reduction of GO during the ultrasonic process and the exfoliation of the layered structure of the GO.The peak of RGO is around 2h 23.2,which is close to the (0 0 2) reflection of graphite, however, the diffraction peak becomes wider and weaker.These show that the integrity of the crystalline structure declines and the randomness increases from the graphite to RGO. Fig. 2b shows the XRD patterns of ZnO-RGO and pure ZnO nanoparticles.It can be seen that the diffraction peaks of ZnO-RGO composites are well agreement with the similar spherical structure (PDF No. 65-3411) of ZnO.However, no typical diffraction peak of graphite (0 0 2) or GO (0 0 1) is observable in the XRD pattern for ZnO-RGO nanocomposites.The disappearance of the (0 0 1) diffraction peak is due to the fact that the regular layer stacking of GO was destroyed by the crystal growth of ZnO between the interlayers during the hydrothermal reaction, leading to the exfoliation of GO.On the other hand, as reported previously, graphite oxide sheets can be reduced under hydrothermal conditions, and the exfoliated reduced graphene oxide sheets show no visible sign of the (0 0 2) peak 33.The pure ZnO particles prepared in same process as ZnO-RGO have poor crystallinity and need calcination (Supplementary material).However, the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites do not need calcination process, demonstrating that RGO can promote the crystallization of ZnO. Raman scattering is highly sensitive to the electronic structure of carbon based materials, especially for the changes in the CC, CAC, edges, defects and the randomness of C. The Raman spectra of Graphite, GO, RGO and ZnO-RGO are shown in Fig. 3.The spectrum of pure Graphite has two bands at 1570 cm A1 and 1330 cm A1 , which correspond to the graphite (G) and diamondoid (D) bands, respectively.The appearance of the G band is due to the first-order scattering of E 2g phonons by sp 2 carbon atoms, the D band is attributed to the breathing mode of j-point photons of A 1g symmetry 34.However, these two peaks appear at 1578 cm A1 and 1345 cm A1 in GO.The shift of the peak position indicates the destruction of sp 2 bonds and the formation of defects in the sheets due to oxidation.The Raman spectrum of GO has been used to compare the degree of defects in RGO.The I D /I G ratio increases from 0.91 in GO to 1.20 in RGO is attributed to the removal of oxygen functionalities and the decrease of the average size of the sp 2 domains formed in the RGO 35.The I D /I G value of ZnO-RGO is 0.96.The values of the nanocomposites are less than RGO, showing that the RGO in the nanocomposites has fewer defects, hinting that the formation of ZnO particles may promote the reduction of GO. The FT-IR spectra of GO, RGO and ZnO-RGO are shown in Fig. 4. The stretching and bending vibration of the hydroxyl groups of GO appears at 3404 cm A1 .The broad absorption peaks at around 2930 cm A1 are attributed to the characteristic stretching vibration of CH 2 , a strong peak at 1730 cm A1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of carboxyl groups (ACOOH) or the conjugate groups 36.A peak at 1656 cm A1 is due to the presence of sp 2 bond of graphite in GO.The two peaks at 1385 and 1100 cm A1 are an evidence of epoxy and alkoxy functional groups in GO.The presence of these oxygen-containing groups illustrates that graphite has been oxidized, and the polar groups, especially the presence of surface hydroxyl groups, make the GO easily form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and appear good hydrophilic.It is noteworthy that the characteristic peaks of GO either vanish or appear with significantly lower intensities after reduction.However, for the ZnO-RGO nanocomposites, the absorption peaks of OAH group (3404 cm A1 ) and epoxide groups (1385 cm A1 ) become weak, the absorption peaks of CAO, and CO oriented from COOH groups at 1100 cm A1 and 1730 cm A1 are absent.These results indicate that the GO has been reduced to a great extent (theoretical model predicted that the complete reduction may be difficult 37).Furthermore, the absorption band in the range of 440-590 cm A1 for the ZnO-RGO can be assigned to the stretching vibration of Zn-O, which is blue shifted from 410 cm A1 of Zn-O in the bulk ZnO.The blue shift probably results from the coordination between the residual hydroxyl, epoxy groups on the RGO sheets and the nano ZnO self-assembled spheres. UV-vis spectroscopy is an informative and important technique to determine the change in the absorption of photo-catalyst.Fig. 5 displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of ZnO-RGO nanocomposites and ZnO nanoparticles.According to the spectra, ZnO presents its characteristic absorption sharp edge rising at 400 nm, while the ZnO-RGO sample shows an intense, broad background absorption in the visible light region, and its characteristic absorption sharp edge red shift to 520 nm.The band gap (Eg) of ZnO is estimated to be about 3.2 eV from the absorption edge.However, the band gap of the nanocomposites is reduced to 2.5 eV.Thus, the solar energy may be utilized more efficiently, and the photo-catalytic activity is expected to be enhanced. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum is widely used to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer, and reflect the lifetime of photogenerated electronhole pairs from semiconductor particles under light illumination.The PL spectra of the ZnO-RGO composite and pure ZnO are shown in Fig. 6.The spectra exhibit a broad emission band in the range of 340-600 nm, which is ascribed to luminescence from localized surface states due to recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs.As displayed in Fig. 6, the ZnO sample emits strong PL signals with peaks at 344, 360, 450, 468, and 484 nm.The introduction of RGO leads to a significant decrease in the emission intensity of the PL spectrum.It indicates that the synergistic effects between these two components can effectively reduce the recombination rate of photo-induced electrons-holes and lead to an increased separation of electrons and holes.In conclusion, the RGO can serve as an effective electron-accepting material and hinder the direct recombination of e A -h pairs in ZnO. The photo-degradation of Rhodamine B dye and photo-catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide are used to study the photo-catalytic reactivity of the ZnO-RGO composites.In order to evaluate the photo-degradation efficiency of ZnO and ZnO-RGO composites, a model reaction of RhB is employed for the photo-degradation experiments under simulated sunlight irradiation.The normalized temporal concentration changes (C 0 AC/C 0 ) of RhB during photodegradation are shown in Fig. 7.It can be seen that an approximate 92.9 of RhB was removed from the solution after 2.5 h in the presence of ZnO-RGO composites while only about 54.6 of RhB was decomposed for pure ZnO nanoparticles.Besides higher photo-catalytic activity, it should be pointed out that ZnO-RGO composites also present higher dye adsorption efficiency than ZnO nanoparticles before irradiation.These results indicate that the introduction of RGO support plays an active part in the adsorption and catalytic degradation process of dyes.Three reasons may account for the enhanced catalytic activity of the semiconductor-RGO nanocomposites: (1) RGO can adsorb more dye molecules on its surface.(2) Due to its two-dimensional p-conjugation structure, RGO can act as an electron acceptor allowing for the photo-excited electrons of ZnO in the composites to be quickly transferred from the conduction band of ZnO to RGO. (3) The introduction of RGO enlarges the light adsorption scope enhancing the using efficiency of simulated sunlight.In the photo-catalytic reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reacts in the presence of photo-catalyst and light to form a variety of products, such as methane, methanol, and some higher hydrocarbons.In order to test the photo-reduction capability of our products, methanol was chosen as the target product.Fig. 8 shows the changes in methanol yield with the increase in irradiation time.The largest yields of methanol for ZnO and ZnO-RGO photo-catalysts under simulated sunlight irradiation for 10 h were 26.2 and 45.8 lmol/g-cat respectively.The results clearly indicate that the photo-catalytic reduction performances of ZnO can be greatly improved by incorporating the RGO sheets. On the basis of the above results, the probable mechanism of the photo-degradation reaction is proposed as in Fig. 9.The mechanism considers that the dye acts as a sensitizer of simulated sunlight.The excited electrons are transferred from the dye to an electron acceptor and the dye is changed to a cationic dye radical followed by self-degradation or degradation by the reactive oxidation species.According to previous works 19,38,39, the CB and VB of ZnO are A4.05 and A7.25 eV respectively, RhB 3.08 and A5.45 eV respectively and the work function of RGO is A4.42 eV.The order of the energy levels of the three materials is RhB(CB) ZnO(CB) R-GO.Because the energy level of RGO is slightly lower than the conduction band of pure ZnO, the photo-generated electrons from the excited RhB absorbed on RGO cannot be transferred to the surface of pure ZnO and easily recombine with the ground state of RhB, leading the photo-catalytic activity being reduced.However, the band gap narrowing of ZnO in the ZnO-RGO composites changes the energy level between RGO and ZnO and allows electron from the excited RhB to move to the conduction band of ZnO (path 1).Valence electron of ZnO can also be excited to the conduction band by absorbing light due to the narrow band gap of ZnO-RGO composites, and then transferred to the surface of RGO or RhB (path 2).However, the photo electron in the pure ZnO nanoparticles can only be transferred from the conduction band to the RhB, thus, the electron-hole recombination rate greatly increases.The excited electron can be trapped by oxygen molecules to create oxygen peroxide radicals.These oxygen peroxide radical and hydroxyl radical generated from ZnO-RGO composites make the oxidative decomposition of RhB getting CO 2 and H 2 O.Moreover, RGO has excellent conductivity, which boosts an effective charge separation. In addition, though the detailed mechanism of the CO 2 photoreduction has not been fully understood, some basic processes and major steps have been proposed 6,32,40.The energy-level diagrams of ZnO, RGO, CH 3 OH, and CO 2 are shown in Fig. 10.A series of free radical reactions can be initiated by photon-excited electrons and valence band holes which are created by excited ZnO-RGO under simulated sunlight irradiation.In the photo-reduction, the photo-generated electrons are migrated to the RGO surface serving as the reducing sites and react with the absorbed CO 2. Because the reduction potential of e -in the RGO surface is A4.42 eV, which is lower than the potential of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (A0.38 eV), the e -can act as a donor.The hole in the ZnO valence band reacts with H 2 O producing O 2 and H .H , e and CO 2 react to create CH 3 OH.The details are as followings: Though the excited electrons in the conduction band of pure ZnO can also reduce CO 2 to create CH 3 OH, the holes and electrons are easy to recombine without RGO.The RGO not only enhances the separation of holes and electrons but also increases the reaction site of e -and CO 2 .As a result, the photo-efficiency can be significantly promoted.In our CO 2 photo-reduction process, only CH 3 OH was detected, although there are possibilities for the formation of other products, such as CO, HCHO and CH 4 .The photo-catalytic performance data, herein, potentially support our hypothetical interpretation of the CO 2 reduction mechanism."}, {"llm generation": "simulated sunlight", "source": "The synthesized ZnO-RGO composites showed better photo-catalytic activity toward the degradation of RhB dye and the reduction of CO 2 under the irradiation of simulated sunlight than the pure ZnO particles and the efficiency of the nanocomposites for the photo-degradation of RhB was increased about 39 and the yield of methanol from the reduction of CO 2 was improved by 75.", "context": "In summary, we provided a convenient, environmentally friendly one-step hydrothermal approach to synthesize ZnO-RGO composites for photo-catalysis applications.The advantage of this method is that it does not require toxic solvents or chemicals to reduce graphite oxide.The reduced graphene oxide sheets were decorated by spherical ZnO particles with an average diameter of 150 nm, and these spherical crystals were distributed randomly on the surface and edges of the RGO sheets.The synthesized ZnO-RGO composites showed better photo-catalytic activity toward the degradation of RhB dye and the reduction of CO 2 under the irradiation of simulated sunlight than the pure ZnO particles and the efficiency of the nanocomposites for the photo-degradation of RhB was increased about 39 and the yield of methanol from the reduction of CO 2 was improved by 75.

The photo-catalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out in a glass cell with the light source placed in the middle equipped with a water-cooled jacket.The ZnO-RGO concentration was 1 g/L in 100 mL of 0.0025 M NaHCO 3 aqueous solution.Prior to the illumination, CO 2 was bubbled with a constant flow through the stirred suspension for at least 30 min to purge the air and saturate the solution.The reactor was tightly closed.Samples of liquid reaction mixture were taken at various times during the irradiation.A spot of the suspension was withdrawn by a syringe, filtered through a Millipore filter membrane and analyzed.The formation of methanol was determined by a gas chromatography equipped with FID using a 50 m long KB-FFAP column.Blank reactions were performed to ensure that the hydrocarbon production was due to the photo-reduction of CO 2 and eliminate the surrounding interference.The first blank was light illumination without the catalyst, the second was in the dark with the catalyst and CO 2 under the same experimental conditions and the third was in the absence of CO 2 .No hydrocarbons were detected in the above blank tests.
