Proposed Reaction Mechanism of Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction on the BiCN Hybrid Energy Fuels metal with SPR effect could promote the light-harvesting capacity.(iii) The larger specific surface area brings more active sites.This work highlights the advantage of metal-semiconductor nanohybrids and provides some meaningful help for exploring g-C 3 N 4 -related catalysts with good photocatalytic efficiency for CO 2 reduction. s Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00439.
