The morphology of the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure was characterized by TEM.As shown in Figure 1b-d, the Bi 2 O 3 / Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure exhibits a unique interconnected net structure which is composed of secondary interweaved nanowires with an average diameter of 5 nm and an irregular ultrathin nanosheet shape.The microstructure of the Bi 2 O 3 / Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure was further investigated by the HRTEM.As shown in Figure 1e, the interconnected net structure of Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 is quite obvious.The corresponding HRTEM images selected from the dashed areas of Figure 1e are further enlarged in Figure 1f,g.The lattice spacings of 0.289 and 0.386 nm are well indexed to the (002) and (200) planes of tetragonal Bi 2 O 3 , and the lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.361 nm could be ascribed to the (002) plane of orthorhombic Bi 2 WO 6 .This result indicates that the Bi 2 O 3 / Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure is composed of Bi 2 O 3 nanosheets and Bi 2 WO 6 nanowire networks.The interconnected heterostructures comprising Bi 2 WO 6 nanowire networks and Bi 2 O 3 nanosheets might provide more abundant active sites and assessable channels for the transport of mass, thus contributing to the photocatalytic activity. The XRD pattern further confirms that the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure is composed of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 .As shown in Figure 2a,b, the XRD pattern of BOBWO-1 only displays characteristic (210), ( 201), (002), (220), and (102) lattice planes (JCPDS no.76-0147), which indicates that the product can readily be assigned to pure Bi 2 O 3 .In addition, the characteristic (113), ( 200), ( 220), (133), and (226) can be ascribed to Bi 2 WO 6 (Figure S1, JCPDS no.73-2020).As vividly shown in Figure 2b, BOBWO-12 not only exists in the characteristic (210) and (002) lattice planes of Bi 2 O 3 but is also displayed (113) and (200) lattice planes of Bi 2 WO 6 , which suggests that Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 exist in the system simultaneously.To explore the formation mechanism of the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure, a series of control experiments were carried out by varying the hydrothermal reaction time, and the corresponding XRD patterns and TEM images are shown in Figure 2a,b and Figure S2.When the hydrothermal reaction time is 1 h, all of the samples were nanosheet shapes with a smooth surface and no nanowires can be observed.The XRD pattern confirms that the nanosheet-like sample is pure Bi 2 O 3 , indicating that Bi 2 O 3 is first generated (Figure S2b).When the reaction was prolonged to 2 h, the Bi 2 WO 6 network appeared with densely assembled nanowires and closely hybridized with a Bi 2 O 3 nanosheet to form the intermediate Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure (Figure S2c).As shown in the XRD pattern (Figure 2b), the (201), (220), and (102) lattice ACS Applied Energy Materials planes of Bi 2 O 3 are missing, and the new lattice planes (113) and (200) of Bi 2 WO 6 are formed on the same positions, which conjectures that the stronger intensity peaks of Bi 2 WO 6 cover the weaker characteristic peaks of Bi 2 O 3 .Further prolonging the reaction time to 6 h, the Bi 2 WO 6 nanowires turn sparsely and the Bi 2 O 3 nanosheets gradually shrink, demonstrating that Bi 2 O 3 is converted to Bi 2 WO 6 as the precursor (Figure S2d).Then, most of the Bi 2 WO 6 nanowires disappear, and a new type of nanosheet structure combined with sparse nanowires is generated when the reaction time is 18 h (Figure S2e).Meanwhile, the only one weak intensity (002) lattice plane of XRD indicates that there is little Bi 2 O 3 in the heterostructure sample at this step (Figure 2b), which is in line with the TEM result (Figure S2e).Finally, the span-new well-defined Bi 2 WO 6 nanosheets with the sandwich-layered structure were formed when the reaction is 24 h (Figure 2a and Figure S2f).Moreover, the HAADF-STEM image of BOBWO-12 and the corresponding EDX elemental mapping images (Figure S2g,h) demonstrate the inhomogeneous distribution of Bi, W, and O elements, indicating that the sample is heterogeneous. To further explore the growth mechanism of the composites, the surface areas and corresponding pore size distribution curves of the different hydrothermal time catalysts were determined.In Figure 2c,d and Table S1, the BOBWO-6 displays the highest BET surface area (36.04 m 2 g -1 ) and the largest BJH surface area of pores (40.91 m 2 g -1 ).With the reaction time prolonging to 12 h, the BET surface area (24.47 m 2 g -1 ) and the BJH surface area (23.75 m 2 g -1 ) of the pores of the BOBWO-12 drastically decrease compared to the BOBWO-6, which could be ascribed to the conversion of Bi 2 O 3 to Bi 2 WO 6 by the epitaxial growth and filling the pores of Bi 2 WO 6 networks gradually.Further prolonging the reaction time to 18 h, the large rectangular pores of Bi 2 WO 6 disappear thoroughly, and the BET surface area (22.38 m 2 g -1 ) and the BJH surface area of pores (22.72 m 2 g -1 ) of BOBWO-18 still keep decreasing.When the reaction time reaches to 24 h, the BOBWO-24 displays the lowest BET surface area (18.05 m 2 g -1 ) and the smallest BJH surface area of pores (15.44m 2 g -1 ).In conclusion, with the reaction time prolonging, the BET and BJH surface area of the composites continue to decrease, which is consistent with the change of TEM and XRD results, further demonstrating that Bi 2 O 3 could convert to Bi 2 WO 6 as the precursor and fill up the pore of Bi 2 WO 6 networks.In consideration of an average diameter of 5 nm, the 2D nanowires grafted on some CTAB will spontaneously transform into the nanosheets and the size of the Bi 2 WO 6 nanosheets turns larger with the reaction time increasing, which is consistent with Yang's report. 36This process can be illustrated by the atom structure shown in Figure S2a.The Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure can be regarded as an intermediate during the transformation of Bi 2 O 3 to Bi 2 WO 6 via epitaxial growth. XPS was performed to investigate elemental compositions and chemical states of the samples.As shown in Figure 3a, the Bi 4f spectra of the BOBWO-12 exhibit two characteristic peaks at 159.2 and 164.5 eV, which can be assigned to Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 , respectively. 37In the comparison to BOBWO-24 (pure Bi 2 WO 6 ), a positive shift of about 0.1 eV can be observed, indicating a strong interaction between the Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , and eventually causing a charge balance between Bi of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi of Bi 2 WO 6 . 38In association with the element content ratio of Bi, W, and O (4: 1: 9) (Figure S3), the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 (1: 1) heterostructure is generated by the covalently-bonded epitaxial growth and co-sharing of the Bi-O tetrahedron.In the W 4f XPS spectra (Figure 3b), the BOBWO-12 and BOBWO-24 show the same peaks at 35.4 and 37.6 eV, and the peaks correspond to the W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 of Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively, 37,39 indicating that the addition of Bi 2 O 3 could not affect the surrounding electronic environment of W atoms due to the Bi 2 O 3 is not directly connected with W atoms of Bi 2 WO 6 , which also reflects that the Bi 2 O 3 is directly combined with the Bi 2 WO 6 by co-sharing the Bi-O tetrahedron.As exhibited in Figure 3c, the peaks of O1s at 530.2 and 531.7 eV of the BOBWO-12 corresponded to the Bi-O of Bi 2 O 2 2 and W-O of WO 4 2-, respectively, which is the same as those of the BOBWO-24. 40In addition, the peak at 532.6 eV of the BOBWO-12 is because of the oxygen of the surface adsorbing water molecules, 41 which indicates that Bi 2 O 3 can facilitate the surface absorption of physical water and contribute to the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with the H 2 O vapor.As shown in Figure 3d, the Br 3d peaks at 68.2 and 69.2 eV of the BOBWO-12 can be assigned to the Br 3d 5/2 and Br 3d 3/2 , respectively, which is a little negative shift than the BOBWO-24. 42,43Due to part of Br could absorb on the surface of catalysts, the negative shift of Br element in the composites can be ascribed to the increased electron density of Br, which indicates that more unsaturated Bi sites are exposed in the composite and cause more electrons transfer to the absorbed Br. 43 Figure 4a shows the UV-DRS spectra of the as-synthesized pure Bi 2 O 3 and BOBWO with different reaction times, and the corresponding band gap energies were calculated from the plots of (h) 1/2 vs the energy of the absorbed light in Figure 4b.Pure Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24) display a visiblelight absorption edge at approximately 389 and 445 nm, respectively.A slight redshift is observed for the BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, and BOBWO-18 compared to the pure Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), which indicates an enhanced visible-light harvesting ability of the composites and reveals a strong interaction from the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure.Moreover, the band gap energies of the as-prepared samples are quite close, and the values are 2.97, 2.55, 2.60, 2.64, and 2.69 eV for the Bi 2 O 3 , BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, BOBWO-18, and BOBWO-24, respectively.The delicate difference of the band gap energy of the samples demonstrates that Bi 2 O 3 is gradually transformed to Bi 2 WO 6 with the reaction time increasing. To study the separation properties of photogenerated electrons and holes, the transient photocurrent response was applied to give evidence about charge separation under irradiation.An enhanced photocurrent intensity of BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, and BOBWO-18 could be recognized as distinct from pure Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), (Figure 4c), which corresponds to a higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and could be ascribed to the intimate interface between Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 .Furthermore, the BOBWO-12 shows the highest photocurrent intensity, and the result indicates that the composites possess the fastest photogenerated electron-hole separation rate, which may be ascribed to the largest contact area and the intimate coupling between Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 .From the EIS, the migration state of carriers in the electrode-electrolyte interface can be more deeply clarified. 44As shown in Figure 4d, the BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, and BOBWO-18 possess a smaller radius in contrast with Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), which suggests that the composites have lower charge transfer resistance, faster separation, and migration of carriers.Interestingly, the BOBWO-12 also exhibits the smallest radius, which further indicates that the covalently bonded interface could provide a rapid channel for photogenerated carrier transfer. Meanwhile, to further figure out the influence of the charge transfer that arose from the covalently bonded interface, the steady-state photoluminescence spectra of the as-prepared samples were examined.In this work, the PL spectra of the asprepared samples were tested at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm.As shown in Figure 4e, the PL intensities of BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, and BOBWO-18 samples are lower than that of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), indicating the faster charge separation of the heterostructure.Meanwhile, BOBWO-12 shows the weakest steady-state PL emission peaks at 440 nm, indicating the lowest photogenerated carrier recombination, which could be ascribed to the conjecture that the covalently bonded interface could facilitate the photogenerated carrier separation between Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 .To further verify the function of the covalently bonded interface of the composites in the photogenerated carrier transfer process, the time-resolved fluorescence study was carried.As shown in Figure 4f and Table S2, the fluorescence lifetime of the BOBWO-12 is 0.90689 ns, which is much longer than that of pure Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), further suggesting that the recombination of charge carriers over the composites have been restrained effectively. 45Furthermore, the detailed fluorescence lifetime 2 of the BOBWO-12 is much longer than other samples, indicating a much lower direct recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers in the composites, which further proves that the compact covalently bonded interface between Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 can benefit the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.Interestingly, the BOBWO-12 with an asymmetric Bi To figure out the connection between the above characteristics (special microstructure and photoelectrochemical property) and the photocatalytic activity, the CO 2 photoreduction tests over the as-prepared samples were carried out under 4 h continuous visible-light irradiation ( 400 nm) in a CO 2 and H 2 O (vapor) atmosphere.As shown in Figure 5a,b, all the BOBWO samples exhibit enhanced photocatalytic CO and O 2 generation activities than bulk Bi 2 WO 6 and pure Bi 2 O 3 , which could be ascribed to the highly efficient photoinduced electron reduction CO 2 to CO and photoinduced hole oxidation H 2 O to O 2 due to the rapid photogenerated carrier transfer and high charge separation efficiency.Meanwhile, it could be seen that no CO can be detected from pure Bi 2 O 3 , which means that pure Bi 2 O 3 cannot reduce CO 2 to CO under photocatalytic conditions.Especially, the CO generation rate of BOBWO-12 reaches up to 17.39 molg -1 h -1 , which is 18.0 and 4.2 times higher than that of bulk-Bi 2 WO 6 and Bi 2 WO 6 nanosheets.To figure out the significance of the covalently bonded interface, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of physically mixed Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 was measured.After 4 h of irradiation, the CO yield of physically mixed Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 only reaches up to 25.52 molg -1 that is much lower than that of the covalently bonded BOBWO-12 (Figure S4), which suggests that the compact interface could accelerate the charge transfer and decrease the photogenerated carrier recombination.Interestingly, the CO generation rate of the BOBWO-12 is 3.3, 5.3, and 4.2 times higher than that of the BOBWO-6, BOBWO-18, and BOBWO-24, respectively, revealing a strong correlation with the structure and composition of the different reaction time composites.Meanwhile, the BOBWO-12 also shows the best selectivity of CO generation (95.4)compared to Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , while almost no H 2 and CH 4 could be detected (Figure 5b), which suggests that the composites tend to produce CO through a dual electron reduction and cannot function as the active sites for the generation of H 2 and CH 4 .To investigate the long-term stability of this heterostructure photocatalyst, the reusability test was performed over the BOBWO-12 sample under the same photocatalytic test condition.As shown in Figure 5c, the photocatalytic CO generation activity of the BOBWO-12 remains well after five cycles, and the CO yield retains 83.5 of the first run, from 17.39 to 14.51 molg -1 , which indicates that the heterointerface connected by the covalent bond is beneficial to the structural stability of the composite catalyst. 46o achieve indirect evidence of the carbon source and the possible catalytic mechanism of the generated CO, a series of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments under different reaction conditions were carried out.As shown in Figure 5d, column 1, no products are detected under dark conditions, indicating the photocatalytic nature of the CO 2 reduction reaction. 47With the absence of H 2 O vapor, the CO generation decreases sharply (Figure 5d, column 2), indicating that the high photocatalytic activity of the composites must simultaneously conduct the oxidation of H 2 O and the reduction of CO 2 . 3Meanwhile, almost no CO is generated (Figure 5d, column 3) in the absence of photocatalysts.Moreover (Figure 5d, column 4), when the reactor was filled by N 2 and H 2 O (vapor) rather than CO 2 , no CO is detected and just a little H 2 is detected, which confirms that the raw CO 2 is the key to the generation of CO (Figure 5d, column 5). To validate the reason for the increased activity of Bi 2 O 3 / Bi 2 WO 6 in CO 2 photoreduction compared to pure Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge positions of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 require to be investigated.To pinpoint the band position of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , the Mott-Schottky (MS) measurements were taken.The flat band potentials (E f ) of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 are estimated to be -0.69 and -1.09V vs Ag/AgCl from the MS plot (Figure S5), which are equal to -0.07 and -0.47 V vs normal hydrogen electrode ACS Applied Energy Materials (NHE). 48The slopes of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 MS plots are positive, indicating that Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 are n-type semiconductors. 49In n-type semiconductors, the flat-band potential is an approximation of the potential of the CB. 49herefore, the CB edge potentials of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 are estimated to be -0.07 and -0.47 V (vs NHE, pH 0), respectively.Especially, the CB edge potentials of Bi 2 O 3 is more positive than the position (-0.11V vs. NHE, pH0) of CO 2 /CO photoreduction, thus the Bi 2 O 3 could not favor the CO 2 photoreduction to CO, which is consistent with the result of CO 2 photoreduction measurement (Figure 5a).Especially, the CB edge potential of Bi 2 O 3 is more positive than the position (-0.11V vs NHE, pH 0) of CO 2 /CO photoreduction; thus, Bi 2 O 3 could not favor the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO, which is consistent with the result of CO 2 photoreduction measurement (Figure 5a).Considering the Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 band gaps (E g ) to be 2.97 and 2.69 eV, the VB edge potentials of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 are calculated to be 2.90 and 2.22 V, respectively.Therefore, the charge transfer mechanism could be divided into two types, II-type and Zscheme.If the II-type charge transfer mechanism is adopted in BOBWO, the electrons will transfer from CB of Bi 2 WO 6 to CB of Bi 2 O 3 and the holes will transfer from VB of Bi 2 O 3 to VB of Bi 2 WO 6 , which could not reach to the standard potential of CO 2 /CO photoreduction.However, the BOBWO-12 performs superior activity in CO 2 photoreduction to CO, which could be attributed to the Z-scheme charge transfer (Figure 6a).As we know, the photogenerated electrons of Aurivillius phase oxides Bi 2 WO 6 tend to transfer from BiO layer to WO 4 2layer 30 , and the photogenerated holes tend to transfer from BiO layer to WO 4 2-layer.Therefore, with the accumulated holes of Bi 2 WO 6 in BiO layer, the BiO layer of Bi 2 WO 6 can attract large photogenerated electrons from the Bi 2 O 3 , and the photogenerated electrons that arisen from Bi 2 O 3 could transfer to BiO layer of Bi 2 WO 6 by cosharing the Bi-O tetrahedron, eventually transfer to the WO4 2- layer (Figure 6b).Meanwhile, the cosharing of the Bi-O tetrahedron could shorten the migration distance of photogenerated carriers and accelerate the electron transfer (Figure 6c), which further explains the rapid photogenerated carrier transfer and the low photogenerated carrier recombination.Interestingly, taking the energy band structure, different interlayer structures, and atom structure into consideration, the photogenerated electrons all tend to transfer from Bi 2 O 3 to Bi 2 WO 6 , and the photogenerated holes all locate in Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively, which also sufficiently proves the Zscheme charge transfer mechanism in the BOBWO. Meanwhile, to testify the good photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared heterostructure photocatalyst, we also studied the photocatalytic degradation of the RhB aqueous solution over the catalysts.It is obvious that BOBWO-12 shows the best photocatalytic activity than other photocatalysts (Figure S6a).After 2 h of illumination, the RhB was completely degraded.As presented in Figure S6b, the photocatalytic activity of the BOBWO-12 is 6.8 and 49.5 times higher than that of Bi 2 O 3 and bulk Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively.The photocatalytic degradation stability was also investigated using BOBWO-12 as the photocatalyst.As shown in Figures S6c,d andS8, after five cycles of RhB degradation, the BOBWO-12 still shows good photocatalytic activity and initial morphology.Consequently, the dye degradation experiment also can reflect the enhanced photocatalytic performance of covalently-bonded composites, which further suggests that the rapid charge transfer and high charge separation efficiency of the covalently-bonded composites."}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [{"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were carried out under the irradiation of a solar simulator in a 300 mL home-made Pyrex glass reactor.", "context": "2.2.2.Synthesis of Other Samples.The reference samples synthesized with different reaction times, including 1, 2, 6, 18, and 24 h, were denoted as BOBWO-1, BOBWO-2, BOBWO-6, BOBWO-18, and BOBWO-24, respectively.The bulk-Bi 2 WO 6 (bulk-BWO) was fabricated similar to BOBWO-12 except without adding CTAB.Bi 2 O 3 was synthesized followed by the same procedure without the addition of Na 2 WO 6 .The physically mixed Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 was synthesized by adding the foregoing Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 at a molar ratio 1:1 mixed in 60 mL of deionized water and then sonicated and stirred for 1 h, respectively.ACS Applied Energy Materials 2.3.Material Characterizations.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (FEI Tecnai G2 F20) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (JEOL-JEM-2010) were applied to confirm the morphologies of materials.Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed on a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800 II, Japan) to analyze the compositions of the prepared samples.The purity and crystallinity of the as-prepared Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 powders were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu K radiation ( 0.15406 nm) on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer.The compositions of products were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCA PHI500).UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) was performed on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were performed using a TriStar II 3020 surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA) to determine the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore size distribution of the samples.The photoluminescence spectra (PL) for powder samples were obtained on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer.Time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra were obtained on a QuantaMaster and TimeMaster Spectrofluorometer (QuantaMaster 40, Photon Technology International, Inc.) with an excitation wavelength of 337 nm and a detection wavelength of 441 nm.The electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of radicals spin-trapped by the spin-trap reagent DMPO (Sigma Chemical Co.) in water or methanol were examined on a Bruker model ESR JES-FA200 spectrometer. 2.4.Photocatalytic Activity Tests.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests: The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were carried out under the irradiation of a solar simulator in a 300 mL home-made Pyrex glass reactor.In brief, 50 mg of sample was added into moderate DI water and dispersed evenly and then dried at 80 C.NaHCO 3 (0.084 g) was added to the groove in the reactor.Nitrogen (5 mL/min) was passed through liquid water to ensure the presence of saturated water vapor under atmospheric pressure.After purifying nitrogen for 20 min, 0.6 mL of H 2 SO 4 (2 molL -1 ) aqueous solution was injected slowly to react with NaHCO 3 to produce CO 2 and H 2 O vapor.Then, the reactor was irradiated under a 300 W Xe lamp with a cutoff filter ( 400 nm).The gas products were detected by a gas chromatograph (CEAULIGHT GC-7920) and calibrated with a standard gas mixture.All the gas components were determined by the retention time, and the concentrations of gas components were calculated by the external standard method of peak areas. Photodegradation of RhB: The photocatalytic activities of prepared samples were assessed by the photodegradation of RhB (10 mol L -1 ) under a 250 W xenon lamp with a cutoff filter ( 420 nm).For a typical procedure, 20 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in 80 mL RhB aqueous solution in a Pyrex glass container.Before irradiation, the suspension was stirred for 90 min to achieve an adsorption-desorption equilibrium between pollutants and catalysts in darkness.Then, they were exposed to the light source to start the photocatalysis reaction.At an interval of 30 min, 4 mL of the suspension was collected and centrifuged to remove the catalyst particles.The supernatant liquid was analyzed on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2450). 2.5.Photoelectrochemical Properties.The photocurrent measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were investigated by a CHI660B electrochemical analyzer in a standard three-electrode system, where Ag/AgCl and Pt wire were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively, and the samples were used as working electrodes.The detail of working electrodes is that the samples were spin-coated onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses.The electrolytes of photocurrent measurement and EIS analysis were carried out in 0."}, {"llm generation": "Visible-light", "source": "To figure out the connection between the above characteristics (special microstructure and photoelectrochemical property) and the photocatalytic activity, the CO 2 photoreduction tests over the as-prepared samples were carried out under 4 h continuous visible-light irradiation ( 400 nm) in a CO 2 and H 2 O (vapor) atmosphere.", "context": "Figure 1a illustrates the single-step hydrothermal synthetic process of the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure and the corresponding crystal structure.As shown in the atom structure, the layered structure Bi 2 WO 6 is constructed by Bi 2 O 2 layers and corner-shared WO 6 octahedral layers. 323334 The structure of the Bi 2 O 2 layer in Bi 2 WO 6 is similar to the structure of Bi 2 O 3 , which is a Bi-O tetrahedral configuration. 35This special structure endows Bi 2 WO 6 with epitaxial growth along with the Bi 2 O 3 layer by cosharing of the Bi-O tetrahedron.In comparison with other Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 composites, this covalently bonded Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure exhibits a compact heterointerface with strong interfacial interaction, which could provide a highway for the transfer of charge carriers, thus reducing their recombination, and also could enhance the structural stability of the heterostructure photocatalyst. The morphology of the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure was characterized by TEM.As shown in Figure 1b-d, the Bi 2 O 3 / Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure exhibits a unique interconnected net structure which is composed of secondary interweaved nanowires with an average diameter of 5 nm and an irregular ultrathin nanosheet shape.The microstructure of the Bi 2 O 3 / Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure was further investigated by the HRTEM.As shown in Figure 1e, the interconnected net structure of Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 is quite obvious.The corresponding HRTEM images selected from the dashed areas of Figure 1e are further enlarged in Figure 1f,g.The lattice spacings of 0.289 and 0.386 nm are well indexed to the (002) and (200) planes of tetragonal Bi 2 O 3 , and the lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.361 nm could be ascribed to the (002) plane of orthorhombic Bi 2 WO 6 .This result indicates that the Bi 2 O 3 / Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure is composed of Bi 2 O 3 nanosheets and Bi 2 WO 6 nanowire networks.The interconnected heterostructures comprising Bi 2 WO 6 nanowire networks and Bi 2 O 3 nanosheets might provide more abundant active sites and assessable channels for the transport of mass, thus contributing to the photocatalytic activity. The XRD pattern further confirms that the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure is composed of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 .As shown in Figure 2a,b, the XRD pattern of BOBWO-1 only displays characteristic (210), ( 201), (002), (220), and (102) lattice planes (JCPDS no.76-0147), which indicates that the product can readily be assigned to pure Bi 2 O 3 .In addition, the characteristic (113), ( 200), ( 220), (133), and (226) can be ascribed to Bi 2 WO 6 (Figure S1, JCPDS no.73-2020).As vividly shown in Figure 2b, BOBWO-12 not only exists in the characteristic (210) and (002) lattice planes of Bi 2 O 3 but is also displayed (113) and (200) lattice planes of Bi 2 WO 6 , which suggests that Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 exist in the system simultaneously.To explore the formation mechanism of the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure, a series of control experiments were carried out by varying the hydrothermal reaction time, and the corresponding XRD patterns and TEM images are shown in Figure 2a,b and Figure S2.When the hydrothermal reaction time is 1 h, all of the samples were nanosheet shapes with a smooth surface and no nanowires can be observed.The XRD pattern confirms that the nanosheet-like sample is pure Bi 2 O 3 , indicating that Bi 2 O 3 is first generated (Figure S2b).When the reaction was prolonged to 2 h, the Bi 2 WO 6 network appeared with densely assembled nanowires and closely hybridized with a Bi 2 O 3 nanosheet to form the intermediate Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure (Figure S2c).As shown in the XRD pattern (Figure 2b), the (201), (220), and (102) lattice ACS Applied Energy Materials planes of Bi 2 O 3 are missing, and the new lattice planes (113) and (200) of Bi 2 WO 6 are formed on the same positions, which conjectures that the stronger intensity peaks of Bi 2 WO 6 cover the weaker characteristic peaks of Bi 2 O 3 .Further prolonging the reaction time to 6 h, the Bi 2 WO 6 nanowires turn sparsely and the Bi 2 O 3 nanosheets gradually shrink, demonstrating that Bi 2 O 3 is converted to Bi 2 WO 6 as the precursor (Figure S2d).Then, most of the Bi 2 WO 6 nanowires disappear, and a new type of nanosheet structure combined with sparse nanowires is generated when the reaction time is 18 h (Figure S2e).Meanwhile, the only one weak intensity (002) lattice plane of XRD indicates that there is little Bi 2 O 3 in the heterostructure sample at this step (Figure 2b), which is in line with the TEM result (Figure S2e).Finally, the span-new well-defined Bi 2 WO 6 nanosheets with the sandwich-layered structure were formed when the reaction is 24 h (Figure 2a and Figure S2f).Moreover, the HAADF-STEM image of BOBWO-12 and the corresponding EDX elemental mapping images (Figure S2g,h) demonstrate the inhomogeneous distribution of Bi, W, and O elements, indicating that the sample is heterogeneous. To further explore the growth mechanism of the composites, the surface areas and corresponding pore size distribution curves of the different hydrothermal time catalysts were determined.In Figure 2c,d and Table S1, the BOBWO-6 displays the highest BET surface area (36.04 m 2 g -1 ) and the largest BJH surface area of pores (40.91 m 2 g -1 ).With the reaction time prolonging to 12 h, the BET surface area (24.47 m 2 g -1 ) and the BJH surface area (23.75 m 2 g -1 ) of the pores of the BOBWO-12 drastically decrease compared to the BOBWO-6, which could be ascribed to the conversion of Bi 2 O 3 to Bi 2 WO 6 by the epitaxial growth and filling the pores of Bi 2 WO 6 networks gradually.Further prolonging the reaction time to 18 h, the large rectangular pores of Bi 2 WO 6 disappear thoroughly, and the BET surface area (22.38 m 2 g -1 ) and the BJH surface area of pores (22.72 m 2 g -1 ) of BOBWO-18 still keep decreasing.When the reaction time reaches to 24 h, the BOBWO-24 displays the lowest BET surface area (18.05 m 2 g -1 ) and the smallest BJH surface area of pores (15.44m 2 g -1 ).In conclusion, with the reaction time prolonging, the BET and BJH surface area of the composites continue to decrease, which is consistent with the change of TEM and XRD results, further demonstrating that Bi 2 O 3 could convert to Bi 2 WO 6 as the precursor and fill up the pore of Bi 2 WO 6 networks.In consideration of an average diameter of 5 nm, the 2D nanowires grafted on some CTAB will spontaneously transform into the nanosheets and the size of the Bi 2 WO 6 nanosheets turns larger with the reaction time increasing, which is consistent with Yang's report. 36This process can be illustrated by the atom structure shown in Figure S2a.The Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure can be regarded as an intermediate during the transformation of Bi 2 O 3 to Bi 2 WO 6 via epitaxial growth. XPS was performed to investigate elemental compositions and chemical states of the samples.As shown in Figure 3a, the Bi 4f spectra of the BOBWO-12 exhibit two characteristic peaks at 159.2 and 164.5 eV, which can be assigned to Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 , respectively. 37In the comparison to BOBWO-24 (pure Bi 2 WO 6 ), a positive shift of about 0.1 eV can be observed, indicating a strong interaction between the Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , and eventually causing a charge balance between Bi of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi of Bi 2 WO 6 . 38In association with the element content ratio of Bi, W, and O (4: 1: 9) (Figure S3), the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 (1: 1) heterostructure is generated by the covalently-bonded epitaxial growth and co-sharing of the Bi-O tetrahedron.In the W 4f XPS spectra (Figure 3b), the BOBWO-12 and BOBWO-24 show the same peaks at 35.4 and 37.6 eV, and the peaks correspond to the W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 of Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively, 37,39 indicating that the addition of Bi 2 O 3 could not affect the surrounding electronic environment of W atoms due to the Bi 2 O 3 is not directly connected with W atoms of Bi 2 WO 6 , which also reflects that the Bi 2 O 3 is directly combined with the Bi 2 WO 6 by co-sharing the Bi-O tetrahedron.As exhibited in Figure 3c, the peaks of O1s at 530.2 and 531.7 eV of the BOBWO-12 corresponded to the Bi-O of Bi 2 O 2 2 and W-O of WO 4 2-, respectively, which is the same as those of the BOBWO-24. 40In addition, the peak at 532.6 eV of the BOBWO-12 is because of the oxygen of the surface adsorbing water molecules, 41 which indicates that Bi 2 O 3 can facilitate the surface absorption of physical water and contribute to the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with the H 2 O vapor.As shown in Figure 3d, the Br 3d peaks at 68.2 and 69.2 eV of the BOBWO-12 can be assigned to the Br 3d 5/2 and Br 3d 3/2 , respectively, which is a little negative shift than the BOBWO-24. 42,43Due to part of Br could absorb on the surface of catalysts, the negative shift of Br element in the composites can be ascribed to the increased electron density of Br, which indicates that more unsaturated Bi sites are exposed in the composite and cause more electrons transfer to the absorbed Br. 43 Figure 4a shows the UV-DRS spectra of the as-synthesized pure Bi 2 O 3 and BOBWO with different reaction times, and the corresponding band gap energies were calculated from the plots of (h) 1/2 vs the energy of the absorbed light in Figure 4b.Pure Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24) display a visiblelight absorption edge at approximately 389 and 445 nm, respectively.A slight redshift is observed for the BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, and BOBWO-18 compared to the pure Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), which indicates an enhanced visible-light harvesting ability of the composites and reveals a strong interaction from the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure.Moreover, the band gap energies of the as-prepared samples are quite close, and the values are 2.97, 2.55, 2.60, 2.64, and 2.69 eV for the Bi 2 O 3 , BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, BOBWO-18, and BOBWO-24, respectively.The delicate difference of the band gap energy of the samples demonstrates that Bi 2 O 3 is gradually transformed to Bi 2 WO 6 with the reaction time increasing. To study the separation properties of photogenerated electrons and holes, the transient photocurrent response was applied to give evidence about charge separation under irradiation.An enhanced photocurrent intensity of BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, and BOBWO-18 could be recognized as distinct from pure Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), (Figure 4c), which corresponds to a higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and could be ascribed to the intimate interface between Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 .Furthermore, the BOBWO-12 shows the highest photocurrent intensity, and the result indicates that the composites possess the fastest photogenerated electron-hole separation rate, which may be ascribed to the largest contact area and the intimate coupling between Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 .From the EIS, the migration state of carriers in the electrode-electrolyte interface can be more deeply clarified. 44As shown in Figure 4d, the BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, and BOBWO-18 possess a smaller radius in contrast with Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), which suggests that the composites have lower charge transfer resistance, faster separation, and migration of carriers.Interestingly, the BOBWO-12 also exhibits the smallest radius, which further indicates that the covalently bonded interface could provide a rapid channel for photogenerated carrier transfer. Meanwhile, to further figure out the influence of the charge transfer that arose from the covalently bonded interface, the steady-state photoluminescence spectra of the as-prepared samples were examined.In this work, the PL spectra of the asprepared samples were tested at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm.As shown in Figure 4e, the PL intensities of BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, and BOBWO-18 samples are lower than that of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), indicating the faster charge separation of the heterostructure.Meanwhile, BOBWO-12 shows the weakest steady-state PL emission peaks at 440 nm, indicating the lowest photogenerated carrier recombination, which could be ascribed to the conjecture that the covalently bonded interface could facilitate the photogenerated carrier separation between Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 .To further verify the function of the covalently bonded interface of the composites in the photogenerated carrier transfer process, the time-resolved fluorescence study was carried.As shown in Figure 4f and Table S2, the fluorescence lifetime of the BOBWO-12 is 0.90689 ns, which is much longer than that of pure Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), further suggesting that the recombination of charge carriers over the composites have been restrained effectively. 45Furthermore, the detailed fluorescence lifetime 2 of the BOBWO-12 is much longer than other samples, indicating a much lower direct recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers in the composites, which further proves that the compact covalently bonded interface between Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 can benefit the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.Interestingly, the BOBWO-12 with an asymmetric Bi To figure out the connection between the above characteristics (special microstructure and photoelectrochemical property) and the photocatalytic activity, the CO 2 photoreduction tests over the as-prepared samples were carried out under 4 h continuous visible-light irradiation ( 400 nm) in a CO 2 and H 2 O (vapor) atmosphere.As shown in Figure 5a,b, all the BOBWO samples exhibit enhanced photocatalytic CO and O 2 generation activities than bulk Bi 2 WO 6 and pure Bi 2 O 3 , which could be ascribed to the highly efficient photoinduced electron reduction CO 2 to CO and photoinduced hole oxidation H 2 O to O 2 due to the rapid photogenerated carrier transfer and high charge separation efficiency.Meanwhile, it could be seen that no CO can be detected from pure Bi 2 O 3 , which means that pure Bi 2 O 3 cannot reduce CO 2 to CO under photocatalytic conditions.Especially, the CO generation rate of BOBWO-12 reaches up to 17.39 molg -1 h -1 , which is 18.0 and 4.2 times higher than that of bulk-Bi 2 WO 6 and Bi 2 WO 6 nanosheets.To figure out the significance of the covalently bonded interface, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of physically mixed Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 was measured.After 4 h of irradiation, the CO yield of physically mixed Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 only reaches up to 25.52 molg -1 that is much lower than that of the covalently bonded BOBWO-12 (Figure S4), which suggests that the compact interface could accelerate the charge transfer and decrease the photogenerated carrier recombination.Interestingly, the CO generation rate of the BOBWO-12 is 3.3, 5.3, and 4.2 times higher than that of the BOBWO-6, BOBWO-18, and BOBWO-24, respectively, revealing a strong correlation with the structure and composition of the different reaction time composites.Meanwhile, the BOBWO-12 also shows the best selectivity of CO generation (95.4)compared to Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , while almost no H 2 and CH 4 could be detected (Figure 5b), which suggests that the composites tend to produce CO through a dual electron reduction and cannot function as the active sites for the generation of H 2 and CH 4 .To investigate the long-term stability of this heterostructure photocatalyst, the reusability test was performed over the BOBWO-12 sample under the same photocatalytic test condition.As shown in Figure 5c, the photocatalytic CO generation activity of the BOBWO-12 remains well after five cycles, and the CO yield retains 83.5 of the first run, from 17.39 to 14.51 molg -1 , which indicates that the heterointerface connected by the covalent bond is beneficial to the structural stability of the composite catalyst. 46o achieve indirect evidence of the carbon source and the possible catalytic mechanism of the generated CO, a series of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments under different reaction conditions were carried out.As shown in Figure 5d, column 1, no products are detected under dark conditions, indicating the photocatalytic nature of the CO 2 reduction reaction. 47With the absence of H 2 O vapor, the CO generation decreases sharply (Figure 5d, column 2), indicating that the high photocatalytic activity of the composites must simultaneously conduct the oxidation of H 2 O and the reduction of CO 2 . 3Meanwhile, almost no CO is generated (Figure 5d, column 3) in the absence of photocatalysts.Moreover (Figure 5d, column 4), when the reactor was filled by N 2 and H 2 O (vapor) rather than CO 2 , no CO is detected and just a little H 2 is detected, which confirms that the raw CO 2 is the key to the generation of CO (Figure 5d, column 5). To validate the reason for the increased activity of Bi 2 O 3 / Bi 2 WO 6 in CO 2 photoreduction compared to pure Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge positions of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 require to be investigated.To pinpoint the band position of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , the Mott-Schottky (MS) measurements were taken.The flat band potentials (E f ) of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 are estimated to be -0.69 and -1.09V vs Ag/AgCl from the MS plot (Figure S5), which are equal to -0.07 and -0.47 V vs normal hydrogen electrode ACS Applied Energy Materials (NHE). 48The slopes of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 MS plots are positive, indicating that Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 are n-type semiconductors. 49In n-type semiconductors, the flat-band potential is an approximation of the potential of the CB. 49herefore, the CB edge potentials of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 are estimated to be -0.07 and -0.47 V (vs NHE, pH 0), respectively.Especially, the CB edge potentials of Bi 2 O 3 is more positive than the position (-0.11V vs. NHE, pH0) of CO 2 /CO photoreduction, thus the Bi 2 O 3 could not favor the CO 2 photoreduction to CO, which is consistent with the result of CO 2 photoreduction measurement (Figure 5a).Especially, the CB edge potential of Bi 2 O 3 is more positive than the position (-0.11V vs NHE, pH 0) of CO 2 /CO photoreduction; thus, Bi 2 O 3 could not favor the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO, which is consistent with the result of CO 2 photoreduction measurement (Figure 5a).Considering the Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 band gaps (E g ) to be 2.97 and 2.69 eV, the VB edge potentials of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 are calculated to be 2.90 and 2.22 V, respectively.Therefore, the charge transfer mechanism could be divided into two types, II-type and Zscheme.If the II-type charge transfer mechanism is adopted in BOBWO, the electrons will transfer from CB of Bi 2 WO 6 to CB of Bi 2 O 3 and the holes will transfer from VB of Bi 2 O 3 to VB of Bi 2 WO 6 , which could not reach to the standard potential of CO 2 /CO photoreduction.However, the BOBWO-12 performs superior activity in CO 2 photoreduction to CO, which could be attributed to the Z-scheme charge transfer (Figure 6a).As we know, the photogenerated electrons of Aurivillius phase oxides Bi 2 WO 6 tend to transfer from BiO layer to WO 4 2layer 30 , and the photogenerated holes tend to transfer from BiO layer to WO 4 2-layer.Therefore, with the accumulated holes of Bi 2 WO 6 in BiO layer, the BiO layer of Bi 2 WO 6 can attract large photogenerated electrons from the Bi 2 O 3 , and the photogenerated electrons that arisen from Bi 2 O 3 could transfer to BiO layer of Bi 2 WO 6 by cosharing the Bi-O tetrahedron, eventually transfer to the WO4 2- layer (Figure 6b).Meanwhile, the cosharing of the Bi-O tetrahedron could shorten the migration distance of photogenerated carriers and accelerate the electron transfer (Figure 6c), which further explains the rapid photogenerated carrier transfer and the low photogenerated carrier recombination.Interestingly, taking the energy band structure, different interlayer structures, and atom structure into consideration, the photogenerated electrons all tend to transfer from Bi 2 O 3 to Bi 2 WO 6 , and the photogenerated holes all locate in Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively, which also sufficiently proves the Zscheme charge transfer mechanism in the BOBWO. Meanwhile, to testify the good photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared heterostructure photocatalyst, we also studied the photocatalytic degradation of the RhB aqueous solution over the catalysts.It is obvious that BOBWO-12 shows the best photocatalytic activity than other photocatalysts (Figure S6a).After 2 h of illumination, the RhB was completely degraded.As presented in Figure S6b, the photocatalytic activity of the BOBWO-12 is 6.8 and 49.5 times higher than that of Bi 2 O 3 and bulk Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively.The photocatalytic degradation stability was also investigated using BOBWO-12 as the photocatalyst.As shown in Figures S6c,d andS8, after five cycles of RhB degradation, the BOBWO-12 still shows good photocatalytic activity and initial morphology.Consequently, the dye degradation experiment also can reflect the enhanced photocatalytic performance of covalently-bonded composites, which further suggests that the rapid charge transfer and high charge separation efficiency of the covalently-bonded composites."}], "lamp": [], "reaction medium": [], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "To figure out the connection between the above characteristics (special microstructure and photoelectrochemical property) and the photocatalytic activity, the CO 2 photoreduction tests over the as-prepared samples were carried out under 4 h continuous visible-light irradiation ( 400 nm) in a CO 2 and H 2 O (vapor) atmosphere.", "context": "Figure 1a illustrates the single-step hydrothermal synthetic process of the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure and the corresponding crystal structure.As shown in the atom structure, the layered structure Bi 2 WO 6 is constructed by Bi 2 O 2 layers and corner-shared WO 6 octahedral layers. 323334 The structure of the Bi 2 O 2 layer in Bi 2 WO 6 is similar to the structure of Bi 2 O 3 , which is a Bi-O tetrahedral configuration. 35This special structure endows Bi 2 WO 6 with epitaxial growth along with the Bi 2 O 3 layer by cosharing of the Bi-O tetrahedron.In comparison with other Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 composites, this covalently bonded Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure exhibits a compact heterointerface with strong interfacial interaction, which could provide a highway for the transfer of charge carriers, thus reducing their recombination, and also could enhance the structural stability of the heterostructure photocatalyst.

The XRD pattern further confirms that the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure is composed of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 .As shown in Figure 2a,b, the XRD pattern of BOBWO-1 only displays characteristic (210), ( 201), (002), (220), and (102) lattice planes (JCPDS no.76-0147), which indicates that the product can readily be assigned to pure Bi 2 O 3 .In addition, the characteristic (113), ( 200), ( 220), (133), and (226) can be ascribed to Bi 2 WO 6 (Figure S1, JCPDS no.73-2020).As vividly shown in Figure 2b, BOBWO-12 not only exists in the characteristic (210) and (002) lattice planes of Bi 2 O 3 but is also displayed (113) and (200) lattice planes of Bi 2 WO 6 , which suggests that Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 exist in the system simultaneously.To explore the formation mechanism of the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure, a series of control experiments were carried out by varying the hydrothermal reaction time, and the corresponding XRD patterns and TEM images are shown in Figure 2a,b and Figure S2.When the hydrothermal reaction time is 1 h, all of the samples were nanosheet shapes with a smooth surface and no nanowires can be observed.The XRD pattern confirms that the nanosheet-like sample is pure Bi 2 O 3 , indicating that Bi 2 O 3 is first generated (Figure S2b).When the reaction was prolonged to 2 h, the Bi 2 WO 6 network appeared with densely assembled nanowires and closely hybridized with a Bi 2 O 3 nanosheet to form the intermediate Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure (Figure S2c).As shown in the XRD pattern (Figure 2b), the (201), (220), and (102) lattice ACS Applied Energy Materials planes of Bi 2 O 3 are missing, and the new lattice planes (113) and (200) of Bi 2 WO 6 are formed on the same positions, which conjectures that the stronger intensity peaks of Bi 2 WO 6 cover the weaker characteristic peaks of Bi 2 O 3 .Further prolonging the reaction time to 6 h, the Bi 2 WO 6 nanowires turn sparsely and the Bi 2 O 3 nanosheets gradually shrink, demonstrating that Bi 2 O 3 is converted to Bi 2 WO 6 as the precursor (Figure S2d).Then, most of the Bi 2 WO 6 nanowires disappear, and a new type of nanosheet structure combined with sparse nanowires is generated when the reaction time is 18 h (Figure S2e).Meanwhile, the only one weak intensity (002) lattice plane of XRD indicates that there is little Bi 2 O 3 in the heterostructure sample at this step (Figure 2b), which is in line with the TEM result (Figure S2e).Finally, the span-new well-defined Bi 2 WO 6 nanosheets with the sandwich-layered structure were formed when the reaction is 24 h (Figure 2a and Figure S2f).Moreover, the HAADF-STEM image of BOBWO-12 and the corresponding EDX elemental mapping images (Figure S2g,h) demonstrate the inhomogeneous distribution of Bi, W, and O elements, indicating that the sample is heterogeneous. To further explore the growth mechanism of the composites, the surface areas and corresponding pore size distribution curves of the different hydrothermal time catalysts were determined.In Figure 2c,d and Table S1, the BOBWO-6 displays the highest BET surface area (36.04 m 2 g -1 ) and the largest BJH surface area of pores (40.91 m 2 g -1 ).With the reaction time prolonging to 12 h, the BET surface area (24.47 m 2 g -1 ) and the BJH surface area (23.75 m 2 g -1 ) of the pores of the BOBWO-12 drastically decrease compared to the BOBWO-6, which could be ascribed to the conversion of Bi 2 O 3 to Bi 2 WO 6 by the epitaxial growth and filling the pores of Bi 2 WO 6 networks gradually.Further prolonging the reaction time to 18 h, the large rectangular pores of Bi 2 WO 6 disappear thoroughly, and the BET surface area (22.38 m 2 g -1 ) and the BJH surface area of pores (22.72 m 2 g -1 ) of BOBWO-18 still keep decreasing.When the reaction time reaches to 24 h, the BOBWO-24 displays the lowest BET surface area (18.05 m 2 g -1 ) and the smallest BJH surface area of pores (15.44m 2 g -1 ).In conclusion, with the reaction time prolonging, the BET and BJH surface area of the composites continue to decrease, which is consistent with the change of TEM and XRD results, further demonstrating that Bi 2 O 3 could convert to Bi 2 WO 6 as the precursor and fill up the pore of Bi 2 WO 6 networks.In consideration of an average diameter of 5 nm, the 2D nanowires grafted on some CTAB will spontaneously transform into the nanosheets and the size of the Bi 2 WO 6 nanosheets turns larger with the reaction time increasing, which is consistent with Yang's report. 36This process can be illustrated by the atom structure shown in Figure S2a.The Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure can be regarded as an intermediate during the transformation of Bi 2 O 3 to Bi 2 WO 6 via epitaxial growth. XPS was performed to investigate elemental compositions and chemical states of the samples.As shown in Figure 3a, the Bi 4f spectra of the BOBWO-12 exhibit two characteristic peaks at 159.2 and 164.5 eV, which can be assigned to Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 , respectively. 37In the comparison to BOBWO-24 (pure Bi 2 WO 6 ), a positive shift of about 0.1 eV can be observed, indicating a strong interaction between the Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , and eventually causing a charge balance between Bi of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi of Bi 2 WO 6 . 38In association with the element content ratio of Bi, W, and O (4: 1: 9) (Figure S3), the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 (1: 1) heterostructure is generated by the covalently-bonded epitaxial growth and co-sharing of the Bi-O tetrahedron.In the W 4f XPS spectra (Figure 3b), the BOBWO-12 and BOBWO-24 show the same peaks at 35.4 and 37.6 eV, and the peaks correspond to the W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 of Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively, 37,39 indicating that the addition of Bi 2 O 3 could not affect the surrounding electronic environment of W atoms due to the Bi 2 O 3 is not directly connected with W atoms of Bi 2 WO 6 , which also reflects that the Bi 2 O 3 is directly combined with the Bi 2 WO 6 by co-sharing the Bi-O tetrahedron.As exhibited in Figure 3c, the peaks of O1s at 530.2 and 531.7 eV of the BOBWO-12 corresponded to the Bi-O of Bi 2 O 2 2 and W-O of WO 4 2-, respectively, which is the same as those of the BOBWO-24. 40In addition, the peak at 532.6 eV of the BOBWO-12 is because of the oxygen of the surface adsorbing water molecules, 41 which indicates that Bi 2 O 3 can facilitate the surface absorption of physical water and contribute to the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with the H 2 O vapor.As shown in Figure 3d, the Br 3d peaks at 68.2 and 69.2 eV of the BOBWO-12 can be assigned to the Br 3d 5/2 and Br 3d 3/2 , respectively, which is a little negative shift than the BOBWO-24. 42,43Due to part of Br could absorb on the surface of catalysts, the negative shift of Br element in the composites can be ascribed to the increased electron density of Br, which indicates that more unsaturated Bi sites are exposed in the composite and cause more electrons transfer to the absorbed Br. 43 Figure 4a shows the UV-DRS spectra of the as-synthesized pure Bi 2 O 3 and BOBWO with different reaction times, and the corresponding band gap energies were calculated from the plots of (h) 1/2 vs the energy of the absorbed light in Figure 4b.Pure Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24) display a visiblelight absorption edge at approximately 389 and 445 nm, respectively.A slight redshift is observed for the BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, and BOBWO-18 compared to the pure Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), which indicates an enhanced visible-light harvesting ability of the composites and reveals a strong interaction from the Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 heterostructure.Moreover, the band gap energies of the as-prepared samples are quite close, and the values are 2.97, 2.55, 2.60, 2.64, and 2.69 eV for the Bi 2 O 3 , BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, BOBWO-18, and BOBWO-24, respectively.The delicate difference of the band gap energy of the samples demonstrates that Bi 2 O 3 is gradually transformed to Bi 2 WO 6 with the reaction time increasing. To study the separation properties of photogenerated electrons and holes, the transient photocurrent response was applied to give evidence about charge separation under irradiation.An enhanced photocurrent intensity of BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, and BOBWO-18 could be recognized as distinct from pure Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), (Figure 4c), which corresponds to a higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and could be ascribed to the intimate interface between Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 .Furthermore, the BOBWO-12 shows the highest photocurrent intensity, and the result indicates that the composites possess the fastest photogenerated electron-hole separation rate, which may be ascribed to the largest contact area and the intimate coupling between Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 .From the EIS, the migration state of carriers in the electrode-electrolyte interface can be more deeply clarified. 44As shown in Figure 4d, the BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, and BOBWO-18 possess a smaller radius in contrast with Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), which suggests that the composites have lower charge transfer resistance, faster separation, and migration of carriers.Interestingly, the BOBWO-12 also exhibits the smallest radius, which further indicates that the covalently bonded interface could provide a rapid channel for photogenerated carrier transfer. Meanwhile, to further figure out the influence of the charge transfer that arose from the covalently bonded interface, the steady-state photoluminescence spectra of the as-prepared samples were examined.In this work, the PL spectra of the asprepared samples were tested at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm.As shown in Figure 4e, the PL intensities of BOBWO-6, BOBWO-12, and BOBWO-18 samples are lower than that of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), indicating the faster charge separation of the heterostructure.Meanwhile, BOBWO-12 shows the weakest steady-state PL emission peaks at 440 nm, indicating the lowest photogenerated carrier recombination, which could be ascribed to the conjecture that the covalently bonded interface could facilitate the photogenerated carrier separation between Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 .To further verify the function of the covalently bonded interface of the composites in the photogenerated carrier transfer process, the time-resolved fluorescence study was carried.As shown in Figure 4f and Table S2, the fluorescence lifetime of the BOBWO-12 is 0.90689 ns, which is much longer than that of pure Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 (BOBWO-24), further suggesting that the recombination of charge carriers over the composites have been restrained effectively. 45Furthermore, the detailed fluorescence lifetime 2 of the BOBWO-12 is much longer than other samples, indicating a much lower direct recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers in the composites, which further proves that the compact covalently bonded interface between Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 can benefit the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.Interestingly, the BOBWO-12 with an asymmetric Bi To figure out the connection between the above characteristics (special microstructure and photoelectrochemical property) and the photocatalytic activity, the CO 2 photoreduction tests over the as-prepared samples were carried out under 4 h continuous visible-light irradiation ( 400 nm) in a CO 2 and H 2 O (vapor) atmosphere.As shown in Figure 5a,b, all the BOBWO samples exhibit enhanced photocatalytic CO and O 2 generation activities than bulk Bi 2 WO 6 and pure Bi 2 O 3 , which could be ascribed to the highly efficient photoinduced electron reduction CO 2 to CO and photoinduced hole oxidation H 2 O to O 2 due to the rapid photogenerated carrier transfer and high charge separation efficiency.Meanwhile, it could be seen that no CO can be detected from pure Bi 2 O 3 , which means that pure Bi 2 O 3 cannot reduce CO 2 to CO under photocatalytic conditions.Especially, the CO generation rate of BOBWO-12 reaches up to 17.39 molg -1 h -1 , which is 18.0 and 4.2 times higher than that of bulk-Bi 2 WO 6 and Bi 2 WO 6 nanosheets.To figure out the significance of the covalently bonded interface, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of physically mixed Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 was measured.After 4 h of irradiation, the CO yield of physically mixed Bi 2 O 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 only reaches up to 25.52 molg -1 that is much lower than that of the covalently bonded BOBWO-12 (Figure S4), which suggests that the compact interface could accelerate the charge transfer and decrease the photogenerated carrier recombination.Interestingly, the CO generation rate of the BOBWO-12 is 3.3, 5.3, and 4.2 times higher than that of the BOBWO-6, BOBWO-18, and BOBWO-24, respectively, revealing a strong correlation with the structure and composition of the different reaction time composites.Meanwhile, the BOBWO-12 also shows the best selectivity of CO generation (95.4)compared to Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , while almost no H 2 and CH 4 could be detected (Figure 5b), which suggests that the composites tend to produce CO through a dual electron reduction and cannot function as the active sites for the generation of H 2 and CH 4 .To investigate the long-term stability of this heterostructure photocatalyst, the reusability test was performed over the BOBWO-12 sample under the same photocatalytic test condition.As shown in Figure 5c, the photocatalytic CO generation activity of the BOBWO-12 remains well after five cycles, and the CO yield retains 83.5 of the first run, from 17.39 to 14.51 molg -1 , which indicates that the heterointerface connected by the covalent bond is beneficial to the structural stability of the composite catalyst. 46o achieve indirect evidence of the carbon source and the possible catalytic mechanism of the generated CO, a series of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments under different reaction conditions were carried out.As shown in Figure 5d, column 1, no products are detected under dark conditions, indicating the photocatalytic nature of the CO 2 reduction reaction. 47With the absence of H 2 O vapor, the CO generation decreases sharply (Figure 5d, column 2), indicating that the high photocatalytic activity of the composites must simultaneously conduct the oxidation of H 2 O and the reduction of CO 2 . 3Meanwhile, almost no CO is generated (Figure 5d, column 3) in the absence of photocatalysts.Moreover (Figure 5d, column 4), when the reactor was filled by N 2 and H 2 O (vapor) rather than CO 2 , no CO is detected and just a little H 2 is detected, which confirms that the raw CO 2 is the key to the generation of CO (Figure 5d, column 5). To validate the reason for the increased activity of Bi 2 O 3 / Bi 2 WO 6 in CO 2 photoreduction compared to pure Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge positions of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 require to be investigated.To pinpoint the band position of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , the Mott-Schottky (MS) measurements were taken.The flat band potentials (E f ) of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 are estimated to be -0.69 and -1.09V vs Ag/AgCl from the MS plot (Figure S5), which are equal to -0.07 and -0.47 V vs normal hydrogen electrode ACS Applied Energy Materials (NHE). 48The slopes of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 MS plots are positive, indicating that Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 are n-type semiconductors. 49In n-type semiconductors, the flat-band potential is an approximation of the potential of the CB. 49herefore, the CB edge potentials of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 are estimated to be -0.07 and -0.47 V (vs NHE, pH 0), respectively.Especially, the CB edge potentials of Bi 2 O 3 is more positive than the position (-0.11V vs. NHE, pH0) of CO 2 /CO photoreduction, thus the Bi 2 O 3 could not favor the CO 2 photoreduction to CO, which is consistent with the result of CO 2 photoreduction measurement (Figure 5a).Especially, the CB edge potential of Bi 2 O 3 is more positive than the position (-0.11V vs NHE, pH 0) of CO 2 /CO photoreduction; thus, Bi 2 O 3 could not favor the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO, which is consistent with the result of CO 2 photoreduction measurement (Figure 5a).Considering the Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 band gaps (E g ) to be 2.97 and 2.69 eV, the VB edge potentials of Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 are calculated to be 2.90 and 2.22 V, respectively.Therefore, the charge transfer mechanism could be divided into two types, II-type and Zscheme.If the II-type charge transfer mechanism is adopted in BOBWO, the electrons will transfer from CB of Bi 2 WO 6 to CB of Bi 2 O 3 and the holes will transfer from VB of Bi 2 O 3 to VB of Bi 2 WO 6 , which could not reach to the standard potential of CO 2 /CO photoreduction.However, the BOBWO-12 performs superior activity in CO 2 photoreduction to CO, which could be attributed to the Z-scheme charge transfer (Figure 6a).As we know, the photogenerated electrons of Aurivillius phase oxides Bi 2 WO 6 tend to transfer from BiO layer to WO 4 2layer 30 , and the photogenerated holes tend to transfer from BiO layer to WO 4 2-layer.Therefore, with the accumulated holes of Bi 2 WO 6 in BiO layer, the BiO layer of Bi 2 WO 6 can attract large photogenerated electrons from the Bi 2 O 3 , and the photogenerated electrons that arisen from Bi 2 O 3 could transfer to BiO layer of Bi 2 WO 6 by cosharing the Bi-O tetrahedron, eventually transfer to the WO4 2- layer (Figure 6b).Meanwhile, the cosharing of the Bi-O tetrahedron could shorten the migration distance of photogenerated carriers and accelerate the electron transfer (Figure 6c), which further explains the rapid photogenerated carrier transfer and the low photogenerated carrier recombination.Interestingly, taking the energy band structure, different interlayer structures, and atom structure into consideration, the photogenerated electrons all tend to transfer from Bi 2 O 3 to Bi 2 WO 6 , and the photogenerated holes all locate in Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively, which also sufficiently proves the Zscheme charge transfer mechanism in the BOBWO. Meanwhile, to testify the good photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared heterostructure photocatalyst, we also studied the photocatalytic degradation of the RhB aqueous solution over the catalysts.It is obvious that BOBWO-12 shows the best photocatalytic activity than other photocatalysts (Figure S6a).After 2 h of illumination, the RhB was completely degraded.As presented in Figure S6b, the photocatalytic activity of the BOBWO-12 is 6.8 and 49.5 times higher than that of Bi 2 O 3 and bulk Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively.The photocatalytic degradation stability was also investigated using BOBWO-12 as the photocatalyst.As shown in Figures S6c,d andS8, after five cycles of RhB degradation, the BOBWO-12 still shows good photocatalytic activity and initial morphology.Consequently, the dye degradation experiment also can reflect the enhanced photocatalytic performance of covalently-bonded composites, which further suggests that the rapid charge transfer and high charge separation efficiency of the covalently-bonded composites."}]}}
