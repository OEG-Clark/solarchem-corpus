FLG was synthesized by a liquid exfoliation process derived from Artificial graphite (graphite, purity 99 ).All delamination experiments were carried out in a homemade ultra-high-pressure continuousflow cell disrupter according to the previously reported method.41 Typically, 10 wt. graphite suspension in deionized water is created by applying from low pressure (800 bar) to high pressure (2000 bar) to force the sample through a small orifice at high speed under a flow rate of 10 L/min.The shearing effects crushed the graphite and dispersed and emulsified the sample components.During this process, the FLG remained in suspension, which was ensured by keeping the sample at 14-16 C in a circulating water bath.The FLG was produced 3 batch runs at 800 bar, 3 batch runs at 1200 bar and 3 batch runs at 2000 bar.In these three steps, the pressure was maintained at these pressures by controlling the piston force applied to the nozzle.Note that the low resistance of 4.9 10 -3 for the as-prepared FLG has been measured by a 4 point probe measurement, which confirmed the high conductive property of the FLG used in this work.

The experimental set up to carry out photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is shown in Scheme 1.The photocatalysts, including CsPbBr 3 NPs, CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS samples, were coated on the quartz substrates (2.5 cm 2 ) by drop-casting with a constant loading amount of 20 mg, respectively.The quartz substrate coated with photocatalysts was vertically set in a gas-tight sample vial that contained 10 L DI-water (the volume of sample vial was 40 mL).After the sample vial was purged with CO 2 gas for 30 min in darkness, it was sealed and heated up to 100 C in an oven to vaporize DI-water.To carry out the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the sealed sample vial incorporated with photocatalysts, CO 2 and H 2 O vapor was illuminated by a 500 W Xe lamp coupled with A-M1.5 and 400 nm cut-off filters under 100 mW/cm 2 illumination.The examined gas was taken by a gas tight syringe with interval of one hour and injected into the gas chromatography (GC) with a barrier discharge ionization detector (SHIMADZU GC-2010, BID-2010 Plus) to analyze the gas products.To measure apparent quantum efficiency (AQE), the same reaction system contained photocatalysts, CO 2 and H 2 O vapor was irradiated by monochromatic light (HORIBA TRIAX 180) for 24 h.The resulted product gas was taken by a gas tight syringe and characterized by the GC."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "N 2 atmosphere w/wo H 2 O", "source": "To confirm the product, CH 4 , coming from the purged CO 2 , the several controlling examinations were performed, including the photocatalytic reactions under N 2 atmosphere w/wo H 2 O using CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5 as the photocatalyst.", "context": "The morphologies of pristine CsPbBr 3 NPs, GO and FLG are shown in Fig. 1a-c.The cubic-liked CsPbBr 3 NPs with an average particle size of 11.6 3.6 nm were clearly observed.The morphologies of the GO and FLG are both thin sheets.The lateral size of GO and FLG was both estimated about 5-20 m by the corresponded TEM and SEM images (Fig. S1).The CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs were synthesized using the LARP process, which is the same method to obtain CsPbBr NPs.As shown in Fig. 1(d).and 1(g)., CsPbBr 3 NPs were in-situ grown on the surface of GO and FLG without changing their morphologies, respectively.Additionally, the free-standing CsPbBr 3 NPs, GO and FLG were rarely observed, which indicates the advantage of the present method for obtaining CsPbBr 3 -graphene-based NHSs.The HR-TEM and TEM-EDS line-scan of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs were individually performed to analyze their interfacial structure and composition.The HR-TEM images in Fig. 1(e).shows the clear lattice fringes at the interface of CsPbBr 3 /GO, which can be assigned to (001) of monoclinic-phase CsPbBr 3 .In addition, there are two distinct sets of the lattice fringes at the interface of CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs, which can be identified as ( 110) and (002) of monoclinic-phase CsPbBr 3 and hexagonal-phase graphite, respectively.Furthermore, the TEM-EDS line-scan of the CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs confirmed the corresponding elements, including C for the bottom sheet and Cs, Pb Br for the surface cubic particles.Note that the sharp interface of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs as shown in the HR-TEM images (Fig. 1(e) and 1(h)) is believed to be important for CT under light illumination. To confirm the possible variation of crystal structure during the LARP process, XRD characterizations for CsPbBr 3 NPs, GO, FLG, CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs were accomplished.Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of CsPbBr 3 NPs, GO, FLG, CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs.A peak at 2 12.4 for GO was shown, which can be suggested as the interlayer spacing about 0.71 nm in GO. 40 For FLG, a peak at 2 26 can be observed, which corresponds to the spacing of (002) planes of hexagonal phase graphite 42.The XRD peaks at 2 15.2 , 21.5 , 30.4 , 30.7 , 34.4 , 37.7 and 43.7 can be identified as the (001), ( 110), (002), ( 200), ( 210), ( 211) and (202) planes of monoclinic CsPbBr 3 (JCPDS Card No. 18-0364).In addition, as the formation of CsPbBr 3 /GO and CsPbBr 3 /FLG NHSs, the XRD patterns of CsPbBr 3 was still presented, which demonstrated that the crystal structure of CsPbBr would not be altered as the FLG or GO were incorporated in the LARP process.The characteristic peak of FLG was still presented for CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs, which illustrated the decoration of CsPbBr 3 NPs only on the surface of FLG without inserting it into the stacked graphene layers.However, the characteristic peak of GO was absent for CsPbBr 3 -GO NHSs, which may be caused by the decoration of CsPbBr NPs on the surface of GO thin layer to change the interlayer spacing.For a better understanding of the interfacial chemical states, XPS analysis of GO, FLG, CsPbBr 3 NPs, CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs was performed.As shown in Fig. 2(b) and Table S1, for the comparison between the two series (GO/CsPbBr 3 -GO and FLG/CsPbBr 3 -FLG), the C 1s XPS spectra represented a significant decrease in the contributions of C-O Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of the experimental set up to carry out photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. (285.97 eV), CO (287.46 eV) and O-CO (288.86 eV) as compared to that of sp 2 carbon (284.6 eV).This outcome illustrates that the decoration of CsPbBr 3 NPs majorly relies on the formation of chemical bonds upon the oxygen functional groups on the surface of GO and FLG.Moreover, Cs 3d, Pb 4f and Br 3d XPS spectra displayed shifts toward lower binding energies after the CsPbBr 3 NPs were decorated on GO or FLG, respectively.This phenomenon reveals the strong chemical interaction at the interfaces of CsPbBr 3 /GO and CsPbBr 3 /FLG.22 This result, together with the TEM, EDS and XRD analyses, confirmed that the current synthetic process could successfully obtain CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs. The composition of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs can be easily modulated by controlling the relative amounts of CsPbBr 3 precursors and GO/FLG during the LARP processes.Fig. 3 shows TEM images of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs with a gradual enhancement in the loading amounts of GO or FLG in the individual precursor solutions.The decorated density of the CsPbBr 3 NPs decreased with an increase in the content of GO and FLG for the both of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs, respectively.In addition, the cubic-like CsPbBr 3 NPs still can be observed on the surfaces of GO or FLG.The histogram of particle size distribution of CsPbBr 3 NPs in CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs are shown in Fig. S2 and summarized in Table S2.Significantly, the increased particle size and enlarged distribution of CsPbBr 3 NPs on the surface of GO and FLG was observed.This phenomenon can be attributed to that the CsPbBr 3 NPs were in-situ grown on the surface of GO and FLG by LARP process, which would vary the growth process and result in the larger particle or aggregation.22 Note that the actual compositions of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs were analyzed and interpreted using TGA.The results are shown in Fig. S3 and summarized in Table S3.Obviously, the in-situ growth of the CsPbBr 3 NPs on the surface of GO or FLG would result in the similar cubic morphology but smaller particle size as compared to the pristine free-standing CsPbBr 3 NPs, which may be caused to the lower local concentration of precursors on the surface of GO or FLG than that in solution.For the comparison between CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs, the component of FLG is higher than GO to achieve the similar morphology in the NHSs, which may be due to the lower specific surface area of FLG (38.7 m 2 /g) than that of GO (142.5 m 2 /g) (the BET analytic results of GO and FLG are shown in Fig. S4).On the other hand, the variations in decoration density and particle size of the CsPbBr 3 NPs in CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs may result in the different optical properties as compared to the pristine CsPbBr 3 NPs. Consequently, the UV-vis absorption and PL emission spectra of CsPbBr 3 NPs, GO, FLG, CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs were collected to study their optical properties.In Fig. 4(a) and (b), the UV-vis absorption spectrum of bare CsPbBr 3 NPs shows an excitonic absorption peak at 512 nm, while both of UV-vis absorption spectra for the GO and FLG showed none of absorption in the visible region of 400-600 nm.For the CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs, the excitonic absorption peaks at 512 nm were still observed, which indicated the formation of NHS would not alter the absorption property of CsPbBr 3 NPs.Furthermore, the absorbance of the CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs was gradually enhanced as the increased content of GO or FLG, which can be attributed to the significant scattering effect of the micronsized GO and FLG.As shown in Fig. 4(c emission peak at 523 nm for the bare CsPbBr 3 NPs was observed, which can be assigned as the charge carrier recombination from the CB to the VB via a radiative pathway.When the CsPbBr 3 NPs were decorated on the surface of GO and FLG, the PL emission of CsPbBr 3 NPs was suppressed.Additionally, with an increase in the loading amount of GO and FLG, respectively, the PL intensity of the emission peaks of CsPbBr 3 NPs showed a gradual decrease.This phenomenon reveals that the radiative recombination of charge carriers in CsPbBr 3 NPs would be suppressed by the interfacial CT as the formation of CsPbBr 3 /GO or CsPbBr 3 /FLG interfaces.Therefore, the interfacial CT behavior in the CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs needs to be further investigated, individually. To further realize the interfacial CT behavior in the CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs, we performed UPS examination to interpret their electronic band structures.The UPS features of CsPbBr 3 NPs, GO and FLG were firstly collected to determine the electronic band position by the linear intersection method.38 As shown in Fig. 5(a-c), the secondary-electron cut-off energy was measured as 17.65, 14.67 and 16.75 eV for CsPbBr 3 NPs, GO, and FLG by linear extrapolation.Consequently, the Fermi level (E f ) of CsPbBr 3 NPs, GO and FLG were estimated to be -3.55,-6.56 and -4.45 eV (vs vacuum), respectively.In addition, the VB maximum (E VB ) with respect to F f (E CB -E f ) can be obtained by the linear extrapolation along the tangent of the spectra onset, giving as 2.0, 0.71, and 0 eV for CsPbBr 3 NPs, GO and FLG.The E VB of CsPbBr 3 NPs and GO can be determined as -5.55 and -7.27 eV (vs vacuum).Note that the same potential at -4.45 eV (vs vacuum) of E f and E VB for FLG can be suggested that the potential at -4.45 eV (vs vacuum) is also work function for the present FLG.43,44 To further interpret the CB minimum (E CB ) of CsPbBr 3 NPs and GO, the energy band gap (E g ) was firstly determined by linear extrapolation of their tauc plots as shown in Fig. 5d.The results indicated that the E g of CsPbBr 3 NPs and GO can be estimated 2.37 and 4.17 eV, respectively, which is consistent with the reported values in the literatures.45464748 Consequently, the E CB potentials of CsPbBr 3 NPs and GO can be further determined as -3.18 and -3.10 eV (vs vacuum).To confirm the semiconducting property of GO, PL and PL excitation were measured and shown in Fig. 5(e).The best excitation wavelength at 320 nm can be suggested as electronic absorbance of (sp 2 domain), and the PL maximum at 460 nm can be suggested as the radiative recombination of photoexcited charge carrier through the oxygen-containing functional groups (sp 3 domain).49 This outcome provides a strong evidence for the semiconducting property of the as-prepared GO in this work.Based on the UPS results, the energy band structures of CsPbBr 3 NPs, GO and FLG can be sketched individually as shown in Fig. 5(f).However, the CT is carried out at the interface between CsPbBr 3 NPs and GO/FLG, it is also essential to understand the energy band structures in CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs.Therefore, the UPS features of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs were also collected as shown in Fig. 5(g).The secondary-electron cut-off energy was estimated as 16.63 and 16.84 eV by linear extrapolation, which revealed that the E f of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs can be computed as -4.57and -4.36 eV (vs vacuum), respectively.Significantly, the E f of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs presents a shift toward the middle region between the CsPbBr 3 NP and GO/FLG.This phenomenon of E f shift can be attributed to the band alignment at the interfaces of CsPbBr 3 /GO and CsPbBr 3 /FLG 37,38,50.Following this scenario, the energy band at the interfaces of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs would be re-arranged by band alignment.As shown in Fig. 5(h), we delineated the possible electronic band structures of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs.For CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS, both of the CB and VB potentials of GO was higher than that of CsPbBr 3 NP to form a type-II band structure after the band alignment.This outcome could result in the photoexcited holes transfer from VB of CsPbBr 3 NP into that of GO and the accumulation of photoexcited electrons on the CB of CsPbBr 3 NPs under light illumination.On the other hand, for CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs, the Schottky-junction-like energy band structure formed.The photoexcited electrons can inject into E f of FLG from the CB of CsPbBr 3 NPs and the photoexcited holes would remain on the VB of CsPbBr 3 NPs under light irradiation.Although the CT behavior was different, the pronounced charge separation was produced at the interfaces of CsPbBr 3 /GO and CsPbBr 3 /FLG, resulting in the apparent suppression of radiative recombination of charge carriers in both of the CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs.These outcomes illustrate that the CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs exhibit remarkable charge separation properties, which would be a great benefit to the utilization in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.More importantly, the different interfacial CT behavior in the both NHSs may provide a great model to study the correlation between energy band structure, charge carrier dynamics and efficiency in photoelectric conversions. Before the particle application of in photoelectric conversions, the interfacial charge carrier dynamics for the CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs are essential to understand by TRPL examination.Fig. 6 shows the TRPL spectra of CsPbBr 3 NPs, CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS samples.Faster PL decay profiles of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS samples than CsPbBr 3 NP sample were observed.For the better comparison, the PL decay curves were fitted with exponential decay kinetics and the fitting parameters were listed in Table 1.The PL decay profile of CsPbBr 3 NPs can be fitted with triple exponential decay kinetics, resulting in 17.6 of fast component with a lifetime of 7.21 ns ( 1 ), 68.5 of the medium component with a lifetime of 49.63 ns ( 2 ) and 14.1 of slow component with a lifetime of 154.66 ns ( 3 ).The fast decay component can be assigned as the radiative recombination of CB electrons and VB holes.In addition, the medium and slow components can be suggested as the radiative recombination of long-lived electron-hole pairs in shallow-trap and deep-trap states of CsPbBr 3 NPs, which is consistent with our previous studies of exciton dynamics of lead halide based perovskite nanostructures.22 For CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs, the increased amplitude of fast decay component and decreased amplitudes of medium and slow components as compared to CsPbBr 3 NPs were observed.These outcomes indicate that the emergency of additional nonradiative recombination pathways from the electronic interaction between CsPbBr 3 NPs and GO/FLG, confirming the proposed mechanism of the interfacial CT process in CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs in UPS examinations.The intensity-average PL lifetime ( av ) is calculated and listed in Table 1 for a better comparison. Significantly, the av of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs is shorter than that of CsPbBr 3 NPs because of the interfacial CT.Since the quenching of PL emission is mainly caused by CT from CsPbBr 3 NPs to GO/FLG, the CT rate constant (k CT ) of CsPbBr 3 NPsGO and CsPbBr 3 NPsFLG processes in CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs can be estimated by the expressions in Table 1. For CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS samples, the interfacial k CT was 8.21 10 7 , 8.76 10 7 , 1.12 10 8 and 8.87 10 7 s -1 for CsPbBr 3 -GO-0.5,CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.0,CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5 and CsPbBr 3 -GO-2.0.Significantly, the more pronounced hole transfer from the VB of CsPbBr 3 NPs to that of GO as the loading amount of GO increased to 1.5 mg in CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS, leading to 1.4 times enhancement in the k CT between CsPbBr 3 and GO.However, the k CT of CsPbBr 3 -GO NHSs decreased when the loading amount of GO up to 2.0 mg, which may be caused by the excess GO become an interfacial charge-carrier recombination initiator to suppress the charge separation efficiency.40 On the other hand, for CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs, the interfacial k CT was calculated as 4.74 10 6 , 1.24 10 7 , 2.24 10 7 and 2.84 10 7 s -1 for CsPbBr 3 -FLG-1.5,CsPbBr 3 -FLG-3.0,CsPbBr 3 -FLG-4.5and CsPbBr 3 -FLG-6.0.Apparently, the efficiency of CT from the CB of CsPbBr 3 NPs to the E f of FLG was improved as the loading amount of FLG increased in CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs.Interestingly, a comparison of interfacial CT kinetics between CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs under the same amount of GO/FLG loading reveals that the k CT of CsPbBr 3 -GO is almost 2-order magnitude higher than that of CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS sample (CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5vs CsPbBr 3 -FLG-1.5).This outcome can be attributed to the larger specific surface area of GO than that of FLG, providing more functional groups to connect with CsPbBr 3 NPs to generate the stronger electronic interaction and promote the interfacial k CT in CsPbBr 3 -GO NHSs.Additionally, in the both cases of CsPbBr 3 -graphene-based NHSs, the increased loading of GO/FLG would enhance the interfacial k CT , resulting in the remarkable charge separation properties.In this regard, the interfacial charge carrier dynamics of CsPbBr 3 -graphene-based NHSs can be modulated by the composition of GO/FLG, which may lead to a controllable efficiency in the application of solar energy conversions. To demonstrate the promising potential of CsPbBr 3 -graphene-based NHSs in solar energy conversions, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using CsPbBr 3 NPs, GO, FLG, CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS samples were performed.Herein, the CsPbBr 3 NP, CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS samples were individually introduced into a gas-tight sample vial within CO 2 and H 2 O vapor to carry out CO 2 reduction under visible light illumination for 3 h.Interestingly, there was only CH 4 and H 2 could be detected in the produced gas of the present examinations.This phenomenon reveals that the competitive CO 2 and H 2 O reductions took place simultaneously in the sample vial by using CsPbBr 3 NP, CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS samples as the photocatalysts.Note that GO and FLG didn't show any photoactivity in the examinations, which can be expected because of the large band gap of semiconducting GO and conducting FLG are not the principle active materials in visible-lightdriven photocatalysis.In addition, the highly selective CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion via photocatalysis by CsPbBr 3 NP, CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS samples was achieved.The detailed mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction will be further discussed later.The results of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using CsPbBr 3 NP, CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS samples as photocatalysts were shown in Fig. 7(a).To compare the CsPbBr 3 NP and CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS samples in the examination of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, amounts of CH 4 produced of 41.7, 43.1 43.9, 55.7 and 35.0 mole g -1 for CsPbBr 3 NPs, CsPbBr 3 -GO-0.5,CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.0,CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5 and CsPbBr 3 -GO-2.0were obtained under visible light illumination for 3 h, respectively.Therefore, the CH 4 production rate (k CH4 ) of CsPbBr 3 NPs, CsPbBr 3 -GO-0.5,CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.0,CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5CsPbBr 3 -GO-2.0was estimated as 13.9, 14.4, 14.6, 18.6 and 11.7 mole g -1 h -1 .On the other hand, Fig. 7 (b) showed the results of H 2 production by CsPbBr 3 NPs and CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS samples as the photocatalysts after 3 h visible light illumination.14.2, 14.8, 17.4, 20.6 and 11.4 mole g -1 for CsPbBr 3 NPs, CsPbBr 3 -GO-0.5,CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.0,CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5 and CsPbBr 3 -GO-2.0were observed.Consequently, the H 2 production rate (k H2 ) of CsPbBr 3 NPs, CsPbBr 3 -GO-0.5,CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.0,CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5CsPbBr 3 -GO-2.0was estimated as 4.7, 4.9, 5.8, 6.9 and 3.8 mole g -1 h -1 .Both of k CH4 and k H2 enhanced when the CsPbBr 3 NPs were decorated on the GO surface to form the NHS.Obviously, k CH4 and k H2 of CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS gradually enhanced as the loading amount of GO increased.Among this series, both k CH4 and k H2 of CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5showed 1.4-fold higher than that of CsPbBr 3 NP sample, which indicated the optimized CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5exhibited the highest photoactivity as well as remarkable charge separation performance.However, the decreased k CH4 and k H2 of CsPbBr 3 -GO-2.0with the largest loading amount of GO were observed, which could be attributed to the interfacial charge-carrier recombination by excess GO to suppress the charge separation.Note that the CO 2 adsorption capacity for the CsPbBr 3 NPs and CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS samples were examined to rule out the possible surficial effect in photocatalytic CO 2 reductions.As shown in Fig. S5(a) and Table S4, when compared to the pure CsPbBr 3 NPs, the CO 2 uptakes of CsPbBr 3 -GO NHSs enhanced . , where X represents 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0. , where Y represents 1.5, 3.0, 4.5 and 6.0. a The intensity-average PL lifetime ( av ) was calculated using the expression. b The value of CT rate constant (k CT ) was calculated using the expression.when the loading amount of GO gradually increased.Especially for CsPbBr 3 -GO-2.0,it's CO 2 adsorption capacity increased about decouple, however, it's photoactivity of CO 2 reduction was worse than that of CsPbBr 3 NPs.For the better comparison, the photoactivity as a function of the GO composition for CsPbBr 3 NPs and CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS samples were summarized in Table 2.The electron consumption rate (R e ) for the reduced products strongly depends on the interfacial k CT of CsPbBr 3 -GO NHSs as shown in Fig. 7(c).As the interfacial k CT enhanced in CsPbBr 3 -GO NHSs by increasing the GO composition, the charge separation efficiency could be improved, leading to a great benefit to carry out CO 2 and H 2 O reductions.It is worth noting that the selectivity of CO 2 -to-CH 4 and H 2 O-to-H 2 was calculated to be 92 and 8 , which reveals that the electron consumptions of CsPbBr 3 NP and CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS samples were mainly contributed by CO 2 reduction in the present photocatalytic system.On the contrary, CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS samples were also introduced into the photocatalytic examinations to carry out the CO 2 reductions.As shown in Fig. 8(a), the amounts of produced CH 4 were measured as 14.1, 13.4, 12.7 and 11.4 mole g -1 , which could be turned into the k CH4 of 4.7, 4.5, 4.3 and 3.8 mole g -1 h -1 for CsPbBr 3 -FLG-1.5,CsPbBr 3 -FLG-3.0,CsPbBr 3 -FLG-4.5and CsPbBr 3 -FLG-6.0,respectively.Additionally, the amount of H 2 in the examined product gas was 11.6, 12.7, 11.7 and 7.3 mole g -1 for CsPbBr 3 -FLG-1.5,CsPbBr 3 -FLG-3.0,CsPbBr 3 -FLG-4.5and CsPbBr 3 -FLG-6.0as shown in Fig. 8(b).The k H2 of CsPbBr 3 -FLG-1.5,CsPbBr 3 -FLG-3.0,CsPbBr 3 -FLG-4.5and CsPbBr 3 -FLG-6.0was estimated as 3.9, 4.2, 3.9 and 2.4 mole g -1 h -1 , respectively.Significantly, the photoactivity of CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS samples was decreased as compared to the pristine CsPbBr 3 NPs in the CO 2 and H 2 O reductions.The CO 2 adsorption capacity for the CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS samples was also measured.As shown in Fig. S5(b) and Table S4, the CO 2 uptakes of CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs was higher than that of pure CsPbBr 3 NPs.However, the photoactivity of CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs in CO 2 reduction also worse than pure CsPbBr 3 NPs.This results ruled out the possible surficial effect of CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS in photocatalytic CO 2 reductions.The R e and selectivity for CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS samples were also calculated and listed in Table 2.As the composition of FLG increased, the photoactivity of CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS presents a progressive depression.Fig. 8(c) presents the correlation between R e and k CT of CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS with different FLG composition.In addition, the selectivity of CO 2 -to-CH 4 decreased to 82 and that of H 2 O-to-H 2 increased to 28 .The inconsistency between photoactivity and interfacial charge carrier dynamics of CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS was observed.Although the increasing amount of FLG would improve the photoexcited electron transfer from the CB of CsPbBr 3 to E f of FLG and leave hole on the VB of CsPbBr 3 , the separated electron on E f of FLG would prefer not to carry out the CO 2 reductions while favoring to H 2 O reduction.This unexpected phenomenon illustrates that the strategy of graphene to serve as an electron acceptor and separate charge carriers is not ideally for proceeding photocatalytic CO 2 reduction for CsPbBr 3 -graphene-based NHSs. The observed high selectivity of CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion when using CsPbBr 3 NPs as the photocatalysts may be attributed to their efficient production and separation of photogenerated charge carriers.515253 In addition, the larger energy difference (1.08 eV) between the CB of CsPbBr 3 NP and potential of CH 4 /CO 2 may result in the stronger driving force of electron transfer from CsPbBr 3 NPs to CO 2 (the energy difference between the CB of CsPbBr 3 NP and CO/CO 2 potential is 0.79 eV), leading to thermodynamically favorable CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.38,39 To further understand the detailed mechanism of unexpected results in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction when using CsPbBr 3 /graphene based NHSs as the photocatalysts, the alignment band structure of CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs with the energy potential of CO 2 and H 2 O reductions are integrated and shown in Fig. 9.The potentials of separated photoexcited electrons are -4.20 V (vs vacuum) on the CB of CsPbBr 3 in CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS and -4.36 V (vs vacuum) on the E f of FLG in CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS, respectively.However, the reduction potential of CO 2 -to-CH 4 is -4.26V (vs vacuum).Therefore, the separated photoexcited electrons in the CsPbBr 3 domain of CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS exhibit the enough potential to carry out CO 2 -to-CH 4 and H 2 O-to-H 2 conversions.The observed high selectivity of CO 2 -to-CH 4 by using CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS as the photocatalyst can be attributed to the well-matched potential between the CB of CsPbBr 3 and CH 4 /CO 2 .On the other hand, the lower E f potential of FLG in CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS than reduction potential of CO 2 -to-CH 4 would prefer not to proceed with CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.Therefore, when the utilization of CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS the photocatalyst, the photoactivity of CO 2 reduction decreased.The significant evidence that more pronounced charge separated in CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS as the loading amount of FLG increased, resulting in the worse efficiency in CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.Moreover, the decreased selectivity in CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion can be suggested to the lower potential of FLG that would match the potential of H 2 O reduction.Consequently, in CsPbBr 3 -graphene-based NHSs, the intrinsic properties of graphene are essential to dominating the energy band structure and their interfacial CT behavior, resulting in the different energy potential to affect the efficiency and selectivity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions. To confirm the product, CH 4 , coming from the purged CO 2 , the several controlling examinations were performed, including the photocatalytic reactions under N 2 atmosphere w/wo H 2 O using CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5 as the photocatalyst.After light illumination for 3 h, no products could be detected.In addition, isotopic labeling experiment was also performed using CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5NHSs as the photocatalyst within 13 CO 2 and H 2 O atmosphere.The signal of 13 CH 4 resulted from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by present CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5NHSs.On the other hand, the physical mixture of CsPbBr 3 GO-1.5 was introduced as the photocatalyst to carry out photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. S7, CsPbBr 3 GO-1.5did not perform as well as CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5did (3 mole g -1 h -1 of CH 4 production by CsPbBr 3 GO-1.5).The poor photoactivity of CsPbBr 3 GO-1.5can be attributed to the destitute interaction between CsPbBr 3 NPs and the GO sheets, resulting in the destitute charge separation.On the other hand, to demonstrate the potential of the present CsPbBr 3 -GO NHSs in the application of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The commercial P25 TiO 2 was also introduced into the photocatalytic system to test the activity for CO 2 reduction under visible illumination.As shown in Fig. S7, the k CH4 of P25 TiO 2 was measured only 1.5 mole g -1 h -1 , which was lower about 12 times than the k CH4 of CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5.This result indicates that the present CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5exhibits a great potential in the practical application of visible-light-driven CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.In order to understand the recyclability and long-term stability for the practical application of CsPbBr 3 -GO NHSs, the recycling examination of CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion by using CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5 and CsPbBr 3 NPs as the photocatalysts within CO 2 and H 2 O atmosphere was accomplished.As shown in Fig. 10(a), no appreciable decay of photoactivity was observed for CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5after recycling in five rounds of CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.On the contrary, the 50 decay of photoactivity was observed for CsPbBr 3 NPs in the same examination as shown in Fig. S8.This outcome indicated that the water oxidation occurred in the GO domain could inhibit the water degradation of CsPbBr 3 and improve the chemical stability of CsPbBr 3 -GO NHSs.The CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5 was further characterized with XRD, XPS and TEM before and after 15 h of visible light irradiation to evaluate its stability.The insignificant variation in the crystal structure, morphology and surficial chemical properties of CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5can be found in Fig. 10 Fig. 1.TEM images of (a) CsPbBr 3 NPs (inset: histogram of particle size distribution), (b) GO and (c) FLG.(d) TEM, (e) HR-TEM images and (f) EDS line-scan of CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS.(g) TEM, (h) HR-TEM images and (i) EDS line-scan of CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS.

CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS, especially CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5,demonstrated the comparable apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 0.33 (Fig. S9) for CH 4 production under 440 nm monochromatic light irradiation as compared to the previously developed state-of-art MHP NHSs as shown in Table S5.Most importantly, these results confirm that the CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS can really be used as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst for practical solar energy conversions."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Fixed-bed", "source": "The photocatalysts, including CsPbBr 3 NPs, CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS samples, were coated on the quartz substrates (2.5 cm 2 ) by drop-casting with a constant loading amount of 20 mg, respectively.The quartz substrate coated with photocatalysts was vertically set in a gas-tight sample vial that contained 10 L DI-water (the volume of sample vial was 40 mL).", "context": "The GO was synthesized by the modified Hummers' method.40 Firstly, graphite (0.5 g) powder was mixed with an acidic solution (20 mL of H 2 SO 4 and 10 mL of HNO 3 ) under stirring in an ice bath.3 g of KMnO 4 was slowly added into the mixed solution.After all of the KMnO 4 powder dissolved completely, the mixed solution was heated to 35 C in a water bath with stirring for 3 h.As the color of the mixed solution changed from purple to brown, 40 mL DI water was dropwise added.After 1.5 h, 100 mL of 1 H 2 O 2 solution was added into the mixed solution to stop the reaction.Lastly, the product was collected by centrifuge and washed with 1 M HCl solution to neutral and redispersed in ethanol.Note that the semiconducting property of the as-prepared GO was confirmed by a 4 point probe measurement, which showed the undetectable value of resistance of the GO. FLG was synthesized by a liquid exfoliation process derived from Artificial graphite (graphite, purity 99 ).All delamination experiments were carried out in a homemade ultra-high-pressure continuousflow cell disrupter according to the previously reported method.41 Typically, 10 wt. graphite suspension in deionized water is created by applying from low pressure (800 bar) to high pressure (2000 bar) to force the sample through a small orifice at high speed under a flow rate of 10 L/min.The shearing effects crushed the graphite and dispersed and emulsified the sample components.During this process, the FLG remained in suspension, which was ensured by keeping the sample at 14-16 C in a circulating water bath.The FLG was produced 3 batch runs at 800 bar, 3 batch runs at 1200 bar and 3 batch runs at 2000 bar.In these three steps, the pressure was maintained at these pressures by controlling the piston force applied to the nozzle.Note that the low resistance of 4.9 10 -3 for the as-prepared FLG has been measured by a 4 point probe measurement, which confirmed the high conductive property of the FLG used in this work. The CsPbBr 3 NPs were synthesized using LARP method under room temperature 22.First of all, the PbBr 2 (1.74 mg), octylammonium bromide (1.73 mg) and CsBr (0.35 mg) were dissolved in 1 mL DMF. After sonication of the mixed solution for 10 min, 100 L of oleic acid (OA) was added to form the homogenous precursor solution.Finally, all the precursor solution was added into 20 mL toluene dropwise with stirring to form CsPbBr 3 NPs.The resultant CsPbBr 3 NPs were collected by centrifuge and washed with toluene twice for further utilization.On the other hand, the CsPbBr 3 -GO and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHSs were synthesized by the same process, however the precursor solutions were incorporated with different amounts of GO and FLG, respectively.Thus, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mg of GO and 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0 mg of FLG were individually added into the precursor solutions, which was stirred overnight before added into toluene.The resultant samples were denoted as CsPbBr 3 -GO-0.5,CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.0,CsPbBr 3 -GO-1.5,CsPbBr 3 -GO-2.0and CsPbBr 3 -FLG-1.5,CsPbBr 3 -FLG-3.0,CsPbBr 3 -FLG-4.5,CsPbBr 3 -FLG-6.0. XRD analysis (Rigaku Corporation, MiniFlex II powder diffractometer) was carried out to study the crystalline phase of the sample at a voltage of 30 kV and a current of 15 mA.The scanning angle range was conducted from 10to 80at a rate of 4/min.TEM (JEOL, JEM-1400) and HR-AEM (JEOL, JEM-2100 F) analyses were operated with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV and 200 kV, respectively.UV-vis absorption spectra (Shimadzu UV-1800) and PL spectra (Hitachi F-7000) were collected by using a quartz cuvette (1cm 1cm) as container measuring as-synthesized sample under room temperature.XPS and UPS spectra were obtained by Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB Xi electron spectroscopy with Al K1 anode.TRPL spectra were recorded using a home-built single-photon counting system with a GaN diode laser ( 375 nm, pulse duration of 50 ps) as the excitation source.The composition was estimated using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, TA Instruments Q500) under N 2 atmosphere.Surface area the samples were measured by N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms curves using micromeritics tristar 3000 (Micromeritics, instrument corporation, Norcross, GA 30,093 USA).The micromeritics VacPrepTM 061 used to remove the adsorbed contaminants and used to vacuum for the preparation of samples through heating and evacuation.The CO 2 adsorption isotherms at 25 C were collected on Micromeritics ASAP 2020 sorption analyzer. The experimental set up to carry out photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is shown in Scheme 1.The photocatalysts, including CsPbBr 3 NPs, CsPbBr 3 -GO NHS and CsPbBr 3 -FLG NHS samples, were coated on the quartz substrates (2.5 cm 2 ) by drop-casting with a constant loading amount of 20 mg, respectively.The quartz substrate coated with photocatalysts was vertically set in a gas-tight sample vial that contained 10 L DI-water (the volume of sample vial was 40 mL).After the sample vial was purged with CO 2 gas for 30 min in darkness, it was sealed and heated up to 100 C in an oven to vaporize DI-water.To carry out the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the sealed sample vial incorporated with photocatalysts, CO 2 and H 2 O vapor was illuminated by a 500 W Xe lamp coupled with A-M1.5 and 400 nm cut-off filters under 100 mW/cm 2 illumination.The examined gas was taken by a gas tight syringe with interval of one hour and injected into the gas chromatography (GC) with a barrier discharge ionization detector (SHIMADZU GC-2010, BID-2010 Plus) to analyze the gas products.To measure apparent quantum efficiency (AQE), the same reaction system contained photocatalysts, CO 2 and H 2 O vapor was irradiated by monochromatic light (HORIBA TRIAX 180) for 24 h.The resulted product gas was taken by a gas tight syringe and characterized by the GC."}], "operation mode": []}}
