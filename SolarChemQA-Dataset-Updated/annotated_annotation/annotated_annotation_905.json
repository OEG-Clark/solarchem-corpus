The Bi 2 WO 6 nanosheets (BWO-NS) with single-crystallinity and dominantly exposed 001 facets were formed from a hydrothermal anion exchange treatment involving metathesis reaction. Prior to the hydrothermal process, 1.5 mmol of the as-developed BOB-NS was dispersed in 120 mL of aqueous solution containing 1 mmol of Na 2 WO 4 2H 2 O.The mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature.Subsequently, the mixture solution was transferred to a 200 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was maintained at 140 o C for 12 h under autogenous pressure.Upon completion of reaction, the autoclave was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature.Then, the precipitate was collected by filtration and washed repeatedly with ethanol and deionized water for several times.Finally, the obtained product was dried in an air oven at 60 o C for 12 h. For comparison, pristine Bi 2 WO 6 nanoplates (BWO-P) were prepared through one-step hydrothermal process without using BiOBr as starting material.Briefly, 1 mmol of Na 2 WO 4 2H 2 O was dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water and the solution was added dropwise into 70 mL of deionized water containing 2 mmol of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O.The mixture solution was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 1 h, then transferred to a 125 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave.The autoclave was maintained at 140 o C for 24 h under autogenous pressure.After completion of reaction, the autoclave was cooled naturally to room temperature and the resulting precipitate was filtered and washed repeatedly with ethanol and deionized water for several times. The final product was subjected to oven drying at 60 o C for 12 h. The crystallographic phase of the as-developed samples was acquired by a X-ray diffractometer equipped with a UV cut-off filter to simulate visible light ( 400 nm). The computations were performed using Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) within the ultrasoft pseudopotential approach. All the proposed geometrical structures were optimized by generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) of exchange-correlation functional.A kinetic energy cut-off of 400 eV and Monkhorst-Pack mesh of 331 were adopted for the geometry optimization and electronic property calculations.The convergence criteria were set as 210 -5 eV/atom for energy, 0.05 eV/A for maximum force, 0.001 GPa for maximum pressure and 0.002 A for maximum displacement. To evaluate the photoactivities of the as-developed photocatalysts, CO 2 photoreduction experiments were performed over all the samples in a continuous gas flow reactor, as delineated in Fig. S1.To mimic natural surroundings, the experiment conditions were maintained at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature.Prior to the experiments, photocatalysts were uniformly coated on glass rods, and the glass rods were loaded into quartz columns which positioned under light source.Subsequently, high purity CO 2 gas (99.999 ) was directed through H 2 O, and the humidified CO 2 gas was channeled to the quartz columns to allow intimate contact between the reactant gas and coated photocatalysts.The flowrate of gas was maintained at 50 mL/min for 30 min, in order to evacuate excess air from the reactor and also to ensure adsorptiondesorption equilibrium was achieved on the sample surface.Thereafter, the flowrate was reduced to 5 mL/min and kept constant for 8 h under visible light irradiation, which was supplied by a 300W Xenon arc lamp equipped with UV cut-off filter to provide 400 nm.To avoid light interference from the surroundings, the whole reactor setup was enclosed in a black box.The reaction products were collected at every 1 h interval and qualitatively analyzed by online gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7820A) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The total production yield of CH 4 from the photocatalytic reaction was quantified using Eq.1: (1) where and are the final and initial concentration of CH 4 , is the volumetric flowrate of product gas, and is the amount of photocatalysts used in the experiment."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon arc lamp", "source": "In this study, a 300W Xenon arc lamp equipped ACS Paragon Plus EnvironmentACS Applied Materials Interfaces", "context": "In summary, we have demonstrated a facile topotactic transformation approach for the synthesis of ultrathin BWO-NS from BOB-NS.Other than preserving the 2D nanostructure and dominantly exposed 001 facets, the BWO-NS exhibited enlarged specific surface area and improved crystallinity compared to the pristine BWO-P synthesized from one-step hydrothermal process. More importantly, a fascinating bandgap narrowing and upshifting of CB resulting from the mystical effects of ion exchange for reconstruction of energy bands were observed for BWO-NS. Integrating these propitious properties into a single-photocatalyst, BWO-NS exhibited a total CH 4 production yield of 8.02 mol/g after 8 h of reaction under visible light, manifesting a significant 2.6-fold and 9.3-fold improvement of CH 4 production over BOB-NS and BWO-P, respectively.This production yield is impressive for a standalone photocatalyst without involving any cocatalysts, dopants or artificial defects.As a whole, this work delivered an ingenious approach to boost the performance of a standalone photocatalyst through combining the virtues of both photocatalysts, and we believe that our work would bring a step closer towards the rational optimization of efficient photocatalyst design.

Fig.4A and 4Bshow the CH 4 production yield over the BWO-NS, BOB-NS and BWO-P after 8 h of reaction under visible light illumination.In comparison to BOB-NS and BWO-NS, the control sample BWO-P showed minimal CH 4 production, with a total yield of only 0.86 mol/g.This observation is in line with the theoretical expectation, in which pristine Bi 2 WO 6 with uncontrolled surface structures and exposed facets may render plenty bulk recombination centre as well as promoting the competition between reduction and oxidation reactions.On the contrary, BWO-NS exhibited a remarkable CH 4 yield of 8.02 mol/g after 8 h of reaction, which demonstrated a substantial 2.6-fold and 9.3-fold enhancement over BOB-NS and BWO-P, respectively.Moreover, the photostability tests over BWO-NS revealed a remarkable stability of 93.6 after 3 successive test cycles of CO 2 photoreduction under identical experimental conditions (Fig.S5A and S5B), which manifested the suitability of BWO-NS for repeated usage.This superior photocatalytic activity of BWO-NS was attributed to several synergistic factors.Firstly, the careful design of BWO-NS for ultrathin thickness with predominantly exposed 001 facets rendered a large exposure of the most reactive facets for photoreduction reactions.Secondly, Figure 5.
