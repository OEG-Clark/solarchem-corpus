As a typical anionic dye, MO was used to evaluate the adsorption properties of the as-synthesized samples at room temperature.Typically, 10 mg of catalyst was ultrasonically dispersed into 50 mL of MO aqueous solution (10 mg L -1 ) at netural pH and then the suspension was stirred continuously.At a given time interval, ca. 4 mL of suspension was withdrawn and centrifuged, followed by further filtration with a 0.22 m syringe filter (pretreated by MO dye).The concentration of the residual MO was determined using a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer at the maximum wavelength ( max ) of 464 nm, according to the calibration curve between the max absorbance and concentration of MO.The dye removal percentage ( dye , ) and adsorption capacity (q t , mg g -1 ) were calculated by the following equations: where m (g) is the mass of adsorbent; V (L) is the volume of dye aqueous solution; C 0 and C t (mg L -1 ) are the initial concentration of dye solution and dye concentration at contact time t (min), respectively. Photocatalytic tests for TC degradation were performed using a PLS-SXE300 Xe lamp (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.) equipped with a UV cut-off filter as the visible light source ( 420 nm).Typically, 40 mg of sample was put into 80 mL of TC aqueous solution (C 0 20 mg L -1 ) and then the suspension was magnetically stirred for 1 h in the dark to establish an adsorption-desorption equilibrium between catalysts and TC molecules.The photocatalytic tests were conducted in a customized quartz reactor that was kept at 25C by a flow of cooling water and covered by aluminum foil to enhance light absorption of the reaction sysytem.At a specific time interval, clear TC solution was collected by centrifugation and filtration.The concentrations of TC solutions were measured on the Lambda 950 instrument to calculate the degradation efficiency ( TC , ) based on the equation: where C e and C are the equilibrium and time-dependent concentrations of TC solutions, respectively. The photocatalytic tests for CO 2 reduction were performed in a customized airtight reactor (135 mL) with an optical quartz window at the top.In a typical test, 30 mg of catalyst was uniformly coated on a square quartz plate (2.5 2.5 cm 2 ) and placed at the bottom of the reactor.Prior to light irradiation, the reaction system was flushed by N 2 gas, and then high-purity CO 2 (99.99) was bubbled through DI water for 30 min to fill the reactor with gaseous CO 2 and H 2 O.After that, such a reaction system was allowed to stand for the adsorption-desorption equilibrium between catalyst and CO 2 /H 2 O.A CEL-HXF300 Xe lamp (Beijing China Education Aulight Co., Ltd.) equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter was employed to provide the visible light irradiation with an average light intensity of 210 mW cm -2 at the upper position of catalyst film (CEL-NP2000 optical power meter, Beijing China Education Aulight Co., Ltd.).The reaction temperature was kept at 15 C using a DC-0506 low-temperature thermostat bath.At each time interval, 1 mL of gas was extracted from the reactor and quantified by a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).The reduction products was quantified by the external standard with a calibration curve.

Photocatalytic tests for TC degradation were performed using a PLS-SXE300 Xe lamp (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.) equipped with a UV cut-off filter as the visible light source ( 420 nm).Typically, 40 mg of sample was put into 80 mL of TC aqueous solution (C 0 20 mg L -1 ) and then the suspension was magnetically stirred for 1 h in the dark to establish an adsorption-desorption equilibrium between catalysts and TC molecules.The photocatalytic tests were conducted in a customized quartz reactor that was kept at 25C by a flow of cooling water and covered by aluminum foil to enhance light absorption of the reaction sysytem.At a specific time interval, clear TC solution was collected by centrifugation and filtration.The concentrations of TC solutions were measured on the Lambda 950 instrument to calculate the degradation efficiency ( TC , ) based on the equation: where C e and C are the equilibrium and time-dependent concentrations of TC solutions, respectively. The photocatalytic tests for CO 2 reduction were performed in a customized airtight reactor (135 mL) with an optical quartz window at the top.In a typical test, 30 mg of catalyst was uniformly coated on a square quartz plate (2.5 2.5 cm 2 ) and placed at the bottom of the reactor.Prior to light irradiation, the reaction system was flushed by N 2 gas, and then high-purity CO 2 (99.99) was bubbled through DI water for 30 min to fill the reactor with gaseous CO 2 and H 2 O.After that, such a reaction system was allowed to stand for the adsorption-desorption equilibrium between catalyst and CO 2 /H 2 O.A CEL-HXF300 Xe lamp (Beijing China Education Aulight Co., Ltd.) equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter was employed to provide the visible light irradiation with an average light intensity of 210 mW cm -2 at the upper position of catalyst film (CEL-NP2000 optical power meter, Beijing China Education Aulight Co., Ltd.).The reaction temperature was kept at 15 C using a DC-0506 low-temperature thermostat bath.At each time interval, 1 mL of gas was extracted from the reactor and quantified by a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).The reduction products was quantified by the external standard with a calibration curve. The PEC tests were performed by an electrochemical workstation (Solartron 1260/1287) in a standard three-electrode quartz cell using a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode, a Pt plate and the catalyst film deposited on an ITO substrate as reference electrode, counter electrode and working electrode, respectively.Before each test, the working electrode was immersed in the electrolyte (1.0 M NaOH, pH 13.6) until the open-circuit potential (V oc ) reached a steady state.The Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded with AC amplitude of 10 mV at a frequency range of 100 kHz 0.1 Hz under light irradiation.The V oc , linear sweep voltammagrams (LSV), transient photocurrent responses and EIS were measured with the working electrodes irradiated from their back sides to decrease the thickness effect of catalyst films.A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 400 nm cutoff filter was used as the visible light source for PEC measurements.The measured potentials vs. Ag/AgCl electrode (E Ag/AgCl ) were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the Nernst equation: E RHE E Ag/AgCl 0.059 pH E 0 Ag/AgCl , where E RHE is the converted potential vs. RHE, E 0 Ag/AgCl is 0.1976 V for the Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) at 25 C."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Thus, the more negative CB of HCN (in relative to that of BCN) could endow it with stronger reduction ability for the generation of reactive radicals towards pollutant degradation and the conversion of CO 2 gas into hydrocarbon fuels.", "context": "In summary, 2D p-g-C 3 N 4 NSs hybridized with 3D hierarchical TiO 2 MFs were successfully fabricated through a one-pot hydrothermal method using K 2 Ti 6 O 13 NBs and g-C 3 N 4 bulks as precursors.Abundant porous structures, surface C vacancies and interfacial heterojunctions are constructed in the micro-nano TiO 2 /p-g-C 3 N 4 HAs.Interestingly, the hydrothermally produced p-g-C 3 N 4 NSs show excellent selective MO adsorption while the introduction of TiO 2 MFs exhibits a negative effect on their adsorption capability.Importantly, TiO 2 /p-g-C 3 N 4 composites show remarkably enhanced visible-light photocatalytic performances towards both antibiotic degradation and CO 2 reduction.The excellent adsorption and photocatalytic properties of multifunctional 3D/2D TiO 2 /p-g-C 3 N 4 HAs are mainly attributed to the positively charged surface, enlarged surface area and pore volume (more adsorption/active sites), improved light absorption and especially the enhanced charge separation efficiency based on interfacial heterojunctions and surface C vacancies.This work may provide an attractive pathway to design multifunctional g-C 3 N 4 -based composites via the synergy of composition, structure and defect engineering for highly efficient environmental remediation and solar-to-fuel conversion.
