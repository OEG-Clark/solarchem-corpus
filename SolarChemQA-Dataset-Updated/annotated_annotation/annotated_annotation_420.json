Determination of the chemical composition of the powder catalysts was performed on an ARL9400 XP sequential WD-XRF spectrometer.All spectra were collected under vacuum conditions, while the data analysis was performed with the use of WinXRF software.The analyzed powders were pressed into pellets about 0.6 mm thick and a diameter of 25 mm without any binding agent and covered with 4-lm supporting polypropylene film. Nitrogen physisorption at 77 K was carried out on the automated volumetric apparatus NOVA2000e (Quantachrome Instruments, USA) after sample degassing at 105 C for 24 h under a vacuum 1 Torr.The specific surface area, S BET , was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory for the p/p 0 range 0.05-0.3021. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were measured using a PANalytical MPD diffractometer in the conventional Bragg-Brentano setup, using Ni-filtered CuKa radiation, variable divergence and antiscatter slits, 0.04-rad axial Soller slits and PIXcel detector.NIST LaB 6 standard reference material (660a) was used for the instrumental broadening calibration.XRD data analysis focused on the determination of lattice parameters/cell volume and crystallite size was done using the Rietveld/WPPM 22 implemented in the software MSTRUCT 23.Models described in 24 were used. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of hydrated and granulated (0.25-0.50 mm) photocatalysts were measured in quartz cuvettes (thickness 5 mm) by using a GBS CINTRA 303 spectrometer (GBC Scientific Equipment, Australia) equipped with an integrating sphere covered by a BaSO 4 layer.The spectra of all materials were measured using Spectralon-coated disks as a standard.The spectra were recorded in the range of 200-900 nm (lamps switched at 350 nm) and a scan rate of 100 nm/min.The scan step was 1 nm, and the width of monochromator slit was 2 nm.The reflectances were recalculated to the absorption using the Kubelka-Munk equation: where R ? is the diffuse reflectance from a semi-infinite layer. The contact potential difference (V CPD ) measurements were taken by the dynamic condenser method of Kelvin with a KP6500 probe (McAllister Technical Services).The reference electrode was a standard stainless steel plate with a diameter of 3 mm (U ref 4.3 eV) provided by the manufacturer.During the measurements, the gradient of the peakto-peak versus backing potential was set to 0.2, whereas the vibration frequency and amplitude were set to 120 Hz and 40 a.u., respectively.The final V CPD value was an average of 60 independent points using two backing potentials.The measurements were taken under atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature.Before the measurements, the samples were pressed into pellets of 10 mm diameter using the 8 MPa pressure.Work function values were obtained from a simple relation The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in a homemade apparatus.A stirred batch annular reactor with a suspended photocatalyst was illuminated by an 8 W Hg lamp (k 254 nm) situated on the quartz glass.The shell tube was made from stainless steel.The internal volume was 355 cm 3 .The photocatalyst powder (0.12 g) was suspended in 120 ml of 0.2 M NaOH solutions for typical batches 25,26.A magnetic stirrer at the bottom agitated the photocatalyst-suspended solution to prevent sedimentation of the photocatalyst.The pressure of the gas phase was continuously monitored. Prior to the illumination, a supercritical fluid-grade CO2 with a certified maximum of hydrocarbons less than 1 ppm (SIAD Technical Gases, CZ) to avoid any hydrocarbon contamination was bubbled with a constant flow through the stirred suspension for at least 20 min to purge the air and to saturate the solution.The reactor was tightly closed and the CO 2 pressure was maintained at 120 kPa.The pressure of the gas phase was continuously monitored.Then, the photocatalytic reaction was started by switching on the Hg lamp.Samples of gas reaction mixture were taken at various times during the irradiation.Gas sampling was performed using a gas-tight syringe (10 ml) through a septum.GC/FID/TCD was used for the analysis of reaction products in the gas phase 27. The accuracy of the experiment was verified by a series of repeated measurements, and the relative error of product yields (lmol/g) of 10 was determined.Blank tests were carried out to guarantee that the methane production was due to the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and to eliminate the surrounding interference.During the first test, the reaction mixture was UV-illuminated without the photocatalyst, the second reaction mixture was in the dark with the photocatalyst under the same experimental conditions, and the third suspension of photocatalyst was illuminated in the absence of CO 2 .No hydrocarbons were detected in the above blank tests. The decomposition of N 2 O was carried out in a homemade apparatus at ambient temperature with or without the catalyst (photocatalysis and photolysis, respectively).The adhesive material with 0.1 g catalyst was inserted on the bottom of the batch reactor (of 180 ml volume).The metal flange with a flat quartz visor was placed on the batch reactor, equipped with a bypass with peristaltic pump for circulating mixing of the reacting mixture.The circulation rate was 200 rpm.In both photochemical and photocatalytic experiments, the reactor was filled with a N 2 O/He mixture (968 ppm) and illuminated by an 8 W Hg lamp (k 254 nm).Temperature and pressure inside the photoreactor were monitored continuously during the experiments.A gas chromatograph with thermal conductivity detector (GC/TCD) was used for the analysis of N 2 O decay.The concentration of N 2 O was measured before switching on the UV lamp and during the reaction.The reproducibility of the photocatalytic experiments was verified by repeated tests in the interval of 0-18 h.The accuracy of the measurement was certified by a series of repeated measurements, and the relative error of the N 2 O concentration (ppm) of 5 was determined."}, {"llm generation": "Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts", "source": "The specific surface area of Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts rises with the increase of the Ce loading in TiO 2 photocatalysts from 32 m 2 /g up to 99 m 2 /g (Table 1).", "context": "Results of photocatalysts characterization are summarized in Tables 1,2.The specific surface area of Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts rises with the increase of the Ce loading in TiO 2 photocatalysts from 32 m 2 /g up to 99 m 2 /g (Table 1).This effect can be attributed to a decreasing size of the anatase crystallites as a consequence of cerium ion incorporation into the anatase crystal lattice, as can be revealed from the data in Table 2.The observed inhibition effect of cerium doping on the anatase crystallite growth is in agreement with our previous works 15,18, where the refined anatase lattice parameters increased and, consequently, the anatase cell volume expanded.The positive effect of cerium doping on the optical properties of photocatalysts can be also proved; the shift of the spectral response of the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts to the visible light region is evident, and the decrease in the absorption edge of the photocatalysts with cerium loading was detected (Table 1). Figure 1 shows the dependence of the absorption edge (1) and specific surface area (2) as a function of the Ce loading.It shows that the small Ce amount (to 0.8 mol) results in a steep linear decrease in the absorption edge from 3.19 eV (for TiO 2 ) to 2.97 eV (for 0.8 mol of Ce in TiO 2 ).This decrease in the absorption edge continues up to 3 mol of Ce.With further increasing the Ce loading, the absorption edge slowly stabilizes at approximately 2.64 eV for 10 mol of Ce 15.The specific surface area increases rapidly with small Ce loadings (to 0.8 mol) and reaches a maximum for 3 mol of Ce.Further Ce addition causes a slow decrease 15. The effect of irradiation time on the formation of gaseous products in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was studied over all prepared Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts.Figure 2 demonstrates the evolution of reaction products as the function of irradiation time.Methane and hydrogen were determined as the gaseous products of the reaction, and the obtained yields of hydrogen were higher by one order of magnitude in comparison with those of methane.The other possible products (methanol, formaldehyde) were under the detection limit.Yields of both formed reaction products are the highest for the 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst. The effect of irradiation time on the photochemical and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O was investigated for all Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts for a time period of 0-18 h.The The results of photocatalytic tests (the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O) showed that the amount of cerium doping is a key factor in both photocatalytic reactions and that the specific doping level of 0.3 mol Ce was generally the most effective for the investigated TiO 2 photocatalysts.Photocatalytic reactions are of very complex nature, and the photoactivity of the photocatalysts is affected by several factors such as the surface area and surface properties (chemical composition, crystallite morphology, etc.), the Fermi level and band gap energy, and, most importantly, the energy levels of electrons and holes.The doping of cerium led to a favorable increase in the specific surface area and also to a favorable decrease in the band gap energy (Table 1).The increasing specific surface area with the increasing cerium concentration can be attributed to decreasing TiO 2 anatase crystallite size (Table 2).As previously demonstrated, the value of the photocatalyst work function can predetermine the photoactivity of the photocatalysts 8,15,18.It was experimentally shown that different Ce loadings in TiO 2 nanoparticles decisively impact the energy of the holes in the valence band and the shift the energy of the electrons in the conduction band, thus directly influencing the CO 2 photoreduction.Figure 4 shows an apparent correlation between the yields of methane and hydrogen after 20 h of irradiation and the work function of individual photocatalysts.There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .This trend is in agreement with our previous results over highly Ce-doped TiO 2 and ZnS/MMT photocatalysts tested in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide 15,18.Thus, the work function measurement appears to be a very helpful experimental guideline for the estimation of the energy shift of the valence and conduction bands of the prepared photocatalysts. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the electron energy in the conduction band must be higher than the H ? reduction potential, whereas the hole energy in the valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.For simplicity, it can be supposed that the Fermi level on the nanoparticle surface is pinned to the middle of nanoparticle band gap 15.Based on the data from Table 1 and Fig. 4, it can be estimated that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -3.256 eV, while the valence band edge is -6.446 eV for pure TiO 2 .For 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 15 meV (CB -3.241eV), while the valence band edge shifts up by 65 meV (VB -6.381eV) (Fig. 5a).Since the pure anatase valence band energy is approximately 500 meV lower than the required oxidation potential of holes, and the hole energy in 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles is sufficient for the oxidation of hydroxyl anions.It can be concluded that for 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles both carriers have sufficient potentials for the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5b).Similarly 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles provide roughly 87 meV decrease in electron energy in the conduction band and 18 meV decrease in hole energy in the valence band with respect to the values of pure anatase.Since the pure TiO 2 has the conduction band energy sufficiently close to the H ? reduction potential, the decrease in electron energy is critical for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .For 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the electron energy in the conduction band decreases slightly below the H ? reduction potential; thus, the photocatalytic performance of such a photocatalyst is decreasing. There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The observed irregular changes in work function upon cerium loading are associated with the strong modification of the electronic properties of the material.The specific electronic characterization of Ce-doped TiO 2 photocatalyst can be challenging due to the complexity of effects.As revealed in the manuscript, the addition of cerium into TiO 2 results in substantial changes in surface area, crystallite size, lattice parameters and optical properties (Tables 1,2).Obviously, this implies modification in the structure, morphology, concentration of defects, mobility of charge carriers, etc.The nonlinear changes in work function with doping are commonly observed when semiconductor systems are involved and are often accounted for the explanation of the catalytic activity, e.g., K-Co-Mn-Al 28, Co-Fe-O 29 and Ce-K-Fe-O 30.The tight relationship between the activity and the work function clearly implied that the electron-donor properties of the catalyst surface gauged by the position of the Fermi level are the primary factor controlling the reaction rate.The work function parameter can also be used for evaluation of photocatalysts where the availability of surface electrons plays a crucial role in surface mediated redox processes 282930. Combining the information about the work function (Fig. 4) with band gap energies for different Ce loadings (Table 1), we can conclude that the best observed Ce loading for the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst is 0.3 mol of Ce.Due to the optimal electron and hole energies, the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst with 0.3 mol of Ce has extraordinary photocatalytic properties. For the photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O, the electron energy in the conduction band and the hole energy in the valence band are sufficient for the triggering of this reaction, as the redox potential of nitrous oxide/nitrogen is 1.77 V.A similar relationship of the photocatalysts activity with the work function as for the reaction yield from CO 2 photocatalytic reduction was also observed in N 2 O conversion at N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition.The lowest measured work function corresponds to the highest value of the N 2 O conversion (Fig. 4c). The doping with various loadings of cerium can influence surface properties of Ce/TiO 2 particularly such as the Fig. 5 Illustration of a the evaluation of energies of electrons and holes in conduction and valence bands from the knowledge of experimentally determined work function and band gap energy for pure TiO 2 and b the shifts of energies of electrons and holes formation in conduction and valence bands in dependence on the Ce amount ratio of Ce 3? /Ce 4? species as well as the presence of surface oxygen species, which can affect the photocatalytic efficiency of the reaction.Wang et al. 16 found that the surface oxygen species on the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite surface can easily capture electrons and that Ce 3? ions could interact with holes and prevent the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher photocatalytic efficiency.In our recent work 15, we have shown that the ratio of present Ce 3? /Ce 4? species is decreasing with the increasing amount of cerium.In our present study of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the photocatalyst efficiency, expressed as kinetic rate constant k, was decreasing in the following sequence: 0.3 mol Ce/ TiO 2 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 C TiO 2 C 0.8 mol Ce/TiO 2 . This tendency can imply the existence of an optimum, narrow range Ce loading for photocatalysts, which corresponds with the ability of the Ce 3?/ Ce 4? redox couple to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, by enabling faster electron transfer along the TiO 2 surface 31323334.In the case of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the retardation of the fast charge recombination by the Ce 3? /Ce 4? redox couple can be the phenomenon responsible for the observed trend in photocatalytic performance of the mentioned Ce/TiO 2 materials. When the Ce content is higher than 0.3 mol of Ce, the blocking of active sites is supposed, leading to the decrease of N 2 O conversion.The effect of the Ce dopant on the N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition has not yet been studied for lower amounts of cerium.However, an optimum amount of Ce is consistent with the results from our previous work dealing with TiO 2 with high amounts of cerium (Ce 0.05 Ti 0.95 O 2 , Ce 0.30 Ti 0.70 O 2 ) 8 which point out that a low Ce loading is recommended for high photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction and N 2 O decomposition."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2 photocatalysts", "source": "The specific surface area of Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts rises with the increase of the Ce loading in TiO 2 photocatalysts from 32 m 2 /g up to 99 m 2 /g (Table 1).", "context": "Results of photocatalysts characterization are summarized in Tables 1,2.The specific surface area of Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts rises with the increase of the Ce loading in TiO 2 photocatalysts from 32 m 2 /g up to 99 m 2 /g (Table 1).This effect can be attributed to a decreasing size of the anatase crystallites as a consequence of cerium ion incorporation into the anatase crystal lattice, as can be revealed from the data in Table 2.The observed inhibition effect of cerium doping on the anatase crystallite growth is in agreement with our previous works 15,18, where the refined anatase lattice parameters increased and, consequently, the anatase cell volume expanded.The positive effect of cerium doping on the optical properties of photocatalysts can be also proved; the shift of the spectral response of the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts to the visible light region is evident, and the decrease in the absorption edge of the photocatalysts with cerium loading was detected (Table 1).

The effect of irradiation time on the photochemical and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O was investigated for all Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts for a time period of 0-18 h.The The results of photocatalytic tests (the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O) showed that the amount of cerium doping is a key factor in both photocatalytic reactions and that the specific doping level of 0.3 mol Ce was generally the most effective for the investigated TiO 2 photocatalysts.Photocatalytic reactions are of very complex nature, and the photoactivity of the photocatalysts is affected by several factors such as the surface area and surface properties (chemical composition, crystallite morphology, etc.), the Fermi level and band gap energy, and, most importantly, the energy levels of electrons and holes.The doping of cerium led to a favorable increase in the specific surface area and also to a favorable decrease in the band gap energy (Table 1).The increasing specific surface area with the increasing cerium concentration can be attributed to decreasing TiO 2 anatase crystallite size (Table 2).As previously demonstrated, the value of the photocatalyst work function can predetermine the photoactivity of the photocatalysts 8,15,18.It was experimentally shown that different Ce loadings in TiO 2 nanoparticles decisively impact the energy of the holes in the valence band and the shift the energy of the electrons in the conduction band, thus directly influencing the CO 2 photoreduction.Figure 4 shows an apparent correlation between the yields of methane and hydrogen after 20 h of irradiation and the work function of individual photocatalysts.There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .This trend is in agreement with our previous results over highly Ce-doped TiO 2 and ZnS/MMT photocatalysts tested in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide 15,18.Thus, the work function measurement appears to be a very helpful experimental guideline for the estimation of the energy shift of the valence and conduction bands of the prepared photocatalysts. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the electron energy in the conduction band must be higher than the H ? reduction potential, whereas the hole energy in the valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.For simplicity, it can be supposed that the Fermi level on the nanoparticle surface is pinned to the middle of nanoparticle band gap 15.Based on the data from Table 1 and Fig. 4, it can be estimated that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -3.256 eV, while the valence band edge is -6.446 eV for pure TiO 2 .For 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 15 meV (CB -3.241eV), while the valence band edge shifts up by 65 meV (VB -6.381eV) (Fig. 5a).Since the pure anatase valence band energy is approximately 500 meV lower than the required oxidation potential of holes, and the hole energy in 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles is sufficient for the oxidation of hydroxyl anions.It can be concluded that for 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles both carriers have sufficient potentials for the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5b).Similarly 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles provide roughly 87 meV decrease in electron energy in the conduction band and 18 meV decrease in hole energy in the valence band with respect to the values of pure anatase.Since the pure TiO 2 has the conduction band energy sufficiently close to the H ? reduction potential, the decrease in electron energy is critical for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .For 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the electron energy in the conduction band decreases slightly below the H ? reduction potential; thus, the photocatalytic performance of such a photocatalyst is decreasing. There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The observed irregular changes in work function upon cerium loading are associated with the strong modification of the electronic properties of the material.The specific electronic characterization of Ce-doped TiO 2 photocatalyst can be challenging due to the complexity of effects.As revealed in the manuscript, the addition of cerium into TiO 2 results in substantial changes in surface area, crystallite size, lattice parameters and optical properties (Tables 1,2).Obviously, this implies modification in the structure, morphology, concentration of defects, mobility of charge carriers, etc.The nonlinear changes in work function with doping are commonly observed when semiconductor systems are involved and are often accounted for the explanation of the catalytic activity, e.g., K-Co-Mn-Al 28, Co-Fe-O 29 and Ce-K-Fe-O 30.The tight relationship between the activity and the work function clearly implied that the electron-donor properties of the catalyst surface gauged by the position of the Fermi level are the primary factor controlling the reaction rate.The work function parameter can also be used for evaluation of photocatalysts where the availability of surface electrons plays a crucial role in surface mediated redox processes 282930. Combining the information about the work function (Fig. 4) with band gap energies for different Ce loadings (Table 1), we can conclude that the best observed Ce loading for the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst is 0.3 mol of Ce.Due to the optimal electron and hole energies, the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst with 0.3 mol of Ce has extraordinary photocatalytic properties. For the photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O, the electron energy in the conduction band and the hole energy in the valence band are sufficient for the triggering of this reaction, as the redox potential of nitrous oxide/nitrogen is 1.77 V.A similar relationship of the photocatalysts activity with the work function as for the reaction yield from CO 2 photocatalytic reduction was also observed in N 2 O conversion at N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition.The lowest measured work function corresponds to the highest value of the N 2 O conversion (Fig. 4c). The doping with various loadings of cerium can influence surface properties of Ce/TiO 2 particularly such as the Fig. 5 Illustration of a the evaluation of energies of electrons and holes in conduction and valence bands from the knowledge of experimentally determined work function and band gap energy for pure TiO 2 and b the shifts of energies of electrons and holes formation in conduction and valence bands in dependence on the Ce amount ratio of Ce 3? /Ce 4? species as well as the presence of surface oxygen species, which can affect the photocatalytic efficiency of the reaction.Wang et al. 16 found that the surface oxygen species on the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite surface can easily capture electrons and that Ce 3? ions could interact with holes and prevent the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher photocatalytic efficiency.In our recent work 15, we have shown that the ratio of present Ce 3? /Ce 4? species is decreasing with the increasing amount of cerium.In our present study of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the photocatalyst efficiency, expressed as kinetic rate constant k, was decreasing in the following sequence: 0.3 mol Ce/ TiO 2 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 C TiO 2 C 0.8 mol Ce/TiO 2 . This tendency can imply the existence of an optimum, narrow range Ce loading for photocatalysts, which corresponds with the ability of the Ce 3?/ Ce 4? redox couple to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, by enabling faster electron transfer along the TiO 2 surface 31323334.In the case of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the retardation of the fast charge recombination by the Ce 3? /Ce 4? redox couple can be the phenomenon responsible for the observed trend in photocatalytic performance of the mentioned Ce/TiO 2 materials. When the Ce content is higher than 0.3 mol of Ce, the blocking of active sites is supposed, leading to the decrease of N 2 O conversion.The effect of the Ce dopant on the N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition has not yet been studied for lower amounts of cerium.However, an optimum amount of Ce is consistent with the results from our previous work dealing with TiO 2 with high amounts of cerium (Ce 0.05 Ti 0.95 O 2 , Ce 0.30 Ti 0.70 O 2 ) 8 which point out that a low Ce loading is recommended for high photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction and N 2 O decomposition."}, {"llm generation": "0.8 mol of Ce in TiO 2", "source": "It shows that the small Ce amount (to 0.8 mol) results in a steep linear decrease in the absorption edge from 3.19 eV (for TiO 2 ) to 2.97 eV (for 0.8 mol of Ce in TiO 2 ).", "context": "Results of photocatalysts characterization are summarized in Tables 1,2.The specific surface area of Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts rises with the increase of the Ce loading in TiO 2 photocatalysts from 32 m 2 /g up to 99 m 2 /g (Table 1).This effect can be attributed to a decreasing size of the anatase crystallites as a consequence of cerium ion incorporation into the anatase crystal lattice, as can be revealed from the data in Table 2.The observed inhibition effect of cerium doping on the anatase crystallite growth is in agreement with our previous works 15,18, where the refined anatase lattice parameters increased and, consequently, the anatase cell volume expanded.The positive effect of cerium doping on the optical properties of photocatalysts can be also proved; the shift of the spectral response of the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts to the visible light region is evident, and the decrease in the absorption edge of the photocatalysts with cerium loading was detected (Table 1).

The effect of irradiation time on the photochemical and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O was investigated for all Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts for a time period of 0-18 h.The The results of photocatalytic tests (the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O) showed that the amount of cerium doping is a key factor in both photocatalytic reactions and that the specific doping level of 0.3 mol Ce was generally the most effective for the investigated TiO 2 photocatalysts.Photocatalytic reactions are of very complex nature, and the photoactivity of the photocatalysts is affected by several factors such as the surface area and surface properties (chemical composition, crystallite morphology, etc.), the Fermi level and band gap energy, and, most importantly, the energy levels of electrons and holes.The doping of cerium led to a favorable increase in the specific surface area and also to a favorable decrease in the band gap energy (Table 1).The increasing specific surface area with the increasing cerium concentration can be attributed to decreasing TiO 2 anatase crystallite size (Table 2).As previously demonstrated, the value of the photocatalyst work function can predetermine the photoactivity of the photocatalysts 8,15,18.It was experimentally shown that different Ce loadings in TiO 2 nanoparticles decisively impact the energy of the holes in the valence band and the shift the energy of the electrons in the conduction band, thus directly influencing the CO 2 photoreduction.Figure 4 shows an apparent correlation between the yields of methane and hydrogen after 20 h of irradiation and the work function of individual photocatalysts.There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .This trend is in agreement with our previous results over highly Ce-doped TiO 2 and ZnS/MMT photocatalysts tested in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide 15,18.Thus, the work function measurement appears to be a very helpful experimental guideline for the estimation of the energy shift of the valence and conduction bands of the prepared photocatalysts. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the electron energy in the conduction band must be higher than the H ? reduction potential, whereas the hole energy in the valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.For simplicity, it can be supposed that the Fermi level on the nanoparticle surface is pinned to the middle of nanoparticle band gap 15.Based on the data from Table 1 and Fig. 4, it can be estimated that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -3.256 eV, while the valence band edge is -6.446 eV for pure TiO 2 .For 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 15 meV (CB -3.241eV), while the valence band edge shifts up by 65 meV (VB -6.381eV) (Fig. 5a).Since the pure anatase valence band energy is approximately 500 meV lower than the required oxidation potential of holes, and the hole energy in 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles is sufficient for the oxidation of hydroxyl anions.It can be concluded that for 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles both carriers have sufficient potentials for the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5b).Similarly 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles provide roughly 87 meV decrease in electron energy in the conduction band and 18 meV decrease in hole energy in the valence band with respect to the values of pure anatase.Since the pure TiO 2 has the conduction band energy sufficiently close to the H ? reduction potential, the decrease in electron energy is critical for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .For 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the electron energy in the conduction band decreases slightly below the H ? reduction potential; thus, the photocatalytic performance of such a photocatalyst is decreasing. There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The observed irregular changes in work function upon cerium loading are associated with the strong modification of the electronic properties of the material.The specific electronic characterization of Ce-doped TiO 2 photocatalyst can be challenging due to the complexity of effects.As revealed in the manuscript, the addition of cerium into TiO 2 results in substantial changes in surface area, crystallite size, lattice parameters and optical properties (Tables 1,2).Obviously, this implies modification in the structure, morphology, concentration of defects, mobility of charge carriers, etc.The nonlinear changes in work function with doping are commonly observed when semiconductor systems are involved and are often accounted for the explanation of the catalytic activity, e.g., K-Co-Mn-Al 28, Co-Fe-O 29 and Ce-K-Fe-O 30.The tight relationship between the activity and the work function clearly implied that the electron-donor properties of the catalyst surface gauged by the position of the Fermi level are the primary factor controlling the reaction rate.The work function parameter can also be used for evaluation of photocatalysts where the availability of surface electrons plays a crucial role in surface mediated redox processes 282930. Combining the information about the work function (Fig. 4) with band gap energies for different Ce loadings (Table 1), we can conclude that the best observed Ce loading for the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst is 0.3 mol of Ce.Due to the optimal electron and hole energies, the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst with 0.3 mol of Ce has extraordinary photocatalytic properties. For the photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O, the electron energy in the conduction band and the hole energy in the valence band are sufficient for the triggering of this reaction, as the redox potential of nitrous oxide/nitrogen is 1.77 V.A similar relationship of the photocatalysts activity with the work function as for the reaction yield from CO 2 photocatalytic reduction was also observed in N 2 O conversion at N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition.The lowest measured work function corresponds to the highest value of the N 2 O conversion (Fig. 4c). The doping with various loadings of cerium can influence surface properties of Ce/TiO 2 particularly such as the Fig. 5 Illustration of a the evaluation of energies of electrons and holes in conduction and valence bands from the knowledge of experimentally determined work function and band gap energy for pure TiO 2 and b the shifts of energies of electrons and holes formation in conduction and valence bands in dependence on the Ce amount ratio of Ce 3? /Ce 4? species as well as the presence of surface oxygen species, which can affect the photocatalytic efficiency of the reaction.Wang et al. 16 found that the surface oxygen species on the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite surface can easily capture electrons and that Ce 3? ions could interact with holes and prevent the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher photocatalytic efficiency.In our recent work 15, we have shown that the ratio of present Ce 3? /Ce 4? species is decreasing with the increasing amount of cerium.In our present study of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the photocatalyst efficiency, expressed as kinetic rate constant k, was decreasing in the following sequence: 0.3 mol Ce/ TiO 2 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 C TiO 2 C 0.8 mol Ce/TiO 2 . This tendency can imply the existence of an optimum, narrow range Ce loading for photocatalysts, which corresponds with the ability of the Ce 3?/ Ce 4? redox couple to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, by enabling faster electron transfer along the TiO 2 surface 31323334.In the case of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the retardation of the fast charge recombination by the Ce 3? /Ce 4? redox couple can be the phenomenon responsible for the observed trend in photocatalytic performance of the mentioned Ce/TiO 2 materials. When the Ce content is higher than 0.3 mol of Ce, the blocking of active sites is supposed, leading to the decrease of N 2 O conversion.The effect of the Ce dopant on the N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition has not yet been studied for lower amounts of cerium.However, an optimum amount of Ce is consistent with the results from our previous work dealing with TiO 2 with high amounts of cerium (Ce 0.05 Ti 0.95 O 2 , Ce 0.30 Ti 0.70 O 2 ) 8 which point out that a low Ce loading is recommended for high photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction and N 2 O decomposition."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2 photocatalysts", "source": "The The results of photocatalytic tests (the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O) showed that the amount of cerium doping is a key factor in both photocatalytic reactions and that the specific doping level of 0.3 mol Ce was generally the most effective for the investigated TiO 2 photocatalysts.", "context": "Results of photocatalysts characterization are summarized in Tables 1,2.The specific surface area of Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts rises with the increase of the Ce loading in TiO 2 photocatalysts from 32 m 2 /g up to 99 m 2 /g (Table 1).This effect can be attributed to a decreasing size of the anatase crystallites as a consequence of cerium ion incorporation into the anatase crystal lattice, as can be revealed from the data in Table 2.The observed inhibition effect of cerium doping on the anatase crystallite growth is in agreement with our previous works 15,18, where the refined anatase lattice parameters increased and, consequently, the anatase cell volume expanded.The positive effect of cerium doping on the optical properties of photocatalysts can be also proved; the shift of the spectral response of the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts to the visible light region is evident, and the decrease in the absorption edge of the photocatalysts with cerium loading was detected (Table 1).

The effect of irradiation time on the photochemical and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O was investigated for all Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts for a time period of 0-18 h.The The results of photocatalytic tests (the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O) showed that the amount of cerium doping is a key factor in both photocatalytic reactions and that the specific doping level of 0.3 mol Ce was generally the most effective for the investigated TiO 2 photocatalysts.Photocatalytic reactions are of very complex nature, and the photoactivity of the photocatalysts is affected by several factors such as the surface area and surface properties (chemical composition, crystallite morphology, etc.), the Fermi level and band gap energy, and, most importantly, the energy levels of electrons and holes.The doping of cerium led to a favorable increase in the specific surface area and also to a favorable decrease in the band gap energy (Table 1).The increasing specific surface area with the increasing cerium concentration can be attributed to decreasing TiO 2 anatase crystallite size (Table 2).As previously demonstrated, the value of the photocatalyst work function can predetermine the photoactivity of the photocatalysts 8,15,18.It was experimentally shown that different Ce loadings in TiO 2 nanoparticles decisively impact the energy of the holes in the valence band and the shift the energy of the electrons in the conduction band, thus directly influencing the CO 2 photoreduction.Figure 4 shows an apparent correlation between the yields of methane and hydrogen after 20 h of irradiation and the work function of individual photocatalysts.There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .This trend is in agreement with our previous results over highly Ce-doped TiO 2 and ZnS/MMT photocatalysts tested in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide 15,18.Thus, the work function measurement appears to be a very helpful experimental guideline for the estimation of the energy shift of the valence and conduction bands of the prepared photocatalysts. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the electron energy in the conduction band must be higher than the H ? reduction potential, whereas the hole energy in the valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.For simplicity, it can be supposed that the Fermi level on the nanoparticle surface is pinned to the middle of nanoparticle band gap 15.Based on the data from Table 1 and Fig. 4, it can be estimated that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -3.256 eV, while the valence band edge is -6.446 eV for pure TiO 2 .For 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 15 meV (CB -3.241eV), while the valence band edge shifts up by 65 meV (VB -6.381eV) (Fig. 5a).Since the pure anatase valence band energy is approximately 500 meV lower than the required oxidation potential of holes, and the hole energy in 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles is sufficient for the oxidation of hydroxyl anions.It can be concluded that for 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles both carriers have sufficient potentials for the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5b).Similarly 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles provide roughly 87 meV decrease in electron energy in the conduction band and 18 meV decrease in hole energy in the valence band with respect to the values of pure anatase.Since the pure TiO 2 has the conduction band energy sufficiently close to the H ? reduction potential, the decrease in electron energy is critical for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .For 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the electron energy in the conduction band decreases slightly below the H ? reduction potential; thus, the photocatalytic performance of such a photocatalyst is decreasing. There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The observed irregular changes in work function upon cerium loading are associated with the strong modification of the electronic properties of the material.The specific electronic characterization of Ce-doped TiO 2 photocatalyst can be challenging due to the complexity of effects.As revealed in the manuscript, the addition of cerium into TiO 2 results in substantial changes in surface area, crystallite size, lattice parameters and optical properties (Tables 1,2).Obviously, this implies modification in the structure, morphology, concentration of defects, mobility of charge carriers, etc.The nonlinear changes in work function with doping are commonly observed when semiconductor systems are involved and are often accounted for the explanation of the catalytic activity, e.g., K-Co-Mn-Al 28, Co-Fe-O 29 and Ce-K-Fe-O 30.The tight relationship between the activity and the work function clearly implied that the electron-donor properties of the catalyst surface gauged by the position of the Fermi level are the primary factor controlling the reaction rate.The work function parameter can also be used for evaluation of photocatalysts where the availability of surface electrons plays a crucial role in surface mediated redox processes 282930. Combining the information about the work function (Fig. 4) with band gap energies for different Ce loadings (Table 1), we can conclude that the best observed Ce loading for the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst is 0.3 mol of Ce.Due to the optimal electron and hole energies, the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst with 0.3 mol of Ce has extraordinary photocatalytic properties. For the photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O, the electron energy in the conduction band and the hole energy in the valence band are sufficient for the triggering of this reaction, as the redox potential of nitrous oxide/nitrogen is 1.77 V.A similar relationship of the photocatalysts activity with the work function as for the reaction yield from CO 2 photocatalytic reduction was also observed in N 2 O conversion at N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition.The lowest measured work function corresponds to the highest value of the N 2 O conversion (Fig. 4c). The doping with various loadings of cerium can influence surface properties of Ce/TiO 2 particularly such as the Fig. 5 Illustration of a the evaluation of energies of electrons and holes in conduction and valence bands from the knowledge of experimentally determined work function and band gap energy for pure TiO 2 and b the shifts of energies of electrons and holes formation in conduction and valence bands in dependence on the Ce amount ratio of Ce 3? /Ce 4? species as well as the presence of surface oxygen species, which can affect the photocatalytic efficiency of the reaction.Wang et al. 16 found that the surface oxygen species on the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite surface can easily capture electrons and that Ce 3? ions could interact with holes and prevent the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher photocatalytic efficiency.In our recent work 15, we have shown that the ratio of present Ce 3? /Ce 4? species is decreasing with the increasing amount of cerium.In our present study of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the photocatalyst efficiency, expressed as kinetic rate constant k, was decreasing in the following sequence: 0.3 mol Ce/ TiO 2 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 C TiO 2 C 0.8 mol Ce/TiO 2 . This tendency can imply the existence of an optimum, narrow range Ce loading for photocatalysts, which corresponds with the ability of the Ce 3?/ Ce 4? redox couple to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, by enabling faster electron transfer along the TiO 2 surface 31323334.In the case of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the retardation of the fast charge recombination by the Ce 3? /Ce 4? redox couple can be the phenomenon responsible for the observed trend in photocatalytic performance of the mentioned Ce/TiO 2 materials. When the Ce content is higher than 0.3 mol of Ce, the blocking of active sites is supposed, leading to the decrease of N 2 O conversion.The effect of the Ce dopant on the N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition has not yet been studied for lower amounts of cerium.However, an optimum amount of Ce is consistent with the results from our previous work dealing with TiO 2 with high amounts of cerium (Ce 0.05 Ti 0.95 O 2 , Ce 0.30 Ti 0.70 O 2 ) 8 which point out that a low Ce loading is recommended for high photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction and N 2 O decomposition."}, {"llm generation": "pure anatase", "source": "Since the pure anatase valence band energy is approximately 500 meV lower than the required oxidation potential of holes, and the hole energy in 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles is sufficient for the oxidation of hydroxyl anions.", "context": "Results of photocatalysts characterization are summarized in Tables 1,2.The specific surface area of Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts rises with the increase of the Ce loading in TiO 2 photocatalysts from 32 m 2 /g up to 99 m 2 /g (Table 1).This effect can be attributed to a decreasing size of the anatase crystallites as a consequence of cerium ion incorporation into the anatase crystal lattice, as can be revealed from the data in Table 2.The observed inhibition effect of cerium doping on the anatase crystallite growth is in agreement with our previous works 15,18, where the refined anatase lattice parameters increased and, consequently, the anatase cell volume expanded.The positive effect of cerium doping on the optical properties of photocatalysts can be also proved; the shift of the spectral response of the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts to the visible light region is evident, and the decrease in the absorption edge of the photocatalysts with cerium loading was detected (Table 1). Figure 1 shows the dependence of the absorption edge (1) and specific surface area (2) as a function of the Ce loading.It shows that the small Ce amount (to 0.8 mol) results in a steep linear decrease in the absorption edge from 3.19 eV (for TiO 2 ) to 2.97 eV (for 0.8 mol of Ce in TiO 2 ).This decrease in the absorption edge continues up to 3 mol of Ce.With further increasing the Ce loading, the absorption edge slowly stabilizes at approximately 2.64 eV for 10 mol of Ce 15.The specific surface area increases rapidly with small Ce loadings (to 0.8 mol) and reaches a maximum for 3 mol of Ce.Further Ce addition causes a slow decrease 15.

The effect of irradiation time on the photochemical and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O was investigated for all Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts for a time period of 0-18 h.The The results of photocatalytic tests (the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O) showed that the amount of cerium doping is a key factor in both photocatalytic reactions and that the specific doping level of 0.3 mol Ce was generally the most effective for the investigated TiO 2 photocatalysts.Photocatalytic reactions are of very complex nature, and the photoactivity of the photocatalysts is affected by several factors such as the surface area and surface properties (chemical composition, crystallite morphology, etc.), the Fermi level and band gap energy, and, most importantly, the energy levels of electrons and holes.The doping of cerium led to a favorable increase in the specific surface area and also to a favorable decrease in the band gap energy (Table 1).The increasing specific surface area with the increasing cerium concentration can be attributed to decreasing TiO 2 anatase crystallite size (Table 2).As previously demonstrated, the value of the photocatalyst work function can predetermine the photoactivity of the photocatalysts 8,15,18.It was experimentally shown that different Ce loadings in TiO 2 nanoparticles decisively impact the energy of the holes in the valence band and the shift the energy of the electrons in the conduction band, thus directly influencing the CO 2 photoreduction.Figure 4 shows an apparent correlation between the yields of methane and hydrogen after 20 h of irradiation and the work function of individual photocatalysts.There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .This trend is in agreement with our previous results over highly Ce-doped TiO 2 and ZnS/MMT photocatalysts tested in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide 15,18.Thus, the work function measurement appears to be a very helpful experimental guideline for the estimation of the energy shift of the valence and conduction bands of the prepared photocatalysts. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the electron energy in the conduction band must be higher than the H ? reduction potential, whereas the hole energy in the valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.For simplicity, it can be supposed that the Fermi level on the nanoparticle surface is pinned to the middle of nanoparticle band gap 15.Based on the data from Table 1 and Fig. 4, it can be estimated that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -3.256 eV, while the valence band edge is -6.446 eV for pure TiO 2 .For 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 15 meV (CB -3.241eV), while the valence band edge shifts up by 65 meV (VB -6.381eV) (Fig. 5a).Since the pure anatase valence band energy is approximately 500 meV lower than the required oxidation potential of holes, and the hole energy in 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles is sufficient for the oxidation of hydroxyl anions.It can be concluded that for 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles both carriers have sufficient potentials for the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5b).Similarly 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles provide roughly 87 meV decrease in electron energy in the conduction band and 18 meV decrease in hole energy in the valence band with respect to the values of pure anatase.Since the pure TiO 2 has the conduction band energy sufficiently close to the H ? reduction potential, the decrease in electron energy is critical for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .For 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the electron energy in the conduction band decreases slightly below the H ? reduction potential; thus, the photocatalytic performance of such a photocatalyst is decreasing. There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The observed irregular changes in work function upon cerium loading are associated with the strong modification of the electronic properties of the material.The specific electronic characterization of Ce-doped TiO 2 photocatalyst can be challenging due to the complexity of effects.As revealed in the manuscript, the addition of cerium into TiO 2 results in substantial changes in surface area, crystallite size, lattice parameters and optical properties (Tables 1,2).Obviously, this implies modification in the structure, morphology, concentration of defects, mobility of charge carriers, etc.The nonlinear changes in work function with doping are commonly observed when semiconductor systems are involved and are often accounted for the explanation of the catalytic activity, e.g., K-Co-Mn-Al 28, Co-Fe-O 29 and Ce-K-Fe-O 30.The tight relationship between the activity and the work function clearly implied that the electron-donor properties of the catalyst surface gauged by the position of the Fermi level are the primary factor controlling the reaction rate.The work function parameter can also be used for evaluation of photocatalysts where the availability of surface electrons plays a crucial role in surface mediated redox processes 282930. Combining the information about the work function (Fig. 4) with band gap energies for different Ce loadings (Table 1), we can conclude that the best observed Ce loading for the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst is 0.3 mol of Ce.Due to the optimal electron and hole energies, the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst with 0.3 mol of Ce has extraordinary photocatalytic properties. For the photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O, the electron energy in the conduction band and the hole energy in the valence band are sufficient for the triggering of this reaction, as the redox potential of nitrous oxide/nitrogen is 1.77 V.A similar relationship of the photocatalysts activity with the work function as for the reaction yield from CO 2 photocatalytic reduction was also observed in N 2 O conversion at N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition.The lowest measured work function corresponds to the highest value of the N 2 O conversion (Fig. 4c). The doping with various loadings of cerium can influence surface properties of Ce/TiO 2 particularly such as the Fig. 5 Illustration of a the evaluation of energies of electrons and holes in conduction and valence bands from the knowledge of experimentally determined work function and band gap energy for pure TiO 2 and b the shifts of energies of electrons and holes formation in conduction and valence bands in dependence on the Ce amount ratio of Ce 3? /Ce 4? species as well as the presence of surface oxygen species, which can affect the photocatalytic efficiency of the reaction.Wang et al. 16 found that the surface oxygen species on the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite surface can easily capture electrons and that Ce 3? ions could interact with holes and prevent the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher photocatalytic efficiency.In our recent work 15, we have shown that the ratio of present Ce 3? /Ce 4? species is decreasing with the increasing amount of cerium.In our present study of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the photocatalyst efficiency, expressed as kinetic rate constant k, was decreasing in the following sequence: 0.3 mol Ce/ TiO 2 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 C TiO 2 C 0.8 mol Ce/TiO 2 . This tendency can imply the existence of an optimum, narrow range Ce loading for photocatalysts, which corresponds with the ability of the Ce 3?/ Ce 4? redox couple to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, by enabling faster electron transfer along the TiO 2 surface 31323334.In the case of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the retardation of the fast charge recombination by the Ce 3? /Ce 4? redox couple can be the phenomenon responsible for the observed trend in photocatalytic performance of the mentioned Ce/TiO 2 materials. When the Ce content is higher than 0.3 mol of Ce, the blocking of active sites is supposed, leading to the decrease of N 2 O conversion.The effect of the Ce dopant on the N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition has not yet been studied for lower amounts of cerium.However, an optimum amount of Ce is consistent with the results from our previous work dealing with TiO 2 with high amounts of cerium (Ce 0.05 Ti 0.95 O 2 , Ce 0.30 Ti 0.70 O 2 ) 8 which point out that a low Ce loading is recommended for high photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction and N 2 O decomposition."}, {"llm generation": "0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles", "source": "Similarly 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles provide roughly 87 meV decrease in electron energy in the conduction band and 18 meV decrease in hole energy in the valence band with respect to the values of pure anatase.", "context": "Results of photocatalysts characterization are summarized in Tables 1,2.The specific surface area of Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts rises with the increase of the Ce loading in TiO 2 photocatalysts from 32 m 2 /g up to 99 m 2 /g (Table 1).This effect can be attributed to a decreasing size of the anatase crystallites as a consequence of cerium ion incorporation into the anatase crystal lattice, as can be revealed from the data in Table 2.The observed inhibition effect of cerium doping on the anatase crystallite growth is in agreement with our previous works 15,18, where the refined anatase lattice parameters increased and, consequently, the anatase cell volume expanded.The positive effect of cerium doping on the optical properties of photocatalysts can be also proved; the shift of the spectral response of the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts to the visible light region is evident, and the decrease in the absorption edge of the photocatalysts with cerium loading was detected (Table 1).

The effect of irradiation time on the photochemical and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O was investigated for all Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts for a time period of 0-18 h.The The results of photocatalytic tests (the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O) showed that the amount of cerium doping is a key factor in both photocatalytic reactions and that the specific doping level of 0.3 mol Ce was generally the most effective for the investigated TiO 2 photocatalysts.Photocatalytic reactions are of very complex nature, and the photoactivity of the photocatalysts is affected by several factors such as the surface area and surface properties (chemical composition, crystallite morphology, etc.), the Fermi level and band gap energy, and, most importantly, the energy levels of electrons and holes.The doping of cerium led to a favorable increase in the specific surface area and also to a favorable decrease in the band gap energy (Table 1).The increasing specific surface area with the increasing cerium concentration can be attributed to decreasing TiO 2 anatase crystallite size (Table 2).As previously demonstrated, the value of the photocatalyst work function can predetermine the photoactivity of the photocatalysts 8,15,18.It was experimentally shown that different Ce loadings in TiO 2 nanoparticles decisively impact the energy of the holes in the valence band and the shift the energy of the electrons in the conduction band, thus directly influencing the CO 2 photoreduction.Figure 4 shows an apparent correlation between the yields of methane and hydrogen after 20 h of irradiation and the work function of individual photocatalysts.There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .This trend is in agreement with our previous results over highly Ce-doped TiO 2 and ZnS/MMT photocatalysts tested in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide 15,18.Thus, the work function measurement appears to be a very helpful experimental guideline for the estimation of the energy shift of the valence and conduction bands of the prepared photocatalysts. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the electron energy in the conduction band must be higher than the H ? reduction potential, whereas the hole energy in the valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.For simplicity, it can be supposed that the Fermi level on the nanoparticle surface is pinned to the middle of nanoparticle band gap 15.Based on the data from Table 1 and Fig. 4, it can be estimated that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -3.256 eV, while the valence band edge is -6.446 eV for pure TiO 2 .For 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 15 meV (CB -3.241eV), while the valence band edge shifts up by 65 meV (VB -6.381eV) (Fig. 5a).Since the pure anatase valence band energy is approximately 500 meV lower than the required oxidation potential of holes, and the hole energy in 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles is sufficient for the oxidation of hydroxyl anions.It can be concluded that for 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles both carriers have sufficient potentials for the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5b).Similarly 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles provide roughly 87 meV decrease in electron energy in the conduction band and 18 meV decrease in hole energy in the valence band with respect to the values of pure anatase.Since the pure TiO 2 has the conduction band energy sufficiently close to the H ? reduction potential, the decrease in electron energy is critical for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .For 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the electron energy in the conduction band decreases slightly below the H ? reduction potential; thus, the photocatalytic performance of such a photocatalyst is decreasing. There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The observed irregular changes in work function upon cerium loading are associated with the strong modification of the electronic properties of the material.The specific electronic characterization of Ce-doped TiO 2 photocatalyst can be challenging due to the complexity of effects.As revealed in the manuscript, the addition of cerium into TiO 2 results in substantial changes in surface area, crystallite size, lattice parameters and optical properties (Tables 1,2).Obviously, this implies modification in the structure, morphology, concentration of defects, mobility of charge carriers, etc.The nonlinear changes in work function with doping are commonly observed when semiconductor systems are involved and are often accounted for the explanation of the catalytic activity, e.g., K-Co-Mn-Al 28, Co-Fe-O 29 and Ce-K-Fe-O 30.The tight relationship between the activity and the work function clearly implied that the electron-donor properties of the catalyst surface gauged by the position of the Fermi level are the primary factor controlling the reaction rate.The work function parameter can also be used for evaluation of photocatalysts where the availability of surface electrons plays a crucial role in surface mediated redox processes 282930. Combining the information about the work function (Fig. 4) with band gap energies for different Ce loadings (Table 1), we can conclude that the best observed Ce loading for the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst is 0.3 mol of Ce.Due to the optimal electron and hole energies, the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst with 0.3 mol of Ce has extraordinary photocatalytic properties. For the photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O, the electron energy in the conduction band and the hole energy in the valence band are sufficient for the triggering of this reaction, as the redox potential of nitrous oxide/nitrogen is 1.77 V.A similar relationship of the photocatalysts activity with the work function as for the reaction yield from CO 2 photocatalytic reduction was also observed in N 2 O conversion at N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition.The lowest measured work function corresponds to the highest value of the N 2 O conversion (Fig. 4c). The doping with various loadings of cerium can influence surface properties of Ce/TiO 2 particularly such as the Fig. 5 Illustration of a the evaluation of energies of electrons and holes in conduction and valence bands from the knowledge of experimentally determined work function and band gap energy for pure TiO 2 and b the shifts of energies of electrons and holes formation in conduction and valence bands in dependence on the Ce amount ratio of Ce 3? /Ce 4? species as well as the presence of surface oxygen species, which can affect the photocatalytic efficiency of the reaction.Wang et al. 16 found that the surface oxygen species on the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite surface can easily capture electrons and that Ce 3? ions could interact with holes and prevent the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher photocatalytic efficiency.In our recent work 15, we have shown that the ratio of present Ce 3? /Ce 4? species is decreasing with the increasing amount of cerium.In our present study of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the photocatalyst efficiency, expressed as kinetic rate constant k, was decreasing in the following sequence: 0.3 mol Ce/ TiO 2 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 C TiO 2 C 0.8 mol Ce/TiO 2 . This tendency can imply the existence of an optimum, narrow range Ce loading for photocatalysts, which corresponds with the ability of the Ce 3?/ Ce 4? redox couple to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, by enabling faster electron transfer along the TiO 2 surface 31323334.In the case of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the retardation of the fast charge recombination by the Ce 3? /Ce 4? redox couple can be the phenomenon responsible for the observed trend in photocatalytic performance of the mentioned Ce/TiO 2 materials. When the Ce content is higher than 0.3 mol of Ce, the blocking of active sites is supposed, leading to the decrease of N 2 O conversion.The effect of the Ce dopant on the N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition has not yet been studied for lower amounts of cerium.However, an optimum amount of Ce is consistent with the results from our previous work dealing with TiO 2 with high amounts of cerium (Ce 0.05 Ti 0.95 O 2 , Ce 0.30 Ti 0.70 O 2 ) 8 which point out that a low Ce loading is recommended for high photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction and N 2 O decomposition."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2", "source": "As revealed in the manuscript, the addition of cerium into TiO 2 results in substantial changes in surface area, crystallite size, lattice parameters and optical properties (Tables 1,2).", "context": "Results of photocatalysts characterization are summarized in Tables 1,2.The specific surface area of Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts rises with the increase of the Ce loading in TiO 2 photocatalysts from 32 m 2 /g up to 99 m 2 /g (Table 1).This effect can be attributed to a decreasing size of the anatase crystallites as a consequence of cerium ion incorporation into the anatase crystal lattice, as can be revealed from the data in Table 2.The observed inhibition effect of cerium doping on the anatase crystallite growth is in agreement with our previous works 15,18, where the refined anatase lattice parameters increased and, consequently, the anatase cell volume expanded.The positive effect of cerium doping on the optical properties of photocatalysts can be also proved; the shift of the spectral response of the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts to the visible light region is evident, and the decrease in the absorption edge of the photocatalysts with cerium loading was detected (Table 1).

The effect of irradiation time on the photochemical and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O was investigated for all Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts for a time period of 0-18 h.The The results of photocatalytic tests (the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O) showed that the amount of cerium doping is a key factor in both photocatalytic reactions and that the specific doping level of 0.3 mol Ce was generally the most effective for the investigated TiO 2 photocatalysts.Photocatalytic reactions are of very complex nature, and the photoactivity of the photocatalysts is affected by several factors such as the surface area and surface properties (chemical composition, crystallite morphology, etc.), the Fermi level and band gap energy, and, most importantly, the energy levels of electrons and holes.The doping of cerium led to a favorable increase in the specific surface area and also to a favorable decrease in the band gap energy (Table 1).The increasing specific surface area with the increasing cerium concentration can be attributed to decreasing TiO 2 anatase crystallite size (Table 2).As previously demonstrated, the value of the photocatalyst work function can predetermine the photoactivity of the photocatalysts 8,15,18.It was experimentally shown that different Ce loadings in TiO 2 nanoparticles decisively impact the energy of the holes in the valence band and the shift the energy of the electrons in the conduction band, thus directly influencing the CO 2 photoreduction.Figure 4 shows an apparent correlation between the yields of methane and hydrogen after 20 h of irradiation and the work function of individual photocatalysts.There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .This trend is in agreement with our previous results over highly Ce-doped TiO 2 and ZnS/MMT photocatalysts tested in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide 15,18.Thus, the work function measurement appears to be a very helpful experimental guideline for the estimation of the energy shift of the valence and conduction bands of the prepared photocatalysts. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the electron energy in the conduction band must be higher than the H ? reduction potential, whereas the hole energy in the valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.For simplicity, it can be supposed that the Fermi level on the nanoparticle surface is pinned to the middle of nanoparticle band gap 15.Based on the data from Table 1 and Fig. 4, it can be estimated that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -3.256 eV, while the valence band edge is -6.446 eV for pure TiO 2 .For 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 15 meV (CB -3.241eV), while the valence band edge shifts up by 65 meV (VB -6.381eV) (Fig. 5a).Since the pure anatase valence band energy is approximately 500 meV lower than the required oxidation potential of holes, and the hole energy in 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles is sufficient for the oxidation of hydroxyl anions.It can be concluded that for 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles both carriers have sufficient potentials for the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5b).Similarly 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles provide roughly 87 meV decrease in electron energy in the conduction band and 18 meV decrease in hole energy in the valence band with respect to the values of pure anatase.Since the pure TiO 2 has the conduction band energy sufficiently close to the H ? reduction potential, the decrease in electron energy is critical for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .For 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the electron energy in the conduction band decreases slightly below the H ? reduction potential; thus, the photocatalytic performance of such a photocatalyst is decreasing. There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The observed irregular changes in work function upon cerium loading are associated with the strong modification of the electronic properties of the material.The specific electronic characterization of Ce-doped TiO 2 photocatalyst can be challenging due to the complexity of effects.As revealed in the manuscript, the addition of cerium into TiO 2 results in substantial changes in surface area, crystallite size, lattice parameters and optical properties (Tables 1,2).Obviously, this implies modification in the structure, morphology, concentration of defects, mobility of charge carriers, etc.The nonlinear changes in work function with doping are commonly observed when semiconductor systems are involved and are often accounted for the explanation of the catalytic activity, e.g., K-Co-Mn-Al 28, Co-Fe-O 29 and Ce-K-Fe-O 30.The tight relationship between the activity and the work function clearly implied that the electron-donor properties of the catalyst surface gauged by the position of the Fermi level are the primary factor controlling the reaction rate.The work function parameter can also be used for evaluation of photocatalysts where the availability of surface electrons plays a crucial role in surface mediated redox processes 282930. Combining the information about the work function (Fig. 4) with band gap energies for different Ce loadings (Table 1), we can conclude that the best observed Ce loading for the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst is 0.3 mol of Ce.Due to the optimal electron and hole energies, the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst with 0.3 mol of Ce has extraordinary photocatalytic properties. For the photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O, the electron energy in the conduction band and the hole energy in the valence band are sufficient for the triggering of this reaction, as the redox potential of nitrous oxide/nitrogen is 1.77 V.A similar relationship of the photocatalysts activity with the work function as for the reaction yield from CO 2 photocatalytic reduction was also observed in N 2 O conversion at N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition.The lowest measured work function corresponds to the highest value of the N 2 O conversion (Fig. 4c). The doping with various loadings of cerium can influence surface properties of Ce/TiO 2 particularly such as the Fig. 5 Illustration of a the evaluation of energies of electrons and holes in conduction and valence bands from the knowledge of experimentally determined work function and band gap energy for pure TiO 2 and b the shifts of energies of electrons and holes formation in conduction and valence bands in dependence on the Ce amount ratio of Ce 3? /Ce 4? species as well as the presence of surface oxygen species, which can affect the photocatalytic efficiency of the reaction.Wang et al. 16 found that the surface oxygen species on the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite surface can easily capture electrons and that Ce 3? ions could interact with holes and prevent the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher photocatalytic efficiency.In our recent work 15, we have shown that the ratio of present Ce 3? /Ce 4? species is decreasing with the increasing amount of cerium.In our present study of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the photocatalyst efficiency, expressed as kinetic rate constant k, was decreasing in the following sequence: 0.3 mol Ce/ TiO 2 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 C TiO 2 C 0.8 mol Ce/TiO 2 . This tendency can imply the existence of an optimum, narrow range Ce loading for photocatalysts, which corresponds with the ability of the Ce 3?/ Ce 4? redox couple to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, by enabling faster electron transfer along the TiO 2 surface 31323334.In the case of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the retardation of the fast charge recombination by the Ce 3? /Ce 4? redox couple can be the phenomenon responsible for the observed trend in photocatalytic performance of the mentioned Ce/TiO 2 materials. When the Ce content is higher than 0.3 mol of Ce, the blocking of active sites is supposed, leading to the decrease of N 2 O conversion.The effect of the Ce dopant on the N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition has not yet been studied for lower amounts of cerium.However, an optimum amount of Ce is consistent with the results from our previous work dealing with TiO 2 with high amounts of cerium (Ce 0.05 Ti 0.95 O 2 , Ce 0.30 Ti 0.70 O 2 ) 8 which point out that a low Ce loading is recommended for high photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction and N 2 O decomposition."}, {"llm generation": "pure TiO 2", "source": "The doping with various loadings of cerium can influence surface properties of Ce/TiO 2 particularly such as the Fig. 5 Illustration of a the evaluation of energies of electrons and holes in conduction and valence bands from the knowledge of experimentally determined work function and band gap energy for pure TiO 2 and b the shifts of energies of electrons and holes formation in conduction and valence bands in dependence on the Ce amount ratio of Ce 3? /Ce 4? species as well as the presence of surface oxygen species, which can affect the photocatalytic efficiency of the reaction.", "context": "Results of photocatalysts characterization are summarized in Tables 1,2.The specific surface area of Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts rises with the increase of the Ce loading in TiO 2 photocatalysts from 32 m 2 /g up to 99 m 2 /g (Table 1).This effect can be attributed to a decreasing size of the anatase crystallites as a consequence of cerium ion incorporation into the anatase crystal lattice, as can be revealed from the data in Table 2.The observed inhibition effect of cerium doping on the anatase crystallite growth is in agreement with our previous works 15,18, where the refined anatase lattice parameters increased and, consequently, the anatase cell volume expanded.The positive effect of cerium doping on the optical properties of photocatalysts can be also proved; the shift of the spectral response of the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts to the visible light region is evident, and the decrease in the absorption edge of the photocatalysts with cerium loading was detected (Table 1).

The effect of irradiation time on the photochemical and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O was investigated for all Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts for a time period of 0-18 h.The The results of photocatalytic tests (the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O) showed that the amount of cerium doping is a key factor in both photocatalytic reactions and that the specific doping level of 0.3 mol Ce was generally the most effective for the investigated TiO 2 photocatalysts.Photocatalytic reactions are of very complex nature, and the photoactivity of the photocatalysts is affected by several factors such as the surface area and surface properties (chemical composition, crystallite morphology, etc.), the Fermi level and band gap energy, and, most importantly, the energy levels of electrons and holes.The doping of cerium led to a favorable increase in the specific surface area and also to a favorable decrease in the band gap energy (Table 1).The increasing specific surface area with the increasing cerium concentration can be attributed to decreasing TiO 2 anatase crystallite size (Table 2).As previously demonstrated, the value of the photocatalyst work function can predetermine the photoactivity of the photocatalysts 8,15,18.It was experimentally shown that different Ce loadings in TiO 2 nanoparticles decisively impact the energy of the holes in the valence band and the shift the energy of the electrons in the conduction band, thus directly influencing the CO 2 photoreduction.Figure 4 shows an apparent correlation between the yields of methane and hydrogen after 20 h of irradiation and the work function of individual photocatalysts.There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .This trend is in agreement with our previous results over highly Ce-doped TiO 2 and ZnS/MMT photocatalysts tested in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide 15,18.Thus, the work function measurement appears to be a very helpful experimental guideline for the estimation of the energy shift of the valence and conduction bands of the prepared photocatalysts. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the electron energy in the conduction band must be higher than the H ? reduction potential, whereas the hole energy in the valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.For simplicity, it can be supposed that the Fermi level on the nanoparticle surface is pinned to the middle of nanoparticle band gap 15.Based on the data from Table 1 and Fig. 4, it can be estimated that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -3.256 eV, while the valence band edge is -6.446 eV for pure TiO 2 .For 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 15 meV (CB -3.241eV), while the valence band edge shifts up by 65 meV (VB -6.381eV) (Fig. 5a).Since the pure anatase valence band energy is approximately 500 meV lower than the required oxidation potential of holes, and the hole energy in 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles is sufficient for the oxidation of hydroxyl anions.It can be concluded that for 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles both carriers have sufficient potentials for the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5b).Similarly 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles provide roughly 87 meV decrease in electron energy in the conduction band and 18 meV decrease in hole energy in the valence band with respect to the values of pure anatase.Since the pure TiO 2 has the conduction band energy sufficiently close to the H ? reduction potential, the decrease in electron energy is critical for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .For 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the electron energy in the conduction band decreases slightly below the H ? reduction potential; thus, the photocatalytic performance of such a photocatalyst is decreasing. There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The observed irregular changes in work function upon cerium loading are associated with the strong modification of the electronic properties of the material.The specific electronic characterization of Ce-doped TiO 2 photocatalyst can be challenging due to the complexity of effects.As revealed in the manuscript, the addition of cerium into TiO 2 results in substantial changes in surface area, crystallite size, lattice parameters and optical properties (Tables 1,2).Obviously, this implies modification in the structure, morphology, concentration of defects, mobility of charge carriers, etc.The nonlinear changes in work function with doping are commonly observed when semiconductor systems are involved and are often accounted for the explanation of the catalytic activity, e.g., K-Co-Mn-Al 28, Co-Fe-O 29 and Ce-K-Fe-O 30.The tight relationship between the activity and the work function clearly implied that the electron-donor properties of the catalyst surface gauged by the position of the Fermi level are the primary factor controlling the reaction rate.The work function parameter can also be used for evaluation of photocatalysts where the availability of surface electrons plays a crucial role in surface mediated redox processes 282930. Combining the information about the work function (Fig. 4) with band gap energies for different Ce loadings (Table 1), we can conclude that the best observed Ce loading for the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst is 0.3 mol of Ce.Due to the optimal electron and hole energies, the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst with 0.3 mol of Ce has extraordinary photocatalytic properties. For the photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O, the electron energy in the conduction band and the hole energy in the valence band are sufficient for the triggering of this reaction, as the redox potential of nitrous oxide/nitrogen is 1.77 V.A similar relationship of the photocatalysts activity with the work function as for the reaction yield from CO 2 photocatalytic reduction was also observed in N 2 O conversion at N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition.The lowest measured work function corresponds to the highest value of the N 2 O conversion (Fig. 4c). The doping with various loadings of cerium can influence surface properties of Ce/TiO 2 particularly such as the Fig. 5 Illustration of a the evaluation of energies of electrons and holes in conduction and valence bands from the knowledge of experimentally determined work function and band gap energy for pure TiO 2 and b the shifts of energies of electrons and holes formation in conduction and valence bands in dependence on the Ce amount ratio of Ce 3? /Ce 4? species as well as the presence of surface oxygen species, which can affect the photocatalytic efficiency of the reaction.Wang et al. 16 found that the surface oxygen species on the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite surface can easily capture electrons and that Ce 3? ions could interact with holes and prevent the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher photocatalytic efficiency.In our recent work 15, we have shown that the ratio of present Ce 3? /Ce 4? species is decreasing with the increasing amount of cerium.In our present study of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the photocatalyst efficiency, expressed as kinetic rate constant k, was decreasing in the following sequence: 0.3 mol Ce/ TiO 2 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 C TiO 2 C 0.8 mol Ce/TiO 2 . This tendency can imply the existence of an optimum, narrow range Ce loading for photocatalysts, which corresponds with the ability of the Ce 3?/ Ce 4? redox couple to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, by enabling faster electron transfer along the TiO 2 surface 31323334.In the case of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the retardation of the fast charge recombination by the Ce 3? /Ce 4? redox couple can be the phenomenon responsible for the observed trend in photocatalytic performance of the mentioned Ce/TiO 2 materials. When the Ce content is higher than 0.3 mol of Ce, the blocking of active sites is supposed, leading to the decrease of N 2 O conversion.The effect of the Ce dopant on the N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition has not yet been studied for lower amounts of cerium.However, an optimum amount of Ce is consistent with the results from our previous work dealing with TiO 2 with high amounts of cerium (Ce 0.05 Ti 0.95 O 2 , Ce 0.30 Ti 0.70 O 2 ) 8 which point out that a low Ce loading is recommended for high photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction and N 2 O decomposition."}, {"llm generation": "0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2", "source": "In our present study of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the photocatalyst efficiency, expressed as kinetic rate constant k, was decreasing in the following sequence: 0.3 mol Ce/ TiO 2 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 C TiO 2 C 0.8 mol Ce/TiO 2 .", "context": "Results of photocatalysts characterization are summarized in Tables 1,2.The specific surface area of Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts rises with the increase of the Ce loading in TiO 2 photocatalysts from 32 m 2 /g up to 99 m 2 /g (Table 1).This effect can be attributed to a decreasing size of the anatase crystallites as a consequence of cerium ion incorporation into the anatase crystal lattice, as can be revealed from the data in Table 2.The observed inhibition effect of cerium doping on the anatase crystallite growth is in agreement with our previous works 15,18, where the refined anatase lattice parameters increased and, consequently, the anatase cell volume expanded.The positive effect of cerium doping on the optical properties of photocatalysts can be also proved; the shift of the spectral response of the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts to the visible light region is evident, and the decrease in the absorption edge of the photocatalysts with cerium loading was detected (Table 1).

The effect of irradiation time on the photochemical and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O was investigated for all Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts for a time period of 0-18 h.The The results of photocatalytic tests (the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O) showed that the amount of cerium doping is a key factor in both photocatalytic reactions and that the specific doping level of 0.3 mol Ce was generally the most effective for the investigated TiO 2 photocatalysts.Photocatalytic reactions are of very complex nature, and the photoactivity of the photocatalysts is affected by several factors such as the surface area and surface properties (chemical composition, crystallite morphology, etc.), the Fermi level and band gap energy, and, most importantly, the energy levels of electrons and holes.The doping of cerium led to a favorable increase in the specific surface area and also to a favorable decrease in the band gap energy (Table 1).The increasing specific surface area with the increasing cerium concentration can be attributed to decreasing TiO 2 anatase crystallite size (Table 2).As previously demonstrated, the value of the photocatalyst work function can predetermine the photoactivity of the photocatalysts 8,15,18.It was experimentally shown that different Ce loadings in TiO 2 nanoparticles decisively impact the energy of the holes in the valence band and the shift the energy of the electrons in the conduction band, thus directly influencing the CO 2 photoreduction.Figure 4 shows an apparent correlation between the yields of methane and hydrogen after 20 h of irradiation and the work function of individual photocatalysts.There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .This trend is in agreement with our previous results over highly Ce-doped TiO 2 and ZnS/MMT photocatalysts tested in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide 15,18.Thus, the work function measurement appears to be a very helpful experimental guideline for the estimation of the energy shift of the valence and conduction bands of the prepared photocatalysts. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the electron energy in the conduction band must be higher than the H ? reduction potential, whereas the hole energy in the valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.For simplicity, it can be supposed that the Fermi level on the nanoparticle surface is pinned to the middle of nanoparticle band gap 15.Based on the data from Table 1 and Fig. 4, it can be estimated that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -3.256 eV, while the valence band edge is -6.446 eV for pure TiO 2 .For 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 15 meV (CB -3.241eV), while the valence band edge shifts up by 65 meV (VB -6.381eV) (Fig. 5a).Since the pure anatase valence band energy is approximately 500 meV lower than the required oxidation potential of holes, and the hole energy in 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles is sufficient for the oxidation of hydroxyl anions.It can be concluded that for 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles both carriers have sufficient potentials for the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5b).Similarly 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles provide roughly 87 meV decrease in electron energy in the conduction band and 18 meV decrease in hole energy in the valence band with respect to the values of pure anatase.Since the pure TiO 2 has the conduction band energy sufficiently close to the H ? reduction potential, the decrease in electron energy is critical for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .For 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the electron energy in the conduction band decreases slightly below the H ? reduction potential; thus, the photocatalytic performance of such a photocatalyst is decreasing. There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The observed irregular changes in work function upon cerium loading are associated with the strong modification of the electronic properties of the material.The specific electronic characterization of Ce-doped TiO 2 photocatalyst can be challenging due to the complexity of effects.As revealed in the manuscript, the addition of cerium into TiO 2 results in substantial changes in surface area, crystallite size, lattice parameters and optical properties (Tables 1,2).Obviously, this implies modification in the structure, morphology, concentration of defects, mobility of charge carriers, etc.The nonlinear changes in work function with doping are commonly observed when semiconductor systems are involved and are often accounted for the explanation of the catalytic activity, e.g., K-Co-Mn-Al 28, Co-Fe-O 29 and Ce-K-Fe-O 30.The tight relationship between the activity and the work function clearly implied that the electron-donor properties of the catalyst surface gauged by the position of the Fermi level are the primary factor controlling the reaction rate.The work function parameter can also be used for evaluation of photocatalysts where the availability of surface electrons plays a crucial role in surface mediated redox processes 282930. Combining the information about the work function (Fig. 4) with band gap energies for different Ce loadings (Table 1), we can conclude that the best observed Ce loading for the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst is 0.3 mol of Ce.Due to the optimal electron and hole energies, the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst with 0.3 mol of Ce has extraordinary photocatalytic properties. For the photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O, the electron energy in the conduction band and the hole energy in the valence band are sufficient for the triggering of this reaction, as the redox potential of nitrous oxide/nitrogen is 1.77 V.A similar relationship of the photocatalysts activity with the work function as for the reaction yield from CO 2 photocatalytic reduction was also observed in N 2 O conversion at N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition.The lowest measured work function corresponds to the highest value of the N 2 O conversion (Fig. 4c). The doping with various loadings of cerium can influence surface properties of Ce/TiO 2 particularly such as the Fig. 5 Illustration of a the evaluation of energies of electrons and holes in conduction and valence bands from the knowledge of experimentally determined work function and band gap energy for pure TiO 2 and b the shifts of energies of electrons and holes formation in conduction and valence bands in dependence on the Ce amount ratio of Ce 3? /Ce 4? species as well as the presence of surface oxygen species, which can affect the photocatalytic efficiency of the reaction.Wang et al. 16 found that the surface oxygen species on the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite surface can easily capture electrons and that Ce 3? ions could interact with holes and prevent the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher photocatalytic efficiency.In our recent work 15, we have shown that the ratio of present Ce 3? /Ce 4? species is decreasing with the increasing amount of cerium.In our present study of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the photocatalyst efficiency, expressed as kinetic rate constant k, was decreasing in the following sequence: 0.3 mol Ce/ TiO 2 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 C TiO 2 C 0.8 mol Ce/TiO 2 . This tendency can imply the existence of an optimum, narrow range Ce loading for photocatalysts, which corresponds with the ability of the Ce 3?/ Ce 4? redox couple to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, by enabling faster electron transfer along the TiO 2 surface 31323334.In the case of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the retardation of the fast charge recombination by the Ce 3? /Ce 4? redox couple can be the phenomenon responsible for the observed trend in photocatalytic performance of the mentioned Ce/TiO 2 materials. When the Ce content is higher than 0.3 mol of Ce, the blocking of active sites is supposed, leading to the decrease of N 2 O conversion.The effect of the Ce dopant on the N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition has not yet been studied for lower amounts of cerium.However, an optimum amount of Ce is consistent with the results from our previous work dealing with TiO 2 with high amounts of cerium (Ce 0.05 Ti 0.95 O 2 , Ce 0.30 Ti 0.70 O 2 ) 8 which point out that a low Ce loading is recommended for high photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction and N 2 O decomposition."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2", "source": "This tendency can imply the existence of an optimum, narrow range Ce loading for photocatalysts, which corresponds with the ability of the Ce 3?/ Ce 4? redox couple to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, by enabling faster electron transfer along the TiO 2 surface 31323334.", "context": "Results of photocatalysts characterization are summarized in Tables 1,2.The specific surface area of Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts rises with the increase of the Ce loading in TiO 2 photocatalysts from 32 m 2 /g up to 99 m 2 /g (Table 1).This effect can be attributed to a decreasing size of the anatase crystallites as a consequence of cerium ion incorporation into the anatase crystal lattice, as can be revealed from the data in Table 2.The observed inhibition effect of cerium doping on the anatase crystallite growth is in agreement with our previous works 15,18, where the refined anatase lattice parameters increased and, consequently, the anatase cell volume expanded.The positive effect of cerium doping on the optical properties of photocatalysts can be also proved; the shift of the spectral response of the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts to the visible light region is evident, and the decrease in the absorption edge of the photocatalysts with cerium loading was detected (Table 1).

The effect of irradiation time on the photochemical and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O was investigated for all Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts for a time period of 0-18 h.The The results of photocatalytic tests (the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O) showed that the amount of cerium doping is a key factor in both photocatalytic reactions and that the specific doping level of 0.3 mol Ce was generally the most effective for the investigated TiO 2 photocatalysts.Photocatalytic reactions are of very complex nature, and the photoactivity of the photocatalysts is affected by several factors such as the surface area and surface properties (chemical composition, crystallite morphology, etc.), the Fermi level and band gap energy, and, most importantly, the energy levels of electrons and holes.The doping of cerium led to a favorable increase in the specific surface area and also to a favorable decrease in the band gap energy (Table 1).The increasing specific surface area with the increasing cerium concentration can be attributed to decreasing TiO 2 anatase crystallite size (Table 2).As previously demonstrated, the value of the photocatalyst work function can predetermine the photoactivity of the photocatalysts 8,15,18.It was experimentally shown that different Ce loadings in TiO 2 nanoparticles decisively impact the energy of the holes in the valence band and the shift the energy of the electrons in the conduction band, thus directly influencing the CO 2 photoreduction.Figure 4 shows an apparent correlation between the yields of methane and hydrogen after 20 h of irradiation and the work function of individual photocatalysts.There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .This trend is in agreement with our previous results over highly Ce-doped TiO 2 and ZnS/MMT photocatalysts tested in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide 15,18.Thus, the work function measurement appears to be a very helpful experimental guideline for the estimation of the energy shift of the valence and conduction bands of the prepared photocatalysts. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the electron energy in the conduction band must be higher than the H ? reduction potential, whereas the hole energy in the valence band must be lower than OH -oxidation potentials.For simplicity, it can be supposed that the Fermi level on the nanoparticle surface is pinned to the middle of nanoparticle band gap 15.Based on the data from Table 1 and Fig. 4, it can be estimated that the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge is -3.256 eV, while the valence band edge is -6.446 eV for pure TiO 2 .For 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the energy of electrons on the conduction band edge increases about approximately 15 meV (CB -3.241eV), while the valence band edge shifts up by 65 meV (VB -6.381eV) (Fig. 5a).Since the pure anatase valence band energy is approximately 500 meV lower than the required oxidation potential of holes, and the hole energy in 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles is sufficient for the oxidation of hydroxyl anions.It can be concluded that for 0.3 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles both carriers have sufficient potentials for the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5b).Similarly 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles provide roughly 87 meV decrease in electron energy in the conduction band and 18 meV decrease in hole energy in the valence band with respect to the values of pure anatase.Since the pure TiO 2 has the conduction band energy sufficiently close to the H ? reduction potential, the decrease in electron energy is critical for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .For 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles, the electron energy in the conduction band decreases slightly below the H ? reduction potential; thus, the photocatalytic performance of such a photocatalyst is decreasing. There is an optimal value (the lowest) of work function which correlates with the highest yields of both products formed during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The observed irregular changes in work function upon cerium loading are associated with the strong modification of the electronic properties of the material.The specific electronic characterization of Ce-doped TiO 2 photocatalyst can be challenging due to the complexity of effects.As revealed in the manuscript, the addition of cerium into TiO 2 results in substantial changes in surface area, crystallite size, lattice parameters and optical properties (Tables 1,2).Obviously, this implies modification in the structure, morphology, concentration of defects, mobility of charge carriers, etc.The nonlinear changes in work function with doping are commonly observed when semiconductor systems are involved and are often accounted for the explanation of the catalytic activity, e.g., K-Co-Mn-Al 28, Co-Fe-O 29 and Ce-K-Fe-O 30.The tight relationship between the activity and the work function clearly implied that the electron-donor properties of the catalyst surface gauged by the position of the Fermi level are the primary factor controlling the reaction rate.The work function parameter can also be used for evaluation of photocatalysts where the availability of surface electrons plays a crucial role in surface mediated redox processes 282930. Combining the information about the work function (Fig. 4) with band gap energies for different Ce loadings (Table 1), we can conclude that the best observed Ce loading for the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst is 0.3 mol of Ce.Due to the optimal electron and hole energies, the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalyst with 0.3 mol of Ce has extraordinary photocatalytic properties. For the photocatalytic decomposition of N 2 O, the electron energy in the conduction band and the hole energy in the valence band are sufficient for the triggering of this reaction, as the redox potential of nitrous oxide/nitrogen is 1.77 V.A similar relationship of the photocatalysts activity with the work function as for the reaction yield from CO 2 photocatalytic reduction was also observed in N 2 O conversion at N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition.The lowest measured work function corresponds to the highest value of the N 2 O conversion (Fig. 4c). The doping with various loadings of cerium can influence surface properties of Ce/TiO 2 particularly such as the Fig. 5 Illustration of a the evaluation of energies of electrons and holes in conduction and valence bands from the knowledge of experimentally determined work function and band gap energy for pure TiO 2 and b the shifts of energies of electrons and holes formation in conduction and valence bands in dependence on the Ce amount ratio of Ce 3? /Ce 4? species as well as the presence of surface oxygen species, which can affect the photocatalytic efficiency of the reaction.Wang et al. 16 found that the surface oxygen species on the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite surface can easily capture electrons and that Ce 3? ions could interact with holes and prevent the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher photocatalytic efficiency.In our recent work 15, we have shown that the ratio of present Ce 3? /Ce 4? species is decreasing with the increasing amount of cerium.In our present study of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the photocatalyst efficiency, expressed as kinetic rate constant k, was decreasing in the following sequence: 0.3 mol Ce/ TiO 2 0.5 mol Ce/TiO 2 C TiO 2 C 0.8 mol Ce/TiO 2 . This tendency can imply the existence of an optimum, narrow range Ce loading for photocatalysts, which corresponds with the ability of the Ce 3?/ Ce 4? redox couple to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, by enabling faster electron transfer along the TiO 2 surface 31323334.In the case of N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition, the retardation of the fast charge recombination by the Ce 3? /Ce 4? redox couple can be the phenomenon responsible for the observed trend in photocatalytic performance of the mentioned Ce/TiO 2 materials. When the Ce content is higher than 0.3 mol of Ce, the blocking of active sites is supposed, leading to the decrease of N 2 O conversion.The effect of the Ce dopant on the N 2 O photocatalytic decomposition has not yet been studied for lower amounts of cerium.However, an optimum amount of Ce is consistent with the results from our previous work dealing with TiO 2 with high amounts of cerium (Ce 0.05 Ti 0.95 O 2 , Ce 0.30 Ti 0.70 O 2 ) 8 which point out that a low Ce loading is recommended for high photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction and N 2 O decomposition."}, {"llm generation": "Ce 0.30 Ti 0.70 O 2", "source": "However, an optimum amount of Ce is consistent with the results from our previous work dealing with TiO 2 with high amounts of cerium (Ce 0.05 Ti 0.95 O 2 , Ce 0.30 Ti 0.70 O 2 ) 8 which point out that a low Ce loading is recommended for high photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction and N 2 O decomposition.", "context": "Results of photocatalysts characterization are summarized in Tables 1,2.The specific surface area of Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts rises with the increase of the Ce loading in TiO 2 photocatalysts from 32 m 2 /g up to 99 m 2 /g (Table 1).This effect can be attributed to a decreasing size of the anatase crystallites as a consequence of cerium ion incorporation into the anatase crystal lattice, as can be revealed from the data in Table 2.The observed inhibition effect of cerium doping on the anatase crystallite growth is in agreement with our previous works 15,18, where the refined anatase lattice parameters increased and, consequently, the anatase cell volume expanded.The positive effect of cerium doping on the optical properties of photocatalysts can be also proved; the shift of the spectral response of the Ce/TiO 2 photocatalysts to the visible light region is evident, and the decrease in the absorption edge of the photocatalysts with cerium loading was detected (Table 1). Figure 1 shows the dependence of the absorption edge (1) and specific surface area (2) as a function of the Ce loading.It shows that the small Ce amount (to 0.8 mol) results in a steep linear decrease in the absorption edge from 3.19 eV (for TiO 2 ) to 2.97 eV (for 0.8 mol of Ce in TiO 2 ).This decrease in the absorption edge continues up to 3 mol of Ce.With further increasing the Ce loading, the absorption edge slowly stabilizes at approximately 2.64 eV for 10 mol of Ce 15.The specific surface area increases rapidly with small Ce loadings (to 0.8 mol) and reaches a maximum for 3 mol of Ce.Further Ce addition causes a slow decrease 15.
