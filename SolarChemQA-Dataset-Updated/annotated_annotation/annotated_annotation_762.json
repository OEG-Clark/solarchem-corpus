In order to further determine the composition of the sample, the FT-IR spectra of the samples were measured.As seen from Fig. 2, the absorption bands of g-C 3 N 4 in the range of 9001200 cm -1 , 810 cm -1 and 30003420 cm -1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of C-N, CN or outside the C-N heterocycle, the bending vibration characteristic peaks of the triazine unit, and the stretching vibration of -NH/-NH 2 groups on the broken aromatic ring of g-C 3 N 4 edge or the stretching vibration of water molecules adsorbed on the surface, respectively 40 semiconductors can be calculated by the plots of (hv) 1/2 versus (hv) (Fig. 5b) 43. Considering that both g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) are indirect-band-gap semiconductors, the E g of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) is estimated to be 2.71 eV and 2.87 eV, respectively, in consistent with the literatures 44,45.From our previous work, the E CB of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) was separately determined to be -1.27eV and 0.41 eV by Mott-Schottky method 46,47.According to the band gap from DRS, the E VB of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) is 1.44 eV and 3.28 eV, respectively. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of as-prepared samples was investigated under simulated solar light irradiation in a gas-solid reaction system, and the reductive products were detected by gas chromatography (GC).As seen from Fig. 6a-d, the controlled experiments demonstrated that the as-produced CO can be neglected when the photoreactions were conducted without photocatalysts or in the darkness.However, a slight amount of CO was produced under the Ar atmosphere, which should be ascribed to the organics attached on the surface of materials.The actual CO production rate for all the samples was determined combined with the results from controlled experiments.The CO generation rate of g-C 3 N 4 is 2.19 molg -1 h -1 , and that of Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) is 0.21 molg -1 h -1 , indicating that it almost cannot reduce CO 2 .Compared with pure Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) and g-C 3 N 4 , the CNBB-2, CNBB-3 and CNBB-4 composites all display improved CO 2 photoreduction performance, while CNBB-1 has a lower activity than g-C 3 N 4 , but higher than Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH).The highest CO generation rate obtained for CNBB-3 was determined to be approximately 6.09 molg -1 h -1 , which is 2.78 times that of g-C 3 N 4 . For comparison, the mechanically-mixed g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) with mass ratio of 1:1 was synthesized, and named as CNBB-3-MM.As seen from Fig. 6c, CNBB-3-MM shows an apparently lower CO 2 reduction activity than CNBB-3, indicating that the ball-milling process allows an intimate interface interaction between Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) and g-C 3 N 4 , and thus CNBB-3 exhibits more efficient photocatalytic performance. It is well known that the photocatalytic activity of materials is mainly dominated by the separation and transfer efficiencies of photoelectron-hole pairs in addition to light absorbing ability.The transient photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and fluorescence decay curve were used to investigate the separation, transfer and recombination rates of the photocatalysts.In Fig. 7a, the photocurrent of all samples is rapidly generated with the light turning on and the g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) composites show higher intensities than the pure Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) and g-C 3 N 4 .The CNBB-3 composite photocatalyst has the strongest photocurrent intensity in all the samples, indicating the highest charge separation efficiency 48.Fig. 7b shows the Nyquist plots of Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH), g-C 3 N 4 and CNBB-3.Obviously, the arc radius of the CNBB-3 curve is smaller than that of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH).It is reported that a smaller radius of the arc indicates a higher efficiency of interfacial photo-charge transfer 49.The electrons and holes in the quasi-equilibrium state emit light through recombination to form a difference spectrum of intensity or energy distribution of wavelength light 50.PL spectroscopy is an effective means for evaluating the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes in photocatalysts.A lower PL intensity indicates a lower recombination rate of the carriers, which is more favorable for the carriers to participate in the photocatalytic reaction.and photogenerated electrons in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 1617181920.This process effectively inhibits the recombination of the photoexcited electrons and holes 38 In addition, the electrons in CB of g-C 3 N 4 has a stronger reductive ability, and the holes in VB of"}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by a Hitachi F4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer made in Japan, using a 150W Xe lamp at 400 V as the excitation lamp ( ex 260 nm ) .", "context": "All the raw materials here are analytically pure and used without further purification.

Considering that both g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) are indirect-band-gap semiconductors, the E g of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) is estimated to be 2.71 eV and 2.87 eV, respectively, in consistent with the literatures 44,45.From our previous work, the E CB of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) was separately determined to be -1.27eV and 0.41 eV by Mott-Schottky method 46,47.According to the band gap from DRS, the E VB of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) is 1.44 eV and 3.28 eV, respectively.

For comparison, the mechanically-mixed g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) with mass ratio of 1:1 was synthesized, and named as CNBB-3-MM.As seen from Fig. 6c, CNBB-3-MM shows an apparently lower CO 2 reduction activity than CNBB-3, indicating that the ball-milling process allows an intimate interface interaction between Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) and g-C 3 N 4 , and thus CNBB-3 exhibits more efficient photocatalytic performance. It is well known that the photocatalytic activity of materials is mainly dominated by the separation and transfer efficiencies of photoelectron-hole pairs in addition to light absorbing ability.The transient photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and fluorescence decay curve were used to investigate the separation, transfer and recombination rates of the photocatalysts.In Fig. 7a, the photocurrent of all samples is rapidly generated with the light turning on and the g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) composites show higher intensities than the pure Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) and g-C 3 N 4 .The CNBB-3 composite photocatalyst has the strongest photocurrent intensity in all the samples, indicating the highest charge separation efficiency 48.Fig. 7b shows the Nyquist plots of Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH), g-C 3 N 4 and CNBB-3.Obviously, the arc radius of the CNBB-3 curve is smaller than that of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH).It is reported that a smaller radius of the arc indicates a higher efficiency of interfacial photo-charge transfer 49.The electrons and holes in the quasi-equilibrium state emit light through recombination to form a difference spectrum of intensity or energy distribution of wavelength light 50.PL spectroscopy is an effective means for evaluating the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes in photocatalysts.A lower PL intensity indicates a lower recombination rate of the carriers, which is more favorable for the carriers to participate in the photocatalytic reaction.and photogenerated electrons in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 1617181920.This process effectively inhibits the recombination of the photoexcited electrons and holes 38 In addition, the electrons in CB of g-C 3 N 4 has a stronger reductive ability, and the holes in VB of"}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "The experiment of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was conducted in a Pyrex vacuumed sealed glass reactor (Figure S1).", "context": "All the raw materials here are analytically pure and used without further purification.

The synthesis process for Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) was shown in the following.First, 0.979 g of Bi(NO 3 )5H 2 O and 0.989 g of H 3 BO 3 were separately dissolved into 20 mL deionized water, and stirred for 30 minutes to achieve an even solution.Then the H 3 BO 3 solution was dropwise added into the Bi(NO 3 )5H 2 O solution, and the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 7.5 by sodium hydroxide.It was then transferred to a hydrothermal autoclave of PTFE, and reacted in an oven at 180 C for 12 hours. After cooling naturally to room temperature, the samples were washed by deionized water and ethanol for three times, and finally they were dried in an oven for 6 hours at 60 C 36. The g-C 3 N 4 /Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) composites were prepared by a high-energy wet ball-milling method 38.The above as-obtained Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) and g-C 3 N 4 with different mass ratios (6:1, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3) were dissolved in 10 mL deionized water, and then added into ball mill tanks.Then, they are milled with a rotating speed of 560 rpm for 5 h.The obtained samples were washed with deionized water for 6 times, and dried for 6 hours at 60 C.The final composite materials with the g-C 3 N 4 : Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) mass ratios of 6:1, 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3 were named as CNBB-1, CNBB-2, CNBB-3 and CNBB-4, respectively.In addition, mechanically-mixed g- sample with mass ratio of 1:1 was prepared only by simply mixing and named as CNBB-3-MM. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was applied for the crystalline structure analysis on a Bruker D8 focus Advance diffractometer (Cu K radiation, 40 kV/40 mA).The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded by a Bruker spectrometer in the frequency range of 4000-450 cm -1 .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PerkinElmer PHI 5000C) was used for testing the surface element of samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the general morphology of the photocatalysts on a Hitachi S4800 (Japan) instrument in Japan.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and EDX-mapping were used to characterize the morphology and element distribution of samples.UV-diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained from the Varian Cary5000 UV-vis spectrophotometer and recorded with an integrator sphere.The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by a Hitachi F4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer made in Japan, using a 150W Xe lamp at 400 V as the excitation lamp ( ex 260 nm ) .The time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra were recorded by transient steady-state fluorescence spectrometer (FLS 980). The reactive oxygen species were detected by JES-FA200 ESR spectrometer (Japan). The experiment of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was conducted in a Pyrex vacuumed sealed glass reactor (Figure S1).First, 20 mg of sample and 2 mL of deionized water were added into a glass petri dish under ultrasound treatment for 10 min, and then were put in an oven at 60 C for 6 hours.Secondly, the dish was placed on a tripod in the photoreactor containing 1.7 g of Na 2 CO 3 at the bottom.Thirdly, the reactor was sealed with vacuum grease and vacuumed by air pump.Fourthly, 15mL of H 2 SO 4 (0.1mol/L) was injected into the reactor to react with the Na 2 CO 3 , and meantime the glass reactor was illuminated by a 300 W Xe lamp providing simulated sunlight.At every one hour, 3 mL of gas in the reactor was sampled and analyzed by a Gas Chromatograph (GC7806, Perfect Light, China). The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out by a standard three electrode system with using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Chenhua Instruments Co., China).In the three electrode system, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution as the electrolyte solution.The working electrode was prepared as following: 10 mg of powder sample was dissolved into 1m of ethanol and coated on a ITO film (2 cm4 cm), and dried at room temperature.The photocurrent (PC) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured with irradiation of a 300W Xe lamp.32.9 and 41.8 are assigned to the (020), (-111), (-131), ( 130) and (041) crystal planes, respectively 39.XRD patterns of g-C 3 N 4 and Bi 2 O 2 BO 2 (OH) are in good consistence with the previously reported results.For the series of"}]}}
