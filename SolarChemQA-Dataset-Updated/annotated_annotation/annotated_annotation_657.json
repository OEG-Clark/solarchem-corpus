The CeO 2 /ZnIn 2 S 4 composites were prepared by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment.In a typical fabrication procedure, ZnCl 2 (136.3 mg), InCl 3 4H 2 O (586.6 mg), and thioacetamide (TAA, 601.0 mg) were dissolved in 27 mL ethanol solution (V ethanol :V water 1:2), then various amount of the prepared CeO 2 (4.3, 21.2, 29.7, 42.3, and 84.6 mg) was added into the solution.After stirred and sonicated for 30 min, the homogeneous mixture was moved into a Teflon liner (50 mL) and kept at 180 C for 2 h under a microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment.After being cooled down to the ambient temperature, a yellow precipitate was obtained by the way of filtration and rinsed by distilled water and absolute ethanol for several times to make the pH value of filtrate be around 7. At last, the product was desiccated at 70 C for 2 h in a vacuum oven.The obtained samples were denoted as CZx (x 1, 5, 7, 10, and 20, respectively), where x represented the theoretical mass percentage of CeO 2 to ZnIn 2 S 4 .For comparison, pure ZnIn 2 S 4 was synthesized with a same approach in the absence of CeO 2 cubes, named as ZIS. All of the prepared photocatalysts were degassed at 150 C for 6 h prior to the measurements.Specifically, a Xe lamp (300 W, XD 350, CHINA) equipped with an UV-cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was exploited as the visible-light source.The degassed samples (100 mg) and NaHCO 3 (84 mg) were individually added into a two-neck Pyrex reactor possessing two parallel planes, which was sealed by a rubber stopper.Later, the reaction system was purified using N 2 for one hour to totally eliminate air.H 2 SO 4 was carefully immitted into the special groove on one neck of the reactor to react with NaHCO 3 , so that CO 2 was in-situ generated in this closed system.The resulting gas (1 mL) was injected by the syringe, and then detected and analyzed in virtue of gas chromatography (GC-14C, SHIMADZU, JAPAN) at an interval of one-hour irradiation."}, {"llm generation": "visible-light irradiation (420 nm)", "source": "Firstly, electrons were photoexcited from the VB to the CB of the ZIS semiconductor under visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm), while the electrons in the VB of CeO2 could not be photoexcited due to the wide bandgap.", "context": "3.1.Phase structure X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were analyzed to determine the crystallographic structure of synthesized photocatalysts.From the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1a, spiculate peaks of the pure CeO 2 can be observed at 28.6, 33.2, 47.6, and 56.4, respectively indexed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) facets of CeO 2 with a cerianite phase (JCPDS, No. 34-0394) 48.In the XRD pattern of bare ZIS, the diffraction peaks located at 27.7, 30.5, and 47.2are respectively ascribed to (1 0 2), (1 0 4), and (1 1 0) facets of the hexagonal-phase ZIS (JCPDS, No. 65-2023) 40.In the composites, when the mass fraction of CeO 2 was less than 10 wt, the XRD peaks of CeO 2 were not observed obviously.With the augment of the CeO 2 loading amount, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of CeO 2 increased, which can be clearly viewed from partial-amplificatory XRD pattern of its (1 1 1) facet (Fig. 1b).In addition, the characterized peaks of CeO 2 in the composites exhibited an evident skewing to the lower angle.It suggests that a robust interaction was formed between CeO 2 and ZIS.These results preliminarily demonstrated the fact that CeO 2 /ZnIn 2 S 4 composite photocatalysts were well fabricated as expected. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded to directly observe the morphologies of CeO 2 and ZIS and their interposition relationships in the composites.Fig. 2a shows that CeO 2 possesses a cubic morphology with the size ranging from 50 to 500 nm, whilst Fig. S1a shows that ZIS adopts a 3D hierarchical flower-like structure assembled by 2D nanosheets with several micrometers in diameters.In the CZ5 sample, CeO 2 nanocubes gleamingly interspersed in the ZIS microspheres (Fig. 2b), and further observation tells that the ZIS nanosheets were tightly contacted with the CeO 2 nanocubes (Fig. 2c).Furthermore, TEM image of CZ5 exhibited a similar morphology with that in the SEM image (Fig. 2d), and the corresponding high-resolution TEM image displayed the interplanar spacing of 0.327, 0.286, and 0.317 nm (Fig. 2e), referring to the (1 0 4) facets of the hexagonal ZIS 40, (2 0 0) and (1 1 1) facets of cerianite CeO 2 56, respectively.The electron microscopy images visually indicated an intimate interfacial contact between CeO 2 and ZIS in the CZ5 sample.Nevertheless, with the excessive introduction of CeO 2 in the composites (CZ20 for example), the stack of CeO 2 cubes devastated the 3D hierarchical flowerlike morphology of ZIS (Fig. S1b).It was considered that the devastation of 3D morphology might decrease the specific surface area, leading to a lower photocatalytic performance 57. It is commonly acknowledged that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (S BET ) plays an imperative role in the photocatalytic performance of catalysts 11.The photocatalyst with a large surface area could not merely benefit in the adsorption of more reactive molecules, but also provide more active sites for photocatalysis reactions.In order to confirm the effect of CeO 2 loading amount on the S BET of the composites, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the fabricated samples were recorded as shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S2.Firstly, it can be observed that the adsorption-desorption isotherms of bare CeO 2 and ZIS are totally different.In the light of the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification 58, the adsorption-desorption isotherm of the ZIS are type IV, and the shape of its hysteresis loop in a relative pressure ranging from 0.45 to 1.0 is attributed to H3 type, indicating the presence of slit-like pores generated from the aggregation of nanosheets.The corresponding pore size is distributed from 2 to 100 nm as demonstrated in Fig. 3b, corroborating the presence of mesopores and macropores in the nanosheet-assembled ZIS microspheres 40, in step with the results of Fig. 3a.However, for the bare CeO 2 , there is nearly no hysteresis loop in the adsorption-desorption isotherm and negligible peak in the pore size distribution curve, and the relevant pore volume and S BET are much smaller than those of the ZIS (Table 1).It is not unexpected because the CeO 2 owns the morphology of stacked nanocubes, which have glazed surface without any pores and gaps (Fig. 2a). When the CeO 2 nanocubes were incorporated into the ZIS microspheres, the isotherm shape of the composites remained the same with that of ZIS.As is summarized in Table 1, the introduction of a small amount of CeO 2 into the ZIS enlarged its surface area, and reached the largest in the CZ5 sample, while excessive CeO 2 has the opposite effect, for which excessive CeO 2 is likely to destruct the 3D hierarchical flower-like spherical structure of ZIS.This results are consistent with the FESEM images (Fig. 2a-c and Fig. S1b).Such hierarchical structure can provide larger surface area to accommodate more active sites and be rather beneficial to the diffusion of reactants and products 59.These consequences suggest that the surface area may be a significant influential factor for the photocatalytic performance of composites. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the CeO 2 , ZIS, and CZ5 samples were performed to further investigate the interaction between CeO 2 and ZIS.As is shown in Fig. 4a, the signals of O, Ce, S, In, and Zn elements were observed in the CZ5 composites.An evident peak located at 285.0 eV can be indexed to adventitious carbon stemming from the atmospheric CO 2 or the XPS instrument 60.In addition, comparisons of high-resolution XPS spectra of Ce 3d, O 1s, and S 2p in the CeO 2 , CZ5, and ZIS samples were demonstrated in Fig. 4b-d.According to the Fig. 4b, the Ce 3d peak of CeO 2 could be fitted into eight peaks, consisting of two kinds of spin-orbit lines, named as U and V 31,48.Ce 3d 3/2 spin-orbit components are assigned to U lines, which include three typical peaks flagged as u (899.4 eV), u'' (905.7 eV) and u''' (915.1 eV), respectively.Ce 3d 5/2 spin-orbit components were classified to V lines, containing the other peaks, which were separately denoted as v (880.8 eV), v'' (887.5 eV) and v''' (896.8 eV).Those abovementioned six peaks all belong to Ce 4 .The residual two peaks located at 902.1 and 884.0 eV are respectively labeled as u' and v', which are attributed to the Ce 3 species, indicating the existence of oxygen vacancy on the CeO 2 surface 61.Further evidence came from the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) result of the CeO 2 (see Fig. S3).The EPR signal at g 2.004 demonstrated that the electrons trapped on oxygen vacancies on the CeO 2 surface 62.For the CZ5 sample, the XPS signal of Ce was very weak.It is not strange because the loading amount of CeO 2 was very low, and the CeO 2 cubes were partly wrapped by the ZIS nanosheets as observed in SEM image (Fig. 2c).From Fig. 4c, the O 1s spectrum of CeO 2 could be divided into two sub-peaks, originating from the coexisted lattice oxygen (529.0 eV) and adsorbed oxygen from hydroxyl groups (531.8 eV) in CeO 2 48.In Fig. 4d, the characteristic peaks located at 161.7 eV and 162.9 eV are assigned to the S 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 peaks in bare ZIS 63.However, when CeO 2 nanocubes were incorporated into ZIS, the lattice oxygen peak of CeO 2 shifted to a lower binding energy, while the S 2p peaks of ZIS shifted to a higher binding energy, indicating a robust interfacial contact between CeO 2 and ZIS.The tight combination of two semiconductors can validly facilitate the transportation and separation of photoinduced charge carriers during the photocatalysis process. On the basis of above information, a rational mechanism was proposed to uncover the formation process of the CeO 2 /ZIS composites.Firstly, in the precursor solution, TAA molecules preferred to be attached to the oxygen vacancy on the surface of CeO 2 since sulfur atoms have similar chemical properties with oxygen atoms 52.Then, in the microwave-assisted hydrothermal process, TAA molecules were thermally decomposed and slowly released S 2-.Therefore, there will be a concentration gradient of S 2-from the surface of CeO 2 to the bulk of the solution.The Zn 2 and In 3 in the precursor solution on one hand integrated with S 2-on the surface of CeO 2 to form ZIS crystals and insitu grew to be nanosheets, and on the other hand reacted with S 2-in the solution to formed ZIS nanosheets.As the reaction proceeded, CeO 2 nanocubes would be contacted with ZIS nanosheets, whilst ZIS nanosheets in the solution were further assembled into flower-like microspheres. It is expected that the close contact between CeO 2 and ZIS is beneficial to the migration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers over the two components under the light irradiation.In order to prove the suggestion, photo/electrochemical characterizations including photoluminescence (PL) spectra, transient photocurrent responses (TPR), surface photovoltage (SPV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots were conducted.Specifically, PL test is a powerful tool to reflect the separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers because PL emission roots in the electron-hole recombination 64.As demonstrated in Fig. 5a, pure CeO 2 and ZIS exhibited relatively stronger PL peaks than CZ5, manifesting that the composite possessed a higher separation rate of electrons and holes than the bare component semiconductor.In addition, compared with the bare ZIS and CeO 2 , the CZ5 sample exhibited obviously higher intensity in TPR and SPV plots (Fig. 5b andc) and smaller arc radius in EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 5d).The results further elaborated that the successful construction of heterocomposite can greatly enhance the transfer efficiency of photoexcited electron-hole pairs via interfacial contact between CeO 2 and ZIS.Note that there is an anodic photocurrent spike at the initial irradiation in the TPR plots of the samples.It is caused by the recombination of photogenerated electrons with the accumulated holes on the surface of ZIS, which was an inevitable process before the equilibration of competitive separation and recombination of charge carriers in the composite photocatalysts 65. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were attained to investigate the light absorption ability of photocatalysts.According to the Fig. 6a, the absorption edges of pure CeO 2 and ZIS were at approximately 400 and 550 nm, respectively, and the corresponding calculated band gaps were 3.25 and 2.52 eV, respectively, by converting the DRS spectra into the Tauc plots (Fig. 6b) via a Kubelka-Munk method 66.Notably, an apparent visible-light absorbance enhancement for CeO 2 was found (the dash area in Fig. 6a), indicating the presence of impurity energy level transitions, which may be aroused by the existed oxygen vacancy on the surface of CeO 2 .This result was in line with the XPS analysis (Fig. 4b).In addition, the increase of CeO 2 loading amount had a negligible effect on the light absorption ability of ZIS.It suggested that the light absorbance of the samples might not be the main factor affecting the photocatalytic performance. In order to uncover the specific band structure of the synthesized CeO 2 and ZIS, their flat-band potentials were obtained by a Mott-Schottky measurement.Fig. 6c andd exhibited that all the linear plots possessed positive slopes, indicating that the CeO 2 and ZIS belonged to n-type semiconductors.In consequence, the obtained flat-band potentials could be approximately considered as their conduction band potentials (E CB ) 40.For the bare CeO 2 and ZIS, the E CB potentials were roughly -0.65 and -1.33 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 6.45, respectively.According to the equations E Ag/AgCl E RHE -0.0591 pH -0.197 and E NHE E RHE -0.0591 pH, the E CB potentials of CeO 2 and ZIS were about -0.07 and -0.75 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH 0, respectively.Combined with the DRS results (Fig. 6a,b), the positions of valence band (E VB ) of CeO 2 and ZIS were calculated to be 3.18 and 1.77 V vs. NHE at pH 0. The photoactivity tests for CO 2 reduction into CH 3 OH were implemented under the irradiation of simulated visible light.Fig. 7 was represented to display the photocatalytic CH 3 OH evolution velocity of the prepared photocatalysts.It's rather apparent that the pure CeO 2 and ZIS exhibit a poor photoactivity, and the amount of CeO 2 in the composites exerted a crucial effect on the CH 3 OH evolution activity.When a few CeO 2 nanocubes were incorporated into the surface of ZIS nanosheets, there was a significant enhancement of CH 3 OH formation efficiency.The CZ5 sample possessed the most excellent photocatalytic performance, which was 3.9-and 7.4-times higher than that of pure ZIS and CeO 2 , respectively.The crucially promoted photoactivity of the complex materials was thought to be aroused by higher separation efficiency of photoexcited electrons-holes pairs, intimate contact between CeO 2 and ZIS, and relatively larger specific surface area.In addition, based on the reported literatures, CeO 2 possessed the capacity of promoting the CO 2 adsorption and conversion 50, which might be the another reason of the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the composites.However, excessive amount of CeO 2 suppressed the CH 3 OH generation.It is because the 3D morphology of ZIS was destructed by excessive amount of CeO 2 so as to result in the decrease of surface area, as confirmed by SEM images (Fig. S1b) and N 2 adsorption-desorption analysis (Table 1).Besides the CH 3 OH, the products of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the composites were also analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with TCD detector (Shimadzu, UV-2600), where oxygen could be detected. Moreover, the photostability of the CZ5 sample was investigated.As shown in Fig. S4, the photocatalytic CH 3 OH production rate of the CZ5 did not exhibit obvious decrease after 5 cycles, indicating its favorable durability during the long-time photocatalysis reduction process. According to the above information, a heuristic mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction into CH 3 OH over CeO 2 decorated ZIS microspheres was proposed as illustrated in Fig. 8. Firstly, electrons were photoexcited from the VB to the CB of the ZIS semiconductor under visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm), while the electrons in the VB of CeO 2 could not be photoexcited due to the wide bandgap.However, based on the results of band structure analysis, the E CB potentials of ZIS and CeO 2 enable both of them to reduce CO 2 into CH 3 OH (E CO2/CH3OH 0.03 V vs NHE at pH 0), and the E CB potential of ZIS is more negative than that of CeO 2 .Therefore, from a thermodynamic point of view, the excited electrons in the CB of ZIS have a tendency to inject into the CB of CeO 2 Moreover, we can evidently observe that the CeO 2 itself possessed a certain visible-light photoactivity for CO 2 reduction (0.073 mol g -1 h -1 ).It is because there exists oxygen vacancy on the surface of CeO 2 , which formed a new energy level (Ce 3 defect level) at the bottom of the CB of the CeO 2 67.Under visible-light irradiation, the electrons on the Ce 3 level were photoexcited into the CB of the CeO 2 and reduce the adsorbed CO 2 molecules on the CeO 2 surface.Therefore, it could be considered that the amount of electrons taking part in the CO 2 photoreduction process over the CeO 2 /ZIS composites was increased due to the existence of oxygen vacancy on the surface of CeO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic", "source": "The composite photocatalysts show higher photocatalytic performance with a CH 3 OH production velocity highest up to 0.542 mol g -1 h -1 under the visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation when the loading amount of CeO 2 is 5 wt, which is roughly 3.9-and 7.4-times higher than bare ZIS and CeO 2 , respectively.", "context": "In summary, a visible-light-driven CeO 2 /ZnIn 2 S 4 composite photocatalytic system has been successfully fabricated by virtue of a simple microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into CH 3 OH.The composite photocatalysts show higher photocatalytic performance with a CH 3 OH production velocity highest up to 0.542 mol g -1 h -1 under the visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation when the loading amount of CeO 2 is 5 wt, which is roughly 3.9-and 7.4-times higher than bare ZIS and CeO 2 , respectively.The enhanced photocatalytic performance of the ZIS microspheres was mainly ascribed to the introduction of CeO 2 nanocubes with oxygen vacancy, which served as an indispensable cocatalyst to efficiently boost the separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs in space and increase the electron concertration during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.Also, the 3D hierarchical structure of ZIS was obbligato as well to guarantee the large specific area for more active reaction sites.Overall, this work not only demonstrated the potential of CeO 2 as a cocatalyst material in the application of CO 2 photoreduction, but also highlights more generally the promising application of ZnIn 2 S 4 -based materials in the field of energy conversion.

The CeO 2 /ZnIn 2 S 4 composites were prepared by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment.In a typical fabrication procedure, ZnCl 2 (136.3 mg), InCl 3 4H 2 O (586.6 mg), and thioacetamide (TAA, 601.0 mg) were dissolved in 27 mL ethanol solution (V ethanol :V water 1:2), then various amount of the prepared CeO 2 (4.3, 21.2, 29.7, 42.3, and 84.6 mg) was added into the solution.After stirred and sonicated for 30 min, the homogeneous mixture was moved into a Teflon liner (50 mL) and kept at 180 C for 2 h under a microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment.After being cooled down to the ambient temperature, a yellow precipitate was obtained by the way of filtration and rinsed by distilled water and absolute ethanol for several times to make the pH value of filtrate be around 7. At last, the product was desiccated at 70 C for 2 h in a vacuum oven.The obtained samples were denoted as CZx (x 1, 5, 7, 10, and 20, respectively), where x represented the theoretical mass percentage of CeO 2 to ZnIn 2 S 4 .For comparison, pure ZnIn 2 S 4 was synthesized with a same approach in the absence of CeO 2 cubes, named as ZIS. All of the prepared photocatalysts were degassed at 150 C for 6 h prior to the measurements.Specifically, a Xe lamp (300 W, XD 350, CHINA) equipped with an UV-cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was exploited as the visible-light source.The degassed samples (100 mg) and NaHCO 3 (84 mg) were individually added into a two-neck Pyrex reactor possessing two parallel planes, which was sealed by a rubber stopper.Later, the reaction system was purified using N 2 for one hour to totally eliminate air.H 2 SO 4 was carefully immitted into the special groove on one neck of the reactor to react with NaHCO 3 , so that CO 2 was in-situ generated in this closed system.The resulting gas (1 mL) was injected by the syringe, and then detected and analyzed in virtue of gas chromatography (GC-14C, SHIMADZU, JAPAN) at an interval of one-hour irradiation."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Firstly, in the precursor solution, TAA molecules preferred to be attached to the oxygen vacancy on the surface of CeO2 since sulfur atoms have similar chemical properties with oxygen atoms 52. Then, in the microwave-assisted hydrothermal process, TAA molecules were thermally decomposed and slowly released S 2-.Therefore, there will be a concentration gradient of S 2-from the surface of CeO2 to the bulk of the solution.", "context": "3.1.Phase structure X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were analyzed to determine the crystallographic structure of synthesized photocatalysts.From the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1a, spiculate peaks of the pure CeO 2 can be observed at 28.6, 33.2, 47.6, and 56.4, respectively indexed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) facets of CeO 2 with a cerianite phase (JCPDS, No. 34-0394) 48.In the XRD pattern of bare ZIS, the diffraction peaks located at 27.7, 30.5, and 47.2are respectively ascribed to (1 0 2), (1 0 4), and (1 1 0) facets of the hexagonal-phase ZIS (JCPDS, No. 65-2023) 40.In the composites, when the mass fraction of CeO 2 was less than 10 wt, the XRD peaks of CeO 2 were not observed obviously.With the augment of the CeO 2 loading amount, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of CeO 2 increased, which can be clearly viewed from partial-amplificatory XRD pattern of its (1 1 1) facet (Fig. 1b).In addition, the characterized peaks of CeO 2 in the composites exhibited an evident skewing to the lower angle.It suggests that a robust interaction was formed between CeO 2 and ZIS.These results preliminarily demonstrated the fact that CeO 2 /ZnIn 2 S 4 composite photocatalysts were well fabricated as expected. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded to directly observe the morphologies of CeO 2 and ZIS and their interposition relationships in the composites.Fig. 2a shows that CeO 2 possesses a cubic morphology with the size ranging from 50 to 500 nm, whilst Fig. S1a shows that ZIS adopts a 3D hierarchical flower-like structure assembled by 2D nanosheets with several micrometers in diameters.In the CZ5 sample, CeO 2 nanocubes gleamingly interspersed in the ZIS microspheres (Fig. 2b), and further observation tells that the ZIS nanosheets were tightly contacted with the CeO 2 nanocubes (Fig. 2c).Furthermore, TEM image of CZ5 exhibited a similar morphology with that in the SEM image (Fig. 2d), and the corresponding high-resolution TEM image displayed the interplanar spacing of 0.327, 0.286, and 0.317 nm (Fig. 2e), referring to the (1 0 4) facets of the hexagonal ZIS 40, (2 0 0) and (1 1 1) facets of cerianite CeO 2 56, respectively.The electron microscopy images visually indicated an intimate interfacial contact between CeO 2 and ZIS in the CZ5 sample.Nevertheless, with the excessive introduction of CeO 2 in the composites (CZ20 for example), the stack of CeO 2 cubes devastated the 3D hierarchical flowerlike morphology of ZIS (Fig. S1b).It was considered that the devastation of 3D morphology might decrease the specific surface area, leading to a lower photocatalytic performance 57. It is commonly acknowledged that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (S BET ) plays an imperative role in the photocatalytic performance of catalysts 11.The photocatalyst with a large surface area could not merely benefit in the adsorption of more reactive molecules, but also provide more active sites for photocatalysis reactions.In order to confirm the effect of CeO 2 loading amount on the S BET of the composites, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the fabricated samples were recorded as shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S2.Firstly, it can be observed that the adsorption-desorption isotherms of bare CeO 2 and ZIS are totally different.In the light of the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification 58, the adsorption-desorption isotherm of the ZIS are type IV, and the shape of its hysteresis loop in a relative pressure ranging from 0.45 to 1.0 is attributed to H3 type, indicating the presence of slit-like pores generated from the aggregation of nanosheets.The corresponding pore size is distributed from 2 to 100 nm as demonstrated in Fig. 3b, corroborating the presence of mesopores and macropores in the nanosheet-assembled ZIS microspheres 40, in step with the results of Fig. 3a.However, for the bare CeO 2 , there is nearly no hysteresis loop in the adsorption-desorption isotherm and negligible peak in the pore size distribution curve, and the relevant pore volume and S BET are much smaller than those of the ZIS (Table 1).It is not unexpected because the CeO 2 owns the morphology of stacked nanocubes, which have glazed surface without any pores and gaps (Fig. 2a). When the CeO 2 nanocubes were incorporated into the ZIS microspheres, the isotherm shape of the composites remained the same with that of ZIS.As is summarized in Table 1, the introduction of a small amount of CeO 2 into the ZIS enlarged its surface area, and reached the largest in the CZ5 sample, while excessive CeO 2 has the opposite effect, for which excessive CeO 2 is likely to destruct the 3D hierarchical flower-like spherical structure of ZIS.This results are consistent with the FESEM images (Fig. 2a-c and Fig. S1b).Such hierarchical structure can provide larger surface area to accommodate more active sites and be rather beneficial to the diffusion of reactants and products 59.These consequences suggest that the surface area may be a significant influential factor for the photocatalytic performance of composites. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the CeO 2 , ZIS, and CZ5 samples were performed to further investigate the interaction between CeO 2 and ZIS.As is shown in Fig. 4a, the signals of O, Ce, S, In, and Zn elements were observed in the CZ5 composites.An evident peak located at 285.0 eV can be indexed to adventitious carbon stemming from the atmospheric CO 2 or the XPS instrument 60.In addition, comparisons of high-resolution XPS spectra of Ce 3d, O 1s, and S 2p in the CeO 2 , CZ5, and ZIS samples were demonstrated in Fig. 4b-d.According to the Fig. 4b, the Ce 3d peak of CeO 2 could be fitted into eight peaks, consisting of two kinds of spin-orbit lines, named as U and V 31,48.Ce 3d 3/2 spin-orbit components are assigned to U lines, which include three typical peaks flagged as u (899.4 eV), u'' (905.7 eV) and u''' (915.1 eV), respectively.Ce 3d 5/2 spin-orbit components were classified to V lines, containing the other peaks, which were separately denoted as v (880.8 eV), v'' (887.5 eV) and v''' (896.8 eV).Those abovementioned six peaks all belong to Ce 4 .The residual two peaks located at 902.1 and 884.0 eV are respectively labeled as u' and v', which are attributed to the Ce 3 species, indicating the existence of oxygen vacancy on the CeO 2 surface 61.Further evidence came from the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) result of the CeO 2 (see Fig. S3).The EPR signal at g 2.004 demonstrated that the electrons trapped on oxygen vacancies on the CeO 2 surface 62.For the CZ5 sample, the XPS signal of Ce was very weak.It is not strange because the loading amount of CeO 2 was very low, and the CeO 2 cubes were partly wrapped by the ZIS nanosheets as observed in SEM image (Fig. 2c).From Fig. 4c, the O 1s spectrum of CeO 2 could be divided into two sub-peaks, originating from the coexisted lattice oxygen (529.0 eV) and adsorbed oxygen from hydroxyl groups (531.8 eV) in CeO 2 48.In Fig. 4d, the characteristic peaks located at 161.7 eV and 162.9 eV are assigned to the S 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 peaks in bare ZIS 63.However, when CeO 2 nanocubes were incorporated into ZIS, the lattice oxygen peak of CeO 2 shifted to a lower binding energy, while the S 2p peaks of ZIS shifted to a higher binding energy, indicating a robust interfacial contact between CeO 2 and ZIS.The tight combination of two semiconductors can validly facilitate the transportation and separation of photoinduced charge carriers during the photocatalysis process. On the basis of above information, a rational mechanism was proposed to uncover the formation process of the CeO 2 /ZIS composites.Firstly, in the precursor solution, TAA molecules preferred to be attached to the oxygen vacancy on the surface of CeO 2 since sulfur atoms have similar chemical properties with oxygen atoms 52.Then, in the microwave-assisted hydrothermal process, TAA molecules were thermally decomposed and slowly released S 2-.Therefore, there will be a concentration gradient of S 2-from the surface of CeO 2 to the bulk of the solution.The Zn 2 and In 3 in the precursor solution on one hand integrated with S 2-on the surface of CeO 2 to form ZIS crystals and insitu grew to be nanosheets, and on the other hand reacted with S 2-in the solution to formed ZIS nanosheets.As the reaction proceeded, CeO 2 nanocubes would be contacted with ZIS nanosheets, whilst ZIS nanosheets in the solution were further assembled into flower-like microspheres. It is expected that the close contact between CeO 2 and ZIS is beneficial to the migration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers over the two components under the light irradiation.In order to prove the suggestion, photo/electrochemical characterizations including photoluminescence (PL) spectra, transient photocurrent responses (TPR), surface photovoltage (SPV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots were conducted.Specifically, PL test is a powerful tool to reflect the separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers because PL emission roots in the electron-hole recombination 64.As demonstrated in Fig. 5a, pure CeO 2 and ZIS exhibited relatively stronger PL peaks than CZ5, manifesting that the composite possessed a higher separation rate of electrons and holes than the bare component semiconductor.In addition, compared with the bare ZIS and CeO 2 , the CZ5 sample exhibited obviously higher intensity in TPR and SPV plots (Fig. 5b andc) and smaller arc radius in EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 5d).The results further elaborated that the successful construction of heterocomposite can greatly enhance the transfer efficiency of photoexcited electron-hole pairs via interfacial contact between CeO 2 and ZIS.Note that there is an anodic photocurrent spike at the initial irradiation in the TPR plots of the samples.It is caused by the recombination of photogenerated electrons with the accumulated holes on the surface of ZIS, which was an inevitable process before the equilibration of competitive separation and recombination of charge carriers in the composite photocatalysts 65. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were attained to investigate the light absorption ability of photocatalysts.According to the Fig. 6a, the absorption edges of pure CeO 2 and ZIS were at approximately 400 and 550 nm, respectively, and the corresponding calculated band gaps were 3.25 and 2.52 eV, respectively, by converting the DRS spectra into the Tauc plots (Fig. 6b) via a Kubelka-Munk method 66.Notably, an apparent visible-light absorbance enhancement for CeO 2 was found (the dash area in Fig. 6a), indicating the presence of impurity energy level transitions, which may be aroused by the existed oxygen vacancy on the surface of CeO 2 .This result was in line with the XPS analysis (Fig. 4b).In addition, the increase of CeO 2 loading amount had a negligible effect on the light absorption ability of ZIS.It suggested that the light absorbance of the samples might not be the main factor affecting the photocatalytic performance. In order to uncover the specific band structure of the synthesized CeO 2 and ZIS, their flat-band potentials were obtained by a Mott-Schottky measurement.Fig. 6c andd exhibited that all the linear plots possessed positive slopes, indicating that the CeO 2 and ZIS belonged to n-type semiconductors.In consequence, the obtained flat-band potentials could be approximately considered as their conduction band potentials (E CB ) 40.For the bare CeO 2 and ZIS, the E CB potentials were roughly -0.65 and -1.33 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 6.45, respectively.According to the equations E Ag/AgCl E RHE -0.0591 pH -0.197 and E NHE E RHE -0.0591 pH, the E CB potentials of CeO 2 and ZIS were about -0.07 and -0.75 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH 0, respectively.Combined with the DRS results (Fig. 6a,b), the positions of valence band (E VB ) of CeO 2 and ZIS were calculated to be 3.18 and 1.77 V vs. NHE at pH 0. The photoactivity tests for CO 2 reduction into CH 3 OH were implemented under the irradiation of simulated visible light.Fig. 7 was represented to display the photocatalytic CH 3 OH evolution velocity of the prepared photocatalysts.It's rather apparent that the pure CeO 2 and ZIS exhibit a poor photoactivity, and the amount of CeO 2 in the composites exerted a crucial effect on the CH 3 OH evolution activity.When a few CeO 2 nanocubes were incorporated into the surface of ZIS nanosheets, there was a significant enhancement of CH 3 OH formation efficiency.The CZ5 sample possessed the most excellent photocatalytic performance, which was 3.9-and 7.4-times higher than that of pure ZIS and CeO 2 , respectively.The crucially promoted photoactivity of the complex materials was thought to be aroused by higher separation efficiency of photoexcited electrons-holes pairs, intimate contact between CeO 2 and ZIS, and relatively larger specific surface area.In addition, based on the reported literatures, CeO 2 possessed the capacity of promoting the CO 2 adsorption and conversion 50, which might be the another reason of the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the composites.However, excessive amount of CeO 2 suppressed the CH 3 OH generation.It is because the 3D morphology of ZIS was destructed by excessive amount of CeO 2 so as to result in the decrease of surface area, as confirmed by SEM images (Fig. S1b) and N 2 adsorption-desorption analysis (Table 1).Besides the CH 3 OH, the products of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over the composites were also analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with TCD detector (Shimadzu, UV-2600), where oxygen could be detected. Moreover, the photostability of the CZ5 sample was investigated.As shown in Fig. S4, the photocatalytic CH 3 OH production rate of the CZ5 did not exhibit obvious decrease after 5 cycles, indicating its favorable durability during the long-time photocatalysis reduction process. According to the above information, a heuristic mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction into CH 3 OH over CeO 2 decorated ZIS microspheres was proposed as illustrated in Fig. 8. Firstly, electrons were photoexcited from the VB to the CB of the ZIS semiconductor under visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm), while the electrons in the VB of CeO 2 could not be photoexcited due to the wide bandgap.However, based on the results of band structure analysis, the E CB potentials of ZIS and CeO 2 enable both of them to reduce CO 2 into CH 3 OH (E CO2/CH3OH 0.03 V vs NHE at pH 0), and the E CB potential of ZIS is more negative than that of CeO 2 .Therefore, from a thermodynamic point of view, the excited electrons in the CB of ZIS have a tendency to inject into the CB of CeO 2 Moreover, we can evidently observe that the CeO 2 itself possessed a certain visible-light photoactivity for CO 2 reduction (0.073 mol g -1 h -1 ).It is because there exists oxygen vacancy on the surface of CeO 2 , which formed a new energy level (Ce 3 defect level) at the bottom of the CB of the CeO 2 67.Under visible-light irradiation, the electrons on the Ce 3 level were photoexcited into the CB of the CeO 2 and reduce the adsorbed CO 2 molecules on the CeO 2 surface.Therefore, it could be considered that the amount of electrons taking part in the CO 2 photoreduction process over the CeO 2 /ZIS composites was increased due to the existence of oxygen vacancy on the surface of CeO 2 ."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
