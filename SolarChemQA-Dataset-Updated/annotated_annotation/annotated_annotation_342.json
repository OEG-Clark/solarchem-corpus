As shown in Fig. 5, TiO 2 /CdS nanoparticles were deposited over the rGO/Pt sheets, which have a wrinkle-paper-like surface.The TiO 2 /CdS and Pt nanoparticles have a large dispersion over the entire rGO sheet, and this feature can positively contribute to the photocatalytic processes.The secondary electron (SE) and the high angle annular dark eld (HAADF) images of the TiO 2 / CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite also conrmed that both Pt and TiO 2 /CdS nanoparticles are supported on the reduced graphene oxide layer.In addition, the Pt and the TiO 2 / CdS nanoparticles are in both (upper and bottom) sides of graphene sheets (Fig. 4S ). In order to obtain a more detailed morphology of the nanocomposite, EDS analysis was carried out in the TiO 2 /CdS/ rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite (Fig. 6).The mapping of the elements conrms the presence of all components distributed over the graphene sheets in an intimate contact which is important for the success of the photocatalytic reaction as depicted in Fig. 8. The absorption spectra of the TiO 2 , TiO 2 /CdS and TiO 2 /CdS/ rGO/Pt samples were measured using diffuse reectance spectroscopy (Fig. 7). The absorption of the TiO 2 nanoparticles is limited to the UV region, whereas the TiO 2 /CdS sample presents a broad band from 200 to 600 nm, which is characteristic of the titania nanoparticles and of the rst excitonic peak of the CdS nanoparticles. 60Compared to the TiO 2 /CdS sample, the increase in optical absorption above 400 nm for the TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite is a result of both reduced graphene oxide absorption and light scattering. The TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite was analysed as a photocatalyst for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in the presence of only water and solar irradiation.Fig. 8 shows the results of methane production as a function of reaction time (5 h) for the quaternary nanocomposite photocatalyst and for the TiO 2 , TiO 2 /CdS and TiO 2 /CdS/Pt samples. As shown in Fig. 8, the pristine TiO 2 sample exhibits limited photocatalytic activity, giving rise to only 0.04 mmol of methane.This effect is likely a consequence of the band gap of TiO 2 (3.2 eV), with maximum absorption in the UV range, thus limiting methane production in the visible range.Wang et al. 61 achieved 0.07 mmol of methane from a TiO 2 (Degussa P25) sample using a similar experimental procedure to that reported herein.Fig. 8 also shows the production of CH 4 for the TiO 2 /CdS sample, indicating a slight increase in the production of methane compared to pristine TiO 2 due to the CdS absorption in the visible range (see UV-vis spectra in Fig. 7).When the TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite containing graphene sheets decorated with Pt nanoparticles was employed, the production of methane signicantly increased, even compared to Pt-coated TiO 2 /CdS samples.This effect results from the benecial synergy between all four components in the photogeneration, charge separation and transport of the charge carriers. The mechanism involved in the production of methane from CO 2 and water is complex and begins upon photoexcitation of the two semiconductors.First, it is interesting to consider the energy level diagram of all components in the TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite.The relative energetic positions of the conduction band (CB), valence band (VB) and work function (f) for TiO 2 , CdS, RGO and Pt are shown in Fig. 9(a).A schematic illustration of the photoinduced charge separation and transfer process in the TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite is also presented in Fig. 9(b). As shown in Fig. 9(a), the energies of the TiO 2 CB and VB are A4.32 and A7.52 eV, respectively, whereas those for the CdS on TiO 2 are A4.14 and A6.48 eV, 62 respectively.In addition, the f of rGO and Pt are approximately A4.9 eV and A6.3 eV, respectively. 63,64In this diagram, the CB edge of CdS is above that of TiO 2 .When the TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite is exposed to visible light, excited electron-hole pairs are generated in both semiconductors.Due to the specic nature of the band alignment at the TiO 2 /CdS interface, the photogenerated electrons are transferred to the CB of TiO 2 , whereas the holes remain in the VB of CdS. 6566667 The spatial separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs in different semiconductors reduces charge recombination and is important for photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical devices. 68,69The rGO sheets are a well-known electron-accepting material with excellent conductivity properties as a result of its two-dimensional planar structure.Thus, a faster electron transfer from both TiO 2 and CdS nanomaterials to the rGO sheets (via the titania conduction band) is expected to occur.The rapid transport of the charge carriers in the graphene sheets promotes an even better charge separation.This process eventually decreases the rate of recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. In addition, the high surface area provided by the carbonaceous material favoured a homogeneous distribution of the Pt nanoparticles and a strong physical contact between the TiO 2 and CdS nanoparticles.In this respect, the Pt nanoparticle co- HCHO 2H (aq) 2e A / CH 3 OH (4) where e A and h denote photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively.First, the presence of h promotes water splitting, resulting in the formation of oxygen gas (O 2 ) and H ions.These H ions, when combined with CO 2 molecules and electrons, promote the formation of organic molecules (hydrocarbons), which at the end of the process are converted to methane by adding more protons and electrons. 71n summary, the photocatalytic results indicate that the TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite exhibited better performance towards CO 2 photoreduction than the TiO 2 , TiO 2 / CdS and TiO 2 /CdS/Pt nanocomposites.This conclusion is also supported by the photoelectrochemical measurements performed using the TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite and using the TiO 2 , TiO 2 /CdS and TiO 2 /CdS/Pt lms deposited onto FTO substrates (Fig. 10).The substrates were employed as working electrodes in a typical three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell. As observed in the chronoamperometry measurements (Fig. 10), the photocurrents responded immediately to the presence of light when the cell operation was interrupted every minute for 50 s (on/off cycle).All samples exhibited anodic photocurrent, indicating that the electron ux is towards the electrode and then driven to the platinum wire by the external circuit.The lms prepared with TiO 2 nanoparticles showed only a small photoactivity, i.e., a low photocurrent due to its limited band gap in the ultraviolet region. 72For the TiO 2 /CdS lm, appreciable values of photocurrent appeared immediately under illumination (ON) and decreased to nearly zero in dark conditions (light OFF).This effect is due to a strong absorption of CdS nanoparticles in the visible region, followed by a fast electron transfer to the TiO 2 nanoparticles. 62,63An enhancement in the anodic photocurrent values was observed for the TiO 2 / CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite compared to TiO 2 /CdS/Pt and TiO 2 / CdS.In fact, platinum nanoparticles contribute to the increase in the photocatalytic activity of the systems, as previously reported. 73,74The higher anodic current for the TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite is consistent with the photocatalysis data as a higher amount of methane gas was detected when the TiO 2 / CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite was employed, suggesting that the quaternary nanocomposite is an efficient material for photocatalysis.It is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of each component separately.We strongly believe that electrons are transported more efficiently through the rGO sheets, thereby decreasing the recombination between electrons in the TiO 2 CB and the holes in the CdS VB.In addition, the presence of Pt nanoparticles is important for more efficiently catalyzing the CO 2 reduction reaction.Coupling two semiconductors (TiO 2 and CdS) with complementary absorption proles and suitable energy levels, which allowed an efficient electron transfer between them, was also a key factor for the success of this quaternary nanocomposite."}, {"llm generation": "Pt nanoparticles", "source": "This result suggests that the transport of photogenerated charges occurs in the carbonaceous material, which is favoured by the relatively high rGO surface area, by the efficient contact among TiO 2 /CdS nanoparticles and by the presence of Pt nanoparticles, which are able to efficiently transport electrons towards carbon dioxide molecules.", "context": "TiO 2 /CdS and rGO/Pt nanocomposites were synthesized separately and then mixed to obtain a new TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite with interesting properties for application in photocatalysis.The XRD data indicated that anatase was the main crystalline phase in pristine TiO 2 , likely due to the simultaneous synthesis of CdS in conjunction with TiO 2 .According to the SEM and HR-TEM images, Pt nanoparticles deposited over rGO sheets are homogeneously dispersed over the entire sheet of carbonaceous material.The TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite was investigated as a photocatalyst for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in the presence of only water and visible light.The TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite provided higher photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 , TiO 2 /CdS and TiO 2 /CdS/Pt samples.This result suggests that the transport of photogenerated charges occurs in the carbonaceous material, which is favoured by the relatively high rGO surface area, by the efficient contact among TiO 2 /CdS nanoparticles and by the presence of Pt nanoparticles, which are able to efficiently transport electrons towards carbon dioxide molecules.The enhanced electron transport in the graphene lms of TiO 2 /CdS/ rGO/Pt nanocomposite was also evidenced in the photoelectrochemical measurements.

Titanium tetrachloride (0.015 mol) was then added to this solution, which was vigorously stirred for 1 h.The resulting solution was deposited onto a Petri dish, and the system was maintained at 40 C for 4 days under ambient conditions for solvent evaporation.The material was heated at 400 C for 4 h (EDG3P -S model, EDG) to produce TiO 2 / CdO powder.Then, 0.3 g of TiO 2 /CdO powder was dispersed in 50 mL of an aqueous solution containing Na 2 S (0.2 mol L A1 ) at room temperature.Aer 6 h of continuous stirring, the resulting product was obtained by ltering, washed three times with distilled water and then dried.The semiconductor samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction using a Shimadzu-XDR 7000 diffractometer equipped with a copper tube and a graphite monochromator and operated at a power of 40 kV and 35 mA.Scanning electron microscopy images were acquired using a FEI Inspect F50high-resolution SEM operated at a voltage of 5 to 10 kV and current of 12 mA.High-resolution transmission electron microscopy images were acquired using a HRTEM-JEM 3010 URP microscope.Raman spectra were recorded using a Raman confocal spectrometer, model T64000 -Jobin Yvon -USA, with an exposure time of 30 s, accumulation of 10 spectra and laser excitation of 514.5 nm in the frequency range of 200-800 cm A1 . The deposition of Pt nanoparticles onto graphene oxide sheets was performed following the procedure described by Xing et al. 38 This procedure consists of depositing Pt nanoparticles over the material of choice by adding a precursor, K 2 PtCl 4 .The procedure begins by depositing 15 mL of an aqueous solution containing ethylene glycol (2 : 1 ethylene glycol : water, volume ratio) to an aqueous solution of graphene oxide prepared following the procedure reported by Gorchinskiy et al. 39 The resulting solution was then transferred to a volumetric ask.Then, 10 ml of K 2 PtCl 4 that was previously dissolved in water at a concentration of 0.01 mol L A1 was deposited.To deposit Pt nanoparticles over graphene oxide sheets, the system was reuxed for 2 h using a thermostatic silicone oil bath (125 C).Following this step, Pt nanoparticles were deposited onto the graphene oxide sheets at a concentration of 1 by weight (with respect to rGO).Pt/graphene oxide samples were separated from the ethylene glycol solution using distilled water (washing steps) and centrifugation for three times.To complete the reduction of graphene oxide, small amounts (drops) of hydrazine hydrate were added to this solution under stirring to provide reduced graphene oxide (rGO) decorated with Pt nanoparticles. 40The same procedure was used for depositing Pt nanoparticles over TiO 2 /CdS to obtain the TiO 2 / CdS/Pt nanocomposite.The samples were characterized using XRD, SEM and HR-TEM. Nanocomposites were prepared by dispersing 1 by weight of rGO/Pt and TiO 2 /CdS into an isopropanol/water solution (2 : 1).The system was kept in an ultrasonic bath for 30 minutes to completely disperse the components in the solvent mixture.Aerwards, the suspension of the quaternary nanocomposite was deposited by the doctor blading technique onto an FTO substrate (active area of 2 cm 2 ) and then dried in an oven to evaporate the solvent to obtain TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt (lm thickness: 6 mm).For comparison, TiO 2 , TiO 2 /CdS and TiO 2 /CdS/Pt lms were prepared using the same procedure described above for the preparation of the TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite.The nanocomposites were characterized using SEM and diffuse reectance spectroscopy with a Varian Cary 5G UV-VIS spectrometer (NIR) equipped with a diffuse reectance accessory.

Ag/AgCl in a KCl solution (3.0 mol L A1 ) as the reference electrode; and platinum wire as the counter electrode, was used in the experiments.An aqueous solution of Na 2 SO 3 (1.0 mol L A1 ) was used as the supporting electrolyte and sacricial reagent (hole scavenger) to avoid degradation of the CdS nanoparticles. 4243344 The photoelectrochemical cell was placed in an optical bench consisting of an OrielXe (Hg) 250 W lamp coupled to an AM 1.5 lter (Oriel), collimating lenses and a water lter (Oriel).The light intensity was calibrated using an optical power metre, model 1830 C (Newport) to 100 mW cm A2 , but no correction was made to account for reection and transmission losses.We used the same lms in the PEC studies, with the exception of those decorated with Pt nanoparticles.Anatase and rutile are the crystalline phases in the pristine TiO 2 sample according to the XRD pattern shown in Fig. 1.This mixture of crystalline phases has previously been reported for TiO 2 samples synthesized using other methods. 4546647 The peaks at 2q values of 25.3 , 37.9 and 48.2 can be indexed to the ( 101 An intense resonance effect is expected for the CdS crystalline phase because the band gap of the CdS nanoparticles is 2.4 eV, which is similar to the laser excitation used to characterize the semiconductor samples in this work.This effect is indeed observed, as shown in Fig. 2(a), because an intense signal was registered at 300 cm A1 and corresponds to the rst-order longitudinal optical phonon (1 LO). 52The second-order LO is less intense, and it was registered at 600 cm A1 , in good agreement with results reported elsewhere for samples containing CdS. 535455 The presence of titanium dioxide nanoparticles was also conrmed by Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 2(a), by the presence of vibrational modes at 395, 516 and 637 cm A1 .These signals correspond to the anatase crystalline phase of titanium dioxide. 52Note that the characteristic Raman signals from the rutile phase were not identied because they should appear within the range of 420 to 450 cm A1 . 52This result is consistent with the data obtained from the powder XRD patterns, in which no diffraction peaks associated with the rutile phase could be identied in the TiO 2 /CdS samples.Fig. 2(b) shows the HR-TEM image of this sample, where it is possible to observe the presence of CdS and TiO 2 particles.The (101) plane of TiO 2 and the (112) plane of CdS were also iden-tied.Note that in this image, the sample is composed of nanosized spherical particles and oblate spheroids for both TiO 2 and CdS.The morphology observed in this work was also reported by other authors for a system composed of TiO 2 /CdS. 562.Characterization of reduced graphene oxide decorated with platinum (rGO/Pt) Fig. 3 presents powder XRD patterns of the graphene oxide samples reduced by hydrazine and of the reduced graphene oxide decorated with Pt nanoparticles.Note that the process for depositing Pt nanoparticles over the carbonaceous material also reduces the graphene oxide sheets, giving rise to a rGO/Pt nanocomposite, a conductive material.Fig. 3 also shows the thin-lm XRD pattern of a Pt lm on a conducting glass substrate for comparison."}, {"llm generation": "Visible light", "source": "The TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite was investigated as a photocatalyst for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in the presence of only water and visible light.", "context": "TiO 2 /CdS and rGO/Pt nanocomposites were synthesized separately and then mixed to obtain a new TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite with interesting properties for application in photocatalysis.The XRD data indicated that anatase was the main crystalline phase in pristine TiO 2 , likely due to the simultaneous synthesis of CdS in conjunction with TiO 2 .According to the SEM and HR-TEM images, Pt nanoparticles deposited over rGO sheets are homogeneously dispersed over the entire sheet of carbonaceous material.The TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite was investigated as a photocatalyst for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in the presence of only water and visible light.The TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite provided higher photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 , TiO 2 /CdS and TiO 2 /CdS/Pt samples.This result suggests that the transport of photogenerated charges occurs in the carbonaceous material, which is favoured by the relatively high rGO surface area, by the efficient contact among TiO 2 /CdS nanoparticles and by the presence of Pt nanoparticles, which are able to efficiently transport electrons towards carbon dioxide molecules.The enhanced electron transport in the graphene lms of TiO 2 /CdS/ rGO/Pt nanocomposite was also evidenced in the photoelectrochemical measurements.

The photoreactor was constructed by taking into account some features described in the literature. 41It was equipped with rubber septa for collecting gaseous samples, inlet and outlet gas valves, a pressure gauge and a quartz window for sunlight illumination.The quaternary and other nanocomposites, as well as the individual samples, were deposited onto a glass substrate and then introduced inside the reactor.The system was sealed by a metal lid and nitrile rubber, specically designed for this task.Dynamic vacuum was applied to the reactor for 30 minutes to remove air.Then, 0.5 mL of liquid water and CO 2 (99.9 purity) were injected into the reactor until a pressure of 0.2 bar was reached.The reactor was subsequently continuously illuminated by polychromatic light (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm A2 ) for 5 h using a solar simulator (Solsim).During the illumination, the gaseous samples that formed inside the reactor were collected each hour, injected into an HP5890 series II gas chromatograph, and quantied. The photoelectrochemical experiments were conducted using an Autolab PGSTAT10 potentiostat/galvanostat (Eco Chemie) controlled by GPES soware, which was used for acquiring and analysing the data.A conventional three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell, consisting of the FTO/TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt, FTO/TiO 2 /CdS/Pt, FTO/TiO 2 /CdS and FTO/TiO 2 lms as working electrodes (active area of 1 cm 2 ); Ag/AgCl in a KCl solution (3.0 mol L A1 ) as the reference electrode; and platinum wire as the counter electrode, was used in the experiments.An aqueous solution of Na 2 SO 3 (1.0 mol L A1 ) was used as the supporting electrolyte and sacricial reagent (hole scavenger) to avoid degradation of the CdS nanoparticles. 4243344 The photoelectrochemical cell was placed in an optical bench consisting of an OrielXe (Hg) 250 W lamp coupled to an AM 1.5 lter (Oriel), collimating lenses and a water lter (Oriel).The light intensity was calibrated using an optical power metre, model 1830 C (Newport) to 100 mW cm A2 , but no correction was made to account for reection and transmission losses.We used the same lms in the PEC studies, with the exception of those decorated with Pt nanoparticles.Anatase and rutile are the crystalline phases in the pristine TiO 2 sample according to the XRD pattern shown in Fig. 1.This mixture of crystalline phases has previously been reported for TiO 2 samples synthesized using other methods. 4546647 The peaks at 2q values of 25.3 , 37.9 and 48.2 can be indexed to the ( 101 An intense resonance effect is expected for the CdS crystalline phase because the band gap of the CdS nanoparticles is 2.4 eV, which is similar to the laser excitation used to characterize the semiconductor samples in this work.This effect is indeed observed, as shown in Fig. 2(a), because an intense signal was registered at 300 cm A1 and corresponds to the rst-order longitudinal optical phonon (1 LO). 52The second-order LO is less intense, and it was registered at 600 cm A1 , in good agreement with results reported elsewhere for samples containing CdS. 535455 The presence of titanium dioxide nanoparticles was also conrmed by Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 2(a), by the presence of vibrational modes at 395, 516 and 637 cm A1 .These signals correspond to the anatase crystalline phase of titanium dioxide. 52Note that the characteristic Raman signals from the rutile phase were not identied because they should appear within the range of 420 to 450 cm A1 . 52This result is consistent with the data obtained from the powder XRD patterns, in which no diffraction peaks associated with the rutile phase could be identied in the TiO 2 /CdS samples.Fig. 2(b) shows the HR-TEM image of this sample, where it is possible to observe the presence of CdS and TiO 2 particles.The (101) plane of TiO 2 and the (112) plane of CdS were also iden-tied.Note that in this image, the sample is composed of nanosized spherical particles and oblate spheroids for both TiO 2 and CdS.The morphology observed in this work was also reported by other authors for a system composed of TiO 2 /CdS. 562.Characterization of reduced graphene oxide decorated with platinum (rGO/Pt) Fig. 3 presents powder XRD patterns of the graphene oxide samples reduced by hydrazine and of the reduced graphene oxide decorated with Pt nanoparticles.Note that the process for depositing Pt nanoparticles over the carbonaceous material also reduces the graphene oxide sheets, giving rise to a rGO/Pt nanocomposite, a conductive material.Fig. 3 also shows the thin-lm XRD pattern of a Pt lm on a conducting glass substrate for comparison."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite was investigated as a photocatalyst for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in the presence of only water and visible light.", "context": "TiO 2 /CdS and rGO/Pt nanocomposites were synthesized separately and then mixed to obtain a new TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite with interesting properties for application in photocatalysis.The XRD data indicated that anatase was the main crystalline phase in pristine TiO 2 , likely due to the simultaneous synthesis of CdS in conjunction with TiO 2 .According to the SEM and HR-TEM images, Pt nanoparticles deposited over rGO sheets are homogeneously dispersed over the entire sheet of carbonaceous material.The TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite was investigated as a photocatalyst for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in the presence of only water and visible light.The TiO 2 /CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite provided higher photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 , TiO 2 /CdS and TiO 2 /CdS/Pt samples.This result suggests that the transport of photogenerated charges occurs in the carbonaceous material, which is favoured by the relatively high rGO surface area, by the efficient contact among TiO 2 /CdS nanoparticles and by the presence of Pt nanoparticles, which are able to efficiently transport electrons towards carbon dioxide molecules.The enhanced electron transport in the graphene lms of TiO 2 /CdS/ rGO/Pt nanocomposite was also evidenced in the photoelectrochemical measurements.
