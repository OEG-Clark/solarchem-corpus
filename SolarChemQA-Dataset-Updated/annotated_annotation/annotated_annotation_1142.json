The morphologies are featured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 2a reveals the as-prepared Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S nanoparticles.The particles size distribution in Fig. 2b shows that the estimated average diameters of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S are 5.5 nm.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) displayed in Fig. 2c shows one set of the diffraction spots, corresponding to 111, 220, and 222 planes in sphalerite phases in the pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S. Fig. 2d shows the as-prepared Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 nanoparticles; the particles size distribution in Fig. 2e shows the estimated average diameters of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 grew to 7.8 nm, indicating the improved crystallinity in accordance with XRD results.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) displayed in inset of Fig. 2f shows two sets of the diffraction spots, corresponding to 111 plane in sphalerite phases and 110, 200 in wurtzite phases, suggesting the coexistence of sphalerite and wurtzite phases in the acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S samples.The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) pictures are presented Fig. 2g,h, both Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 samples exhibit relatively legible lattice fringes, indicating that two samples have good crystallinity.Such a result is consistent with the relatively distinct peaks in XRD results.Careful comparison of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 clearly found more grain boundaries occurred in Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 as marked by the white dot line and the part above and below the white boundary present different atomic arrangement.The lattice spacing derived from the yellow frame is 0.330 nm, corresponding to the 111 crystal planes in cubic Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S while the interplanar distance in blue frame is 0.312 nm, corresponding to the 101 crystal planes in wurtzite Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S. The phase transformed from sphalerite to wurtzite and phase junction was demonstrated to grow in the acid-treated samples.With the pH value of acid reducing, the phase transformation becomes more significant and the wurtzite proportion increased to the largest in the Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-0.25 sample 28.To further understand the morphological characteristics, the volumetric N 2 uptake measurement was taken out, which illustrate the acid-treatment influence on the surface area and N 2 adsorption capacity.As shown from Fig. 2i,the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 is 95.7 m 2 g -1 , slightly smaller than that of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S (114.1 m 2 g -1 ).The acid treatment may cause a slightly increase of particle size and thereby decreasing the surface area, which is also illustrated in XRD and TEM results.The pore size distribution curves are shown in Fig. S2 of supporting information.The pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S samples show a wide range of 2-100 nm with two peaks pore diameter of approximate 3 and 8 nm, confirming the existence of mesopores.The Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 samples show a narrower range of 2-35 nm with a peak pore diameter of approximate 9 nm, the increasing pore size is a result of improvement of the crystal growth after acid treatment, which will undoubtedly reduce the specific surface area 29,30. As the phase transformation are more likely to have energy and atomic disorder, the imperfections were further examined by the room-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to gain a deeper insight into how the acid-treatment affects the defect.As shown in Fig. 3a, both Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and acid-treated samples display a signal at g 2.003, which can be assigned to the absorbed molecular oxygen species.This is a signal arising from the anion vacancies, i.e. S vacancies.If the materials could provide extra free electrons, the atmosphere oxygen are readily to accept electrons after adsorbed on the photocatalysts and generates the EPR signals, indirectly implying the existence of sulfur vacancies in the Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S. The signal of acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 is significantly intensified and broadened, suggesting the increased concentration of sulfur vacancy (S v ) 31,32.According to the EPR quantitative detection, the concentrations of S v are 1.81810 14 spins/g in Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1, almost two-fold than that of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S, which has 1.05210 14 spins/g. To further ascertain the type of vacancy species existing on the surface and the surface composition of the as-prepared Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out.As depicted in Fig. 3b, the S 2p spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks which are allocated to divalent sulfide ions (S 2-) 29.The deconvoluted peaks locate at binding energies of 160.73 and 161.52 eV, allocated to S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 of the normal S atoms, respectively, nearly retain at the same location 25.The peak at 161.21 eV, representing the disordered S, moves toward lower binding energy to 161.11 eV, and the peak at 162.66 eV shifts toward higher binding energy to 163.68 eV, featuring the appearance of elemental S, further confirming the formation of S v after acid treating 25.Likewise, this phenomenon was also detected in the Zn 2p and Cd 3d spectra of pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and acid-treated samples ascribing to Zn 2 and Cd 2 , respectively.As shown in Fig. 3c Correlated well with the band structure, the luminescent property may provide another evidence for the sulfur vacancy generation.Therefore, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 were examined at the excitation wavelength of 320 nm as shown in Fig. 3e, two major emission peaks locate at 435 and 630 nm.The emission peaks of pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 are both situated at 435 nm arising from the deep trap states near conduction band, which was claimed as S v by many authors regarding the nanocrystalline ZnS in the previous literature 21,33,34.The interband transition from Zn 3d orbitals to S 2p orbitals generate the emission.In addition, Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 has weaker PL peaks due to the formation of S v .In the presence of positively charged S v , electrons can be trapped, causing the photogenic electron-hole pairs to separate. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) was also carried out to further research the structural information and the sulfur vacancies of original Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1.As reveal in Fig. 3f,the normalized Zn K-edge XANES curves of pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 present dissimilar features in terms of location and intensity, illustrating the lattice framework of the acid-treated sample is obviously changed, due to the partial transformation of ZnS cubic phase to hexagonal phase, which is consistent with XRD results.Meanwhile, a distinct energy displacement at the rising edge of the XANES spectra was observed.The edge moves toward a lower energy by around 0.4 eV in contrast with the acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1.This edge shift is a representative indicator of valence-state variation from high-oxidation Zn 2 to reduced Zn ( 2) because of the formation of S v .It should be mentioned that this slight edge shift demonstrates that only a partial amount of the Zn (II) has been reduced 34,35. Furthermore, as demonstrated by Fourier transforms of Zn K-edge k 3weighted extended X-ray fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectra in Fig. 4a,b, pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S displays the main peak at 1.90 A, which can be assigned to the Zn-S bonds 21,36.Obviously, acid-treated samples possessed higher peak intensity and the threshold for the acid-treated samples was positioned at slightly higher energy (1.94 A), indicating a higher coordination number of zinc atoms and longer Zn-S bonds.The k 3 -weight EXAFS oscillation was fitted in a R space.The best fit of the scattering interaction can be obtained with a one-shell of Zn-S in the EXAFS spectrum (Table S1 of supporting information).The derived coordination number of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 and Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S is 3.852 and 3.464, respectively.This is because ZnS has undergone a partial transformation and the sulfur vacancy formed at the phase interface.In addition, it can be seen from the k 3 (k) plot of pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S in the Fig. 4a that the maximum in the envelope for two samples are both located at around 5.7 A -1 .But the amplitude of k 3 (k) oscillations of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 is slightly higher, indicating the lattices of acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S are more distorted than pristine, which highlights the formation of the new hexagonal phase.From the comparison in Fig. 4e,f, the location of the wavelet transforms maximum shifts from 6.3 A -1 for pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S to 6.7 A -1 for acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1, indicating the presence of S v in the acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S. Similar results appear on Cd K-edge XAFS spectrum (Fig. 4c,d).These XAFS results clearly point toward the phase transition and S v which formed at the two-phase grain boundary, which further confirms the XPS analysis 36373839.From the above discussion, it can be concluded that Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S with S v was created by acid treatment.In addition, Table S2 of supporting information shows composition molar ratio of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 analyzed by energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), the deficiency of sulfur content means the formation of S v , which confirms the results of EPR.Meanwhile, with the formation of S v , electron hole pairs separation were enhanced, which is consistent with the results of PL. The scheme for the formation of S v is proposed in Fig. 5.The zincblend structured Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S belongs to a cubic configuration.After the acid treatment, the crystal structure is reconstructed and slightly sulfur atoms at grain surface begin to escape (probably in form of H 2 S) under acidic environment.In such a condition, the phase of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S is transformed from sphalerite to wurtzite.Two-phase grain boundary with higher energy can induce plenty of sulfur vacancies accumulated.Usually, the presence of S v will facilitate the adsorption and activation of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules and promote the formation of CO and H 2 in the CO 2 reduction reaction (this part will be discussed later) 4,9. The photocatalytic gaseous evolution experiments were performed in K 2 SO 3 and KHCO 3 solution saturated with CO 2 under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).The CO and H 2 were detected as gaseous products during the reaction, and no formic acid, methanol or other liquid hydrocarbon compound was identified by nuclear paramagnetic resonance (Seen from Fig. S4of supporting information).As shown in Fig. 6a,b, pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S revealed a photocatalytic CO production and H 2 production with an average rate of 1.89 mol g -1 h -1 and 2129.46 mol g -1 h -1 , while the acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 showed 2.58 times and 1.85 times higher photocatalytic activity than that of the pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S with poor S v , respectively.Isotope experiment demonstrated that the carbon sources in the products are all from pristine CO 2 (Fig. S5 of supporting information).In addition, the Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S samples treated by different nitric acid all were dramatically improved photocatalytic activity with a CO and H 2 average yield of 4.88 mol g -1 h -1 and 3939.82mol g -1 h -1 except the superacid Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-0.25 samples.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was also measured under a monochromatic wavelength ( 420 nm, 1/2 19.1 nm) and calculated by the equation in Section 2.5.It was calculated the AQE for CO and H 2 evolution is 0.011 and 14.001, respectively.Fig. 6c,d shows the photocatalytic reduction performance of Zn x Cd 1- x S samples after pH 1 acid treatment.For samples with different Zn and Cd ratios, the effects by acidification are not same.For the Zn 0.3 Cd 0.7 S samples with low zinc content after acidification (Zn 0.3 Cd 0.7 S-1), CO production increased by 2.7 times and hydrogen production increased by 1.8 times.However, the CO production decreased over the Zn 0.7 Cd 0.3 S sample with high zinc content (Zn 0.7 Cd 0.3 S-1), despite that the hydrogen production increased merely by 1.5 times, comparable to Zn 0.3 Cd 0.7 S-1.In the case of low zinc, it tends to generate CO, while in the case of high zinc, it is easier to generate H 2 .Under the same conditions, Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S samples after acidification had the best catalytic performance. It should be noted that the EPR results showed that the vacancy concentration of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 was less than twice that of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S samples, but the catalytic performance was more than twice, which may cause the formation of new phase effectively regulated the energy band structure of the composite phase samples. To clarify how the phase transition and S v generation affects the photocatalytic activity, we began with the band structure analysis.As depicted in Fig. 7a, UV-vis absorption spectra can further ascertain the presence of new phase in the acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S (pH 1) by observing the obvious red shift with the decrease of acidification pH value.Through Tauc plots (h) n/2 A(h -Eg) (, , A, Eg, and n are the absorption coefficient, incident light frequency, constant, band-gap, and an integer, respectively), we use the Kubelka-Munk method to calculate the band gap of as-prepared Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S nanoparticle.Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S samples are indirect transition semiconductors so the value of n for Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S is 4. The Eg value of pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S samples are depicted in Fig. 7b.The increase in bandgap width may be due to the phase transition of ZnS from cubic to hexagonal from the previous work 30. The selected two representative samples Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 were further conducted the Mott-Schottky measurement to decide the band positions.The Eg of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 are detected to be 2.56 eV and 2.67 eV by Tauc plot, respectively 40.From the Mott-Schottky measurement, we obtained the flatband potential for pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S (Fig. 7c) to be -0.63V and -0.67 V, respectively.For n-type semiconductors, the flat band is close to the conduction band potential, so we approximately use the flat band potential as the conduction band position.Correspondingly, the density of charge carriers is calculated from the Mott Schottky curve, which recorded in Table S5 of supporting information.The density of charge carriers is 2.223 10 7 m -3 in Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1, more than two-fold than that of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S (1.071 10 7 m -3 ).The increased charge carriers density due to the formation of S v is beneficial to the photocatalytic reaction 21,41,42. Furthermore, combining Mott-Schottky results with the bandgap (Eg) from DRS spectra of samples, the CB values of pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 in Fig. 7c is -0.63 eV and -0.67 eV and the VB values of pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and acid-treated samples are estimated to be 1.93 eV and 2.00 eV, respectively.The relatively energy band position of pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 are shown in Fig. 7d according to the band gap data.Benefiting from the elevated conduction band, photo-induced electrons can generate a larger reduction potential in Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1.Meanwhile, S v can capture the electrons to inhibit the recombination with holes, resulting the improvement of its photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance. In order to illustrate the important role of phase transition and S v generation in promoting carrier transportation and separation, it is essential to choose time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) to research the lifetime of photogenerated carriers.As clarified in Fig. 8a and Table S3 of supporting information, the fitting function is y A 1 exp(-x/ 1 ) A 2 exp(-x/ 2 )y 0 , and the carrier lifetime of acidtreated samples was prolonged to be 4.791 ns compared with pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S (4.094 ns), which indicated that h -e -recombination was greatly inhibited in promoting the photocatalytic performance.This is mainly due to the presence of S v for capturing excited electrons near the bottom of CB and then perform trap-to-trap hopping for donor-acceptor recombination rather than jumping directly to the VB, thus prolonging the carrier lifetime.In addition, compared with the pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S, the acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 was beneficial to reduce the bulk-tosurface diffusion length for carriers to inhibit electron-hole from recombination. We further adopted positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) to understand the form and content of the defects in Fig. 8b.The 1 is attributed to the lattice defects, such as structural vacancies ( v ) or dislocation vacancies ( d ), while 2 and 3 are caused by the vacancies clusters which formed in the large voids (nanoscale) in materials. Notably, both 1 , 2 and 3 increased (Table S4 of supporting information) after acid-treatment, i.e., from 323 ps, 1.062 ns and 31.053ns to 363 ps, 1.425 ns and 37.041 ns, respectively, which accord with an increase in the defect dimension.Meanwhile, the 1 , 2 , and 3 relative intensities, demonstrated as I 1 , I 2 and I 3 , are also changed, revealing an increase in I 1 from 86.655 to 92.764 and a decrease in I 2 I 3 , which demonstrated that more single lattice S v than vacancy clusters are imported 28,39. To further prove the possibility of charge transfer between pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and acid-treated Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1, the photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out.As displayed in Fig. 8c, the photocurrent intensity of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 was higher than pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S, in consistent with the results of TRPL.All the above characterization results revealed that the performance of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 is owing to S v and phase structure, which greatly improved the separation and transportation of charge.Furthermore, the Nyquist plot electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in dark.As displayed in Fig. 8d and Table S7 of supporting information, the semicircular over acid-treated samples was smaller than pristine Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S at the high frequency region, confirming better conductivity and providing the lower recombination rate of carriers because of the formation of S v .For Zn x Cd 1-x S samples with different Zn and Cd ratios, as the incorporation of Zn augments, the band gap width of the catalyst will gradually increase and the conduction potential will be more positive 29,43,44.The positively moving conduction band has an adverse effect on the CO 2 reduction reaction, which requiring higher reduction potential than HER, thus inhibiting the CO 2 reduction reaction and enhancing HER 29,45.After the introduction of sulfur vacancies through acidification, the zinc content in Zn 0.7 Cd 0.3 S-1 samples was further increased with the loss of sulfur, leading to the inhibition of CO 2 reduction and the improvement of HER.In conclusion, Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S-1 samples with proper band gap width, appropriate conduction potential and sufficient S v had the best catalytic performance under the same conditions. To gain insight into the electronic structure, the density of states (DOS) are displayed in Fig. 9a.It is certified that V s -Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S presents a wider bandgap and a higher conduction band edge, well consistent with the experimental results in Fig. 7.In addition, the red boxed area in Fig. 9a shows that the introduction of S v significantly increases the electron density states near the conduction band edge, which is beneficial to the reduction reaction.To further investigate the reaction energy of each step in the CO 2 photoreduction reaction, the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) are carried out.The Gibbs free energies (G) for each reaction step is shown in Fig. 9b and the adsorption atomic model is shown in Fig. S8of supporting information.As displayed in Fig. 9b, the G values of CO 2 and intermediates adsorption on the surfaces of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S and V s -Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S are negative, indicating that the adsorption of CO 2 molecules on the surface is energy favorable.V s -Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S has a stronger capability for CO 2 adsorption owing to a lower G value (-0.33 eV) than that of Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S (-0.25 eV) (confirmed by CO 2 gas adsorption experiments, see Fig. S9 of supporting information).Subsequently, CO 2 molecules accepts one electron to form COOH, with the Gibbs free energy increases, this step can be seen as the rate-determining step.In particular, the energy barrier of 0.07 eV on the V s -containing surface is lower than the 0.08 eV of perfect Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S surface, suggesting a lower barrier of the catalytic reduction reaction rate in presence of V s .The second electron transfer to the adsorbed species is easily to implement because the conversion of COOH to CO is steeply downhill in G.In this step, more negative G (-0.48 eV) on the V s -containing surface suggests that the stabilization of CO species is encouraged in contrast with the pristine surface.This process gives the explanation why more production of CO in our experiment.In a word, the key holding for efficient CO 2 reduction to CO over Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S lies in the formation of the intermediate COOH from CO 2 .When V s are exposed on the surface, the barrier to form the key intermediate of COOH can be significantly reduced and thus beneficial for the overall process of CO 2 reduction."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
