(Fig. 1a(i)), and then was further treated by the hydrothermal process in the red phosphorus and nickel nitrate mixtures to synthesize 2D/2D-3D NP/ZIS nanohybrids (Fig. 1a(ii)).NP can be obtained by without addition of ZIS (Fig. 1a(iii)).The detailed information is shown in the Supporting Information.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements reveal that NP and ZIS have high crystallinity and can be assigned to the tetragonal phase Ni 12 P 5 (I4/m(87), PDF22-1190) and hexagonal phase ZnIn 2 S 4 (P-3 m1(164), PDF65-2023), respectively (Fig. 1b).The PXRD patterns of the NP/ZIS hybrids are ultimately identical to that of individual ZIS.No obviously diffraction peaks of NP can be found, which may be attributed to its small size with uniform dispersion or low content 323334.The weight ratio of NP in 1, 3, 5, 7 and 12 NP/ZIS hybrid was determined to be about 0.02 , 0.35 , 2.6 , 4.1 and 8.2 by ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) tests.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further demonstrates the surface chemical composition and valence state of NP, ZIS, and NP/ZIS (Fig. 2).Fig. 2a presents the survey spectra of NP, ZIS and 7 NP/ZIS hybrid, which indicates that no impurity peaks of other elements except Ni, P, S, In, Zn, O and C can be determined.The C and O signals could be assigned to the graphite conductive adhesive or the adsorbed gas 34.Fig. 2b-d present high-resolution XPS spectra of Zn 2p, In 3d and S 2p, respectively.Clearly, peaks in Zn 2p assigned to Zn 2 are observed at 1045.1 eV (Zn 2p 1/2 ) and 1022.0 eV (Zn 2p 3/2 ).Meanwhile, the peaks of In 3d at 452.4 eV (In 3d 3/2 ) and 444.8 eV (In 3d 5/2 ) and S 2p at 162.8 eV (S 2p 1/2 ) and 161.6 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) can be monitored to In 3 and S 2-of ZnIn 2 S 4 , respectively 29303132.It demonstrates that ZnIn 2 S 4 was successfully synthesized.Notably, compared with individual ZIS, the Zn, In and S peaks of NP/ZIS hybrid slightly shift to higher binding energies.It indicates that there are strong electronic interactions between NP and ZIS 35.Notably, Ni and P peaks can be monitored in the survey spectrum of 7 NP/ZIS hybrid.Ni 2p and P 2p high-resolution XPS spectra are displayed in Fig. 2e and Fig. 2f, respectively.The Ni 2p 3/2 spectrum of individual NP shows three peaks at 861.7, 856.1 and 853.1 eV, which can be assigned to the satellite peak of Ni(II), Ni 2 and the Ni (0 2) in Ni 12 P 5 , respectively.On the other hand, the peaks of P 2p centered at about 133.4 and 129.9 eV can be ascribed to the oxidized P species formed on the surface of nickel phosphide and the P -(0 1) in Ni 12 P 5 , respectively.The results indicate that the Ni-P bond is of covalent nature, which could contribute to the transfer of fast electrons and promote the improvement of photocatalytic H 2 production 35,36.Additionally, in contrast to Ni 2p and P 2p peaks of pure NP, it can be observed a slight shift of Ni 2p to a higher binding energy and P 2p to a lower binding energy in the 7 NP/ZIS sample, which indicates interactions between ZIS and NP rather than a simple physical mixture.The microstructure of the as-prepared sample was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).It is found that NP consists of multilayer and porous netted structure (Fig. 3a-c).The serried lattice fringes with the dspacing of 0.27 nm could be assigned to (310) crystal plane of tetragonal Ni 12 P 5 (Fig. 3d).The ZIS exhibits a 2D-3D hierarchical structure, which is consisted of regular 3D microsphere-like flowers (like marigold).The 3D microsphere-like flower is further comprised of 2D crisscross nanosheets (like petals) with the smooth surface (Fig. 3e-g).The relative broad lattice fringes with the d-spacing of 0.32 nm are corresponding to (102) crystal plane of hexagonal phase ZnIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 3h).When 3 NP is coupled with ZIS, the external morphology of 3 NP/ZIS hybrid is similar to that of individual ZIS (Figure S1).However, when the content of NP is increased to 7, it can be found that some 2D nano-flakes are loaded on the surface of ZIS nanosheets (Fig. 3i-k).Plentiful nano-flakes can be found to cover the surface of ZIS nanosheets when the content of NP is further increased to 12 (Figure S2).The 2D/2D hybrid structures are further investigated by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM).Two types of and intimately contacted distinctive lattice fringes with a boundary can be clearly observed in Fig. 3l.The lattice spacings of nanosheets and small nano-flakes are 0.32 and 0.27 nm, which can be ascribed to (102) and (310) crystal plans of ZIS and NP, respectively.Moreover, EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) images were further confirmed the composition and element distribution of NP/ZIS hybrid.The 7 NP/ ZIS hybrid consists of Zn, In, S, Ni and P elements (Fig. 3m and Figure S3), which enrich the entire microsphere-like flowers.These are in accordance with PXRD and XPS results (Fig. 1b and Fig. 2).Notably, an interesting phenomenon can be observed that many mesoporous holes appeared on the surfaces of ZIS nanosheets after deposition of NP (directed by the yellow arrows in Fig. 3k) in contrast to individual ZIS (Fig. 3g), which could increase the surface area and bring defects (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4a, adsorption-desorption curves of ZIS and 7 NP/ ZIS both display type IV isotherms, implying the existence of porous structures.The average pore sizes of ZIS and 7 NP/ZIS are about 13.7 and 9.2 nm, respectively.Specifically, the porous structure of ZIS comes from 2D crisscross nanosheets of ZIS; After NP nano-flakes are loaded on the surface of ZIS nanosheets, pore size, pore volume and surface area of NP/ZIS should be reduced due to coverage of NP nano-flakes.Interestingly, the BJH pore volume and BET surface area of 7 NP/ZIS are increased from 0.09 cm 3 g -1 and 68.5 m 2 g -1 to 0.25 cm 3 g -1 and 112.3 m 2 g -1 , respectively.These further confirm the formation of new small pores in NP/ZIS.To further understand the defect of NP/ZIS hybrid microstructure, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was performed (Fig. 4b).No obvious EPR signal can be detected for individual ZIS.However, a distinct signal with 2.003 of g factor can be obviously found over NP/ZIS.It indicates that V Zn is formed over NP/ZIS on the base of g value 19.On the other hand, the weight ratio of Zn in NP/ZIS (14.4 ) is indeed less than the theoretical weight ratio of Zn in ZnIn 2 S 4 (15.5 ).Actually, the atomic ratio (0.46:1:2.01) of Zn:In:S in NP/ZIS was obtained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).Moreover, the results of XPS and EDX characterizations also indicate that the content of Zn in NP/ZIS is lower than the theoretical content of Zn in ZIS (Fig. 2 and Figure S3).Thus, the consistent results combined with the ESR result can confirm the formation of V Zn in NP/ZIS.The Zn vacancy and many mesopores on ZIS nanosheets are probably due to powerful oxidizing ability of red phosphorus and the drastic process of the hydrothermal reaction.In the light of the above characterization and results, it could be concluded that noble-metal free NP/ZIS nanohybrid with 2D/2D-3D hierarchical heterostructure and V Zn can be fabricated by the hydrothermal method. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the photocatalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol (ArCH 2 OH) into H 2 and benzaldehyde (ArCHO) under visible light illumination (Fig. 5a).Firstly, the control groups (photolysis and dark reaction) were tested and exhibited no ArCHO and H 2 production.Individual ZIS exhibits low ArCHO production (67.8 mol h -1 ) and H 2 evolution (55.6 mol h -1 ) rates.The low selectivity of the pristine ZIS is mainly because hydrobenzoin is formed via the C -C coupling reaction, which has been demonstrated over ZIS by the previous report 11.Although obvious photocatalytic activity is invisible over individual NP, the NP/ZIS hybrids display significantly photocatalytic activities.Especially, the 7 NP/ZIS hybrid exhibits the most distinguished reactivity.The rates of ArCHO production and H 2 evolution can increase to 697.3 and 680.5 mol h -1 , respectively, which are about 10.3 and 12.2 times higher than that of individual ZIS, respectively.Simultaneously, the highest selectivity (94.9 ) can also be obtained over 7 NP/ZIS among NP/ZIS hybrids.It mainly because the low H 2 -evolution overpotential of NP can promote H 2 production, and the photoexcited electrons and holes can be separated and transferred to the targeted location, facilitating the process of ArCH 2 OH dehydrogenation.Moreover, the reactive trend of NP/ZIS hybrid photocatalyst closely follows its absorbance (Fig. 5b), implying bandgap-transition-dependent H 2 production action.Noticeably, under simulated sunlight illumination, the rates of ArCHO production (selectivity of 91.5 ) and H 2 evolution could increase up to 1190.3 and 1104.9 mol h -1 , respectively.A high AQE (apparent quantum efficiency) of about 11.73 is obtained at 420 5 nm.It is superior to the reported photocatalysts: Pt x /Zn 3 In 2 S 6 6, Ni:ZnIn 2 S 4 11, Co/CdS NRs 27,CeO 2 /ZnIn 2 S 4 28, and Au/ZnIn 2 S 4 29.The primary data are summarized in Table S1.To investigate the stability of the as-prepared NP/ZIS, the XRD, SEM and ESR before and after photocatalytic cycle reaction had been performed.As shown in Figure S4-7, after four times recycle, the photocatalytic activity, morphology, Zn vacancy and crystal phase of NP/ZIS are all not changed obviously.The results indicate that the NP/ZIS hybrid is an efficient and stable photocatalyst for conversion of ArCH 2 OH into ArCHO with high selectivity and H 2 under mild reaction conditions.Furthermore, the H 2 evolution of ArCH 2 OH splitting has strong relation to the solvent.The results indicate that the order of H 2 production on 7 NP/ZIS in different solvents is benzotrifluoride (BTF) acetonitrile cyclohexan dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Fig. 6a and Figure S8). To demonstrate the contributions of NP and V Zn to the enhanced photocatalytic activity, the Ni 12 P 5 /ZnIn 2 S 4 composite without V Zn (NP//ZIS) and V Zn -modified ZnIn 2 S 4 (V-ZIS) 19 were synthesized (Figure S9-11).Due to V Zn in NP/ZIS, Pt/V-ZIS, NiO x /V-ZIS and NiS x /V-ZIS were also prepared for comparison by using the as-prepared V-ZIS as substrate and the reported method 6,34.Clearly, the 7 NP/ZIS hybrid shows the highest photocatalytic activity among these photocatalysts (Fig. 6a).These results indicate that the photocatalytic activity of the ZIS can be improved by creating V Zn and loading cocatalyst (NP, Pt, NiO x and NiS x ), and significantly enhanced by simultaneously decorating V Zn and noble-metal free cocatalyst NP. To further illustrate the superiority of this dual-function photocatalytic redox reaction system in thermodynamics and kinetics, the control groups were carried out and shown in (Fig. 6b).It is inspiring that the photocatalytic H 2 production rate of 7 NP/ZIS hybrid is extremely enhanced by splitting of ArCH 2 OH, which is about 15825.6 times higher than that by splitting of water (H 2 O).It is known that Gibbs free energy of ArCH 2 OH splitting (ArCH 2 OH ArCHO H 2 , G 28 kJ mol -1 ) is much less than that of water splitting ( 6,23.According to the relationship between Gibbs free energy and reaction equilibrium constant (G -RTlnK), the reaction equilibrium constants of ArCH 2 OH splitting and water splitting are about 1.2 10 -5 and 1.9 10 -42 , respectively.Therefore, from the view of thermodynamics, the reaction of ArCH 2 OH splitting is much more easily to do than that of water splitting. From the view of kinetics, it can be seen that the photocatalytic H 2 production rate of 7 NP/ZIS is about 12.2 times as large as that of ZIS (Fig. 6b).It indicates that noble-metal free NP co-catalyst and V Zn can effectively promote photocatalytic H 2 evolution.Notably, the kinetics of photocatalysis is mainly determined by light absorption, charge separation-transportation and surface reactive sites (or specific surface area).Therefore, in order to understand profoundly the influence factor of the kinetics, a series of experimental techniques were performed.Firstly, the surface area and BJH pore volume of NP/ZIS are increased by 1.6 and 2.8 times after the deposition of NP on ZIS, respectively.Obviously, larger surface area and pore volume would favorite reaction kinetics, while the enhanced activity cannot all ascribe to them.On the base of UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) data (Figure S12 and Figure S13) and the Kubelka-Munk equation 37, although the black NP shows that it can absorb all visible light, the bandgap energy (E g ) of 7 NP/ZIS (2.36 eV) is very close to that of individual ZIS (2.44 eV).It implies that the intrinsic absorption of the bulk ZIS has not been changed. To further study the energy band structure, Mott-Schottky plots of NP, ZIS and 7 NP/ZIS are tested under different frequency (Figure S14-16).NP, ZIS and NP/ZIS hybrid display distinct flat bands with band energies at ca. -0.45, -0.48 and -0.64 V (vs Ag/AgCl), respectively.It indicates that photogenerated charge carriers can be transferred from ZIS to NP.Additionally, the n-type semiconductor characteristic of ZIS has not changed after the deposition of NP.Due to the potential of Ag/ AgCl is about 0.2 V (vs NHE) and the flat band of an n-type semiconductor is close (about -0.1 eV) to its conduction band (CB) 38, the CBs of ZIS and 7 NP/ZIS hybrid are ca.-0.38 eV and -0.54 eV (vs NHE), respectively.Consequently, the valence bands (VBs) of ZIS and 7 NP/ZIS hybrid are about 2.06 and 1.82 eV (vs NHE), respectively.Clearly, the CB and VB of 7 NP/ZIS hybrid are uplifted by about 0.16 and 0.24 eV, respectively, in contrast to that of individual ZIS (Fig. 7a). The elevated CB and increased VB width over NP/ZIS hybrid imply that the photogenerated holes (h ) have faster mobility and can be consumed better 12.Both two aspects of the energy band structure are conducive to prohibiting the recombination of photoexcited charges, and thus contribute to the enhancement of photocatalytic performance.Based on the previous report 19, for V Zn -modified ZnIn 2 S 4 , the charge density at the around S could be obviously increased by implanting V Zn .This would give rise to electrons transition easily from VB to CB and electrons centralization around V Zn , which would be very advantageous for separation and transfer of charge carriers 19.Consequently, on the basis of the equation (N D (2/e 0 ) dU FL /d(1/C 2 ) 39, where 0 is absolute dielectric constant, e is elementary charge, is dielectric constant and is about 4.7 for ZIS 40, and C is the capacitance), the carrier density (N D ) was also be calculated.Here, NP/ZIS indeed exhibits a higher N D (1.32 10 20 cm -3 ) than ZIS (9.89 10 19 cm -3 ).Especially, for n-type semiconductors, the increase in N D is associated with increased electrical conductivity () according to the following function 41: eN D , where is the mobility of the carriers.Notably, increased conductivity is significantly favorable for promoting charge carrier separation and transportation. To further confirm the conductivity and separation-transportation of photoexcited charges, photoelectrochemical (PEC, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photocurrent transient decay and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV)) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were carried out (Fig. 7b-f).Fig. 7b exhibits TRPL patterns of 7 NP/ZIS hybrid and individual ZIS, which has been demonstrated to be a useful tool to study the specific charge carrier dynamics of nanomaterials.The TRPL decay plots are fitted via biexponential kinetics function (I (t) A 1 exp(-t/ 1 ) A 2 exp(-t/ 2 )) 42, in which two decay components are derived.Specifically, 1 and 2 are come from the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers in the vacancies or other defects and the recombination of free excitons, respectively 42,43. Clearly, 1 of NP/ZIS hybrid is longer than that of ZIS, indicating that large defects present in the NP/ZIS, which has been verified by the EPR technique (Fig. 4b).Additionally, the loading of NP on ZIS reduces 2 to 0.86 ns for NP/ZIS hybrid compared with ZIS, suggesting better separation and transportation of free excitons.Moreover, the average lifetime () values of NP/ZIS hybrid and individual ZIS were also calculated via the following function: )/(A 1 1 A 2 2 ) 39, and demonstrated to be about 0.99 and 1.42 ns, respectively.The obvious reduction of the average lifetime in the NP/ZIS hybrid reveals the establishment of an electron transportation channel from ZIS to NP in a non-radiative pathway 42434445.It is greatly favorable for restriction of photogenerated charge recombination and charge transportation in the hetero-layered NP/ZIS heterostructure, which can be confirmed by their EIS (Fig. 7c) and PL (Fig. 7d) spectra.The 7 NP/ZIS hybrid presents a smaller EIS arc radius and a lower PL intensity than that of individual ZIS.Notably, the PL intensity of the NP/ZIS hybrid is lower than ZIS and the mixture of ZIS and NP (ZIS NP, 4.1 NP was added because the real weight ratio of NP in 7 NP/ZIS is 4.1 detected by ICP), indicating the decrease of the NP/ZIS PL intensity is not ascribed to the non-luminescent NP wholly, but is due to the restrained recombination of the photoexcited charge carriers partly.In addition, the related electron-transportation rate constant (R etc ) in the NP/ZIS hybrid has been calculated to be about 3.25 10 8 S -1 by using the following equation 43: R etc(ZISNP/ZIS) 1/ (NP/ZIS) -1/ (ZIS) . The efficient separation and transportation of photoexcited charges over NP/ZIS photocatalyst could be further demonstrated by transient photocurrent responses (Fig. 7e).Under visible light illumination, 7 NP/ZIS hybrid exhibits higher photocurrent than individual ZIS.Interestingly, for ZIS, the photocurrent intensity increases upon opening the shutter and reaches a max value within 26 s, suggesting that the charging-discharging process exists in ZIS 46.However, the photocurrent of the NP/ZIS hybrid reaches its peak under the moment of light-on.It indicates that photogenerated charges can be fast separated and transported over NP/ZIS hybrid in contrast to ZIS.In addition, the photocurrent of NP/ZIS hybrid then decays a little and quickly reaches steady state with the prolonging of irradiation time (a little attenuation could be ascribed to that the photogenerated electrons are captured by dissolved oxygen) 46, while the photocurrent of ZIS decays slowly with illumination of visible light, which could be due to photocorrosion of metal sulfides 6.It demonstrates that the NP/ZIS hybrid photocatalyst is stable under visible light illumination.It is consistent with its activity and anti-corrosive quality (Figure S4-7).Moreover, to highlight the effect of NP on the H 2 -production kinetics of ZIS, LSV curves of ZIS and 7 NP/ZIS hybrid were also detected under visible light irradiation (Fig. 7f).Compared to that of individual ZIS, the cathodic current density of 7 NP/ZIS hybrid shows an obvious enhancement in the potential region of -1.4 V to 0 V (vs.Ag/AgCl), indicating that NP nano-flakes are significant active sites which can greatly boost the photocatalytic reactivity 6,46.It should be noted that 7 NP/ZIS also have more ability than V-ZIS for separating and transferring photogenerated charges, which has been confirmed by PEC tests (Figure S17 and Figure S18).In a word, both PL and PEC measurements confirm that NP/ZIS can significantly improve the charge separation-transportation and the subsequent H 2 evolution from ArCH 2 OH dehydrogenation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for ZIS, V-ZIS and NP were carried out through the Materials Studio (BIOVIA V2017, American).First, we focused on the structural properties of the NP, after the geometry optimization, we get the lattice constants is (8.613, 8.613, 5.096 A) which is similar to the theoretical value (8.646, 8.646, 5.07 A)To study the electronic properties, we calculate the band structure of the structure, and the results are plotted in Figure S19.It is found to be metallic as the partially occupied bands cross the Fermi level in the Brillouin zone, and the NP has no spin polarization. The work function is a crucial parameter in estimating the charge transfer direction between the interfaces of two nanomaterials.Then, and4.54 eV, respectively.Obviously, the work function of NP is lower than that of ZIS and V-ZIS, an Ohmic contact between NP and ZIS or V-ZIS will be formed 9.With respect to the Fermi level (E F ) of the Pt (5.65 eV) is lower than that of ZIS and V-ZIS ( E vac -E F , E vac is the vacuum level, Figure S23), the E F of the NP is higher than that of ZIS and V-ZIS.It is known that, after an n-type semiconductor contact with a semiconductor or a metal, the charge carriers (electrons) will transfer from the material with a higher E F to the other material with a lower E F until the two Fermi levels reach the same level.The surface energy bands bend downwards or upwards and the build-in internal electric field is formed on their interfaces, which are the critical factors for separating and transporting the photogenerated electrons and holes.In that case, for NP/ZIS hybrid with V Zn , because V-ZIS NP , the charge carriers will transfer from NP to V-ZIS via NP/ZIS interface (Scheme 1a).Thus, the carrier density (N D ) of NP is reduced and the N D of V-ZIS in NP/ZIS hybrid is increased.It is in accordance with the above experimental values.When the equilibrium of this space charge region is established, the surface energy band of V-ZIS bends downwards to form a reverse barrier layer and the build-in internal electric field with a direction of NPV-ZIS is formed on the NP/ZIS interfaces (Scheme 1b).The Coulomb attraction between the positive electricity fields on the side of NP and the photogenerated electrons on the CB of V-ZIS, the V Zn defect level (Vs) and the downward band bending can significantly promote separation and transportation of the photogenerated electrons synergistically (Scheme 1c).Similarly, the downward band bending and the Coulomb attraction are also formed in the NP/ZIS interfaces without V Zn (Scheme 1d-f).However, because Pt V-ZIS , the surface energy band of V-ZIS bends upwards to form a barrier layer and the build-in internal electric field with a direction of V-ZISPt is formed on the Pt/V-ZIS interfaces (Scheme 1g-i).In this case, due to the barrier layer and the Coulombic repulsive force between the build-in internal electric field and the photogenerated electrons (e -) on the conduction band (CB) of V-ZIS, the photogenerated electrons is difficult and slow transportation from the CB of V-ZIS to the Pt surface.Therefore, the separation and transportation efficiencies of the photogenerated charge carriers of these photocatalysts follow the order: NP/ZIS NP//ZIS Pt/V-ZIS, which is consistent with their photocatalytic activities. In addition, EPR was used to investigate the process of ArCH 2 OH dehydrogenation (Figure S24).The sextuple peaks (intensity 1:1:1:1:1:1, a H 22.4 G, A N 14.8 G) assigned to the characteristic peaks of DMPOcarbon-centered radicals 38 can be observed over both ZIS and NP/ZIS under visible light irradiation.Moreover, 7 NP/ZIS hybrid exhibits a higher intensity of EPR signals than individual ZIS, suggesting that much more intermediates are produced on NP/ZIS.This also confirms that NP/ ZIS is an efficient photocatalyst for separation and transportation of photoexcited charges, because the formation of carbon-centered radicals needs the involvement of photogenerated holes 34.This result is consistent with the above photocatalytic activities and PEC results.The isotopic tracer method was performed to further understand ArCH 2 OH dehydrogenation (Figure S25).It can be demonstrated by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC -MS) spectra that the product of ArCD 2 OH dehydrogenation is mainly ArCDO.That is to say, in this dual-function reaction system, H atoms of C-H and OH -in ArCH 2 OH are dehydrogenated.On the other hand, the solvent benzotrifluoride cannot be dehydrogenized to produce H 2 .It indicates that the evolved H 2 comes from the reactant ArCH 2 OH.Therefore, the improved photocatalytic performance of H 2 evolution and fine chemicals are simultaneously achieved by conversion of ArCH 2 OH over noble-metal-free NP/ZIS photocatalyst under visible light illumination, and an illustration of the mechanism is proposed as shown in Scheme 1c.Under visible light illumination, the electrons are photoexcited from the VB of V-ZIS into the CB.At the same time, the equal numbers of holes are generated in the CB.Then, H atoms of C-H and OH -in ArCH 2 OH are dehydrogenated by the photogenerated holes and to produce ArCHO via free radical reaction.On the other hand, the photoexcited electrons migrate from the CB to the NP via CB Vs NP and CB NP, and react with the dehydrogenated H to form H 2 .During the photocatalytic redox reactions, the enlarged surface area and porous structure can increase reactive sites; the Vs, the build-in internal electric field and the downward band bending can significantly improve electrical conductivity, charge carrier separation and transportation.Thus, biomass-relevant alcohols can be efficiently converted into aldehydes and H 2 over the as-synthesized NP/ZIS photocatalyst under visible light illumination. It is known that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and N 2 fixation are crucial solar-to-chemical energy pathways to address greenhouse effect and energy crisis 4748495051.However, CO 2 reduction and N 2 fixation as like water splitting into H 2 are suffered from thermodynamics and kinetics.For instance, N 2 3H 2 O 3/2O 2 2NH 3 , G 0 681.1 kJ mol -1 ; CO 2 2H 2 O 2O 2 CH 4 , G 0 818.18kJ mol -1 .To solve these barriers, hole-sacrificial reagents and multifarious photocatalysts have been explored.However, developing new reaction system and/or photocatalysts meet the expectation are still challenges.Based on our complete utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes in one reaction system, Coupling CO 2 reduction and N 2 fixation with alcohol oxidation may be alternatively effective approach to improve their photocatalytic reactivity (Fig. 8a-b).To test the idea, we compared NP/ZIS-H 2 O and NP/ZIS-ArCH 2 OH groups for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and N 2 fixation under visible light (the detail procedure in Supporting information).It is noteworthy that, in H 2 O reaction system, the 7 NP/ZIS exhibits very low photocatalytic activity for both CO 2 reduction and N 2 fixation (Fig. 8c-d).However, in ArCH 2 OH reaction system, not only ArCH 2 OH can be transformed into ArCHO, but also CO 2 and N 2 can be efficient converted into value-added chemicals such as CH 4 and NH 3 .In this dual-function photoredox reaction system, the photogenerated holes and electrons are both utilized.The holes are used to oxidize ArCH 2 OH, and the electrons are employed to reduce CO 2 and N 2 .Moreover, compared to the H 2 O reaction system, the thermodynamics of this dual-function reaction system is significantly improved.For instance, N 2 3ArCH 2 OH 3ArCHO 2NH 3 , G 0 51.1 kJ mol -1 ; CO 2 4ArCH 2 OH 4ArCHO 2H 2 O CH 4 , G 0 -18.5 kJ mol -1 .Therefore, although the used photocatalysts are both 7 NP/ZIS, CO 2 and N 2 can be more efficient transformed in ArCH 2 OH reaction system than in tranditional H 2 O reaction system.It is hope that the reactants, efficient photoredox reactions and mechanisms can be extended and unveiled in the following study, and this strategy can provide a new horizon toward solar-to-chemical energy conversion."}, {"llm generation": "Visible light", "source": "Visible-lightdriven photocatalyst NP/ZIS showed remarkable reactivity and stability for benzaldehyde production and H 2 evolution by the photocatalytic selective conversion of benzyl alcohol.", "context": "In summary, noble-metal-free Ni 12 P 5 /ZnIn 2 S 4 nanohybrid with 2D/ 2D-3D hierarchical heterostructure and zinc vacancies (NP/ZIS) has been successfully fabricated by a hydrothermal method.Visible-lightdriven photocatalyst NP/ZIS showed remarkable reactivity and stability for benzaldehyde production and H 2 evolution by the photocatalytic selective conversion of benzyl alcohol.Under simulated sunlight illumination, the rates of benzaldehyde production (selectivity of 91.5 ) and H 2 evolution could increase up to 1190.3 and 1104.9 mol h -1 , respectively.Compared to pure water splitting and individual ZIS, the thermodynamics and kinetics of H 2 production over 7 NP/ZIS are enhanced by 15825.6 and 12.2 times, respectively.Notably, the quantum efficiency of H 2 evolution can reach up to 11.73 ( 420 5 nm).The outstanding performance is due to the synergic advantages of enlarged surface area and porous structure, generated defect state (zinc vacancies), and improved NP co-catalyst.Moreover, simultaneous photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (or N 2 fixation) and alcohol oxidation can also be realized over the NP/ZIS by directly utilization of the photogenerated holes and electrons under visible light.This work shows a promising strategy to design noble-metal-free photocatalysts with high efficiency and stability through simple cocatalyst and vacancies implanting for solar energy conversion, but also sheds light on a promising and burgeoning photocatalytic reaction system: solar-driven reforming of biomass-relevant substrates to fine chemicals and H 2 , CO 2 reduction, and N 2 fixation.

treated by the hydrothermal process in the red phosphorus and nickel nitrate mixtures to synthesize 2D/2D-3D NP/ZIS nanohybrids (Fig. 1a(ii)).NP can be obtained by without addition of ZIS (Fig. 1a(iii)).The detailed information is shown in the Supporting Information.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements reveal that NP and ZIS have high crystallinity and can be assigned to the tetragonal phase Ni 12 P 5 (I4/m(87), PDF22-1190) and hexagonal phase ZnIn 2 S 4 (P-3 m1(164), PDF65-2023), respectively (Fig. 1b).The PXRD patterns of the NP/ZIS hybrids are ultimately identical to that of individual ZIS.No obviously diffraction peaks of NP can be found, which may be attributed to its small size with uniform dispersion or low content 323334.The weight ratio of NP in 1, 3, 5, 7 and 12 NP/ZIS hybrid was determined to be about 0.02 , 0.35 , 2.6 , 4.1 and 8.2 by ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) tests.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further demonstrates the surface chemical composition and valence state of NP, ZIS, and NP/ZIS (Fig. 2).Fig. 2a presents the survey spectra of NP, ZIS and 7 NP/ZIS hybrid, which indicates that no impurity peaks of other elements except Ni, P, S, In, Zn, O and C can be determined.The C and O signals could be assigned to the graphite conductive adhesive or the adsorbed gas 34.Fig. 2b-d present high-resolution XPS spectra of Zn 2p, In 3d and S 2p, respectively.Clearly, peaks in Zn 2p assigned to Zn 2 are observed at 1045.1 eV (Zn 2p 1/2 ) and 1022.0 eV (Zn 2p 3/2 ).Meanwhile, the peaks of In

that ZnIn 2 S 4 was successfully synthesized.Notably, compared with individual ZIS, the Zn, In and S peaks of NP/ZIS hybrid slightly shift to higher binding energies.It indicates that there are strong electronic interactions between NP and ZIS 35.Notably, Ni and P peaks can be monitored in the survey spectrum of 7 NP/ZIS hybrid.Ni 2p and P 2p high-resolution XPS spectra are displayed in Fig. 2e and Fig. 2f, respectively.The Ni 2p 3/2 spectrum of individual NP shows three peaks at 861.7, 856.1 and 853.1 eV, which can be assigned to the satellite peak of Ni(II), Ni 2 and the Ni (0 2) in Ni 12 P 5

5 , respectively.The results indicate that the Ni-P bond is of covalent nature, which could contribute to the transfer of fast electrons and promote the improvement of photocatalytic H 2 production 35,36.Additionally, in contrast to Ni 2p and P 2p peaks of pure NP, it can be observed a slight shift of Ni 2p to a higher binding energy and P 2p to a lower binding energy in the 7 NP/ZIS sample, which indicates interactions between ZIS and NP rather than a simple physical mixture.The microstructure of the as-prepared sample was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).It is found that NP consists of multilayer and porous netted structure (Fig. 3a-c).The serried lattice fringes with the dspacing of 0.27 nm could be assigned to (310) crystal plane of tetragonal Ni 12 P 5 (Fig. 3d).The ZIS exhibits a 2D-3D hierarchical structure, which is consisted of regular 3D microsphere-like flowers (like marigold).The 3D microsphere-like flower is further comprised of 2D crisscross nanosheets (like petals) with the smooth surface (Fig. 3e-g).The relative broad lattice fringes with the d-spacing of 0.32 nm are corresponding to (102) crystal plane of hexagonal phase ZnIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 3h).When 3 NP is coupled with ZIS, the external morphology of 3 NP/ZIS hybrid is similar to that of individual ZIS (Figure S1).However, when the content of NP is increased to 7, it can be found that some 2D nano-flakes are loaded on the surface of ZIS nanosheets (Fig. 3i-k).Plentiful nano-flakes can be found to cover the surface of ZIS nanosheets when the content of NP is further increased to 12 (Figure S2).The 2D/2D hybrid structures are further investigated by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM).Two types of and intimately contacted distinctive lattice fringes with a boundary can be clearly observed in Fig. 3l.The lattice spacings of nanosheets and small nano-flakes are 0.32 and 0.27 nm, which can be ascribed to (102) and (310) crystal plans of ZIS and NP, respectively.Moreover, EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) images were further confirmed the composition and element distribution of NP/ZIS hybrid.The 7 NP/ ZIS hybrid consists of Zn, In, S, Ni and P elements (Fig. 3m and Figure S3), which enrich the entire microsphere-like flowers.These are in accordance with PXRD and XPS results (Fig. 1b and Fig. 2).Notably, an interesting phenomenon can be observed that many mesoporous holes appeared on the surfaces of ZIS nanosheets after deposition of NP (directed by the yellow arrows in Fig. 3k) in contrast to individual ZIS (Fig. 3g), which could increase the surface area and bring defects (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4a, adsorption-desorption curves of ZIS and 7 NP/ ZIS both display type IV isotherms, implying the existence of porous structures.The average pore sizes of ZIS and 7 NP/ZIS are about 13.7 and 9.2 nm, respectively.Specifically, the porous structure of ZIS comes from 2D crisscross nanosheets of ZIS; After NP nano-flakes are loaded on the surface of ZIS nanosheets, pore size, pore volume and surface area of NP/ZIS should be reduced due to coverage of NP nano-flakes.Interestingly, the BJH pore volume and BET surface area of 7 NP/ZIS are increased from 0.09 cm 3 g -1 and 68.5 m 2 g -1 to 0.25 cm 3 g -1 and 112.3 m 2 g -1 , respectively.These further confirm the formation of new small pores in NP/ZIS.To further understand the defect of NP/ZIS hybrid microstructure, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was performed (Fig. 4b).No obvious EPR signal can be detected for individual ZIS.However, a distinct signal with 2.003 of g factor can be obviously found over NP/ZIS.It indicates that V Zn is formed over NP/ZIS on the base of g value 19.On the other hand, the weight ratio of Zn in NP/ZIS (14.4 ) is indeed less than the theoretical weight ratio of Zn in ZnIn 2 S 4 (15.5 ).Actually, the atomic ratio (0.46:1:2.01) of Zn:In:S in NP/ZIS was obtained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).Moreover, the results of XPS and EDX characterizations also indicate that the content of Zn in NP/ZIS is lower than the theoretical content of Zn in ZIS (Fig. 2 and Figure S3).Thus, the consistent results combined with the ESR result can confirm the formation of V Zn in NP/ZIS.The Zn vacancy and many mesopores on ZIS nanosheets are probably due to powerful oxidizing ability of red phosphorus and the drastic process of the hydrothermal reaction.In the light of the above characterization and results, it could be concluded that noble-metal free NP/ZIS nanohybrid with 2D/2D-3D hierarchical heterostructure and V Zn can be fabricated by the hydrothermal method. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the photocatalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol (ArCH 2 OH) into H 2 and benzaldehyde (ArCHO) under visible light illumination (Fig. 5a).Firstly, the control groups (photolysis and dark reaction) were tested and exhibited no ArCHO and H 2 production.Individual ZIS exhibits low ArCHO production (67.8 mol h -1 ) and H 2 evolution (55.6 mol h -1 ) rates.The low selectivity of the pristine ZIS is mainly because hydrobenzoin is formed via the C -C coupling reaction, which has been demonstrated over ZIS by the previous report 11.Although obvious photocatalytic activity is invisible over individual NP, the NP/ZIS hybrids display significantly photocatalytic activities.Especially, the 7 NP/ZIS hybrid exhibits the most distinguished reactivity.The rates of ArCHO production and H 2 evolution can increase to 697.3 and 680.5 mol h -1 , respectively, which are about 10.3 and 12.2 times higher than that of individual ZIS, respectively.Simultaneously, the highest selectivity (94.9 ) can also be obtained over 7 NP/ZIS among NP/ZIS hybrids.It mainly because the low H 2 -evolution overpotential of NP can promote H 2 production, and the photoexcited electrons and holes can be separated and transferred to the targeted location, facilitating the process of ArCH 2 OH dehydrogenation.Moreover, the reactive trend of NP/ZIS hybrid photocatalyst closely follows its absorbance (Fig. 5b), implying bandgap-transition-dependent H 2 production action.Noticeably, under simulated sunlight illumination, the rates of ArCHO production (selectivity of 91.5 ) and H 2 evolution could increase up to 1190.3 and 1104.9 mol h -1 , respectively.A high AQE (apparent quantum efficiency) of about 11.73 is obtained at 420 5 nm.It is superior to the reported photocatalysts: Pt x /Zn 3 In 2 S 6 6, Ni:ZnIn 2 S 4 11, Co/CdS NRs 27,CeO 2 /ZnIn 2 S 4 28, and Au/ZnIn 2 S 4 29.The primary data are summarized in Table S1.To investigate the stability of the as-prepared NP/ZIS, the XRD, SEM and ESR before and after photocatalytic cycle reaction had been performed.As shown in Figure S4-7, after four times recycle, the photocatalytic activity, morphology, Zn vacancy and crystal phase of NP/ZIS are all not changed obviously.The results indicate that the NP/ZIS hybrid is an efficient and stable photocatalyst for conversion of ArCH 2 OH into ArCHO with high selectivity and H 2 under mild reaction conditions.Furthermore, the H 2 evolution of ArCH 2 OH splitting has strong relation to the solvent.The results indicate that the order of H 2 production on 7 NP/ZIS in different solvents is benzotrifluoride (BTF) acetonitrile cyclohexan dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Fig. 6a and Figure S8). To demonstrate the contributions of NP and V Zn to the enhanced photocatalytic activity, the Ni 12 P 5 /ZnIn 2 S 4 composite without V Zn (NP//ZIS) and V Zn -modified ZnIn 2 S 4 (V-ZIS) 19 were synthesized (Figure S9-11).Due to V Zn in NP/ZIS, Pt/V-ZIS, NiO x /V-ZIS and NiS x /V-ZIS were also prepared for comparison by using the as-prepared V-ZIS as substrate and the reported method 6,34.Clearly, the 7 NP/ZIS hybrid shows the highest photocatalytic activity among these photocatalysts (Fig. 6a).These results indicate that the photocatalytic activity of the ZIS can be improved by creating V Zn and loading cocatalyst (NP, Pt, NiO x and NiS x ), and significantly enhanced by simultaneously decorating V Zn and noble-metal free cocatalyst NP. To further illustrate the superiority of this dual-function photocatalytic redox reaction system in thermodynamics and kinetics, the control groups were carried out and shown in (Fig. 6b).It is inspiring that the photocatalytic H 2 production rate of 7 NP/ZIS hybrid is extremely enhanced by splitting of ArCH 2 OH, which is about 15825.6 times higher than that by splitting of water (H 2 O).It is known that Gibbs free energy of ArCH 2 OH splitting (ArCH 2 OH ArCHO H 2 , G 28 kJ mol -1 ) is much less than that of water splitting ( 6,23.According to the relationship between Gibbs free energy and reaction equilibrium constant (G -RTlnK), the reaction equilibrium constants of ArCH 2 OH splitting and water splitting are about 1.2 10 -5 and 1.9 10 -42 , respectively.Therefore, from the view of thermodynamics, the reaction of ArCH 2 OH splitting is much more easily to do than that of water splitting. From the view of kinetics, it can be seen that the photocatalytic H 2 production rate of 7 NP/ZIS is about 12.2 times as large as that of ZIS (Fig. 6b).It indicates that noble-metal free NP co-catalyst and V Zn can effectively promote photocatalytic H 2 evolution.Notably, the kinetics of photocatalysis is mainly determined by light absorption, charge separation-transportation and surface reactive sites (or specific surface area).Therefore, in order to understand profoundly the influence factor of the kinetics, a series of experimental techniques were performed.Firstly, the surface area and BJH pore volume of NP/ZIS are increased by 1.6 and 2.8 times after the deposition of NP on ZIS, respectively.Obviously, larger surface area and pore volume would favorite reaction kinetics, while the enhanced activity cannot all ascribe to them.On the base of UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) data (Figure S12 and Figure S13) and the Kubelka-Munk equation 37, although the black NP shows that it can absorb all visible light, the bandgap energy (E g ) of 7 NP/ZIS (2.36 eV) is very close to that of individual ZIS (2.44 eV).It implies that the intrinsic absorption of the bulk ZIS has not been changed. To further study the energy band structure, Mott-Schottky plots of NP, ZIS and 7 NP/ZIS are tested under different frequency (Figure S14-16).NP, ZIS and NP/ZIS hybrid display distinct flat bands with band energies at ca. -0.45, -0.48 and -0.64 V (vs Ag/AgCl), respectively.It indicates that photogenerated charge carriers can be transferred from ZIS to NP.Additionally, the n-type semiconductor characteristic of ZIS has not changed after the deposition of NP.Due to the potential of Ag/ AgCl is about 0.2 V (vs NHE) and the flat band of an n-type semiconductor is close (about -0.1 eV) to its conduction band (CB) 38, the CBs of ZIS and 7 NP/ZIS hybrid are ca.-0.38 eV and -0.54 eV (vs NHE), respectively.Consequently, the valence bands (VBs) of ZIS and 7 NP/ZIS hybrid are about 2.06 and 1.82 eV (vs NHE), respectively.Clearly, the CB and VB of 7 NP/ZIS hybrid are uplifted by about 0.16 and 0.24 eV, respectively, in contrast to that of individual ZIS (Fig. 7a). The elevated CB and increased VB width over NP/ZIS hybrid imply that the photogenerated holes (h ) have faster mobility and can be consumed better 12.Both two aspects of the energy band structure are conducive to prohibiting the recombination of photoexcited charges, and thus contribute to the enhancement of photocatalytic performance.Based on the previous report 19, for V Zn -modified ZnIn 2 S 4 , the charge density at the around S could be obviously increased by implanting V Zn .This would give rise to electrons transition easily from VB to CB and electrons centralization around V Zn , which would be very advantageous for separation and transfer of charge carriers 19.Consequently, on the basis of the equation (N D (2/e 0 ) dU FL /d(1/C 2 ) 39, where 0 is absolute dielectric constant, e is elementary charge, is dielectric constant and is about 4.7 for ZIS 40, and C is the capacitance), the carrier density (N D ) was also be calculated.Here, NP/ZIS indeed exhibits a higher N D (1.32 10 20 cm -3 ) than ZIS (9.89 10 19 cm -3 ).Especially, for n-type semiconductors, the increase in N D is associated with increased electrical conductivity () according to the following function 41: eN D , where is the mobility of the carriers.Notably, increased conductivity is significantly favorable for promoting charge carrier separation and transportation. To further confirm the conductivity and separation-transportation of photoexcited charges, photoelectrochemical (PEC, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photocurrent transient decay and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV)) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were carried out (Fig. 7b-f).Fig. 7b exhibits TRPL patterns of 7 NP/ZIS hybrid and individual ZIS, which has been demonstrated to be a useful tool to study the specific charge carrier dynamics of nanomaterials.The TRPL decay plots are fitted via biexponential kinetics function (I (t) A 1 exp(-t/ 1 ) A 2 exp(-t/ 2 )) 42, in which two decay components are derived.Specifically, 1 and 2 are come from the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers in the vacancies or other defects and the recombination of free excitons, respectively 42,43. Clearly, 1 of NP/ZIS hybrid is longer than that of ZIS, indicating that large defects present in the NP/ZIS, which has been verified by the EPR technique (Fig. 4b).Additionally, the loading of NP on ZIS reduces 2 to 0.86 ns for NP/ZIS hybrid compared with ZIS, suggesting better separation and transportation of free excitons.Moreover, the average lifetime () values of NP/ZIS hybrid and individual ZIS were also calculated via the following function: )/(A 1 1 A 2 2 ) 39, and demonstrated to be about 0.99 and 1.42 ns, respectively.The obvious reduction of the average lifetime in the NP/ZIS hybrid reveals the establishment of an electron transportation channel from ZIS to NP in a non-radiative pathway 42434445.It is greatly favorable for restriction of photogenerated charge recombination and charge transportation in the hetero-layered NP/ZIS heterostructure, which can be confirmed by their EIS (Fig. 7c) and PL (Fig. 7d) spectra.The 7 NP/ZIS hybrid presents a smaller EIS arc radius and a lower PL intensity than that of individual ZIS.Notably, the PL intensity of the NP/ZIS hybrid is lower than ZIS and the mixture of ZIS and NP (ZIS NP, 4.1 NP was added because the real weight ratio of NP in 7 NP/ZIS is 4.1 detected by ICP), indicating the decrease of the NP/ZIS PL intensity is not ascribed to the non-luminescent NP wholly, but is due to the restrained recombination of the photoexcited charge carriers partly.In addition, the related electron-transportation rate constant (R etc ) in the NP/ZIS hybrid has been calculated to be about 3.25 10 8 S -1 by using the following equation 43: R etc(ZISNP/ZIS) 1/ (NP/ZIS) -1/ (ZIS) . The efficient separation and transportation of photoexcited charges over NP/ZIS photocatalyst could be further demonstrated by transient photocurrent responses (Fig. 7e).Under visible light illumination, 7 NP/ZIS hybrid exhibits higher photocurrent than individual ZIS.Interestingly, for ZIS, the photocurrent intensity increases upon opening the shutter and reaches a max value within 26 s, suggesting that the charging-discharging process exists in ZIS 46.However, the photocurrent of the NP/ZIS hybrid reaches its peak under the moment of light-on.It indicates that photogenerated charges can be fast separated and transported over NP/ZIS hybrid in contrast to ZIS.In addition, the photocurrent of NP/ZIS hybrid then decays a little and quickly reaches steady state with the prolonging of irradiation time (a little attenuation could be ascribed to that the photogenerated electrons are captured by dissolved oxygen) 46, while the photocurrent of ZIS decays slowly with illumination of visible light, which could be due to photocorrosion of metal sulfides 6.It demonstrates that the NP/ZIS hybrid photocatalyst is stable under visible light illumination.It is consistent with its activity and anti-corrosive quality (Figure S4-7).Moreover, to highlight the effect of NP on the H 2 -production kinetics of ZIS, LSV curves of ZIS and 7 NP/ZIS hybrid were also detected under visible light irradiation (Fig. 7f).Compared to that of individual ZIS, the cathodic current density of 7 NP/ZIS hybrid shows an obvious enhancement in the potential region of -1.4 V to 0 V (vs.Ag/AgCl), indicating that NP nano-flakes are significant active sites which can greatly boost the photocatalytic reactivity 6,46.It should be noted that 7 NP/ZIS also have more ability than V-ZIS for separating and transferring photogenerated charges, which has been confirmed by PEC tests (Figure S17 and Figure S18).In a word, both PL and PEC measurements confirm that NP/ZIS can significantly improve the charge separation-transportation and the subsequent H 2 evolution from ArCH 2 OH dehydrogenation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for ZIS, V-ZIS and NP were carried out through the Materials Studio (BIOVIA V2017, American).First, we focused on the structural properties of the NP, after the geometry optimization, we get the lattice constants is (8.613, 8.613, 5.096 A) which is similar to the theoretical value (8.646, 8.646, 5.07 A)To study the electronic properties, we calculate the band structure of the structure, and the results are plotted in Figure S19.It is found to be metallic as the partially occupied bands cross the Fermi level in the Brillouin zone, and the NP has no spin polarization. The work function is a crucial parameter in estimating the charge transfer direction between the interfaces of two nanomaterials.Then, and4.54 eV, respectively.Obviously, the work function of NP is lower than that of ZIS and V-ZIS, an Ohmic contact between NP and ZIS or V-ZIS will be formed 9.With respect to the Fermi level (E F ) of the Pt (5.65 eV) is lower than that of ZIS and V-ZIS ( E vac -E F , E vac is the vacuum level, Figure S23), the E F of the NP is higher than that of ZIS and V-ZIS.It is known that, after an n-type semiconductor contact with a semiconductor or a metal, the charge carriers (electrons) will transfer from the material with a higher E F to the other material with a lower E F until the two Fermi levels reach the same level.The surface energy bands bend downwards or upwards and the build-in internal electric field is formed on their interfaces, which are the critical factors for separating and transporting the photogenerated electrons and holes.In that case, for NP/ZIS hybrid with V Zn , because V-ZIS NP , the charge carriers will transfer from NP to V-ZIS via NP/ZIS interface (Scheme 1a).Thus, the carrier density (N D ) of NP is reduced and the N D of V-ZIS in NP/ZIS hybrid is increased.It is in accordance with the above experimental values.When the equilibrium of this space charge region is established, the surface energy band of V-ZIS bends downwards to form a reverse barrier layer and the build-in internal electric field with a direction of NPV-ZIS is formed on the NP/ZIS interfaces (Scheme 1b).The Coulomb attraction between the positive electricity fields on the side of NP and the photogenerated electrons on the CB of V-ZIS, the V Zn defect level (Vs) and the downward band bending can significantly promote separation and transportation of the photogenerated electrons synergistically (Scheme 1c).Similarly, the downward band bending and the Coulomb attraction are also formed in the NP/ZIS interfaces without V Zn (Scheme 1d-f).However, because Pt V-ZIS , the surface energy band of V-ZIS bends upwards to form a barrier layer and the build-in internal electric field with a direction of V-ZISPt is formed on the Pt/V-ZIS interfaces (Scheme 1g-i).In this case, due to the barrier layer and the Coulombic repulsive force between the build-in internal electric field and the photogenerated electrons (e -) on the conduction band (CB) of V-ZIS, the photogenerated electrons is difficult and slow transportation from the CB of V-ZIS to the Pt surface.Therefore, the separation and transportation efficiencies of the photogenerated charge carriers of these photocatalysts follow the order: NP/ZIS NP//ZIS Pt/V-ZIS, which is consistent with their photocatalytic activities. In addition, EPR was used to investigate the process of ArCH 2 OH dehydrogenation (Figure S24).The sextuple peaks (intensity 1:1:1:1:1:1, a H 22.4 G, A N 14.8 G) assigned to the characteristic peaks of DMPOcarbon-centered radicals 38 can be observed over both ZIS and NP/ZIS under visible light irradiation.Moreover, 7 NP/ZIS hybrid exhibits a higher intensity of EPR signals than individual ZIS, suggesting that much more intermediates are produced on NP/ZIS.This also confirms that NP/ ZIS is an efficient photocatalyst for separation and transportation of photoexcited charges, because the formation of carbon-centered radicals needs the involvement of photogenerated holes 34.This result is consistent with the above photocatalytic activities and PEC results.The isotopic tracer method was performed to further understand ArCH 2 OH dehydrogenation (Figure S25).It can be demonstrated by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC -MS) spectra that the product of ArCD 2 OH dehydrogenation is mainly ArCDO.That is to say, in this dual-function reaction system, H atoms of C-H and OH -in ArCH 2 OH are dehydrogenated.On the other hand, the solvent benzotrifluoride cannot be dehydrogenized to produce H 2 .It indicates that the evolved H 2 comes from the reactant ArCH 2 OH.Therefore, the improved photocatalytic performance of H 2 evolution and fine chemicals are simultaneously achieved by conversion of ArCH 2 OH over noble-metal-free NP/ZIS photocatalyst under visible light illumination, and an illustration of the mechanism is proposed as shown in Scheme 1c.Under visible light illumination, the electrons are photoexcited from the VB of V-ZIS into the CB.At the same time, the equal numbers of holes are generated in the CB.Then, H atoms of C-H and OH -in ArCH 2 OH are dehydrogenated by the photogenerated holes and to produce ArCHO via free radical reaction.On the other hand, the photoexcited electrons migrate from the CB to the NP via CB Vs NP and CB NP, and react with the dehydrogenated H to form H 2 .During the photocatalytic redox reactions, the enlarged surface area and porous structure can increase reactive sites; the Vs, the build-in internal electric field and the downward band bending can significantly improve electrical conductivity, charge carrier separation and transportation.Thus, biomass-relevant alcohols can be efficiently converted into aldehydes and H 2 over the as-synthesized NP/ZIS photocatalyst under visible light illumination. It is known that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and N 2 fixation are crucial solar-to-chemical energy pathways to address greenhouse effect and energy crisis 4748495051.However, CO 2 reduction and N 2 fixation as like water splitting into H 2 are suffered from thermodynamics and kinetics.For instance, N 2 3H 2 O 3/2O 2 2NH 3 , G 0 681.1 kJ mol -1 ; CO 2 2H 2 O 2O 2 CH 4 , G 0 818.18kJ mol -1 .To solve these barriers, hole-sacrificial reagents and multifarious photocatalysts have been explored.However, developing new reaction system and/or photocatalysts meet the expectation are still challenges.Based on our complete utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes in one reaction system, Coupling CO 2 reduction and N 2 fixation with alcohol oxidation may be alternatively effective approach to improve their photocatalytic reactivity (Fig. 8a-b).To test the idea, we compared NP/ZIS-H 2 O and NP/ZIS-ArCH 2 OH groups for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and N 2 fixation under visible light (the detail procedure in Supporting information).It is noteworthy that, in H 2 O reaction system, the 7 NP/ZIS exhibits very low photocatalytic activity for both CO 2 reduction and N 2 fixation (Fig. 8c-d).However, in ArCH 2 OH reaction system, not only ArCH 2 OH can be transformed into ArCHO, but also CO 2 and N 2 can be efficient converted into value-added chemicals such as CH 4 and NH 3 .In this dual-function photoredox reaction system, the photogenerated holes and electrons are both utilized.The holes are used to oxidize ArCH 2 OH, and the electrons are employed to reduce CO 2 and N 2 .Moreover, compared to the H 2 O reaction system, the thermodynamics of this dual-function reaction system is significantly improved.For instance, N 2 3ArCH 2 OH 3ArCHO 2NH 3 , G 0 51.1 kJ mol -1 ; CO 2 4ArCH 2 OH 4ArCHO 2H 2 O CH 4 , G 0 -18.5 kJ mol -1 .Therefore, although the used photocatalysts are both 7 NP/ZIS, CO 2 and N 2 can be more efficient transformed in ArCH 2 OH reaction system than in tranditional H 2 O reaction system.It is hope that the reactants, efficient photoredox reactions and mechanisms can be extended and unveiled in the following study, and this strategy can provide a new horizon toward solar-to-chemical energy conversion."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
