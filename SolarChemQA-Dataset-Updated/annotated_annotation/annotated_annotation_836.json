Pd, Ag, Au, Cu were loaded on HST by a photodeposition method 32.0.4 g HST sample with 60 ml aqueous solutions dissolving an appropriate amount of PdCl 2 , AgNO 3 , HAuCl 4 and CuSO 4 was put into a 300 ml quartz reaction cell.The reaction cell was deaerated by a vacuum pump before reactions.Under the irradiation by a 300 W Xe lamp, the metal cations were reduced by photogenerated electrons of HST and loaded on its surface.After reaction 4 h, products were collected by filtration and dried at 50 C for 3 h. The crystal structure of the photocatalytic materials was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (Bruker-AXS Germany, Cu Ka, l 0.15406 nm, 40 kV, 40 mA).The UVevis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were determined by a UVevis spectrophotometer TU-1901 (Purkinje, China) and were converted to absorbance by the KubelkaeMunk method.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were conducted using a JEM-2100 F (Japan).The surface electronic state was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Shimadzu-Kratos, Axis UltraDLD, Japan).All the binding energy (BE) values were calibrated by using the standard BE value of contaminant carbon (C1s 14 284.6 eV) as a reference.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded at room temperature using a HITACHIF-7000 spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 260 nm. Electrochemical measurements of linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) for obtaining overpotential of H 2 evolution and CO evolution were performed using a CHI760D electrochemical workstation with three-electrode system according to our previous report 33.Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively.The working electrodes were prepared by coating photocatalysts onto glassy carbon electrodes (3 mm diameter, 0.07 cm 2 ).Typically, 10 mg of loaded-HST was immersed into 1 ml of 0.1 wt Nafion aqueous solution with 10 h of ultrasonication.Then, 10 ml slurry was injected onto glassy carbon electrode and was dried in air at 50 C for 2 h.The electrolyte used for the reduction of H 2 O and reduction of CO 2 was put into 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 , and 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 aqueous solution, respectively.Prior to the electrochemical measurement, electrolyte was bubbled N 2 or CO 2 for 30 min to obtain N 2 -saturated Na 2 SO 4 solution (Na 2 SO 4 eN 2 ) or CO 2 -saturated KHCO 3 (KHCO 3 eCO 2 ).All potentials in this study were converted into the potentials of reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by For more direct observation to overpotentials of H 2 evolution and CO evolution, LSV curves were converted into Tafel curves (E overpotential 14 E onset potential -E 0 ). The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out by a continuous-flow system using a 92 m top-irradiation-type reactor (see Fig. S1).95 Ar5CO 2 mixture gas with 2.5 ml/ min controlled by a mass flowmeter was bubbled into the water (80 C) to generated CO 2 H 2 O gas.Then, the reactants CO 2 /H 2 O were introduced to the quartz flattening cylinder reactor maintained at 25 C by a circulating-water system.0.2 g photocatalyst powder was unfolded on the bottom of reactor with 2 cm A 1 cm area.A 300 W Xe lamp (l 200 nm) which the light intensity at wavelength 365 nm was ca 2.3 mW cm A2 was used as a light source.Gaseous products such as CO and H 2 were analyzed by an online GC (Huishi, GC450, China, argon as carrier gas) with a FID detector (MS-13X) and a TCD detector (TDX-01)."}, {"llm generation": "UVevis irradiation", "source": "It had confirmed that not any products were found using blank reactions in the absence of catalysts under dark or UVevis irradiation (l 200 nm), or in the presence of catalysts in dark or under visible light irradiation (l 420 nm), indicating that CO and H 2 were obtained from the photocatalytic reaction instead of the thermal catalytic reaction.", "context": "Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of HST samples loaded with different cocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 1, the XRD patterns of bare HST are comprised of strong (00l) and weak (hk0) reflections.The diffraction features are attributed to the nanosheets structure with 2D atomic arrangement, indicating the layered structure is preserved 34,35.The analysis is also affirmed by the SEM and TEM images of HST, which show a plate-like particle with a single-crystal structure (see Fig. S2).After loading, compared to bare HST, no diffraction peaks shift is observed in all loaded HST samples, indicating that cocatalysts are loaded on the surface of HST rather than incorporated into the lattice.Additionally, no diffraction peaks of cocatalysts are observed because of low loading amounts or small particle size of cocatalysts.The DRS spectra of HST samples loaded with different cocatalysts are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption edge of HST is ca.320 nm, corresponding to 3.9 V of band gap.Compared to bare HST, loaded HST samples exhibit new absorption longer than 320 nm, suggesting cocatalysts loaded on HST successfully.Of note, the HST loaded Cu samples arise new absorption edge at 580 nm, suggesting the Cu species probably is Cu 2 O(E g 14 2.17 eV corresponding to l onset absorption 14 571 nm) 36. To investigate the chemical states of cocatalysts loaded on the surface of HST, the binding energies of cocatalysts were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).The main elements Sr, Ta, O in HST are indexed from the survey spectra (Fig. S3).From Ag high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) spectrum (Fig. 3), obvious peaks at 367.6 eV and 373.6 eV are observed, which represent Ag3d 5/2 and Ag3d 3/2 of Ag metal (Ag 0 ) 37,38.The result indicated that Ag ions were reduced to Ag 0 by photoinduced electrons in the photodeposition process and loaded on the surface of HST.For Cu 2p, the spectrum which the binding energy ranges from 938 eV to 925 eV can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 39,40.It is important to note that the colour of Cu/HST was pink when the photodeposition reaction just finished, and then turned into light-grey exposure to atmosphere.The phenomenon of colour change suggests the CuO species derived from the oxidation on the surface of Cu 2 O. From Pd 3 d XPS spectrum, two major peaks with binding energies of 334.7 eV and 340.0 eV are assigned to Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 of Pd metal (Pd 0 ) 41, respectively.In the HR Au 4f XPS spectrum, the binding energies at 83.1 eV (Au 4f 7/2 ) and 86.8 eV (Au 4f 5/2 ) are in agreement with those for Au metal (Au 0 ) 42.The result indicates that Pd and Au species loaded on the surface of HST are metals. To further investigate the morphology and particle size of cocatalysts on the surface of HST, the HR-TEM images of loaded HST were performed and shown in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4a, the particle size of Ag species is ca.20e40 nm in diameter.The lattice fringe spacing of 0.208 nm and 0.229 nm with 54 intersection angle corresponds to the (200) plane and (111) plane of cubic Ag 0 43, further confirming that Ag 0 particles were loaded on the surface of HST.Fig. 4b images show the Pd particle with ca.20 nm has the lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.231 nm, which can be assigned to the (111) plane of cubic Pd metal (Pd 0 ) 44.From Fig. 4c, the Au with ca.40 nm in diameter lattice fringe distance was measured to be 0.234 nm, close to 0.235 nm of the (111) plane spacing of cubic Au 0 45.The results of HR-TEM are consistent with the analysis of XPS, which Ag, Pd, Au species loaded on HST are metal nanoparticles.In additional, the TEM image of Cu/HST sample (Fig. 4d) shows the particles of Cu species with 20e40 nm diameter.The HR-TEM image shows the distinct lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.29 nm, which is corresponding to the (110) planes of cubic structure Cu 2 O 28.The result is also consistent with the analysis of DRS and XPS. Fig. 5 shows the CO and H 2 evolution rates of HST and Ag, Pd, Cu, Au loaded HST.It had confirmed that not any products were found using blank reactions in the absence of catalysts under dark or UVevis irradiation (l 200 nm), or in the presence of catalysts in dark or under visible light irradiation (l 420 nm), indicating that CO and H 2 were obtained from the photocatalytic reaction instead of the thermal catalytic reaction.From Fig. 5, the bare HST exhibits the photocatalytic activity for the CO evolution (ca.0.07 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 evolution (ca.3.5 mmol g A1 h A1 ) due to the high (negative) conduction band position and good separation ability to electrons and holes.It also can be found that, the H 2 evolution rate is far higher than the CO evolution rate, which probably is attributed to the very strong adsorption ability of HST to H 2 O 46.In addition, there is no CH 4 in reduction products, although it has been reported as a main reduction product in some photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions 47e49.It can be explained as follows: although the reduction potential of CO 2 to CH 4 (0.17V vs RHE) is more positive than that of H to H 2 (0 V) and CO 2 to CO (-0.11V), the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 which includes 8 protons and 8 electrons possesses high overpotential, which inhibits the occurrence of the reaction.As shown in Fig. 5, after loading, the CO evolution rates of HST loaded with Ag, Au, Cu, Pd are enhanced obviously and reach ca.0.16 mmol g A1 h A1 , 0.16 mmol g A1 h A1 , 0.23 mmol g A1 h A1 , 0.28 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are 2.2, 2.2, 3.2, 4.0 times of that of bare HST.The result indicates that Pd, Cu 2 O cocatalysts loaded on the surface of HST are more benefit for CO evolution.It should be noted that the CO evolution rate of Ag/HST exhibits the maximal peak value and drops quickly to near that of Au/HST.It has been reported that Ag cocatalyst will aggregate to big size particles in the reaction process, which may lead to the decrease of activity 19.To examine whether the rapid decrease of photocatalytic activity of Ag/HST originated from the aggregation of Ag in the reaction process, the morphology of Ag Fig. 5 e CO and H 2 evolution rates of HST and loaded HST with 1.0 wt Ag, Pd, Cu or Au.Experiment errors were estimated to be about 5e10. particles after reaction was investigated.From Fig. S4, the particle size of Ag before reaction (Fig. S4a) was 15e30 nm, but the particle size of Ag after reaction (Fig. S4b) was 20e50 nm, indicating that the particle size of Ag obviously grew up in the reaction process.Therefore, the decrease of photocatalytic activity of Ag/HST probably is due to the aggregation of Ag in the reaction process.Additionally, clearly, Pd, Au loading can improve significantly photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution.The H 2 evolution rates of Pd/HST and Au/HST reach 16.5 mmol g A1 h A1 and 17.5 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are 4.7 and 5.0 times of that of bare HST.However, the H 2 evolution rate of Cu 2 O/HST is ca.4.0 mmol g A1 h A1 , close to that of bare HST.The H 2 evolution rate of Ag/HST is only ca.0.3 mmol g A1 h A1 , even much less than that of bare HST, indicating Ag cocatalyst loading is detrimental to the H 2 evolution.From the results of the photocatalytic activity for CO and H 2 evolution on Pd, Au, Ag and Cu 2 O loaded HST, it can be found that cocatalysts exhibit diverse ability in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO or H 2 evolution (see Table S1).Pd loading can promote not only the photocatalytic activity for CO evolution but for H 2 evolution as well.The Au loading significantly enhances the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution, while Cu 2 O loading obviously improves the photocatalytic activity for CO evolution.The Ag loading only slightly improves the photocatalytic activity for CO evolution and restrains the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution. As we know, to enhance the photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst, the efforts must be made on promoting the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes as well as constructing the active sites on its surface 50.For inhibiting the recombination of electron-hole pairs on the surface of photocatalysts before the occurrence of reduction reaction, cocatalysts (e.g.Pt, Pd) are loaded on the surface of photocatalysts to form Schottky barrier or p-n junction, which promotes the migration of electrons from photocatalysts to cocatalysts 51.Subsequently, the electrons gathering on cocatalysts reduce reactants to reduced products.In addition, due to containing two reactants CO 2 and H 2 O, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction refers to the completion of reduced products, which electrons reduce H to H 2 directly or H along with CO 2 to CO.It has been reported that some metals or oxides possess low overpotential for CO evolution and act as active sites for CO evolution 52,53.Therefore, the photocatalytic activity and selectivity toward CO or H 2 of Pd, Au, Ag, Cu 2 O loaded HST probably strongly depends on their ability to separate electron-hole pairs and overpotential of CO evolution and H 2 evolution. To clarify the effect of cocatalysts Ag, Pd, Au, Cu 2 O on controlling the photocatalytic activity and selectivity, PL emission spectra of the cocatalysts loaded samples were measured to investigate the efficiency of charge separation (Fig. 6), because the intensity of PL emission represented the level of recombination of electrons and holes.It can be observed after loading, the PL intensity drop, indicating that cocatalysts loading facilitates the separation of electrons and holes 54.This should be attributed to the high work function of Pd, Au, Ag metals and the formation of junction of Cu 2 O and HST, which results in the rapid migration of electrons from HST to cocatalysts.Compared to Ag loading, Pd and Au loading causes the better separation of electronholes because the work functions of Pd (5.12 V) and Au (5.1 V) are higher than that of Ag (4.26 V).To examine the overpotentials of CO evolution and H 2 evolution on loaded HST, the current-density-potential behaviours of loaded HST samples in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution with saturated were measured by a linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) method.Also, the Tafel plots from LSV data are shown in Fig. 7.The cathodic currents obtained in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 with saturated N 2 should be attributed to the H 2 evolution reaction, while the cathodic currents obtained in 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 with saturated CO 2 are ascribed to the CO evolution reaction 55.From Fig. 7, in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 solutions, the onset potentials of current density increasing of Pd/HST and Au/HST are lower than that of Ag/HST and Cu 2 O/HST.More clearly, from Tafel plots, the Pd/HST (0.64 V) and Au/HST (0.67 V) samples exhibit much lower overpotentials than Cu 2 O/HST (0.77 V) and Ag/HST (0.78 V), indicating that, compared to Ag/HST and Cu 2 O/HST samples, the H 2 evolution reaction occurs on Pd/HST and Au/HST samples more lightly 56.However, in 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 solutions with saturated CO 2 , the Pd/HST (0.45 V) and Cu 2 O/HST (0.40 V) samples exhibit the lower overpotentials than Ag/HST (0.50 V) and Au/HST (0.55 V), which will result in the high photocatalytic activity for CO evolution.From the results of electrochemical measurement and photocatalytic activity, it can be concluded that the selectivity toward CO or H 2 of photocatalysts strongly depends on its overpotential of CO evolution and H 2 evolution (see Table S1).Therefore, based on the analysis above, the schematic presentation of cocatalysts loading for promoting the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity and selectivity toward CO or H 2 is proposed as Fig. 8.After cocatalysts loading, the photoinduced electrons in CB of HST rapidly move to cocatalysts and cause the separation to holes.With the low overpotentials for both CO and H 2 evolution, the electrons on Pd particles readily reduce H or CO 2 H to H 2 or CO.For Cu 2 O/HST, due to the relative low overpotential for CO evolution and the high overpotential for H 2 evolution, more electrons on Cu 2 O are Fig. 6 e PL spectra of HST and loaded HST with 1.0 wt Ag, Pd, Cu and Au.used to reduce CO 2 H to CO, which results in the enhancement of CO evolution rate.Additionally, Cu 2 O loading may increase the adsorption amount of CO 2 , which is beneficial for CO evolution 57,58.Because Ag/HST possesses the relative high overpotential for both H 2 and CO evolution, its H 2 and CO evolution rates are low. In this study, although having avoided the use of any organic reagents or organic metal salts in processes of the preparation of photocatalysts and photocatalytic reaction, the control experimental was carried out under Ar/H 2 O atmosphere to investigate whether the obtained CO originated from CO 2 .From Fig. S5 and Fig. 9, the H 2 evolution rate of 1 Pd/HST under Ar/H 2 O atmosphere is ca.atmosphere.The phenomenon was also found by other researchers, in which CO should be derived from the CO 2 adsorbed on the surface of photocatalysts from the air as well as the surface-adsorbed organic contaminants 28,59,60.However, the result indicates that the main CO production is assigned to the reduction of CO 2 but not the organic contaminants. To examine the effect of the Pd cocatalysts content on the photocatalytic activity, the rates of CO evolution and H 2 evolution of 0.5e2 wt Pd/HST samples are shown in Fig. 10.Although no Pd diffraction peaks are observed from XRD patterns, the stronger absorption longer than 320 nm from DRS indicates the increase of Pd amounts loaded on HST (see Fig. S6).From Fig. 10, all the Pd-decorated HST samples exhibit almost same H 2 evolution rates regardless of loading amounts.However, the CO evolution rates were influenced by Pd loading amounts.1.0 wt Pd/HST sample exhibited the highest CO evolution rate (0.28 mmol g A1 h A1 ), reaching 1.5 times of that of 2.0 wt Pd/HST (0.18 mmol g A1 h A1 ).This result also suggests that excess cocatalyst loading may reduce the photocatalytic activity due to the formation of large particles and poor dispersion on the photocatalyst 61."}, {"llm generation": "visible light irradiation", "source": "It had confirmed that not any products were found using blank reactions in the absence of catalysts under dark or UVevis irradiation (l 200 nm), or in the presence of catalysts in dark or under visible light irradiation (l 420 nm), indicating that CO and H 2 were obtained from the photocatalytic reaction instead of the thermal catalytic reaction.", "context": "Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of HST samples loaded with different cocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 1, the XRD patterns of bare HST are comprised of strong (00l) and weak (hk0) reflections.The diffraction features are attributed to the nanosheets structure with 2D atomic arrangement, indicating the layered structure is preserved 34,35.The analysis is also affirmed by the SEM and TEM images of HST, which show a plate-like particle with a single-crystal structure (see Fig. S2).After loading, compared to bare HST, no diffraction peaks shift is observed in all loaded HST samples, indicating that cocatalysts are loaded on the surface of HST rather than incorporated into the lattice.Additionally, no diffraction peaks of cocatalysts are observed because of low loading amounts or small particle size of cocatalysts.The DRS spectra of HST samples loaded with different cocatalysts are shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 5 shows the CO and H 2 evolution rates of HST and Ag, Pd, Cu, Au loaded HST.It had confirmed that not any products were found using blank reactions in the absence of catalysts under dark or UVevis irradiation (l 200 nm), or in the presence of catalysts in dark or under visible light irradiation (l 420 nm), indicating that CO and H 2 were obtained from the photocatalytic reaction instead of the thermal catalytic reaction.From Fig. 5, the bare HST exhibits the photocatalytic activity for the CO evolution (ca.0.07 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 evolution (ca.3.5 mmol g A1 h A1 ) due to the high (negative) conduction band position and good separation ability to electrons and holes.It also can be found that, the H 2 evolution rate is far higher than the CO evolution rate, which probably is attributed to the very strong adsorption ability of HST to H 2 O 46.In addition, there is no CH 4 in reduction products, although it has been reported as a main reduction product in some photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions 47e49.It can be explained as follows: although the reduction potential of CO 2 to CH 4 (0.17V vs RHE) is more positive than that of H to H 2 (0 V) and CO 2 to CO (-0.11V), the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 which includes 8 protons and 8 electrons possesses high overpotential, which inhibits the occurrence of the reaction.As shown in Fig. 5, after loading, the CO evolution rates of HST loaded with Ag, Au, Cu, Pd are enhanced obviously and reach ca.0.16 mmol g A1 h A1 , 0.16 mmol g A1 h A1 , 0.23 mmol g A1 h A1 , 0.28 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are 2.2, 2.2, 3.2, 4.0 times of that of bare HST.The result indicates that Pd, Cu 2 O cocatalysts loaded on the surface of HST are more benefit for CO evolution.It should be noted that the CO evolution rate of Ag/HST exhibits the maximal peak value and drops quickly to near that of Au/HST.It has been reported that Ag cocatalyst will aggregate to big size particles in the reaction process, which may lead to the decrease of activity 19.To examine whether the rapid decrease of photocatalytic activity of Ag/HST originated from the aggregation of Ag in the reaction process, the morphology of Ag Fig. 5 e CO and H 2 evolution rates of HST and loaded HST with 1.0 wt Ag, Pd, Cu or Au.Experiment errors were estimated to be about 5e10. particles after reaction was investigated.From Fig. S4, the particle size of Ag before reaction (Fig. S4a) was 15e30 nm, but the particle size of Ag after reaction (Fig. S4b) was 20e50 nm, indicating that the particle size of Ag obviously grew up in the reaction process.Therefore, the decrease of photocatalytic activity of Ag/HST probably is due to the aggregation of Ag in the reaction process.Additionally, clearly, Pd, Au loading can improve significantly photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution.The H 2 evolution rates of Pd/HST and Au/HST reach 16.5 mmol g A1 h A1 and 17.5 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are 4.7 and 5.0 times of that of bare HST.However, the H 2 evolution rate of Cu 2 O/HST is ca.4.0 mmol g A1 h A1 , close to that of bare HST.The H 2 evolution rate of Ag/HST is only ca.0.3 mmol g A1 h A1 , even much less than that of bare HST, indicating Ag cocatalyst loading is detrimental to the H 2 evolution.From the results of the photocatalytic activity for CO and H 2 evolution on Pd, Au, Ag and Cu 2 O loaded HST, it can be found that cocatalysts exhibit diverse ability in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO or H 2 evolution (see Table S1).Pd loading can promote not only the photocatalytic activity for CO evolution but for H 2 evolution as well.The Au loading significantly enhances the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution, while Cu 2 O loading obviously improves the photocatalytic activity for CO evolution.The Ag loading only slightly improves the photocatalytic activity for CO evolution and restrains the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution. As we know, to enhance the photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst, the efforts must be made on promoting the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes as well as constructing the active sites on its surface 50.For inhibiting the recombination of electron-hole pairs on the surface of photocatalysts before the occurrence of reduction reaction, cocatalysts (e.g.Pt, Pd) are loaded on the surface of photocatalysts to form Schottky barrier or p-n junction, which promotes the migration of electrons from photocatalysts to cocatalysts 51.Subsequently, the electrons gathering on cocatalysts reduce reactants to reduced products.In addition, due to containing two reactants CO 2 and H 2 O, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction refers to the completion of reduced products, which electrons reduce H to H 2 directly or H along with CO 2 to CO.It has been reported that some metals or oxides possess low overpotential for CO evolution and act as active sites for CO evolution 52,53.Therefore, the photocatalytic activity and selectivity toward CO or H 2 of Pd, Au, Ag, Cu 2 O loaded HST probably strongly depends on their ability to separate electron-hole pairs and overpotential of CO evolution and H 2 evolution. To clarify the effect of cocatalysts Ag, Pd, Au, Cu 2 O on controlling the photocatalytic activity and selectivity, PL emission spectra of the cocatalysts loaded samples were measured to investigate the efficiency of charge separation (Fig. 6), because the intensity of PL emission represented the level of recombination of electrons and holes.It can be observed after loading, the PL intensity drop, indicating that cocatalysts loading facilitates the separation of electrons and holes 54.This should be attributed to the high work function of Pd, Au, Ag metals and the formation of junction of Cu 2 O and HST, which results in the rapid migration of electrons from HST to cocatalysts.Compared to Ag loading, Pd and Au loading causes the better separation of electronholes because the work functions of Pd (5.12 V) and Au (5.1 V) are higher than that of Ag (4.26 V).To examine the overpotentials of CO evolution and H 2 evolution on loaded HST, the current-density-potential behaviours of loaded HST samples in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution with saturated were measured by a linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) method.Also, the Tafel plots from LSV data are shown in Fig. 7.The cathodic currents obtained in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 with saturated N 2 should be attributed to the H 2 evolution reaction, while the cathodic currents obtained in 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 with saturated CO 2 are ascribed to the CO evolution reaction 55.From Fig. 7, in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 solutions, the onset potentials of current density increasing of Pd/HST and Au/HST are lower than that of Ag/HST and Cu 2 O/HST.More clearly, from Tafel plots, the Pd/HST (0.64 V) and Au/HST (0.67 V) samples exhibit much lower overpotentials than Cu 2 O/HST (0.77 V) and Ag/HST (0.78 V), indicating that, compared to Ag/HST and Cu 2 O/HST samples, the H 2 evolution reaction occurs on Pd/HST and Au/HST samples more lightly 56.However, in 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 solutions with saturated CO 2 , the Pd/HST (0.45 V) and Cu 2 O/HST (0.40 V) samples exhibit the lower overpotentials than Ag/HST (0.50 V) and Au/HST (0.55 V), which will result in the high photocatalytic activity for CO evolution.From the results of electrochemical measurement and photocatalytic activity, it can be concluded that the selectivity toward CO or H 2 of photocatalysts strongly depends on its overpotential of CO evolution and H 2 evolution (see Table S1).Therefore, based on the analysis above, the schematic presentation of cocatalysts loading for promoting the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity and selectivity toward CO or H 2 is proposed as Fig. 8.After cocatalysts loading, the photoinduced electrons in CB of HST rapidly move to cocatalysts and cause the separation to holes.With the low overpotentials for both CO and H 2 evolution, the electrons on Pd particles readily reduce H or CO 2 H to H 2 or CO.For Cu 2 O/HST, due to the relative low overpotential for CO evolution and the high overpotential for H 2 evolution, more electrons on Cu 2 O are Fig. 6 e PL spectra of HST and loaded HST with 1.0 wt Ag, Pd, Cu and Au.used to reduce CO 2 H to CO, which results in the enhancement of CO evolution rate.Additionally, Cu 2 O loading may increase the adsorption amount of CO 2 , which is beneficial for CO evolution 57,58.Because Ag/HST possesses the relative high overpotential for both H 2 and CO evolution, its H 2 and CO evolution rates are low. In this study, although having avoided the use of any organic reagents or organic metal salts in processes of the preparation of photocatalysts and photocatalytic reaction, the control experimental was carried out under Ar/H 2 O atmosphere to investigate whether the obtained CO originated from CO 2 .From Fig. S5 and Fig. 9, the H 2 evolution rate of 1 Pd/HST under Ar/H 2 O atmosphere is ca.atmosphere.The phenomenon was also found by other researchers, in which CO should be derived from the CO 2 adsorbed on the surface of photocatalysts from the air as well as the surface-adsorbed organic contaminants 28,59,60.However, the result indicates that the main CO production is assigned to the reduction of CO 2 but not the organic contaminants. To examine the effect of the Pd cocatalysts content on the photocatalytic activity, the rates of CO evolution and H 2 evolution of 0.5e2 wt Pd/HST samples are shown in Fig. 10.Although no Pd diffraction peaks are observed from XRD patterns, the stronger absorption longer than 320 nm from DRS indicates the increase of Pd amounts loaded on HST (see Fig. S6).From Fig. 10, all the Pd-decorated HST samples exhibit almost same H 2 evolution rates regardless of loading amounts.However, the CO evolution rates were influenced by Pd loading amounts.1.0 wt Pd/HST sample exhibited the highest CO evolution rate (0.28 mmol g A1 h A1 ), reaching 1.5 times of that of 2.0 wt Pd/HST (0.18 mmol g A1 h A1 ).This result also suggests that excess cocatalyst loading may reduce the photocatalytic activity due to the formation of large particles and poor dispersion on the photocatalyst 61."}], "lamp": [], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "95 Ar5CO 2 mixture gas with 2.5 ml/ min controlled by a mass flowmeter was bubbled into the water (80 C) to generated CO 2 H 2 O gas.", "context": "A solid state reaction followed by ion-exchange was used to synthesize H 2 SrTa 2 O 7 31.All materials were obtained from commercial sources (Sinopharm Chemical, China) and used without further purification.In a typical preparation process, SrCO 3 (0.886 g, 99), Ta 2 O 5 (2.651 g, 99.99) and an excess (50) of K 2 CO 3 (1.242g, 99.5) were thoroughly ground by a mortar at room temperature and then the mixture was calcined in alundum crucible in air at 900 C for 6 h to obtain K 2 SrTa 2 O 7 .1.0 g K 2 SrTa 2 O 7 was soaked in 1.0 mol/L HNO 3 aqueous solution for 24 h, washed with deionized water until solution neutral pH value, and dried in air at 50 C for 3 h to obtain H 2 SrTa 2 O 7 (denoted as HST).

The crystal structure of the photocatalytic materials was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (Bruker-AXS Germany, Cu Ka, l 0.15406 nm, 40 kV, 40 mA).The UVevis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were determined by a UVevis spectrophotometer TU-1901 (Purkinje, China) and were converted to absorbance by the KubelkaeMunk method.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were conducted using a JEM-2100 F (Japan).The surface electronic state was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Shimadzu-Kratos, Axis UltraDLD, Japan).All the binding energy (BE) values were calibrated by using the standard BE value of contaminant carbon (C1s 14 284.6 eV) as a reference.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded at room temperature using a HITACHIF-7000 spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 260 nm. Electrochemical measurements of linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) for obtaining overpotential of H 2 evolution and CO evolution were performed using a CHI760D electrochemical workstation with three-electrode system according to our previous report 33.Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively.The working electrodes were prepared by coating photocatalysts onto glassy carbon electrodes (3 mm diameter, 0.07 cm 2 ).Typically, 10 mg of loaded-HST was immersed into 1 ml of 0.1 wt Nafion aqueous solution with 10 h of ultrasonication.Then, 10 ml slurry was injected onto glassy carbon electrode and was dried in air at 50 C for 2 h.The electrolyte used for the reduction of H 2 O and reduction of CO 2 was put into 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 , and 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 aqueous solution, respectively.Prior to the electrochemical measurement, electrolyte was bubbled N 2 or CO 2 for 30 min to obtain N 2 -saturated Na 2 SO 4 solution (Na 2 SO 4 eN 2 ) or CO 2 -saturated KHCO 3 (KHCO 3 eCO 2 ).All potentials in this study were converted into the potentials of reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by For more direct observation to overpotentials of H 2 evolution and CO evolution, LSV curves were converted into Tafel curves (E overpotential 14 E onset potential -E 0 ).

The absorption edge of HST is ca.320 nm, corresponding to 3.9 V of band gap.Compared to bare HST, loaded HST samples exhibit new absorption longer than 320 nm, suggesting cocatalysts loaded on HST successfully.Of note, the HST loaded Cu samples arise new absorption edge at 580 nm, suggesting the Cu species probably is Cu 2 O(E g 14 2.17 eV corresponding to l onset absorption 14 571 nm) 36. To investigate the chemical states of cocatalysts loaded on the surface of HST, the binding energies of cocatalysts were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).The main elements Sr, Ta, O in HST are indexed from the survey spectra (Fig. S3).From Ag high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) spectrum (Fig. 3), obvious peaks at 367.6 eV and 373.6 eV are observed, which represent Ag3d 5/2 and Ag3d 3/2 of Ag metal (Ag 0 ) 37,38.The result indicated that Ag ions were reduced to Ag 0 by photoinduced electrons in the photodeposition process and loaded on the surface of HST.For Cu 2p, the spectrum which the binding energy ranges from 938 eV to 925 eV can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 39,40.It is important to note that the colour of Cu/HST was pink when the photodeposition reaction just finished, and then turned into light-grey exposure to atmosphere.The phenomenon of colour change suggests the CuO species derived from the oxidation on the surface of Cu 2 O. From Pd 3 d XPS spectrum, two major peaks with binding energies of 334.7 eV and 340.0 eV are assigned to Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 of Pd metal (Pd 0 ) 41, respectively.In the HR Au 4f XPS spectrum, the binding energies at 83.1 eV (Au 4f 7/2 ) and 86.8 eV (Au 4f 5/2 ) are in agreement with those for Au metal (Au 0 ) 42.The result indicates that Pd and Au species loaded on the surface of HST are metals. To further investigate the morphology and particle size of cocatalysts on the surface of HST, the HR-TEM images of loaded HST were performed and shown in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4a, the particle size of Ag species is ca.20e40 nm in diameter.The lattice fringe spacing of 0.208 nm and 0.229 nm with 54 intersection angle corresponds to the (200) plane and (111) plane of cubic Ag 0 43, further confirming that Ag 0 particles were loaded on the surface of HST.Fig. 4b images show the Pd particle with ca.20 nm has the lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.231 nm, which can be assigned to the (111) plane of cubic Pd metal (Pd 0 ) 44.From Fig. 4c, the Au with ca.40 nm in diameter lattice fringe distance was measured to be 0.234 nm, close to 0.235 nm of the (111) plane spacing of cubic Au 0 45.The results of HR-TEM are consistent with the analysis of XPS, which Ag, Pd, Au species loaded on HST are metal nanoparticles.In additional, the TEM image of Cu/HST sample (Fig. 4d) shows the particles of Cu species with 20e40 nm diameter.The HR-TEM image shows the distinct lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.29 nm, which is corresponding to the (110) planes of cubic structure Cu 2 O 28.The result is also consistent with the analysis of DRS and XPS. Fig. 5 shows the CO and H 2 evolution rates of HST and Ag, Pd, Cu, Au loaded HST.It had confirmed that not any products were found using blank reactions in the absence of catalysts under dark or UVevis irradiation (l 200 nm), or in the presence of catalysts in dark or under visible light irradiation (l 420 nm), indicating that CO and H 2 were obtained from the photocatalytic reaction instead of the thermal catalytic reaction.From Fig. 5, the bare HST exhibits the photocatalytic activity for the CO evolution (ca.0.07 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 evolution (ca.3.5 mmol g A1 h A1 ) due to the high (negative) conduction band position and good separation ability to electrons and holes.It also can be found that, the H 2 evolution rate is far higher than the CO evolution rate, which probably is attributed to the very strong adsorption ability of HST to H 2 O 46.In addition, there is no CH 4 in reduction products, although it has been reported as a main reduction product in some photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions 47e49.It can be explained as follows: although the reduction potential of CO 2 to CH 4 (0.17V vs RHE) is more positive than that of H to H 2 (0 V) and CO 2 to CO (-0.11V), the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 which includes 8 protons and 8 electrons possesses high overpotential, which inhibits the occurrence of the reaction.As shown in Fig. 5, after loading, the CO evolution rates of HST loaded with Ag, Au, Cu, Pd are enhanced obviously and reach ca.0.16 mmol g A1 h A1 , 0.16 mmol g A1 h A1 , 0.23 mmol g A1 h A1 , 0.28 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are 2.2, 2.2, 3.2, 4.0 times of that of bare HST.The result indicates that Pd, Cu 2 O cocatalysts loaded on the surface of HST are more benefit for CO evolution.It should be noted that the CO evolution rate of Ag/HST exhibits the maximal peak value and drops quickly to near that of Au/HST.It has been reported that Ag cocatalyst will aggregate to big size particles in the reaction process, which may lead to the decrease of activity 19.To examine whether the rapid decrease of photocatalytic activity of Ag/HST originated from the aggregation of Ag in the reaction process, the morphology of Ag Fig. 5 e CO and H 2 evolution rates of HST and loaded HST with 1.0 wt Ag, Pd, Cu or Au.Experiment errors were estimated to be about 5e10. particles after reaction was investigated.From Fig. S4, the particle size of Ag before reaction (Fig. S4a) was 15e30 nm, but the particle size of Ag after reaction (Fig. S4b) was 20e50 nm, indicating that the particle size of Ag obviously grew up in the reaction process.Therefore, the decrease of photocatalytic activity of Ag/HST probably is due to the aggregation of Ag in the reaction process.Additionally, clearly, Pd, Au loading can improve significantly photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution.The H 2 evolution rates of Pd/HST and Au/HST reach 16.5 mmol g A1 h A1 and 17.5 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are 4.7 and 5.0 times of that of bare HST.However, the H 2 evolution rate of Cu 2 O/HST is ca.4.0 mmol g A1 h A1 , close to that of bare HST.The H 2 evolution rate of Ag/HST is only ca.0.3 mmol g A1 h A1 , even much less than that of bare HST, indicating Ag cocatalyst loading is detrimental to the H 2 evolution.From the results of the photocatalytic activity for CO and H 2 evolution on Pd, Au, Ag and Cu 2 O loaded HST, it can be found that cocatalysts exhibit diverse ability in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO or H 2 evolution (see Table S1).Pd loading can promote not only the photocatalytic activity for CO evolution but for H 2 evolution as well.The Au loading significantly enhances the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution, while Cu 2 O loading obviously improves the photocatalytic activity for CO evolution.The Ag loading only slightly improves the photocatalytic activity for CO evolution and restrains the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution. As we know, to enhance the photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst, the efforts must be made on promoting the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes as well as constructing the active sites on its surface 50.For inhibiting the recombination of electron-hole pairs on the surface of photocatalysts before the occurrence of reduction reaction, cocatalysts (e.g.Pt, Pd) are loaded on the surface of photocatalysts to form Schottky barrier or p-n junction, which promotes the migration of electrons from photocatalysts to cocatalysts 51.Subsequently, the electrons gathering on cocatalysts reduce reactants to reduced products.In addition, due to containing two reactants CO 2 and H 2 O, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction refers to the completion of reduced products, which electrons reduce H to H 2 directly or H along with CO 2 to CO.It has been reported that some metals or oxides possess low overpotential for CO evolution and act as active sites for CO evolution 52,53.Therefore, the photocatalytic activity and selectivity toward CO or H 2 of Pd, Au, Ag, Cu 2 O loaded HST probably strongly depends on their ability to separate electron-hole pairs and overpotential of CO evolution and H 2 evolution. To clarify the effect of cocatalysts Ag, Pd, Au, Cu 2 O on controlling the photocatalytic activity and selectivity, PL emission spectra of the cocatalysts loaded samples were measured to investigate the efficiency of charge separation (Fig. 6), because the intensity of PL emission represented the level of recombination of electrons and holes.It can be observed after loading, the PL intensity drop, indicating that cocatalysts loading facilitates the separation of electrons and holes 54.This should be attributed to the high work function of Pd, Au, Ag metals and the formation of junction of Cu 2 O and HST, which results in the rapid migration of electrons from HST to cocatalysts.Compared to Ag loading, Pd and Au loading causes the better separation of electronholes because the work functions of Pd (5.12 V) and Au (5.1 V) are higher than that of Ag (4.26 V).To examine the overpotentials of CO evolution and H 2 evolution on loaded HST, the current-density-potential behaviours of loaded HST samples in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution with saturated were measured by a linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) method.Also, the Tafel plots from LSV data are shown in Fig. 7.The cathodic currents obtained in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 with saturated N 2 should be attributed to the H 2 evolution reaction, while the cathodic currents obtained in 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 with saturated CO 2 are ascribed to the CO evolution reaction 55.From Fig. 7, in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 solutions, the onset potentials of current density increasing of Pd/HST and Au/HST are lower than that of Ag/HST and Cu 2 O/HST.More clearly, from Tafel plots, the Pd/HST (0.64 V) and Au/HST (0.67 V) samples exhibit much lower overpotentials than Cu 2 O/HST (0.77 V) and Ag/HST (0.78 V), indicating that, compared to Ag/HST and Cu 2 O/HST samples, the H 2 evolution reaction occurs on Pd/HST and Au/HST samples more lightly 56.However, in 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 solutions with saturated CO 2 , the Pd/HST (0.45 V) and Cu 2 O/HST (0.40 V) samples exhibit the lower overpotentials than Ag/HST (0.50 V) and Au/HST (0.55 V), which will result in the high photocatalytic activity for CO evolution.From the results of electrochemical measurement and photocatalytic activity, it can be concluded that the selectivity toward CO or H 2 of photocatalysts strongly depends on its overpotential of CO evolution and H 2 evolution (see Table S1).Therefore, based on the analysis above, the schematic presentation of cocatalysts loading for promoting the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity and selectivity toward CO or H 2 is proposed as Fig. 8.After cocatalysts loading, the photoinduced electrons in CB of HST rapidly move to cocatalysts and cause the separation to holes.With the low overpotentials for both CO and H 2 evolution, the electrons on Pd particles readily reduce H or CO 2 H to H 2 or CO.For Cu 2 O/HST, due to the relative low overpotential for CO evolution and the high overpotential for H 2 evolution, more electrons on Cu 2 O are Fig. 6 e PL spectra of HST and loaded HST with 1.0 wt Ag, Pd, Cu and Au.used to reduce CO 2 H to CO, which results in the enhancement of CO evolution rate.Additionally, Cu 2 O loading may increase the adsorption amount of CO 2 , which is beneficial for CO evolution 57,58.Because Ag/HST possesses the relative high overpotential for both H 2 and CO evolution, its H 2 and CO evolution rates are low. In this study, although having avoided the use of any organic reagents or organic metal salts in processes of the preparation of photocatalysts and photocatalytic reaction, the control experimental was carried out under Ar/H 2 O atmosphere to investigate whether the obtained CO originated from CO 2 .From Fig. S5 and Fig. 9, the H 2 evolution rate of 1 Pd/HST under Ar/H 2 O atmosphere is ca.atmosphere.The phenomenon was also found by other researchers, in which CO should be derived from the CO 2 adsorbed on the surface of photocatalysts from the air as well as the surface-adsorbed organic contaminants 28,59,60.However, the result indicates that the main CO production is assigned to the reduction of CO 2 but not the organic contaminants. To examine the effect of the Pd cocatalysts content on the photocatalytic activity, the rates of CO evolution and H 2 evolution of 0.5e2 wt Pd/HST samples are shown in Fig. 10.Although no Pd diffraction peaks are observed from XRD patterns, the stronger absorption longer than 320 nm from DRS indicates the increase of Pd amounts loaded on HST (see Fig. S6).From Fig. 10, all the Pd-decorated HST samples exhibit almost same H 2 evolution rates regardless of loading amounts.However, the CO evolution rates were influenced by Pd loading amounts.1.0 wt Pd/HST sample exhibited the highest CO evolution rate (0.28 mmol g A1 h A1 ), reaching 1.5 times of that of 2.0 wt Pd/HST (0.18 mmol g A1 h A1 ).This result also suggests that excess cocatalyst loading may reduce the photocatalytic activity due to the formation of large particles and poor dispersion on the photocatalyst 61."}, {"llm generation": "0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4", "source": "The cathodic currents obtained in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 with saturated N 2 should be attributed to the H 2 evolution reaction, while the cathodic currents obtained in 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 with saturated CO 2 are ascribed to the CO evolution reaction 55.", "context": "Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of HST samples loaded with different cocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 1, the XRD patterns of bare HST are comprised of strong (00l) and weak (hk0) reflections.The diffraction features are attributed to the nanosheets structure with 2D atomic arrangement, indicating the layered structure is preserved 34,35.The analysis is also affirmed by the SEM and TEM images of HST, which show a plate-like particle with a single-crystal structure (see Fig. S2).After loading, compared to bare HST, no diffraction peaks shift is observed in all loaded HST samples, indicating that cocatalysts are loaded on the surface of HST rather than incorporated into the lattice.Additionally, no diffraction peaks of cocatalysts are observed because of low loading amounts or small particle size of cocatalysts.The DRS spectra of HST samples loaded with different cocatalysts are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption edge of HST is ca.320 nm, corresponding to 3.9 V of band gap.Compared to bare HST, loaded HST samples exhibit new absorption longer than 320 nm, suggesting cocatalysts loaded on HST successfully.Of note, the HST loaded Cu samples arise new absorption edge at 580 nm, suggesting the Cu species probably is Cu 2 O(E g 14 2.17 eV corresponding to l onset absorption 14 571 nm) 36. To investigate the chemical states of cocatalysts loaded on the surface of HST, the binding energies of cocatalysts were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).The main elements Sr, Ta, O in HST are indexed from the survey spectra (Fig. S3).From Ag high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) spectrum (Fig. 3), obvious peaks at 367.6 eV and 373.6 eV are observed, which represent Ag3d 5/2 and Ag3d 3/2 of Ag metal (Ag 0 ) 37,38.The result indicated that Ag ions were reduced to Ag 0 by photoinduced electrons in the photodeposition process and loaded on the surface of HST.For Cu 2p, the spectrum which the binding energy ranges from 938 eV to 925 eV can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 39,40.It is important to note that the colour of Cu/HST was pink when the photodeposition reaction just finished, and then turned into light-grey exposure to atmosphere.The phenomenon of colour change suggests the CuO species derived from the oxidation on the surface of Cu 2 O. From Pd 3 d XPS spectrum, two major peaks with binding energies of 334.7 eV and 340.0 eV are assigned to Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 of Pd metal (Pd 0 ) 41, respectively.In the HR Au 4f XPS spectrum, the binding energies at 83.1 eV (Au 4f 7/2 ) and 86.8 eV (Au 4f 5/2 ) are in agreement with those for Au metal (Au 0 ) 42.The result indicates that Pd and Au species loaded on the surface of HST are metals. To further investigate the morphology and particle size of cocatalysts on the surface of HST, the HR-TEM images of loaded HST were performed and shown in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4a, the particle size of Ag species is ca.20e40 nm in diameter.The lattice fringe spacing of 0.208 nm and 0.229 nm with 54 intersection angle corresponds to the (200) plane and (111) plane of cubic Ag 0 43, further confirming that Ag 0 particles were loaded on the surface of HST.Fig. 4b images show the Pd particle with ca.20 nm has the lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.231 nm, which can be assigned to the (111) plane of cubic Pd metal (Pd 0 ) 44.From Fig. 4c, the Au with ca.40 nm in diameter lattice fringe distance was measured to be 0.234 nm, close to 0.235 nm of the (111) plane spacing of cubic Au 0 45.The results of HR-TEM are consistent with the analysis of XPS, which Ag, Pd, Au species loaded on HST are metal nanoparticles.In additional, the TEM image of Cu/HST sample (Fig. 4d) shows the particles of Cu species with 20e40 nm diameter.The HR-TEM image shows the distinct lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.29 nm, which is corresponding to the (110) planes of cubic structure Cu 2 O 28.The result is also consistent with the analysis of DRS and XPS. Fig. 5 shows the CO and H 2 evolution rates of HST and Ag, Pd, Cu, Au loaded HST.It had confirmed that not any products were found using blank reactions in the absence of catalysts under dark or UVevis irradiation (l 200 nm), or in the presence of catalysts in dark or under visible light irradiation (l 420 nm), indicating that CO and H 2 were obtained from the photocatalytic reaction instead of the thermal catalytic reaction.From Fig. 5, the bare HST exhibits the photocatalytic activity for the CO evolution (ca.0.07 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and H 2 evolution (ca.3.5 mmol g A1 h A1 ) due to the high (negative) conduction band position and good separation ability to electrons and holes.It also can be found that, the H 2 evolution rate is far higher than the CO evolution rate, which probably is attributed to the very strong adsorption ability of HST to H 2 O 46.In addition, there is no CH 4 in reduction products, although it has been reported as a main reduction product in some photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions 47e49.It can be explained as follows: although the reduction potential of CO 2 to CH 4 (0.17V vs RHE) is more positive than that of H to H 2 (0 V) and CO 2 to CO (-0.11V), the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 which includes 8 protons and 8 electrons possesses high overpotential, which inhibits the occurrence of the reaction.As shown in Fig. 5, after loading, the CO evolution rates of HST loaded with Ag, Au, Cu, Pd are enhanced obviously and reach ca.0.16 mmol g A1 h A1 , 0.16 mmol g A1 h A1 , 0.23 mmol g A1 h A1 , 0.28 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are 2.2, 2.2, 3.2, 4.0 times of that of bare HST.The result indicates that Pd, Cu 2 O cocatalysts loaded on the surface of HST are more benefit for CO evolution.It should be noted that the CO evolution rate of Ag/HST exhibits the maximal peak value and drops quickly to near that of Au/HST.It has been reported that Ag cocatalyst will aggregate to big size particles in the reaction process, which may lead to the decrease of activity 19.To examine whether the rapid decrease of photocatalytic activity of Ag/HST originated from the aggregation of Ag in the reaction process, the morphology of Ag Fig. 5 e CO and H 2 evolution rates of HST and loaded HST with 1.0 wt Ag, Pd, Cu or Au.Experiment errors were estimated to be about 5e10. particles after reaction was investigated.From Fig. S4, the particle size of Ag before reaction (Fig. S4a) was 15e30 nm, but the particle size of Ag after reaction (Fig. S4b) was 20e50 nm, indicating that the particle size of Ag obviously grew up in the reaction process.Therefore, the decrease of photocatalytic activity of Ag/HST probably is due to the aggregation of Ag in the reaction process.Additionally, clearly, Pd, Au loading can improve significantly photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution.The H 2 evolution rates of Pd/HST and Au/HST reach 16.5 mmol g A1 h A1 and 17.5 mmol g A1 h A1 , respectively, which are 4.7 and 5.0 times of that of bare HST.However, the H 2 evolution rate of Cu 2 O/HST is ca.4.0 mmol g A1 h A1 , close to that of bare HST.The H 2 evolution rate of Ag/HST is only ca.0.3 mmol g A1 h A1 , even much less than that of bare HST, indicating Ag cocatalyst loading is detrimental to the H 2 evolution.From the results of the photocatalytic activity for CO and H 2 evolution on Pd, Au, Ag and Cu 2 O loaded HST, it can be found that cocatalysts exhibit diverse ability in promoting photocatalytic activity for CO or H 2 evolution (see Table S1).Pd loading can promote not only the photocatalytic activity for CO evolution but for H 2 evolution as well.The Au loading significantly enhances the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution, while Cu 2 O loading obviously improves the photocatalytic activity for CO evolution.The Ag loading only slightly improves the photocatalytic activity for CO evolution and restrains the photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution. As we know, to enhance the photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst, the efforts must be made on promoting the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes as well as constructing the active sites on its surface 50.For inhibiting the recombination of electron-hole pairs on the surface of photocatalysts before the occurrence of reduction reaction, cocatalysts (e.g.Pt, Pd) are loaded on the surface of photocatalysts to form Schottky barrier or p-n junction, which promotes the migration of electrons from photocatalysts to cocatalysts 51.Subsequently, the electrons gathering on cocatalysts reduce reactants to reduced products.In addition, due to containing two reactants CO 2 and H 2 O, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction refers to the completion of reduced products, which electrons reduce H to H 2 directly or H along with CO 2 to CO.It has been reported that some metals or oxides possess low overpotential for CO evolution and act as active sites for CO evolution 52,53.Therefore, the photocatalytic activity and selectivity toward CO or H 2 of Pd, Au, Ag, Cu 2 O loaded HST probably strongly depends on their ability to separate electron-hole pairs and overpotential of CO evolution and H 2 evolution. To clarify the effect of cocatalysts Ag, Pd, Au, Cu 2 O on controlling the photocatalytic activity and selectivity, PL emission spectra of the cocatalysts loaded samples were measured to investigate the efficiency of charge separation (Fig. 6), because the intensity of PL emission represented the level of recombination of electrons and holes.It can be observed after loading, the PL intensity drop, indicating that cocatalysts loading facilitates the separation of electrons and holes 54.This should be attributed to the high work function of Pd, Au, Ag metals and the formation of junction of Cu 2 O and HST, which results in the rapid migration of electrons from HST to cocatalysts.Compared to Ag loading, Pd and Au loading causes the better separation of electronholes because the work functions of Pd (5.12 V) and Au (5.1 V) are higher than that of Ag (4.26 V).To examine the overpotentials of CO evolution and H 2 evolution on loaded HST, the current-density-potential behaviours of loaded HST samples in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution with saturated were measured by a linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) method.Also, the Tafel plots from LSV data are shown in Fig. 7.The cathodic currents obtained in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 with saturated N 2 should be attributed to the H 2 evolution reaction, while the cathodic currents obtained in 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 with saturated CO 2 are ascribed to the CO evolution reaction 55.From Fig. 7, in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 solutions, the onset potentials of current density increasing of Pd/HST and Au/HST are lower than that of Ag/HST and Cu 2 O/HST.More clearly, from Tafel plots, the Pd/HST (0.64 V) and Au/HST (0.67 V) samples exhibit much lower overpotentials than Cu 2 O/HST (0.77 V) and Ag/HST (0.78 V), indicating that, compared to Ag/HST and Cu 2 O/HST samples, the H 2 evolution reaction occurs on Pd/HST and Au/HST samples more lightly 56.However, in 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 solutions with saturated CO 2 , the Pd/HST (0.45 V) and Cu 2 O/HST (0.40 V) samples exhibit the lower overpotentials than Ag/HST (0.50 V) and Au/HST (0.55 V), which will result in the high photocatalytic activity for CO evolution.From the results of electrochemical measurement and photocatalytic activity, it can be concluded that the selectivity toward CO or H 2 of photocatalysts strongly depends on its overpotential of CO evolution and H 2 evolution (see Table S1).Therefore, based on the analysis above, the schematic presentation of cocatalysts loading for promoting the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity and selectivity toward CO or H 2 is proposed as Fig. 8.After cocatalysts loading, the photoinduced electrons in CB of HST rapidly move to cocatalysts and cause the separation to holes.With the low overpotentials for both CO and H 2 evolution, the electrons on Pd particles readily reduce H or CO 2 H to H 2 or CO.For Cu 2 O/HST, due to the relative low overpotential for CO evolution and the high overpotential for H 2 evolution, more electrons on Cu 2 O are Fig. 6 e PL spectra of HST and loaded HST with 1.0 wt Ag, Pd, Cu and Au.used to reduce CO 2 H to CO, which results in the enhancement of CO evolution rate.Additionally, Cu 2 O loading may increase the adsorption amount of CO 2 , which is beneficial for CO evolution 57,58.Because Ag/HST possesses the relative high overpotential for both H 2 and CO evolution, its H 2 and CO evolution rates are low. In this study, although having avoided the use of any organic reagents or organic metal salts in processes of the preparation of photocatalysts and photocatalytic reaction, the control experimental was carried out under Ar/H 2 O atmosphere to investigate whether the obtained CO originated from CO 2 .From Fig. S5 and Fig. 9, the H 2 evolution rate of 1 Pd/HST under Ar/H 2 O atmosphere is ca.atmosphere.The phenomenon was also found by other researchers, in which CO should be derived from the CO 2 adsorbed on the surface of photocatalysts from the air as well as the surface-adsorbed organic contaminants 28,59,60.However, the result indicates that the main CO production is assigned to the reduction of CO 2 but not the organic contaminants.

To clarify the effect of cocatalysts Ag, Pd, Au, Cu 2 O on controlling the photocatalytic activity and selectivity, PL emission spectra of the cocatalysts loaded samples were measured to investigate the efficiency of charge separation (Fig. 6), because the intensity of PL emission represented the level of recombination of electrons and holes.It can be observed after loading, the PL intensity drop, indicating that cocatalysts loading facilitates the separation of electrons and holes 54.This should be attributed to the high work function of Pd, Au, Ag metals and the formation of junction of Cu 2 O and HST, which results in the rapid migration of electrons from HST to cocatalysts.Compared to Ag loading, Pd and Au loading causes the better separation of electronholes because the work functions of Pd (5.12 V) and Au (5.1 V) are higher than that of Ag (4.26 V).To examine the overpotentials of CO evolution and H 2 evolution on loaded HST, the current-density-potential behaviours of loaded HST samples in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution with saturated were measured by a linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) method.Also, the Tafel plots from LSV data are shown in Fig. 7.The cathodic currents obtained in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 with saturated N 2 should be attributed to the H 2 evolution reaction, while the cathodic currents obtained in 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 with saturated CO 2 are ascribed to the CO evolution reaction 55.From Fig. 7, in 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 solutions, the onset potentials of current density increasing of Pd/HST and Au/HST are lower than that of Ag/HST and Cu 2 O/HST.More clearly, from Tafel plots, the Pd/HST (0.64 V) and Au/HST (0.67 V) samples exhibit much lower overpotentials than Cu 2 O/HST (0.77 V) and Ag/HST (0.78 V), indicating that, compared to Ag/HST and Cu 2 O/HST samples, the H 2 evolution reaction occurs on Pd/HST and Au/HST samples more lightly 56.However, in 0.1 mol/L KHCO 3 solutions with saturated CO 2 , the Pd/HST (0.45 V) and Cu 2 O/HST (0.40 V) samples exhibit the lower overpotentials than Ag/HST (0.50 V) and Au/HST (0.55 V), which will result in the high photocatalytic activity for CO evolution.From the results of electrochemical measurement and photocatalytic activity, it can be concluded that the selectivity toward CO or H 2 of photocatalysts strongly depends on its overpotential of CO evolution and H 2 evolution (see Table S1).Therefore, based on the analysis above, the schematic presentation of cocatalysts loading for promoting the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity and selectivity toward CO or H 2 is proposed as Fig. 8.After cocatalysts loading, the photoinduced electrons in CB of HST rapidly move to cocatalysts and cause the separation to holes.With the low overpotentials for both CO and H 2 evolution, the electrons on Pd particles readily reduce H or CO 2 H to H 2 or CO.For Cu 2 O/HST, due to the relative low overpotential for CO evolution and the high overpotential for H 2 evolution, more electrons on Cu 2 O are Fig. 6 e PL spectra of HST and loaded HST with 1.0 wt Ag, Pd, Cu and Au.used to reduce CO 2 H to CO, which results in the enhancement of CO evolution rate.Additionally, Cu 2 O loading may increase the adsorption amount of CO 2 , which is beneficial for CO evolution 57,58.Because Ag/HST possesses the relative high overpotential for both H 2 and CO evolution, its H 2 and CO evolution rates are low. In this study, although having avoided the use of any organic reagents or organic metal salts in processes of the preparation of photocatalysts and photocatalytic reaction, the control experimental was carried out under Ar/H 2 O atmosphere to investigate whether the obtained CO originated from CO 2 .From Fig. S5 and Fig. 9, the H 2 evolution rate of 1 Pd/HST under Ar/H 2 O atmosphere is ca.atmosphere.The phenomenon was also found by other researchers, in which CO should be derived from the CO 2 adsorbed on the surface of photocatalysts from the air as well as the surface-adsorbed organic contaminants 28,59,60.However, the result indicates that the main CO production is assigned to the reduction of CO 2 but not the organic contaminants. To examine the effect of the Pd cocatalysts content on the photocatalytic activity, the rates of CO evolution and H 2 evolution of 0.5e2 wt Pd/HST samples are shown in Fig. 10.Although no Pd diffraction peaks are observed from XRD patterns, the stronger absorption longer than 320 nm from DRS indicates the increase of Pd amounts loaded on HST (see Fig. S6).From Fig. 10, all the Pd-decorated HST samples exhibit almost same H 2 evolution rates regardless of loading amounts.However, the CO evolution rates were influenced by Pd loading amounts.1.0 wt Pd/HST sample exhibited the highest CO evolution rate (0.28 mmol g A1 h A1 ), reaching 1.5 times of that of 2.0 wt Pd/HST (0.18 mmol g A1 h A1 ).This result also suggests that excess cocatalyst loading may reduce the photocatalytic activity due to the formation of large particles and poor dispersion on the photocatalyst 61."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid (0.5 mol/Na\u2082SO\u2084 with saturated N\u2082)", "source": "Fig. 7 e a) LSV curves of HST and loaded HST in 0.5 mol/Na 2 SO 4 with saturated N 2 , b) Tafel plots for loaded HST in 0.5 mol/ Na 2 SO 4 with saturated N 2 , c) LSV curves of HST and loaded HST in 0.1 mol/KHCO 3 with saturated CO 2 , d) Tafel plots for loaded HST in 0.1 mol/KHCO 3 with saturated CO 2.", "context": "In summary, Ag, Pd, Au, Cu 2 O as cocatalysts were loaded on the layered H 2 SrTa 2 O 7 by an in situ photodeposited method for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O.
