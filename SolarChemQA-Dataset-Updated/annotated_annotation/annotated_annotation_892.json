2(a)).", "context": "The Co-UiO-67 and Re-UiO-67 catalysts were successfully synthesized by doping different metal ions via post-synthetic approach.The morphologies of the two catalysts are characterized with SEM and TEM as shown in Fig. 1 The elemental distribution of Co-UiO-67 and Re-UiO-67 was clarified by energy dispersive X-ray elemental (EDX) mapping (Fig. S3).It can be seen clearly that the Co and Re elements are evenly distributed on the catalyst.The EDX mapping results confirm a successful integration of Co and Re elements into UiO-67.ICP-MS reveals that 81.96 and 53.02 of the bipyridine ligands were functionalized with Co and Re in UiO-67, respectively (Table S3).The ICP-MS results reveal that bipyridine ligands were partially functionalized with Re or Co in the catalysts, and the partially functionalized UiO-67 will facilitate diffusion of CO 2 , which is in accordance with previous report. 21alysis of PXRD patterns (Fig. 1(c)) reveals that after doping of Co 2 and Re into UiO-67, the resulted XRD patterns are in agreement with original UiO-67, indicating that the doping of Co 2 and Re has virtually no influence on the crystalline structure of UiO-67. 21The FTIR spectra of metal-doped (Co 2 ,Re ) UiO-67 in good agreement with the pristine UiO-67.Besides, the bands at 1904, 1920, and 2022 cm -1 for Re-UiO-67 S2).Additionally, the thermal stability of samples was tested with thermogravimetry (TG) as shown in Fig. S1, and both samples exhibited highly thermal stability up to 400 C.Before 100 C, the decline of the curve is attributed to the evaporation of solvents within Co-UiO-67 cavities, and it began to drop significantly at 400 C due to the collapse of framework. 22,24 To further investigate the elemental compositions and electronic states of elements in prepared photocatalysts, the XPS spectrum were tested.The XPS spectrum of the Co-UiO-67 indicates the presence of Co, Zr, C, Cl, O, and N (Fig. S4(a)).This further proves the successful doping of cobalt into UiO-67.Two main peaks at 796.6 eV and 780.7 eV shown in XPS spectrum of Co 2p (Fig. 1(e)), corresponding to 2P 1/2 and 2P 3/2 of Co 2 , respectively 25,26 And, tow peaks at 43.3 eV and 41.0 eV shown in Fig. S3 for Re-UiO-67 can be attributed to 4f 5/2 and 4f 7/2 of Re . 27The aforementioned results suggest the successful doping of Co 2 and Re into UiO-67.Solid-state ultraviolet-visible absorption experiment was performed to investigate the coordination situation of doped Co and Re species within UiO-67 (Fig. 1(d)).Co-UiO-67 exhibited three absorption bands at 628, 570, and 530 nm, which correspond to the characteristic absorption of 4 A 2 (F) 4 T 1 (P) transition of Co 2 ions in tetrahedral environments. 25,28The characteristic peak of Re-UiO-67 at 420 nm corresponds to the metal-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) of Re species. 21,27 photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, the CO 2 molecules have to be adsorbed on catalytic sites followed by surface reactions.The higher CO 2 adsorption amount, the more favorable catalytic reaction. 21,30 herefore, the adsorption capacity of porous photocatalysts acts a pivotal part in promotion of their catalytic performances.The CO 2 adsorption capability of samples was evaluated as shown in Fig. 1(f).The Co-UiO-67 exhibited the highest CO 2 adsorption capacity with a value of 33.6 cm 3 g -1 compare to that of Re-UiO-67 (24.6 cm 3 g -1 ) and UiO-67 (17.5 cm 3 g -1 ).The unsaturated coordination of cobalt active site in Co-UiO-67 contributes to the improvement of CO 2 adsorption capacity. 18,29 study the influence of doped Co and Re species on catalytic activity, photocatalytic experiments were performed under visible-light illumination (Fig. 2(a)).After the 4 h photocatalytic reaction using Co-UiO-67 as catalyst, the total amount of CO with a value of 13.17 mol is reached, and the average formation rate of CO amounts to 3292.5 molh -1 g -1 , which is eight-fold of Re-UiO-67 with an average formation rate of 412.5 molh -1 g -1 . As reference experiment the photocatalytic reactions with and without UiO-67 were carried out and analysis of CO evolution results reveals that the amount of produced CO with UiO-67 is as same as that of in the absence of UiO-67, which indicates no photocatalytic activity of UiO-67 toward the reduction of CO 2 .It should be noted that trace amount of CO was produced without UiO-67.This is due to the contribution of photosensitizer, which can be acted as catalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction. 30 liquid products were detected by ion chromatography or GC-MS.To further investigate the importance of the components in this photocatalytic system, reference experiments were carried out and the obtained results are listed in Table S1. Experimental results indicate that the photosensitizers, electronic sacrificial agents, and illumination are essential in this reaction system. The stability of the heterogeneous catalyst is of great significance towards industrial applications. 31As shown in Fig. 2 Co-UiO-67 exhibited virtually no change during three-cycle photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, and the crystalline structure remained unchanged, which was confirmed by XRD data as shown in Fig. S6.In addition, the similar content of Co within Co-UiO-67 before and after photocatalytic reduction reaction was found based on the results of ICP-MS measurements.In contrast, Re-Uio-67 loses its catalytic activity after two catalytic cycles due to the detachment of rhenium from the organic ligand. 19eady-state photoluminescence (PL) experiment was performed to explore the photogenerated electron transfer mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Fig. 3(a) displays the PL spectra of photosensitizer and catalysts.The emission intensity decreased by the addition of catalysts into the reaction system containing photosensitizer, which is inductive of an oxidation quenching process for photocatalytic reduction reaction. 9The emission band intensity of the Co-UiO-67 is lower than that of the Re-UiO-67, which indicates a faster electron transfer process from photosensitizer to the Co-UiO-67 than that to the Re-UiO-67.the current density of Co-UiO-67 under Ar atmosphere, which indicated that the Co-UiO-67 possesses electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.This demonstrates that -0.97 V is an onset potential of the CO 2 reduction reaction. 33The singlet state of E s (Ru(bpy) 3 2 /Ru(bpy) 3 3 ) in acetonitrile solution was calculated to be -1.31V (vs. Ag/AgCl), 34 which is lower than the onset potential.This indicates that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction with Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 and Co-UiO-67 is a thermodynamically favored process (G -1.31V-(-0.97V) -0.34V,i.e. 0). 353637 Generally, a typical photocatalytic reduction reaction can be depicted as follows: (1) the CO 2 molecules have to be adsorbed on the surface of photocatalysts forming CO 2 ; (2) The absorbed CO 2 interacted with protons produced by water decomposition to form COOH intermediate, and (3) the COOH is further reduced to CO by a proton-electron transfer process, followed by (4) CO desorption from the catalyst surface to produce CO. (4) \"\" represents active adsorption state. To get in-depth understanding of the effect of different doped metals on the photocatalytic performance, reaction free energy of Co-UiO-67 and Re-UiO-67 for CO 2 reduction was obtained through DFT calculations as illustrated in Fig. 4.Both catalysts possess a similar catalytic process, in which the rate-limiting step is the process of forming COOH intermediates. 38The formation energy of COOH intermediate amounts to 0.86 eV for Co-UiO-67, which is lower than 0.92 eV for Re-UiO-67, suggesting that Co-UiO-67 is more beneficial for CO 2 reduction.This may be due to the strong interaction of the unsaturated d-orbital electrons of Co active sites with CO 2 molecules, which lowers the free energy barrier.This, in return, contributes to the excellent catalytic performance of Co-UiO-67 than Re-UiO-67."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction for Co-UiO-67 was measured in a CO 2 saturated mixed solution containing 1 mg Co-UiO-67, 8 mg Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 under 300 W Xe lamp (light intensity: 100 mWcm -2 , 400 nm 800 nm) irradiation.", "context": "Chemical reagents used in this work are used without further purification, include CoCl 2 (Energy Chemical), Re(CO) 5 Cl, tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAH), 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid (H 2 bpydc), 4,4'-diphenyldicarboxylic acid (H 2 bpdc), ethanol, methanol, acetic acid, acetonitrile (MeCN), N,N-dimethylformaide (DMF), and triethanolamine (TEOA).
