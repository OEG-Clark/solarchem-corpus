cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), ammonia aqueous, NaOH, KHCO 3 , and Na 2 SO 3 were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent.All reagents used in this work were analytically pure and used without further purification.Sodium silicate solution was extracted from rice husk by the alkali solution method.Briefly, 38 g of calcined rice husk ash and 10 g of NaOH were mixed in 350 mL of water, and then stirred and refluxed at 70 C for 24 h.The mixed liquid was filtered, and the Si content in the clear liquid measured by ICP-OES was 39.1 g/L. The g-C 3 N 4 nanotubes (NT) were prepared by a two-step process with a hydrothermal performing process.Firstly, 2 g of melamine was dissolved into 120 mL of deionized water under the condition of stirring at 80 C for 10 min.Then, the obtained clear solution was transferred to a 200 mL PTFE-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 180 C for 24 h.The crystalline product, preformed white melamine-cyanuric acid (MCA), was collected by filtered, washed several times with water, and completely dried.Secondly, the 3 g of MCA precursor was placed in an alumina crucible with a cover and then calcined at 550 C for h in a tube furnace with N 2 gas flow.For comparison, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 was prepared by thermal polymerization of melamine.Typically, 2 g of melamine was heated at 550 C for 4 h.The light yellow powder was collected after cooled and ground. The TPS was synthesized by the following soft template method.10 g of PEG was dissolved in 40 mL deionized water and stirred for min at 40 C, which labeled as solution A. 1 g of CTAB was dissolved in 10 mL deionized water at 60 C, which labeled as solution B. Solution A was added to solution B, and then 18 mL of sodium silicate solution was added dropwise to the mixed solution after 1 mL of ammonia aqueous was added.The mixture gel was stirred with 300 r/min at 40 C for 8 h.Finally, the product was filtrated, washed, and dried.Then the template was removed by heated to 550 C for 6 h with a ramp rate of 10 C/min. The TPS/g-C 3 N 4 NT composite was prepared by a hydrothermal method.0.3 g of g-C 3 N 4 NT was dispersed in 100 mL of water by ultrasonic treatment for 10 min.0.1 g of TPS was added to the above suspension, and the ultrasonic treatment was continued for 30 min.Then, the mixed solution was transferred to a 200 mL PTFE-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was heated at 120 C for 12 h.Finally, the product was filtrated, washed with deionized water, and dried at 80 C. Samples with the same preparation method but different amounts of TPS, 0.1 g, 0.2 g, and 0.3 g, were labeled TGNT1, TGNT2, and TGNT3. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) with Cu K radiation ( 0.154 nm).The pattern data was recorded at 2 5 to 75 with the step size of 0.02 .Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on a Cary 660 Spectrum One FTIR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Australia) in the range of 4000-600 cm -1 .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data was obtained using an Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer (KRATOS, UK) using monochromatic Al K radiation (h1486.6eV).The signal at 284.8 eV of the C (1s) region was employed to adjust the binding energies for all of the XPS spectra.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on an ULTRA PLUS field emission scanning electron microscope (ZEISS, Germany) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were observed with a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) working at 200 kV.The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm at -196 C and CO 2 adsorption isotherm at 0 C were measured on an ASAP 2460 static adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics, USA).Specific surface area, pore size distribution, and total pore volume were calculated by the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method, the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) method, and the adsorption amount at the relative pressure P/P 0 of 0.995.Before each measurement, the samples were degassed at 200 C for 6 h.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) data was conducted using a Lambda 650S UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, USA) in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra was recorded using a Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer (HORIBA, Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. Photocatalytic activity measurement was carried out in a homemade closed photocatalytic reactor.It can control the gas flow through a mass flow controller (AALBORG, USA), cut off the gas path through the valves, and control the reaction temperature through a chiller (YKKY, China).The experiment of stable photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 under visible light irradiation is thus realized.Before illumination, 100 mg of photocatalysts were suspended in 100 mL of KHCO 3 (0.1 M) and Na 2 SO 3 (0.1 M) under magnetic stirring in the double-layer Pyrex glass reactor, and pure CO 2 gas was continuously through the solution for 30 min to eliminate air and dissolve oxygen.KHCO 3 is used to solution to enhance the solubility of CO 2 during photocatalytic reactions, and Na 2 SO 3 act as holes sacrifice agent 36.A 300 W Xe lamp (Microsolar300, PerfectLight, China) equipped with a cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was used as the visible light source to illuminate the reactant through the quartz window.A constant temperature water tank filled with ethylene glycol aqueous solution was used to control the reaction temperature at 0 C.During the entire irradiation process, pure CO 2 was continuously bubbled through the above solution in the reactor.At a certain time interval, a syringe with a nylon membrane filter (pore size 0.45 m) was used to take out 0.5 mL of liquid product to remove the photocatalyst particles.The ethanol concentration of the 3.0 L liquid sample was analyzed by a QP2010 Ultra gas chromatography mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) with an AOC-20i auto-injector.The gas in the headspace of the reactor was analyzed by a 6890N gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies, USA).Under the same experimental conditions, the comparative experiment was carried out in the dark or without CO 2 gas flow.After the reaction, the sample was separated by centrifugation for repeated measurements, which was to investigate the recyclability.The 13 C isotope labeling experiment was performed to verify that the products were from CO 2 photocatalytic conversion.The 13 CO 2 was used as feed gas instead of 12 CO 2 in the reaction process, and the products were analyzed by the QP2010 Ultra GC-MS. 5 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in a mixed solution of 1 mL of water, 0.35 mL of ethanol, and 10 L of nafion.150 L of the sample was dropped on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass with the area of 1 0.8 cm 2 and dried in a vacuum.The photocurrent measurement was carried out on a CHI660E electrochemical analyzer (ChenHua, China).It was operated in a three-electrode system, and a platinum electrode, indium tin oxide glass, and saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were acted as the counter electrode, working electrode, and standard electrode, respectively.The electrolyte was a 0.1 M sodium sulfate solution.Electrochemical impendence spectroscopes (EIS) was carried out on a PP211 electrochemical analyzer (Zahner, Germany).It was performed in the presence of 5 mM K 3 Fe(CN) 6 /K 4 Fe(CN) 6 (1:1) mixture as a redox probe in 0.1 M potassium chloride (KCl) at 0.24 V."}, {"llm generation": "bulk g-C 3 N 4", "source": "However, a large amount of methanol is detected in the reaction product solution using bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the previously published work 646566.", "context": "The crystal structure of the g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT are investigated by XRD, as presented in Fig. 1.The diffraction peak at 12.7 is assigned the (210) plane corresponding melon-type CN with an orthorhombic structure 37,38.The peak at 27.3 is attributed to the (002) plane corresponding to the characteristic inter-planar stacking reflection of conjugated aromatic systems 39.As shown in Fig. S1(a), the peaks at 10.5 , 18.3 , 21.9 , and 27.7 are attributed to the in-planar packing and inter-planar stacking of hydrothermal intermediate MCA 40.It shows that after the hydrothermal process, the crystal structure of melamine has been completely transformed into MCA.The broad diffraction peak of TPS at 23 degrees in Fig. S1(b) indicates that it is amorphous silica 41. The chemical structure of the samples is surveyed by FTIR, as shown in Fig. 2. The peaks at 1238, 1321, 1410, 1572, and 1637 cm -1 are attributed to the typical stretching modes of C-N heterocycles from g-C 3 N 4 NT 42.The peak at 812 cm -1 is assigned to the vibration mode of the s-triazine units 43.The broad peak around 3200 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrational modes of primary amines -NH 2 and secondary amines NH 44.In the spectra of TPS, the peak at 1085 cm -1 is due to the bond bending vibrations of Si-O-Si.The peak at 958 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrations of Si-OH 45,46.Obviously, the characteristic peaks of TGNT show that the composite photocatalysts are provided with both chemical structures of g-C 3 N 4 and TPS. The compositions and chemical states of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 NT, and TGNT are further investigated by XPS.The survey spectra of C, N, O, Si elements are shown in Fig. 3(a).The high-resolution spectra for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p are fitted and shown in Fig. 3(b) (c) (d) (e).In C 1s spectra, the peaks at 288.3, 285.8, and 284.8 eV are attributed to the carbon atom in N-CN bonds of g-C 3 N 4 , - of the adventitious carbocycles, and C-C bonds in the adventitious reference carbon on the surface 47,48.In N 1s spectra, the peaks at 401.3, 399.6, and 398.7 eV can be ascribed to N in N-(C) 3 , N-H, and C-NC 49,50.The peak at 404.4 eV is attributed to the excitation of the heptazine rings 51.In O 1s spectra, the peak at 533.7 eV is due to the CO bond formed during the hydrothermal process.The peak at 532.3 eV is derived from the C-OH bond, so that TGNT can avoid the formation of -OH groups on the photocatalyst surface, and thus O defects are formed 52,53.The Si 2p binding energy of Si peak at 103.9 eV is the chemical bond of O-Si-O 54,55.As shown in Fig. S3 (d), the three samples of TGNT exhibit obvious Si energy peaks, which prove the combination between g-C 3 N 4 and TPS.5(a).The texture characteristics calculated from the above curve, including BET specific surface area (S ), external specific surface area (S ), total pore volume (V ), and average pore size (D ), are listed in Table 1.It can reveal that with the increase of TPS loading, the N 2 adsorption capacity and pore volume of TGNT increase, thus leading to more surface adsorption vacancies.There are hysteresis loops in the curves of the three samples of TGNT, indicating that there is a process of mesoporous capillary condensation.The mesoporous structure can quickly transfer ions and penetrate to the active site 56.The intermediate MCA has almost no adsorption effect, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1.The tube structure has an enhanced specific surface area after thermal polymerization, and then it is further increased after loading TPS.The extremely increased specific surface area can provide more reactive sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 57.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the trimodal porous distribution peaks of TPS are concentrated at 1.3, 1.7, and 2.4 nm.The samples of TGNT are also showed these three distribution peaks at the pore width above, and the average pore size decreased with the increase of TPS loading.It can also be seen that the TPS load increases by the same amount but the S has a huge difference because part of the trimodal porous is blocked during the 6(a).The characteristic absorption edge at around 450 nm is displayed in all samples.The curve of g-C 3 N 4 NT is relatively blue-shifted, which may originate from the quantum confinement effect caused by the size and thickness reduction compared to bulk g-C 3 N 4 58.For g-C 3 N 4 , the introduction of quantum confinement effect could provide competent driving forces for photocatalytic reactions 59.This indicates that the construction of the nanotube structure and the load of TPS can affect the electronic structure of C 3 N 4 , thereby expanding the band gap 60.The band gap is estimated by the Kubelka-Munk transformation method 61,62, and it is presented in Fig. 6(b).The VB XPS spectra is used to calculate VB potentials (E ), which is shown in Fig. 3(f).The tangents of the curve around 0 eV are calculated, and the energy value corresponding to the position of the intersection of the tangents is the VB potential.The E of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are 1.31, 1.26, and 1.40 eV related to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Considering the band gap estimated by the UV-vis DRS, the CB potentials (E ) of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are located at 1.54, 1.63 and 1.34 eV vs NHE, respectively.They are much more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (0.33 eV vs NHE) 63.It points out that loading TPS on g-C 3 N 4 NT can cause E to be more negative and enhance CO 2 reduction performance.The absorption peak of TGNT is stronger, and its absorption peak tail extends the absorption intensity at greater than 450 nm.Therefore, TGNT loaded of TPS has a stronger light trapping ability. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity was measured under visible light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.Only ethanol was detected when performing catalytic activity evaluation using g-C 3 N 4 NT and composite TGNT as the photocatalyst.However, a large amount of methanol is detected in the reaction product solution using bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the previously published work 646566.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps of the rough mechanism are depicted as follows Eqs. ( 1)-( 5) 67,68. The incident photons of visible light produce excitons after being absorbed by the semiconductor g-C 3 N 4 , which are electron-hole pairs constrained by the Coulomb force 69, as described in Eq. (1).In order for the catalytic process to occur, the charges need respectively migrate to the reaction sites on the photocatalyst surface and avoid recombination.There, electrons and holes respectively reduce the adsorbed electron acceptor CO 2 molecules and oxidize the electron donor H 2 O, which is described in Eqs. ( 2) and (3).The production of CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH through the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is shown in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex path for multi-electron transfer, and multiple products are obtained.From the thermodynamic perspective, six electrons or twelve electrons are required to convert one CO 2 molecule to form CH 3 OH or C 2 H 5 OH.The hollow tubular structure can not only provide effective light collection ability due to multiple light reflections or scattering in the internal space, but also can reduce the diffusion distance from the inside to the surface, thereby accelerating the separation of charge carriers 70.Therefore, TGNT can undertake the conversion process of ethanol with more charge transfer, while bulk g-C 3 N 4 can only produce methanol and a small amount of ethanol. The blank experiments were operated under the same conditions in the dark or without CO 2 gas flow, which did not detect the reduction products.It indicates that both light and CO 2 gas are necessary for the photocatalytic reduction reaction.Besides, N 2 was introduced into the reactor instead of CO 2 for the comparative reaction, and then no carbon-based products were detected, and this is similar to previous reports 71,72.To further verify that the ethanol product originates from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , the 13 C isotope labeling experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 gas under identical experimental conditions.The mass spectrum of the GC-MS analysis of the product of 13 CO 2 as feed gas in the reaction is shown in Fig. 7(c).The fragment peaks of ethanol appear at m/z 31, 32, 43, and 45 instead of the peaks at m/z 29, 30, 31, 41, and 43 of the nonisotopic labeling experiment (Fig. S7).This confirms that the ethanol produced comes from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , rather than originate from carbon materials contamination.In the reaction experiment using bulk TPS as a photocatalyst, no reduction product was detected, indicating that it does not have the photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 .After 8 h of photocatalytic reaction, the ethanol yield of the prepared photocatalyst tends to be stable.The gas in the headspace of the reactor was analyzed, and no gas products of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were detected.Compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the activity of g-C 3 N 4 NT with nanotube structure is greatly enhanced, and the ethanol output is 113 mol/g.Then, the activity of composite TGNT loaded with TPS is further enhanced, and TGNT2 reached 196 mol/g.However, the ethanol yield of TGNT3 is improved less, which is due to the excessive loading of TPS that affects the photocatalytic process.As shown in Fig. 7(d), after 10 cycles of testing, the ethanol production of TGNT2 decreased by less than 5.The photocatalyst was characterized by XRD and FTIR after 10 cycles of running in Fig. S8.From the crystal plane diffraction peak and chemical bond absorption peak, it can be seen that its crystal structure and chemical structure have not changed.It indicates that this composite photocatalyst can be stably used repeatedly for a long time.The comparison of various recently reported g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts previously with the present work for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was listed in Table S2.It can be seen that the present work has prepared a composite photocatalyst with considerable catalytic activity by a universal and simple hydrothermal method. High-sensitivity steady-state PL spectra of as-prepared photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8(a).The emission peak of g-C 3 N 4 is displayed at 475 nm, but due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the TGNT composite structure, the emission peak shifts to 450 nm 73.The PL emission peak intensity of g-C 3 N 4 NT is significantly lower than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , and TGNT1 and TGNT2 are further lower.The low emission peak intensity indicates that the recombination rate of charge carriers is much lower, and the charge transfer in TGNT1 and TGNT2 is faster 74.The emission peak intensity of TGNT3 is extremely enhanced, indicating that loading a large amount of TPS will result in faster recombination of charge carriers.Although TGNT3 has better light absorption performance and larger surface area, the rapid recombination of carriers limits the photocatalytic reduction process and therefore leads to the lowest catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 8(b), the transient photocurrent response analyses were performed under a visible light lamp that turns on and off repeatedly to investigate the charge separation and transfer efficiency.The photocurrent response quickly after light on, and the current density of all photocatalysts can be ignored during light off.The rapid response of current to light irradiation indicates that the charge is quickly transferred in the photocatalyst 75.The corresponding reproducibility of the photocurrent is stable in several cycles of light irradiation, which leads to stable catalytic performance after multiple irradiations and repeated use.The photocurrent intensity of TGNT2 is twice that of g-C 3 N 4 NT, indicating that loading TPS greatly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 76,77.In order to further confirm the improvement of charge separation and transfer efficiency, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT2 were investigated, as shown in the Fig. 8(c).The Nyquist plot shows that the arc radius of TGNT2 is smaller than that of g-C 3 N 4 , which is attributed to the fact that the TPS composite material reduces the charge transfer resistance and increases the electronic conductivity.It results in more effective charge separation, and the excellent charge transfer capability is consistent with the above photocurrent response 78,79.As shown in Fig. 8(d), the structure of the nanotube and the load of the TPS affect the expansion of the band gap.The increase in the band gap of the TGNT can be attributed to the O defect effect due to the loading of silica 80.Photoelectrons and holes can be constrained at the defect site, and new intrinsic or extrinsic absorption bands can be generated in the band gap of SiO 2 , which optimizes the redox couple chosen as photocatalysis/photoelectrochemical applications 81.These factors lead to changes in the energy band structure, and a suitable energy band structure can thermodynamically realize the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4", "source": "The incident photons of visible light produce excitons after being absorbed by the semiconductor g-C 3 N 4 , which are electron-hole pairs constrained by the Coulomb force 69, as described in Eq.

The compositions and chemical states of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 NT, and TGNT are further investigated by XPS.The survey spectra of C, N, O, Si elements are shown in Fig. 3(a).The high-resolution spectra for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p are fitted and shown in Fig. 3(b) (c) (d) (e).In C 1s spectra, the peaks at 288.3, 285.8, and 284.8 eV are attributed to the carbon atom in N-CN bonds of g-C 3 N 4 , - of the adventitious carbocycles, and C-C bonds in the adventitious reference carbon on the surface 47,48.In N 1s spectra, the peaks at 401.3, 399.6, and 398.7 eV can be ascribed to N in N-(C) 3 , N-H, and C-NC 49,50.The peak at 404.4 eV is attributed to the excitation of the heptazine rings 51.In O 1s spectra, the peak at 533.7 eV is due to the CO bond formed during the hydrothermal process.The peak at 532.3 eV is derived from the C-OH bond, so that TGNT can avoid the formation of -OH groups on the photocatalyst surface, and thus O defects are formed 52,53.The Si 2p binding energy of Si peak at 103.9 eV is the chemical bond of O-Si-O 54,55.As shown in Fig. S3 (d), the three samples of TGNT exhibit obvious Si energy peaks, which prove the combination between g-C 3 N 4 and TPS.5(a).The texture characteristics calculated from the above curve, including BET specific surface area (S ), external specific surface area (S ), total pore volume (V ), and average pore size (D ), are listed in Table 1.It can reveal that with the increase of TPS loading, the N 2 adsorption capacity and pore volume of TGNT increase, thus leading to more surface adsorption vacancies.There are hysteresis loops in the curves of the three samples of TGNT, indicating that there is a process of mesoporous capillary condensation.The mesoporous structure can quickly transfer ions and penetrate to the active site 56.The intermediate MCA has almost no adsorption effect, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1.The tube structure has an enhanced specific surface area after thermal polymerization, and then it is further increased after loading TPS.The extremely increased specific surface area can provide more reactive sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 57.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the trimodal porous distribution peaks of TPS are concentrated at 1.3, 1.7, and 2.4 nm.The samples of TGNT are also showed these three distribution peaks at the pore width above, and the average pore size decreased with the increase of TPS loading.It can also be seen that the TPS load increases by the same amount but the S has a huge difference because part of the trimodal porous is blocked during the 6(a).The characteristic absorption edge at around 450 nm is displayed in all samples.The curve of g-C 3 N 4 NT is relatively blue-shifted, which may originate from the quantum confinement effect caused by the size and thickness reduction compared to bulk g-C 3 N 4 58.For g-C 3 N 4 , the introduction of quantum confinement effect could provide competent driving forces for photocatalytic reactions 59.This indicates that the construction of the nanotube structure and the load of TPS can affect the electronic structure of C 3 N 4 , thereby expanding the band gap 60.The band gap is estimated by the Kubelka-Munk transformation method 61,62, and it is presented in Fig. 6(b).The VB XPS spectra is used to calculate VB potentials (E ), which is shown in Fig. 3(f).The tangents of the curve around 0 eV are calculated, and the energy value corresponding to the position of the intersection of the tangents is the VB potential.The E of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are 1.31, 1.26, and 1.40 eV related to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Considering the band gap estimated by the UV-vis DRS, the CB potentials (E ) of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are located at 1.54, 1.63 and 1.34 eV vs NHE, respectively.They are much more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (0.33 eV vs NHE) 63.It points out that loading TPS on g-C 3 N 4 NT can cause E to be more negative and enhance CO 2 reduction performance.The absorption peak of TGNT is stronger, and its absorption peak tail extends the absorption intensity at greater than 450 nm.Therefore, TGNT loaded of TPS has a stronger light trapping ability. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity was measured under visible light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.Only ethanol was detected when performing catalytic activity evaluation using g-C 3 N 4 NT and composite TGNT as the photocatalyst.However, a large amount of methanol is detected in the reaction product solution using bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the previously published work 646566.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps of the rough mechanism are depicted as follows Eqs. ( 1)-( 5) 67,68. The incident photons of visible light produce excitons after being absorbed by the semiconductor g-C 3 N 4 , which are electron-hole pairs constrained by the Coulomb force 69, as described in Eq. (1).In order for the catalytic process to occur, the charges need respectively migrate to the reaction sites on the photocatalyst surface and avoid recombination.There, electrons and holes respectively reduce the adsorbed electron acceptor CO 2 molecules and oxidize the electron donor H 2 O, which is described in Eqs. ( 2) and (3).The production of CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH through the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is shown in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex path for multi-electron transfer, and multiple products are obtained.From the thermodynamic perspective, six electrons or twelve electrons are required to convert one CO 2 molecule to form CH 3 OH or C 2 H 5 OH.The hollow tubular structure can not only provide effective light collection ability due to multiple light reflections or scattering in the internal space, but also can reduce the diffusion distance from the inside to the surface, thereby accelerating the separation of charge carriers 70.Therefore, TGNT can undertake the conversion process of ethanol with more charge transfer, while bulk g-C 3 N 4 can only produce methanol and a small amount of ethanol. The blank experiments were operated under the same conditions in the dark or without CO 2 gas flow, which did not detect the reduction products.It indicates that both light and CO 2 gas are necessary for the photocatalytic reduction reaction.Besides, N 2 was introduced into the reactor instead of CO 2 for the comparative reaction, and then no carbon-based products were detected, and this is similar to previous reports 71,72.To further verify that the ethanol product originates from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , the 13 C isotope labeling experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 gas under identical experimental conditions.The mass spectrum of the GC-MS analysis of the product of 13 CO 2 as feed gas in the reaction is shown in Fig. 7(c).The fragment peaks of ethanol appear at m/z 31, 32, 43, and 45 instead of the peaks at m/z 29, 30, 31, 41, and 43 of the nonisotopic labeling experiment (Fig. S7).This confirms that the ethanol produced comes from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , rather than originate from carbon materials contamination.In the reaction experiment using bulk TPS as a photocatalyst, no reduction product was detected, indicating that it does not have the photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 .After 8 h of photocatalytic reaction, the ethanol yield of the prepared photocatalyst tends to be stable.The gas in the headspace of the reactor was analyzed, and no gas products of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were detected.Compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the activity of g-C 3 N 4 NT with nanotube structure is greatly enhanced, and the ethanol output is 113 mol/g.Then, the activity of composite TGNT loaded with TPS is further enhanced, and TGNT2 reached 196 mol/g.However, the ethanol yield of TGNT3 is improved less, which is due to the excessive loading of TPS that affects the photocatalytic process.As shown in Fig. 7(d), after 10 cycles of testing, the ethanol production of TGNT2 decreased by less than 5.The photocatalyst was characterized by XRD and FTIR after 10 cycles of running in Fig. S8.From the crystal plane diffraction peak and chemical bond absorption peak, it can be seen that its crystal structure and chemical structure have not changed.It indicates that this composite photocatalyst can be stably used repeatedly for a long time.The comparison of various recently reported g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts previously with the present work for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was listed in Table S2.It can be seen that the present work has prepared a composite photocatalyst with considerable catalytic activity by a universal and simple hydrothermal method. High-sensitivity steady-state PL spectra of as-prepared photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8(a).The emission peak of g-C 3 N 4 is displayed at 475 nm, but due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the TGNT composite structure, the emission peak shifts to 450 nm 73.The PL emission peak intensity of g-C 3 N 4 NT is significantly lower than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , and TGNT1 and TGNT2 are further lower.The low emission peak intensity indicates that the recombination rate of charge carriers is much lower, and the charge transfer in TGNT1 and TGNT2 is faster 74.The emission peak intensity of TGNT3 is extremely enhanced, indicating that loading a large amount of TPS will result in faster recombination of charge carriers.Although TGNT3 has better light absorption performance and larger surface area, the rapid recombination of carriers limits the photocatalytic reduction process and therefore leads to the lowest catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 8(b), the transient photocurrent response analyses were performed under a visible light lamp that turns on and off repeatedly to investigate the charge separation and transfer efficiency.The photocurrent response quickly after light on, and the current density of all photocatalysts can be ignored during light off.The rapid response of current to light irradiation indicates that the charge is quickly transferred in the photocatalyst 75.The corresponding reproducibility of the photocurrent is stable in several cycles of light irradiation, which leads to stable catalytic performance after multiple irradiations and repeated use.The photocurrent intensity of TGNT2 is twice that of g-C 3 N 4 NT, indicating that loading TPS greatly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 76,77.In order to further confirm the improvement of charge separation and transfer efficiency, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT2 were investigated, as shown in the Fig. 8(c).The Nyquist plot shows that the arc radius of TGNT2 is smaller than that of g-C 3 N 4 , which is attributed to the fact that the TPS composite material reduces the charge transfer resistance and increases the electronic conductivity.It results in more effective charge separation, and the excellent charge transfer capability is consistent with the above photocurrent response 78,79.As shown in Fig. 8(d), the structure of the nanotube and the load of the TPS affect the expansion of the band gap.The increase in the band gap of the TGNT can be attributed to the O defect effect due to the loading of silica 80.Photoelectrons and holes can be constrained at the defect site, and new intrinsic or extrinsic absorption bands can be generated in the band gap of SiO 2 , which optimizes the redox couple chosen as photocatalysis/photoelectrochemical applications 81.These factors lead to changes in the energy band structure, and a suitable energy band structure can thermodynamically realize the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4 NT", "source": "Compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the activity of g-C 3 N 4 NT with nanotube structure is greatly enhanced, and the ethanol output is 113 mol/g.", "context": "The crystal structure of the g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT are investigated by XRD, as presented in Fig. 1.The diffraction peak at 12.7 is assigned the (210) plane corresponding melon-type CN with an orthorhombic structure 37,38.The peak at 27.3 is attributed to the (002) plane corresponding to the characteristic inter-planar stacking reflection of conjugated aromatic systems 39.As shown in Fig. S1(a), the peaks at 10.5 , 18.3 , 21.9 , and 27.7 are attributed to the in-planar packing and inter-planar stacking of hydrothermal intermediate MCA 40.It shows that after the hydrothermal process, the crystal structure of melamine has been completely transformed into MCA.The broad diffraction peak of TPS at 23 degrees in Fig. S1(b) indicates that it is amorphous silica 41. The chemical structure of the samples is surveyed by FTIR, as shown in Fig. 2. The peaks at 1238, 1321, 1410, 1572, and 1637 cm -1 are attributed to the typical stretching modes of C-N heterocycles from g-C 3 N 4 NT 42.The peak at 812 cm -1 is assigned to the vibration mode of the s-triazine units 43.The broad peak around 3200 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrational modes of primary amines -NH 2 and secondary amines NH 44.In the spectra of TPS, the peak at 1085 cm -1 is due to the bond bending vibrations of Si-O-Si.The peak at 958 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrations of Si-OH 45,46.Obviously, the characteristic peaks of TGNT show that the composite photocatalysts are provided with both chemical structures of g-C 3 N 4 and TPS. The compositions and chemical states of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 NT, and TGNT are further investigated by XPS.The survey spectra of C, N, O, Si elements are shown in Fig. 3(a).The high-resolution spectra for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p are fitted and shown in Fig. 3(b) (c) (d) (e).In C 1s spectra, the peaks at 288.3, 285.8, and 284.8 eV are attributed to the carbon atom in N-CN bonds of g-C 3 N 4 , - of the adventitious carbocycles, and C-C bonds in the adventitious reference carbon on the surface 47,48.In N 1s spectra, the peaks at 401.3, 399.6, and 398.7 eV can be ascribed to N in N-(C) 3 , N-H, and C-NC 49,50.The peak at 404.4 eV is attributed to the excitation of the heptazine rings 51.In O 1s spectra, the peak at 533.7 eV is due to the CO bond formed during the hydrothermal process.The peak at 532.3 eV is derived from the C-OH bond, so that TGNT can avoid the formation of -OH groups on the photocatalyst surface, and thus O defects are formed 52,53.The Si 2p binding energy of Si peak at 103.9 eV is the chemical bond of O-Si-O 54,55.As shown in Fig. S3 (d), the three samples of TGNT exhibit obvious Si energy peaks, which prove the combination between g-C 3 N 4 and TPS.5(a).The texture characteristics calculated from the above curve, including BET specific surface area (S ), external specific surface area (S ), total pore volume (V ), and average pore size (D ), are listed in Table 1.It can reveal that with the increase of TPS loading, the N 2 adsorption capacity and pore volume of TGNT increase, thus leading to more surface adsorption vacancies.There are hysteresis loops in the curves of the three samples of TGNT, indicating that there is a process of mesoporous capillary condensation.The mesoporous structure can quickly transfer ions and penetrate to the active site 56.The intermediate MCA has almost no adsorption effect, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1.The tube structure has an enhanced specific surface area after thermal polymerization, and then it is further increased after loading TPS.The extremely increased specific surface area can provide more reactive sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 57.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the trimodal porous distribution peaks of TPS are concentrated at 1.3, 1.7, and 2.4 nm.The samples of TGNT are also showed these three distribution peaks at the pore width above, and the average pore size decreased with the increase of TPS loading.It can also be seen that the TPS load increases by the same amount but the S has a huge difference because part of the trimodal porous is blocked during the 6(a).The characteristic absorption edge at around 450 nm is displayed in all samples.The curve of g-C 3 N 4 NT is relatively blue-shifted, which may originate from the quantum confinement effect caused by the size and thickness reduction compared to bulk g-C 3 N 4 58.For g-C 3 N 4 , the introduction of quantum confinement effect could provide competent driving forces for photocatalytic reactions 59.This indicates that the construction of the nanotube structure and the load of TPS can affect the electronic structure of C 3 N 4 , thereby expanding the band gap 60.The band gap is estimated by the Kubelka-Munk transformation method 61,62, and it is presented in Fig. 6(b).The VB XPS spectra is used to calculate VB potentials (E ), which is shown in Fig. 3(f).The tangents of the curve around 0 eV are calculated, and the energy value corresponding to the position of the intersection of the tangents is the VB potential.The E of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are 1.31, 1.26, and 1.40 eV related to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Considering the band gap estimated by the UV-vis DRS, the CB potentials (E ) of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are located at 1.54, 1.63 and 1.34 eV vs NHE, respectively.They are much more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (0.33 eV vs NHE) 63.It points out that loading TPS on g-C 3 N 4 NT can cause E to be more negative and enhance CO 2 reduction performance.The absorption peak of TGNT is stronger, and its absorption peak tail extends the absorption intensity at greater than 450 nm.Therefore, TGNT loaded of TPS has a stronger light trapping ability. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity was measured under visible light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.Only ethanol was detected when performing catalytic activity evaluation using g-C 3 N 4 NT and composite TGNT as the photocatalyst.However, a large amount of methanol is detected in the reaction product solution using bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the previously published work 646566.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps of the rough mechanism are depicted as follows Eqs.

The incident photons of visible light produce excitons after being absorbed by the semiconductor g-C 3 N 4 , which are electron-hole pairs constrained by the Coulomb force 69, as described in Eq.

The blank experiments were operated under the same conditions in the dark or without CO 2 gas flow, which did not detect the reduction products.It indicates that both light and CO 2 gas are necessary for the photocatalytic reduction reaction.Besides, N 2 was introduced into the reactor instead of CO 2 for the comparative reaction, and then no carbon-based products were detected, and this is similar to previous reports 71,72.To further verify that the ethanol product originates from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , the 13 C isotope labeling experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 gas under identical experimental conditions.The mass spectrum of the GC-MS analysis of the product of 13 CO 2 as feed gas in the reaction is shown in Fig. 7(c).The fragment peaks of ethanol appear at m/z 31, 32, 43, and 45 instead of the peaks at m/z 29, 30, 31, 41, and 43 of the nonisotopic labeling experiment (Fig. S7).This confirms that the ethanol produced comes from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , rather than originate from carbon materials contamination.In the reaction experiment using bulk TPS as a photocatalyst, no reduction product was detected, indicating that it does not have the photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 .After 8 h of photocatalytic reaction, the ethanol yield of the prepared photocatalyst tends to be stable.The gas in the headspace of the reactor was analyzed, and no gas products of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were detected.Compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the activity of g-C 3 N 4 NT with nanotube structure is greatly enhanced, and the ethanol output is 113 mol/g.Then, the activity of composite TGNT loaded with TPS is further enhanced, and TGNT2 reached 196 mol/g.However, the ethanol yield of TGNT3 is improved less, which is due to the excessive loading of TPS that affects the photocatalytic process.As shown in Fig. 7(d), after 10 cycles of testing, the ethanol production of TGNT2 decreased by less than 5.The photocatalyst was characterized by XRD and FTIR after 10 cycles of running in Fig. S8.From the crystal plane diffraction peak and chemical bond absorption peak, it can be seen that its crystal structure and chemical structure have not changed.It indicates that this composite photocatalyst can be stably used repeatedly for a long time.The comparison of various recently reported g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts previously with the present work for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was listed in Table S2.It can be seen that the present work has prepared a composite photocatalyst with considerable catalytic activity by a universal and simple hydrothermal method. High-sensitivity steady-state PL spectra of as-prepared photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8(a).The emission peak of g-C 3 N 4 is displayed at 475 nm, but due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the TGNT composite structure, the emission peak shifts to 450 nm 73.The PL emission peak intensity of g-C 3 N 4 NT is significantly lower than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , and TGNT1 and TGNT2 are further lower.The low emission peak intensity indicates that the recombination rate of charge carriers is much lower, and the charge transfer in TGNT1 and TGNT2 is faster 74.The emission peak intensity of TGNT3 is extremely enhanced, indicating that loading a large amount of TPS will result in faster recombination of charge carriers.Although TGNT3 has better light absorption performance and larger surface area, the rapid recombination of carriers limits the photocatalytic reduction process and therefore leads to the lowest catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 8(b), the transient photocurrent response analyses were performed under a visible light lamp that turns on and off repeatedly to investigate the charge separation and transfer efficiency.The photocurrent response quickly after light on, and the current density of all photocatalysts can be ignored during light off.The rapid response of current to light irradiation indicates that the charge is quickly transferred in the photocatalyst 75.The corresponding reproducibility of the photocurrent is stable in several cycles of light irradiation, which leads to stable catalytic performance after multiple irradiations and repeated use.The photocurrent intensity of TGNT2 is twice that of g-C 3 N 4 NT, indicating that loading TPS greatly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 76,77.In order to further confirm the improvement of charge separation and transfer efficiency, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT2 were investigated, as shown in the Fig. 8(c).The Nyquist plot shows that the arc radius of TGNT2 is smaller than that of g-C 3 N 4 , which is attributed to the fact that the TPS composite material reduces the charge transfer resistance and increases the electronic conductivity.It results in more effective charge separation, and the excellent charge transfer capability is consistent with the above photocurrent response 78,79.As shown in Fig. 8(d), the structure of the nanotube and the load of the TPS affect the expansion of the band gap.The increase in the band gap of the TGNT can be attributed to the O defect effect due to the loading of silica 80.Photoelectrons and holes can be constrained at the defect site, and new intrinsic or extrinsic absorption bands can be generated in the band gap of SiO 2 , which optimizes the redox couple chosen as photocatalysis/photoelectrochemical applications 81.These factors lead to changes in the energy band structure, and a suitable energy band structure can thermodynamically realize the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction."}, {"llm generation": "bulk g-C 3 N 4", "source": "Compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the activity of g-C 3 N 4 NT with nanotube structure is greatly enhanced, and the ethanol output is 113 mol/g.", "context": "The crystal structure of the g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT are investigated by XRD, as presented in Fig. 1.The diffraction peak at 12.7 is assigned the (210) plane corresponding melon-type CN with an orthorhombic structure 37,38.The peak at 27.3 is attributed to the (002) plane corresponding to the characteristic inter-planar stacking reflection of conjugated aromatic systems 39.As shown in Fig. S1(a), the peaks at 10.5 , 18.3 , 21.9 , and 27.7 are attributed to the in-planar packing and inter-planar stacking of hydrothermal intermediate MCA 40.It shows that after the hydrothermal process, the crystal structure of melamine has been completely transformed into MCA.The broad diffraction peak of TPS at 23 degrees in Fig. S1(b) indicates that it is amorphous silica 41.

The compositions and chemical states of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 NT, and TGNT are further investigated by XPS.The survey spectra of C, N, O, Si elements are shown in Fig. 3(a).The high-resolution spectra for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p are fitted and shown in Fig. 3(b) (c) (d) (e).In C 1s spectra, the peaks at 288.3, 285.8, and 284.8 eV are attributed to the carbon atom in N-CN bonds of g-C 3 N 4 , - of the adventitious carbocycles, and C-C bonds in the adventitious reference carbon on the surface 47,48.In N 1s spectra, the peaks at 401.3, 399.6, and 398.7 eV can be ascribed to N in N-(C) 3 , N-H, and C-NC 49,50.The peak at 404.4 eV is attributed to the excitation of the heptazine rings 51.In O 1s spectra, the peak at 533.7 eV is due to the CO bond formed during the hydrothermal process.The peak at 532.3 eV is derived from the C-OH bond, so that TGNT can avoid the formation of -OH groups on the photocatalyst surface, and thus O defects are formed 52,53.The Si 2p binding energy of Si peak at 103.9 eV is the chemical bond of O-Si-O 54,55.As shown in Fig. S3 (d), the three samples of TGNT exhibit obvious Si energy peaks, which prove the combination between g-C 3 N 4 and TPS.5(a).The texture characteristics calculated from the above curve, including BET specific surface area (S ), external specific surface area (S ), total pore volume (V ), and average pore size (D ), are listed in Table 1.It can reveal that with the increase of TPS loading, the N 2 adsorption capacity and pore volume of TGNT increase, thus leading to more surface adsorption vacancies.There are hysteresis loops in the curves of the three samples of TGNT, indicating that there is a process of mesoporous capillary condensation.The mesoporous structure can quickly transfer ions and penetrate to the active site 56.The intermediate MCA has almost no adsorption effect, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1.The tube structure has an enhanced specific surface area after thermal polymerization, and then it is further increased after loading TPS.The extremely increased specific surface area can provide more reactive sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 57.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the trimodal porous distribution peaks of TPS are concentrated at 1.3, 1.7, and 2.4 nm.The samples of TGNT are also showed these three distribution peaks at the pore width above, and the average pore size decreased with the increase of TPS loading.It can also be seen that the TPS load increases by the same amount but the S has a huge difference because part of the trimodal porous is blocked during the 6(a).The characteristic absorption edge at around 450 nm is displayed in all samples.The curve of g-C 3 N 4 NT is relatively blue-shifted, which may originate from the quantum confinement effect caused by the size and thickness reduction compared to bulk g-C 3 N 4 58.For g-C 3 N 4 , the introduction of quantum confinement effect could provide competent driving forces for photocatalytic reactions 59.This indicates that the construction of the nanotube structure and the load of TPS can affect the electronic structure of C 3 N 4 , thereby expanding the band gap 60.The band gap is estimated by the Kubelka-Munk transformation method 61,62, and it is presented in Fig. 6(b).The VB XPS spectra is used to calculate VB potentials (E ), which is shown in Fig. 3(f).The tangents of the curve around 0 eV are calculated, and the energy value corresponding to the position of the intersection of the tangents is the VB potential.The E of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are 1.31, 1.26, and 1.40 eV related to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Considering the band gap estimated by the UV-vis DRS, the CB potentials (E ) of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are located at 1.54, 1.63 and 1.34 eV vs NHE, respectively.They are much more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (0.33 eV vs NHE) 63.It points out that loading TPS on g-C 3 N 4 NT can cause E to be more negative and enhance CO 2 reduction performance.The absorption peak of TGNT is stronger, and its absorption peak tail extends the absorption intensity at greater than 450 nm.Therefore, TGNT loaded of TPS has a stronger light trapping ability. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity was measured under visible light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.Only ethanol was detected when performing catalytic activity evaluation using g-C 3 N 4 NT and composite TGNT as the photocatalyst.However, a large amount of methanol is detected in the reaction product solution using bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the previously published work 646566.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps of the rough mechanism are depicted as follows Eqs. ( 1)-( 5) 67,68. The incident photons of visible light produce excitons after being absorbed by the semiconductor g-C 3 N 4 , which are electron-hole pairs constrained by the Coulomb force 69, as described in Eq. (1).In order for the catalytic process to occur, the charges need respectively migrate to the reaction sites on the photocatalyst surface and avoid recombination.There, electrons and holes respectively reduce the adsorbed electron acceptor CO 2 molecules and oxidize the electron donor H 2 O, which is described in Eqs. ( 2) and (3).The production of CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH through the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is shown in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex path for multi-electron transfer, and multiple products are obtained.From the thermodynamic perspective, six electrons or twelve electrons are required to convert one CO 2 molecule to form CH 3 OH or C 2 H 5 OH.The hollow tubular structure can not only provide effective light collection ability due to multiple light reflections or scattering in the internal space, but also can reduce the diffusion distance from the inside to the surface, thereby accelerating the separation of charge carriers 70.Therefore, TGNT can undertake the conversion process of ethanol with more charge transfer, while bulk g-C 3 N 4 can only produce methanol and a small amount of ethanol. The blank experiments were operated under the same conditions in the dark or without CO 2 gas flow, which did not detect the reduction products.It indicates that both light and CO 2 gas are necessary for the photocatalytic reduction reaction.Besides, N 2 was introduced into the reactor instead of CO 2 for the comparative reaction, and then no carbon-based products were detected, and this is similar to previous reports 71,72.To further verify that the ethanol product originates from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , the 13 C isotope labeling experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 gas under identical experimental conditions.The mass spectrum of the GC-MS analysis of the product of 13 CO 2 as feed gas in the reaction is shown in Fig. 7(c).The fragment peaks of ethanol appear at m/z 31, 32, 43, and 45 instead of the peaks at m/z 29, 30, 31, 41, and 43 of the nonisotopic labeling experiment (Fig. S7).This confirms that the ethanol produced comes from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , rather than originate from carbon materials contamination.In the reaction experiment using bulk TPS as a photocatalyst, no reduction product was detected, indicating that it does not have the photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 .After 8 h of photocatalytic reaction, the ethanol yield of the prepared photocatalyst tends to be stable.The gas in the headspace of the reactor was analyzed, and no gas products of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were detected.Compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the activity of g-C 3 N 4 NT with nanotube structure is greatly enhanced, and the ethanol output is 113 mol/g.Then, the activity of composite TGNT loaded with TPS is further enhanced, and TGNT2 reached 196 mol/g.However, the ethanol yield of TGNT3 is improved less, which is due to the excessive loading of TPS that affects the photocatalytic process.As shown in Fig. 7(d), after 10 cycles of testing, the ethanol production of TGNT2 decreased by less than 5.The photocatalyst was characterized by XRD and FTIR after 10 cycles of running in Fig. S8.From the crystal plane diffraction peak and chemical bond absorption peak, it can be seen that its crystal structure and chemical structure have not changed.It indicates that this composite photocatalyst can be stably used repeatedly for a long time.The comparison of various recently reported g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts previously with the present work for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was listed in Table S2.It can be seen that the present work has prepared a composite photocatalyst with considerable catalytic activity by a universal and simple hydrothermal method. High-sensitivity steady-state PL spectra of as-prepared photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8(a).The emission peak of g-C 3 N 4 is displayed at 475 nm, but due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the TGNT composite structure, the emission peak shifts to 450 nm 73.The PL emission peak intensity of g-C 3 N 4 NT is significantly lower than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , and TGNT1 and TGNT2 are further lower.The low emission peak intensity indicates that the recombination rate of charge carriers is much lower, and the charge transfer in TGNT1 and TGNT2 is faster 74.The emission peak intensity of TGNT3 is extremely enhanced, indicating that loading a large amount of TPS will result in faster recombination of charge carriers.Although TGNT3 has better light absorption performance and larger surface area, the rapid recombination of carriers limits the photocatalytic reduction process and therefore leads to the lowest catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 8(b), the transient photocurrent response analyses were performed under a visible light lamp that turns on and off repeatedly to investigate the charge separation and transfer efficiency.The photocurrent response quickly after light on, and the current density of all photocatalysts can be ignored during light off.The rapid response of current to light irradiation indicates that the charge is quickly transferred in the photocatalyst 75.The corresponding reproducibility of the photocurrent is stable in several cycles of light irradiation, which leads to stable catalytic performance after multiple irradiations and repeated use.The photocurrent intensity of TGNT2 is twice that of g-C 3 N 4 NT, indicating that loading TPS greatly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 76,77.In order to further confirm the improvement of charge separation and transfer efficiency, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT2 were investigated, as shown in the Fig. 8(c).The Nyquist plot shows that the arc radius of TGNT2 is smaller than that of g-C 3 N 4 , which is attributed to the fact that the TPS composite material reduces the charge transfer resistance and increases the electronic conductivity.It results in more effective charge separation, and the excellent charge transfer capability is consistent with the above photocurrent response 78,79.As shown in Fig. 8(d), the structure of the nanotube and the load of the TPS affect the expansion of the band gap.The increase in the band gap of the TGNT can be attributed to the O defect effect due to the loading of silica 80.Photoelectrons and holes can be constrained at the defect site, and new intrinsic or extrinsic absorption bands can be generated in the band gap of SiO 2 , which optimizes the redox couple chosen as photocatalysis/photoelectrochemical applications 81.These factors lead to changes in the energy band structure, and a suitable energy band structure can thermodynamically realize the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4", "source": "The emission peak of g-C 3 N 4 is displayed at 475 nm, but due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the TGNT composite structure, the emission peak shifts to 450 nm 73.", "context": "The crystal structure of the g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT are investigated by XRD, as presented in Fig. 1.The diffraction peak at 12.7 is assigned the (210) plane corresponding melon-type CN with an orthorhombic structure 37,38.The peak at 27.3 is attributed to the (002) plane corresponding to the characteristic inter-planar stacking reflection of conjugated aromatic systems 39.As shown in Fig. S1(a), the peaks at 10.5 , 18.3 , 21.9 , and 27.7 are attributed to the in-planar packing and inter-planar stacking of hydrothermal intermediate MCA 40.It shows that after the hydrothermal process, the crystal structure of melamine has been completely transformed into MCA.The broad diffraction peak of TPS at 23 degrees in Fig. S1(b) indicates that it is amorphous silica 41. The chemical structure of the samples is surveyed by FTIR, as shown in Fig. 2. The peaks at 1238, 1321, 1410, 1572, and 1637 cm -1 are attributed to the typical stretching modes of C-N heterocycles from g-C 3 N 4 NT 42.The peak at 812 cm -1 is assigned to the vibration mode of the s-triazine units 43.The broad peak around 3200 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrational modes of primary amines -NH 2 and secondary amines NH 44.In the spectra of TPS, the peak at 1085 cm -1 is due to the bond bending vibrations of Si-O-Si.The peak at 958 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrations of Si-OH 45,46.Obviously, the characteristic peaks of TGNT show that the composite photocatalysts are provided with both chemical structures of g-C 3 N 4 and TPS. The compositions and chemical states of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 NT, and TGNT are further investigated by XPS.The survey spectra of C, N, O, Si elements are shown in Fig. 3(a).The high-resolution spectra for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p are fitted and shown in Fig. 3(b) (c) (d) (e).In C 1s spectra, the peaks at 288.3, 285.8, and 284.8 eV are attributed to the carbon atom in N-CN bonds of g-C 3 N 4 , - of the adventitious carbocycles, and C-C bonds in the adventitious reference carbon on the surface 47,48.In N 1s spectra, the peaks at 401.3, 399.6, and 398.7 eV can be ascribed to N in N-(C) 3 , N-H, and C-NC 49,50.The peak at 404.4 eV is attributed to the excitation of the heptazine rings 51.In O 1s spectra, the peak at 533.7 eV is due to the CO bond formed during the hydrothermal process.The peak at 532.3 eV is derived from the C-OH bond, so that TGNT can avoid the formation of -OH groups on the photocatalyst surface, and thus O defects are formed 52,53.The Si 2p binding energy of Si peak at 103.9 eV is the chemical bond of O-Si-O 54,55.As shown in Fig. S3 (d), the three samples of TGNT exhibit obvious Si energy peaks, which prove the combination between g-C 3 N 4 and TPS.5(a).The texture characteristics calculated from the above curve, including BET specific surface area (S ), external specific surface area (S ), total pore volume (V ), and average pore size (D ), are listed in Table 1.It can reveal that with the increase of TPS loading, the N 2 adsorption capacity and pore volume of TGNT increase, thus leading to more surface adsorption vacancies.There are hysteresis loops in the curves of the three samples of TGNT, indicating that there is a process of mesoporous capillary condensation.The mesoporous structure can quickly transfer ions and penetrate to the active site 56.The intermediate MCA has almost no adsorption effect, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1.The tube structure has an enhanced specific surface area after thermal polymerization, and then it is further increased after loading TPS.The extremely increased specific surface area can provide more reactive sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 57.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the trimodal porous distribution peaks of TPS are concentrated at 1.3, 1.7, and 2.4 nm.The samples of TGNT are also showed these three distribution peaks at the pore width above, and the average pore size decreased with the increase of TPS loading.It can also be seen that the TPS load increases by the same amount but the S has a huge difference because part of the trimodal porous is blocked during the 6(a).The characteristic absorption edge at around 450 nm is displayed in all samples.The curve of g-C 3 N 4 NT is relatively blue-shifted, which may originate from the quantum confinement effect caused by the size and thickness reduction compared to bulk g-C 3 N 4 58.For g-C 3 N 4 , the introduction of quantum confinement effect could provide competent driving forces for photocatalytic reactions 59.This indicates that the construction of the nanotube structure and the load of TPS can affect the electronic structure of C 3 N 4 , thereby expanding the band gap 60.The band gap is estimated by the Kubelka-Munk transformation method 61,62, and it is presented in Fig. 6(b).The VB XPS spectra is used to calculate VB potentials (E ), which is shown in Fig. 3(f).The tangents of the curve around 0 eV are calculated, and the energy value corresponding to the position of the intersection of the tangents is the VB potential.The E of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are 1.31, 1.26, and 1.40 eV related to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Considering the band gap estimated by the UV-vis DRS, the CB potentials (E ) of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are located at 1.54, 1.63 and 1.34 eV vs NHE, respectively.They are much more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (0.33 eV vs NHE) 63.It points out that loading TPS on g-C 3 N 4 NT can cause E to be more negative and enhance CO 2 reduction performance.The absorption peak of TGNT is stronger, and its absorption peak tail extends the absorption intensity at greater than 450 nm.Therefore, TGNT loaded of TPS has a stronger light trapping ability. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity was measured under visible light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.Only ethanol was detected when performing catalytic activity evaluation using g-C 3 N 4 NT and composite TGNT as the photocatalyst.However, a large amount of methanol is detected in the reaction product solution using bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the previously published work 646566.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps of the rough mechanism are depicted as follows Eqs. ( 1)-( 5) 67,68. The incident photons of visible light produce excitons after being absorbed by the semiconductor g-C 3 N 4 , which are electron-hole pairs constrained by the Coulomb force 69, as described in Eq. (1).In order for the catalytic process to occur, the charges need respectively migrate to the reaction sites on the photocatalyst surface and avoid recombination.There, electrons and holes respectively reduce the adsorbed electron acceptor CO 2 molecules and oxidize the electron donor H 2 O, which is described in Eqs. ( 2) and (3).The production of CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH through the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is shown in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex path for multi-electron transfer, and multiple products are obtained.From the thermodynamic perspective, six electrons or twelve electrons are required to convert one CO 2 molecule to form CH 3 OH or C 2 H 5 OH.The hollow tubular structure can not only provide effective light collection ability due to multiple light reflections or scattering in the internal space, but also can reduce the diffusion distance from the inside to the surface, thereby accelerating the separation of charge carriers 70.Therefore, TGNT can undertake the conversion process of ethanol with more charge transfer, while bulk g-C 3 N 4 can only produce methanol and a small amount of ethanol. The blank experiments were operated under the same conditions in the dark or without CO 2 gas flow, which did not detect the reduction products.It indicates that both light and CO 2 gas are necessary for the photocatalytic reduction reaction.Besides, N 2 was introduced into the reactor instead of CO 2 for the comparative reaction, and then no carbon-based products were detected, and this is similar to previous reports 71,72.To further verify that the ethanol product originates from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , the 13 C isotope labeling experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 gas under identical experimental conditions.The mass spectrum of the GC-MS analysis of the product of 13 CO 2 as feed gas in the reaction is shown in Fig. 7(c).The fragment peaks of ethanol appear at m/z 31, 32, 43, and 45 instead of the peaks at m/z 29, 30, 31, 41, and 43 of the nonisotopic labeling experiment (Fig. S7).This confirms that the ethanol produced comes from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , rather than originate from carbon materials contamination.In the reaction experiment using bulk TPS as a photocatalyst, no reduction product was detected, indicating that it does not have the photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 .After 8 h of photocatalytic reaction, the ethanol yield of the prepared photocatalyst tends to be stable.The gas in the headspace of the reactor was analyzed, and no gas products of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were detected.Compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the activity of g-C 3 N 4 NT with nanotube structure is greatly enhanced, and the ethanol output is 113 mol/g.Then, the activity of composite TGNT loaded with TPS is further enhanced, and TGNT2 reached 196 mol/g.However, the ethanol yield of TGNT3 is improved less, which is due to the excessive loading of TPS that affects the photocatalytic process.As shown in Fig. 7(d), after 10 cycles of testing, the ethanol production of TGNT2 decreased by less than 5.The photocatalyst was characterized by XRD and FTIR after 10 cycles of running in Fig. S8.From the crystal plane diffraction peak and chemical bond absorption peak, it can be seen that its crystal structure and chemical structure have not changed.It indicates that this composite photocatalyst can be stably used repeatedly for a long time.The comparison of various recently reported g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts previously with the present work for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was listed in Table S2.It can be seen that the present work has prepared a composite photocatalyst with considerable catalytic activity by a universal and simple hydrothermal method. High-sensitivity steady-state PL spectra of as-prepared photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8(a).The emission peak of g-C 3 N 4 is displayed at 475 nm, but due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the TGNT composite structure, the emission peak shifts to 450 nm 73.The PL emission peak intensity of g-C 3 N 4 NT is significantly lower than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , and TGNT1 and TGNT2 are further lower.The low emission peak intensity indicates that the recombination rate of charge carriers is much lower, and the charge transfer in TGNT1 and TGNT2 is faster 74.The emission peak intensity of TGNT3 is extremely enhanced, indicating that loading a large amount of TPS will result in faster recombination of charge carriers.Although TGNT3 has better light absorption performance and larger surface area, the rapid recombination of carriers limits the photocatalytic reduction process and therefore leads to the lowest catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 8(b), the transient photocurrent response analyses were performed under a visible light lamp that turns on and off repeatedly to investigate the charge separation and transfer efficiency.The photocurrent response quickly after light on, and the current density of all photocatalysts can be ignored during light off.The rapid response of current to light irradiation indicates that the charge is quickly transferred in the photocatalyst 75.The corresponding reproducibility of the photocurrent is stable in several cycles of light irradiation, which leads to stable catalytic performance after multiple irradiations and repeated use.The photocurrent intensity of TGNT2 is twice that of g-C 3 N 4 NT, indicating that loading TPS greatly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 76,77.In order to further confirm the improvement of charge separation and transfer efficiency, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT2 were investigated, as shown in the Fig. 8(c).The Nyquist plot shows that the arc radius of TGNT2 is smaller than that of g-C 3 N 4 , which is attributed to the fact that the TPS composite material reduces the charge transfer resistance and increases the electronic conductivity.It results in more effective charge separation, and the excellent charge transfer capability is consistent with the above photocurrent response 78,79.As shown in Fig. 8(d), the structure of the nanotube and the load of the TPS affect the expansion of the band gap.The increase in the band gap of the TGNT can be attributed to the O defect effect due to the loading of silica 80.Photoelectrons and holes can be constrained at the defect site, and new intrinsic or extrinsic absorption bands can be generated in the band gap of SiO 2 , which optimizes the redox couple chosen as photocatalysis/photoelectrochemical applications 81.These factors lead to changes in the energy band structure, and a suitable energy band structure can thermodynamically realize the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction."}, {"llm generation": "TGNT", "source": "The emission peak of g-C 3 N 4 is displayed at 475 nm, but due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the TGNT composite structure, the emission peak shifts to 450 nm 73.", "context": "The crystal structure of the g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT are investigated by XRD, as presented in Fig. 1.The diffraction peak at 12.7 is assigned the (210) plane corresponding melon-type CN with an orthorhombic structure 37,38.The peak at 27.3 is attributed to the (002) plane corresponding to the characteristic inter-planar stacking reflection of conjugated aromatic systems 39.As shown in Fig. S1(a), the peaks at 10.5 , 18.3 , 21.9 , and 27.7 are attributed to the in-planar packing and inter-planar stacking of hydrothermal intermediate MCA 40.It shows that after the hydrothermal process, the crystal structure of melamine has been completely transformed into MCA.The broad diffraction peak of TPS at 23 degrees in Fig. S1(b) indicates that it is amorphous silica 41.

The compositions and chemical states of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 NT, and TGNT are further investigated by XPS.The survey spectra of C, N, O, Si elements are shown in Fig. 3(a).The high-resolution spectra for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p are fitted and shown in Fig. 3(b) (c) (d) (e).In C 1s spectra, the peaks at 288.3, 285.8, and 284.8 eV are attributed to the carbon atom in N-CN bonds of g-C 3 N 4 , - of the adventitious carbocycles, and C-C bonds in the adventitious reference carbon on the surface 47,48.In N 1s spectra, the peaks at 401.3, 399.6, and 398.7 eV can be ascribed to N in N-(C) 3 , N-H, and C-NC 49,50.The peak at 404.4 eV is attributed to the excitation of the heptazine rings 51.In O 1s spectra, the peak at 533.7 eV is due to the CO bond formed during the hydrothermal process.The peak at 532.3 eV is derived from the C-OH bond, so that TGNT can avoid the formation of -OH groups on the photocatalyst surface, and thus O defects are formed 52,53.The Si 2p binding energy of Si peak at 103.9 eV is the chemical bond of O-Si-O 54,55.As shown in Fig. S3 (d), the three samples of TGNT exhibit obvious Si energy peaks, which prove the combination between g-C 3 N 4 and TPS.5(a).The texture characteristics calculated from the above curve, including BET specific surface area (S ), external specific surface area (S ), total pore volume (V ), and average pore size (D ), are listed in Table 1.It can reveal that with the increase of TPS loading, the N 2 adsorption capacity and pore volume of TGNT increase, thus leading to more surface adsorption vacancies.There are hysteresis loops in the curves of the three samples of TGNT, indicating that there is a process of mesoporous capillary condensation.The mesoporous structure can quickly transfer ions and penetrate to the active site 56.The intermediate MCA has almost no adsorption effect, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1.The tube structure has an enhanced specific surface area after thermal polymerization, and then it is further increased after loading TPS.The extremely increased specific surface area can provide more reactive sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 57.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the trimodal porous distribution peaks of TPS are concentrated at 1.3, 1.7, and 2.4 nm.The samples of TGNT are also showed these three distribution peaks at the pore width above, and the average pore size decreased with the increase of TPS loading.It can also be seen that the TPS load increases by the same amount but the S has a huge difference because part of the trimodal porous is blocked during the 6(a).The characteristic absorption edge at around 450 nm is displayed in all samples.The curve of g-C 3 N 4 NT is relatively blue-shifted, which may originate from the quantum confinement effect caused by the size and thickness reduction compared to bulk g-C 3 N 4 58.For g-C 3 N 4 , the introduction of quantum confinement effect could provide competent driving forces for photocatalytic reactions 59.This indicates that the construction of the nanotube structure and the load of TPS can affect the electronic structure of C 3 N 4 , thereby expanding the band gap 60.The band gap is estimated by the Kubelka-Munk transformation method 61,62, and it is presented in Fig. 6(b).The VB XPS spectra is used to calculate VB potentials (E ), which is shown in Fig. 3(f).The tangents of the curve around 0 eV are calculated, and the energy value corresponding to the position of the intersection of the tangents is the VB potential.The E of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are 1.31, 1.26, and 1.40 eV related to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Considering the band gap estimated by the UV-vis DRS, the CB potentials (E ) of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are located at 1.54, 1.63 and 1.34 eV vs NHE, respectively.They are much more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (0.33 eV vs NHE) 63.It points out that loading TPS on g-C 3 N 4 NT can cause E to be more negative and enhance CO 2 reduction performance.The absorption peak of TGNT is stronger, and its absorption peak tail extends the absorption intensity at greater than 450 nm.Therefore, TGNT loaded of TPS has a stronger light trapping ability. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity was measured under visible light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.Only ethanol was detected when performing catalytic activity evaluation using g-C 3 N 4 NT and composite TGNT as the photocatalyst.However, a large amount of methanol is detected in the reaction product solution using bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the previously published work 646566.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps of the rough mechanism are depicted as follows Eqs. ( 1)-( 5) 67,68. The incident photons of visible light produce excitons after being absorbed by the semiconductor g-C 3 N 4 , which are electron-hole pairs constrained by the Coulomb force 69, as described in Eq. (1).In order for the catalytic process to occur, the charges need respectively migrate to the reaction sites on the photocatalyst surface and avoid recombination.There, electrons and holes respectively reduce the adsorbed electron acceptor CO 2 molecules and oxidize the electron donor H 2 O, which is described in Eqs. ( 2) and (3).The production of CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH through the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is shown in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex path for multi-electron transfer, and multiple products are obtained.From the thermodynamic perspective, six electrons or twelve electrons are required to convert one CO 2 molecule to form CH 3 OH or C 2 H 5 OH.The hollow tubular structure can not only provide effective light collection ability due to multiple light reflections or scattering in the internal space, but also can reduce the diffusion distance from the inside to the surface, thereby accelerating the separation of charge carriers 70.Therefore, TGNT can undertake the conversion process of ethanol with more charge transfer, while bulk g-C 3 N 4 can only produce methanol and a small amount of ethanol. The blank experiments were operated under the same conditions in the dark or without CO 2 gas flow, which did not detect the reduction products.It indicates that both light and CO 2 gas are necessary for the photocatalytic reduction reaction.Besides, N 2 was introduced into the reactor instead of CO 2 for the comparative reaction, and then no carbon-based products were detected, and this is similar to previous reports 71,72.To further verify that the ethanol product originates from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , the 13 C isotope labeling experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 gas under identical experimental conditions.The mass spectrum of the GC-MS analysis of the product of 13 CO 2 as feed gas in the reaction is shown in Fig. 7(c).The fragment peaks of ethanol appear at m/z 31, 32, 43, and 45 instead of the peaks at m/z 29, 30, 31, 41, and 43 of the nonisotopic labeling experiment (Fig. S7).This confirms that the ethanol produced comes from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , rather than originate from carbon materials contamination.In the reaction experiment using bulk TPS as a photocatalyst, no reduction product was detected, indicating that it does not have the photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 .After 8 h of photocatalytic reaction, the ethanol yield of the prepared photocatalyst tends to be stable.The gas in the headspace of the reactor was analyzed, and no gas products of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were detected.Compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the activity of g-C 3 N 4 NT with nanotube structure is greatly enhanced, and the ethanol output is 113 mol/g.Then, the activity of composite TGNT loaded with TPS is further enhanced, and TGNT2 reached 196 mol/g.However, the ethanol yield of TGNT3 is improved less, which is due to the excessive loading of TPS that affects the photocatalytic process.As shown in Fig. 7(d), after 10 cycles of testing, the ethanol production of TGNT2 decreased by less than 5.The photocatalyst was characterized by XRD and FTIR after 10 cycles of running in Fig. S8.From the crystal plane diffraction peak and chemical bond absorption peak, it can be seen that its crystal structure and chemical structure have not changed.It indicates that this composite photocatalyst can be stably used repeatedly for a long time.The comparison of various recently reported g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts previously with the present work for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was listed in Table S2.It can be seen that the present work has prepared a composite photocatalyst with considerable catalytic activity by a universal and simple hydrothermal method. High-sensitivity steady-state PL spectra of as-prepared photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8(a).The emission peak of g-C 3 N 4 is displayed at 475 nm, but due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the TGNT composite structure, the emission peak shifts to 450 nm 73.The PL emission peak intensity of g-C 3 N 4 NT is significantly lower than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , and TGNT1 and TGNT2 are further lower.The low emission peak intensity indicates that the recombination rate of charge carriers is much lower, and the charge transfer in TGNT1 and TGNT2 is faster 74.The emission peak intensity of TGNT3 is extremely enhanced, indicating that loading a large amount of TPS will result in faster recombination of charge carriers.Although TGNT3 has better light absorption performance and larger surface area, the rapid recombination of carriers limits the photocatalytic reduction process and therefore leads to the lowest catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 8(b), the transient photocurrent response analyses were performed under a visible light lamp that turns on and off repeatedly to investigate the charge separation and transfer efficiency.The photocurrent response quickly after light on, and the current density of all photocatalysts can be ignored during light off.The rapid response of current to light irradiation indicates that the charge is quickly transferred in the photocatalyst 75.The corresponding reproducibility of the photocurrent is stable in several cycles of light irradiation, which leads to stable catalytic performance after multiple irradiations and repeated use.The photocurrent intensity of TGNT2 is twice that of g-C 3 N 4 NT, indicating that loading TPS greatly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 76,77.In order to further confirm the improvement of charge separation and transfer efficiency, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT2 were investigated, as shown in the Fig. 8(c).The Nyquist plot shows that the arc radius of TGNT2 is smaller than that of g-C 3 N 4 , which is attributed to the fact that the TPS composite material reduces the charge transfer resistance and increases the electronic conductivity.It results in more effective charge separation, and the excellent charge transfer capability is consistent with the above photocurrent response 78,79.As shown in Fig. 8(d), the structure of the nanotube and the load of the TPS affect the expansion of the band gap.The increase in the band gap of the TGNT can be attributed to the O defect effect due to the loading of silica 80.Photoelectrons and holes can be constrained at the defect site, and new intrinsic or extrinsic absorption bands can be generated in the band gap of SiO 2 , which optimizes the redox couple chosen as photocatalysis/photoelectrochemical applications 81.These factors lead to changes in the energy band structure, and a suitable energy band structure can thermodynamically realize the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4 NT", "source": "The PL emission peak intensity of g-C 3 N 4 NT is significantly lower than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , and TGNT1 and TGNT2 are further lower.", "context": "The crystal structure of the g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT are investigated by XRD, as presented in Fig. 1.The diffraction peak at 12.7 is assigned the (210) plane corresponding melon-type CN with an orthorhombic structure 37,38.The peak at 27.3 is attributed to the (002) plane corresponding to the characteristic inter-planar stacking reflection of conjugated aromatic systems 39.As shown in Fig. S1(a), the peaks at 10.5 , 18.3 , 21.9 , and 27.7 are attributed to the in-planar packing and inter-planar stacking of hydrothermal intermediate MCA 40.It shows that after the hydrothermal process, the crystal structure of melamine has been completely transformed into MCA.The broad diffraction peak of TPS at 23 degrees in Fig. S1(b) indicates that it is amorphous silica 41. The chemical structure of the samples is surveyed by FTIR, as shown in Fig. 2. The peaks at 1238, 1321, 1410, 1572, and 1637 cm -1 are attributed to the typical stretching modes of C-N heterocycles from g-C 3 N 4 NT 42.The peak at 812 cm -1 is assigned to the vibration mode of the s-triazine units 43.The broad peak around 3200 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrational modes of primary amines -NH 2 and secondary amines NH 44.In the spectra of TPS, the peak at 1085 cm -1 is due to the bond bending vibrations of Si-O-Si.The peak at 958 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrations of Si-OH 45,46.Obviously, the characteristic peaks of TGNT show that the composite photocatalysts are provided with both chemical structures of g-C 3 N 4 and TPS. The compositions and chemical states of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 NT, and TGNT are further investigated by XPS.The survey spectra of C, N, O, Si elements are shown in Fig. 3(a).The high-resolution spectra for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p are fitted and shown in Fig. 3(b) (c) (d) (e).In C 1s spectra, the peaks at 288.3, 285.8, and 284.8 eV are attributed to the carbon atom in N-CN bonds of g-C 3 N 4 , - of the adventitious carbocycles, and C-C bonds in the adventitious reference carbon on the surface 47,48.In N 1s spectra, the peaks at 401.3, 399.6, and 398.7 eV can be ascribed to N in N-(C) 3 , N-H, and C-NC 49,50.The peak at 404.4 eV is attributed to the excitation of the heptazine rings 51.In O 1s spectra, the peak at 533.7 eV is due to the CO bond formed during the hydrothermal process.The peak at 532.3 eV is derived from the C-OH bond, so that TGNT can avoid the formation of -OH groups on the photocatalyst surface, and thus O defects are formed 52,53.The Si 2p binding energy of Si peak at 103.9 eV is the chemical bond of O-Si-O 54,55.As shown in Fig. S3 (d), the three samples of TGNT exhibit obvious Si energy peaks, which prove the combination between g-C 3 N 4 and TPS.5(a).The texture characteristics calculated from the above curve, including BET specific surface area (S ), external specific surface area (S ), total pore volume (V ), and average pore size (D ), are listed in Table 1.It can reveal that with the increase of TPS loading, the N 2 adsorption capacity and pore volume of TGNT increase, thus leading to more surface adsorption vacancies.There are hysteresis loops in the curves of the three samples of TGNT, indicating that there is a process of mesoporous capillary condensation.The mesoporous structure can quickly transfer ions and penetrate to the active site 56.The intermediate MCA has almost no adsorption effect, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1.The tube structure has an enhanced specific surface area after thermal polymerization, and then it is further increased after loading TPS.The extremely increased specific surface area can provide more reactive sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 57.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the trimodal porous distribution peaks of TPS are concentrated at 1.3, 1.7, and 2.4 nm.The samples of TGNT are also showed these three distribution peaks at the pore width above, and the average pore size decreased with the increase of TPS loading.It can also be seen that the TPS load increases by the same amount but the S has a huge difference because part of the trimodal porous is blocked during the 6(a).The characteristic absorption edge at around 450 nm is displayed in all samples.The curve of g-C 3 N 4 NT is relatively blue-shifted, which may originate from the quantum confinement effect caused by the size and thickness reduction compared to bulk g-C 3 N 4 58.For g-C 3 N 4 , the introduction of quantum confinement effect could provide competent driving forces for photocatalytic reactions 59.This indicates that the construction of the nanotube structure and the load of TPS can affect the electronic structure of C 3 N 4 , thereby expanding the band gap 60.The band gap is estimated by the Kubelka-Munk transformation method 61,62, and it is presented in Fig. 6(b).The VB XPS spectra is used to calculate VB potentials (E ), which is shown in Fig. 3(f).The tangents of the curve around 0 eV are calculated, and the energy value corresponding to the position of the intersection of the tangents is the VB potential.The E of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are 1.31, 1.26, and 1.40 eV related to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Considering the band gap estimated by the UV-vis DRS, the CB potentials (E ) of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are located at 1.54, 1.63 and 1.34 eV vs NHE, respectively.They are much more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (0.33 eV vs NHE) 63.It points out that loading TPS on g-C 3 N 4 NT can cause E to be more negative and enhance CO 2 reduction performance.The absorption peak of TGNT is stronger, and its absorption peak tail extends the absorption intensity at greater than 450 nm.Therefore, TGNT loaded of TPS has a stronger light trapping ability. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity was measured under visible light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.Only ethanol was detected when performing catalytic activity evaluation using g-C 3 N 4 NT and composite TGNT as the photocatalyst.However, a large amount of methanol is detected in the reaction product solution using bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the previously published work 646566.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps of the rough mechanism are depicted as follows Eqs.

The compositions and chemical states of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 NT, and TGNT are further investigated by XPS.The survey spectra of C, N, O, Si elements are shown in Fig. 3(a).The high-resolution spectra for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p are fitted and shown in Fig. 3(b) (c) (d) (e).In C 1s spectra, the peaks at 288.3, 285.8, and 284.8 eV are attributed to the carbon atom in N-CN bonds of g-C 3 N 4 , - of the adventitious carbocycles, and C-C bonds in the adventitious reference carbon on the surface 47,48.In N 1s spectra, the peaks at 401.3, 399.6, and 398.7 eV can be ascribed to N in N-(C) 3 , N-H, and C-NC 49,50.The peak at 404.4 eV is attributed to the excitation of the heptazine rings 51.In O 1s spectra, the peak at 533.7 eV is due to the CO bond formed during the hydrothermal process.The peak at 532.3 eV is derived from the C-OH bond, so that TGNT can avoid the formation of -OH groups on the photocatalyst surface, and thus O defects are formed 52,53.The Si 2p binding energy of Si peak at 103.9 eV is the chemical bond of O-Si-O 54,55.As shown in Fig. S3 (d), the three samples of TGNT exhibit obvious Si energy peaks, which prove the combination between g-C 3 N 4 and TPS.5(a).The texture characteristics calculated from the above curve, including BET specific surface area (S ), external specific surface area (S ), total pore volume (V ), and average pore size (D ), are listed in Table 1.It can reveal that with the increase of TPS loading, the N 2 adsorption capacity and pore volume of TGNT increase, thus leading to more surface adsorption vacancies.There are hysteresis loops in the curves of the three samples of TGNT, indicating that there is a process of mesoporous capillary condensation.The mesoporous structure can quickly transfer ions and penetrate to the active site 56.The intermediate MCA has almost no adsorption effect, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1.The tube structure has an enhanced specific surface area after thermal polymerization, and then it is further increased after loading TPS.The extremely increased specific surface area can provide more reactive sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 57.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the trimodal porous distribution peaks of TPS are concentrated at 1.3, 1.7, and 2.4 nm.The samples of TGNT are also showed these three distribution peaks at the pore width above, and the average pore size decreased with the increase of TPS loading.It can also be seen that the TPS load increases by the same amount but the S has a huge difference because part of the trimodal porous is blocked during the 6(a).The characteristic absorption edge at around 450 nm is displayed in all samples.The curve of g-C 3 N 4 NT is relatively blue-shifted, which may originate from the quantum confinement effect caused by the size and thickness reduction compared to bulk g-C 3 N 4 58.For g-C 3 N 4 , the introduction of quantum confinement effect could provide competent driving forces for photocatalytic reactions 59.This indicates that the construction of the nanotube structure and the load of TPS can affect the electronic structure of C 3 N 4 , thereby expanding the band gap 60.The band gap is estimated by the Kubelka-Munk transformation method 61,62, and it is presented in Fig. 6(b).The VB XPS spectra is used to calculate VB potentials (E ), which is shown in Fig. 3(f).The tangents of the curve around 0 eV are calculated, and the energy value corresponding to the position of the intersection of the tangents is the VB potential.The E of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are 1.31, 1.26, and 1.40 eV related to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Considering the band gap estimated by the UV-vis DRS, the CB potentials (E ) of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are located at 1.54, 1.63 and 1.34 eV vs NHE, respectively.They are much more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (0.33 eV vs NHE) 63.It points out that loading TPS on g-C 3 N 4 NT can cause E to be more negative and enhance CO 2 reduction performance.The absorption peak of TGNT is stronger, and its absorption peak tail extends the absorption intensity at greater than 450 nm.Therefore, TGNT loaded of TPS has a stronger light trapping ability. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity was measured under visible light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.Only ethanol was detected when performing catalytic activity evaluation using g-C 3 N 4 NT and composite TGNT as the photocatalyst.However, a large amount of methanol is detected in the reaction product solution using bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the previously published work 646566.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps of the rough mechanism are depicted as follows Eqs. ( 1)-( 5) 67,68. The incident photons of visible light produce excitons after being absorbed by the semiconductor g-C 3 N 4 , which are electron-hole pairs constrained by the Coulomb force 69, as described in Eq. (1).In order for the catalytic process to occur, the charges need respectively migrate to the reaction sites on the photocatalyst surface and avoid recombination.There, electrons and holes respectively reduce the adsorbed electron acceptor CO 2 molecules and oxidize the electron donor H 2 O, which is described in Eqs. ( 2) and (3).The production of CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH through the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is shown in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex path for multi-electron transfer, and multiple products are obtained.From the thermodynamic perspective, six electrons or twelve electrons are required to convert one CO 2 molecule to form CH 3 OH or C 2 H 5 OH.The hollow tubular structure can not only provide effective light collection ability due to multiple light reflections or scattering in the internal space, but also can reduce the diffusion distance from the inside to the surface, thereby accelerating the separation of charge carriers 70.Therefore, TGNT can undertake the conversion process of ethanol with more charge transfer, while bulk g-C 3 N 4 can only produce methanol and a small amount of ethanol. The blank experiments were operated under the same conditions in the dark or without CO 2 gas flow, which did not detect the reduction products.It indicates that both light and CO 2 gas are necessary for the photocatalytic reduction reaction.Besides, N 2 was introduced into the reactor instead of CO 2 for the comparative reaction, and then no carbon-based products were detected, and this is similar to previous reports 71,72.To further verify that the ethanol product originates from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , the 13 C isotope labeling experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 gas under identical experimental conditions.The mass spectrum of the GC-MS analysis of the product of 13 CO 2 as feed gas in the reaction is shown in Fig. 7(c).The fragment peaks of ethanol appear at m/z 31, 32, 43, and 45 instead of the peaks at m/z 29, 30, 31, 41, and 43 of the nonisotopic labeling experiment (Fig. S7).This confirms that the ethanol produced comes from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , rather than originate from carbon materials contamination.In the reaction experiment using bulk TPS as a photocatalyst, no reduction product was detected, indicating that it does not have the photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 .After 8 h of photocatalytic reaction, the ethanol yield of the prepared photocatalyst tends to be stable.The gas in the headspace of the reactor was analyzed, and no gas products of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were detected.Compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the activity of g-C 3 N 4 NT with nanotube structure is greatly enhanced, and the ethanol output is 113 mol/g.Then, the activity of composite TGNT loaded with TPS is further enhanced, and TGNT2 reached 196 mol/g.However, the ethanol yield of TGNT3 is improved less, which is due to the excessive loading of TPS that affects the photocatalytic process.As shown in Fig. 7(d), after 10 cycles of testing, the ethanol production of TGNT2 decreased by less than 5.The photocatalyst was characterized by XRD and FTIR after 10 cycles of running in Fig. S8.From the crystal plane diffraction peak and chemical bond absorption peak, it can be seen that its crystal structure and chemical structure have not changed.It indicates that this composite photocatalyst can be stably used repeatedly for a long time.The comparison of various recently reported g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts previously with the present work for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was listed in Table S2.It can be seen that the present work has prepared a composite photocatalyst with considerable catalytic activity by a universal and simple hydrothermal method. High-sensitivity steady-state PL spectra of as-prepared photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8(a).The emission peak of g-C 3 N 4 is displayed at 475 nm, but due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the TGNT composite structure, the emission peak shifts to 450 nm 73.The PL emission peak intensity of g-C 3 N 4 NT is significantly lower than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , and TGNT1 and TGNT2 are further lower.The low emission peak intensity indicates that the recombination rate of charge carriers is much lower, and the charge transfer in TGNT1 and TGNT2 is faster 74.The emission peak intensity of TGNT3 is extremely enhanced, indicating that loading a large amount of TPS will result in faster recombination of charge carriers.Although TGNT3 has better light absorption performance and larger surface area, the rapid recombination of carriers limits the photocatalytic reduction process and therefore leads to the lowest catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 8(b), the transient photocurrent response analyses were performed under a visible light lamp that turns on and off repeatedly to investigate the charge separation and transfer efficiency.The photocurrent response quickly after light on, and the current density of all photocatalysts can be ignored during light off.The rapid response of current to light irradiation indicates that the charge is quickly transferred in the photocatalyst 75.The corresponding reproducibility of the photocurrent is stable in several cycles of light irradiation, which leads to stable catalytic performance after multiple irradiations and repeated use.The photocurrent intensity of TGNT2 is twice that of g-C 3 N 4 NT, indicating that loading TPS greatly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 76,77.In order to further confirm the improvement of charge separation and transfer efficiency, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT2 were investigated, as shown in the Fig. 8(c).The Nyquist plot shows that the arc radius of TGNT2 is smaller than that of g-C 3 N 4 , which is attributed to the fact that the TPS composite material reduces the charge transfer resistance and increases the electronic conductivity.It results in more effective charge separation, and the excellent charge transfer capability is consistent with the above photocurrent response 78,79.As shown in Fig. 8(d), the structure of the nanotube and the load of the TPS affect the expansion of the band gap.The increase in the band gap of the TGNT can be attributed to the O defect effect due to the loading of silica 80.Photoelectrons and holes can be constrained at the defect site, and new intrinsic or extrinsic absorption bands can be generated in the band gap of SiO 2 , which optimizes the redox couple chosen as photocatalysis/photoelectrochemical applications 81.These factors lead to changes in the energy band structure, and a suitable energy band structure can thermodynamically realize the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction."}, {"llm generation": "TGNT1", "source": "The PL emission peak intensity of g-C 3 N 4 NT is significantly lower than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , and TGNT1 and TGNT2 are further lower.", "context": "The crystal structure of the g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT are investigated by XRD, as presented in Fig. 1.The diffraction peak at 12.7 is assigned the (210) plane corresponding melon-type CN with an orthorhombic structure 37,38.The peak at 27.3 is attributed to the (002) plane corresponding to the characteristic inter-planar stacking reflection of conjugated aromatic systems 39.As shown in Fig. S1(a), the peaks at 10.5 , 18.3 , 21.9 , and 27.7 are attributed to the in-planar packing and inter-planar stacking of hydrothermal intermediate MCA 40.It shows that after the hydrothermal process, the crystal structure of melamine has been completely transformed into MCA.The broad diffraction peak of TPS at 23 degrees in Fig. S1(b) indicates that it is amorphous silica 41. The chemical structure of the samples is surveyed by FTIR, as shown in Fig. 2. The peaks at 1238, 1321, 1410, 1572, and 1637 cm -1 are attributed to the typical stretching modes of C-N heterocycles from g-C 3 N 4 NT 42.The peak at 812 cm -1 is assigned to the vibration mode of the s-triazine units 43.The broad peak around 3200 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrational modes of primary amines -NH 2 and secondary amines NH 44.In the spectra of TPS, the peak at 1085 cm -1 is due to the bond bending vibrations of Si-O-Si.The peak at 958 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrations of Si-OH 45,46.Obviously, the characteristic peaks of TGNT show that the composite photocatalysts are provided with both chemical structures of g-C 3 N 4 and TPS. The compositions and chemical states of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 NT, and TGNT are further investigated by XPS.The survey spectra of C, N, O, Si elements are shown in Fig. 3(a).The high-resolution spectra for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p are fitted and shown in Fig. 3(b) (c) (d) (e).In C 1s spectra, the peaks at 288.3, 285.8, and 284.8 eV are attributed to the carbon atom in N-CN bonds of g-C 3 N 4 , - of the adventitious carbocycles, and C-C bonds in the adventitious reference carbon on the surface 47,48.In N 1s spectra, the peaks at 401.3, 399.6, and 398.7 eV can be ascribed to N in N-(C) 3 , N-H, and C-NC 49,50.The peak at 404.4 eV is attributed to the excitation of the heptazine rings 51.In O 1s spectra, the peak at 533.7 eV is due to the CO bond formed during the hydrothermal process.The peak at 532.3 eV is derived from the C-OH bond, so that TGNT can avoid the formation of -OH groups on the photocatalyst surface, and thus O defects are formed 52,53.The Si 2p binding energy of Si peak at 103.9 eV is the chemical bond of O-Si-O 54,55.As shown in Fig. S3 (d), the three samples of TGNT exhibit obvious Si energy peaks, which prove the combination between g-C 3 N 4 and TPS.5(a).The texture characteristics calculated from the above curve, including BET specific surface area (S ), external specific surface area (S ), total pore volume (V ), and average pore size (D ), are listed in Table 1.It can reveal that with the increase of TPS loading, the N 2 adsorption capacity and pore volume of TGNT increase, thus leading to more surface adsorption vacancies.There are hysteresis loops in the curves of the three samples of TGNT, indicating that there is a process of mesoporous capillary condensation.The mesoporous structure can quickly transfer ions and penetrate to the active site 56.The intermediate MCA has almost no adsorption effect, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1.The tube structure has an enhanced specific surface area after thermal polymerization, and then it is further increased after loading TPS.The extremely increased specific surface area can provide more reactive sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 57.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the trimodal porous distribution peaks of TPS are concentrated at 1.3, 1.7, and 2.4 nm.The samples of TGNT are also showed these three distribution peaks at the pore width above, and the average pore size decreased with the increase of TPS loading.It can also be seen that the TPS load increases by the same amount but the S has a huge difference because part of the trimodal porous is blocked during the 6(a).The characteristic absorption edge at around 450 nm is displayed in all samples.The curve of g-C 3 N 4 NT is relatively blue-shifted, which may originate from the quantum confinement effect caused by the size and thickness reduction compared to bulk g-C 3 N 4 58.For g-C 3 N 4 , the introduction of quantum confinement effect could provide competent driving forces for photocatalytic reactions 59.This indicates that the construction of the nanotube structure and the load of TPS can affect the electronic structure of C 3 N 4 , thereby expanding the band gap 60.The band gap is estimated by the Kubelka-Munk transformation method 61,62, and it is presented in Fig. 6(b).The VB XPS spectra is used to calculate VB potentials (E ), which is shown in Fig. 3(f).The tangents of the curve around 0 eV are calculated, and the energy value corresponding to the position of the intersection of the tangents is the VB potential.The E of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are 1.31, 1.26, and 1.40 eV related to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Considering the band gap estimated by the UV-vis DRS, the CB potentials (E ) of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are located at 1.54, 1.63 and 1.34 eV vs NHE, respectively.They are much more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (0.33 eV vs NHE) 63.It points out that loading TPS on g-C 3 N 4 NT can cause E to be more negative and enhance CO 2 reduction performance.The absorption peak of TGNT is stronger, and its absorption peak tail extends the absorption intensity at greater than 450 nm.Therefore, TGNT loaded of TPS has a stronger light trapping ability. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity was measured under visible light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.Only ethanol was detected when performing catalytic activity evaluation using g-C 3 N 4 NT and composite TGNT as the photocatalyst.However, a large amount of methanol is detected in the reaction product solution using bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the previously published work 646566.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps of the rough mechanism are depicted as follows Eqs. ( 1)-( 5) 67,68. The incident photons of visible light produce excitons after being absorbed by the semiconductor g-C 3 N 4 , which are electron-hole pairs constrained by the Coulomb force 69, as described in Eq. (1).In order for the catalytic process to occur, the charges need respectively migrate to the reaction sites on the photocatalyst surface and avoid recombination.There, electrons and holes respectively reduce the adsorbed electron acceptor CO 2 molecules and oxidize the electron donor H 2 O, which is described in Eqs. ( 2) and (3).The production of CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH through the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is shown in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex path for multi-electron transfer, and multiple products are obtained.From the thermodynamic perspective, six electrons or twelve electrons are required to convert one CO 2 molecule to form CH 3 OH or C 2 H 5 OH.The hollow tubular structure can not only provide effective light collection ability due to multiple light reflections or scattering in the internal space, but also can reduce the diffusion distance from the inside to the surface, thereby accelerating the separation of charge carriers 70.Therefore, TGNT can undertake the conversion process of ethanol with more charge transfer, while bulk g-C 3 N 4 can only produce methanol and a small amount of ethanol. The blank experiments were operated under the same conditions in the dark or without CO 2 gas flow, which did not detect the reduction products.It indicates that both light and CO 2 gas are necessary for the photocatalytic reduction reaction.Besides, N 2 was introduced into the reactor instead of CO 2 for the comparative reaction, and then no carbon-based products were detected, and this is similar to previous reports 71,72.To further verify that the ethanol product originates from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , the 13 C isotope labeling experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 gas under identical experimental conditions.The mass spectrum of the GC-MS analysis of the product of 13 CO 2 as feed gas in the reaction is shown in Fig. 7(c).The fragment peaks of ethanol appear at m/z 31, 32, 43, and 45 instead of the peaks at m/z 29, 30, 31, 41, and 43 of the nonisotopic labeling experiment (Fig. S7).This confirms that the ethanol produced comes from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , rather than originate from carbon materials contamination.In the reaction experiment using bulk TPS as a photocatalyst, no reduction product was detected, indicating that it does not have the photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 .After 8 h of photocatalytic reaction, the ethanol yield of the prepared photocatalyst tends to be stable.The gas in the headspace of the reactor was analyzed, and no gas products of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were detected.Compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the activity of g-C 3 N 4 NT with nanotube structure is greatly enhanced, and the ethanol output is 113 mol/g.Then, the activity of composite TGNT loaded with TPS is further enhanced, and TGNT2 reached 196 mol/g.However, the ethanol yield of TGNT3 is improved less, which is due to the excessive loading of TPS that affects the photocatalytic process.As shown in Fig. 7(d), after 10 cycles of testing, the ethanol production of TGNT2 decreased by less than 5.The photocatalyst was characterized by XRD and FTIR after 10 cycles of running in Fig. S8.From the crystal plane diffraction peak and chemical bond absorption peak, it can be seen that its crystal structure and chemical structure have not changed.It indicates that this composite photocatalyst can be stably used repeatedly for a long time.The comparison of various recently reported g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts previously with the present work for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was listed in Table S2.It can be seen that the present work has prepared a composite photocatalyst with considerable catalytic activity by a universal and simple hydrothermal method. High-sensitivity steady-state PL spectra of as-prepared photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8(a).The emission peak of g-C 3 N 4 is displayed at 475 nm, but due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the TGNT composite structure, the emission peak shifts to 450 nm 73.The PL emission peak intensity of g-C 3 N 4 NT is significantly lower than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , and TGNT1 and TGNT2 are further lower.The low emission peak intensity indicates that the recombination rate of charge carriers is much lower, and the charge transfer in TGNT1 and TGNT2 is faster 74.The emission peak intensity of TGNT3 is extremely enhanced, indicating that loading a large amount of TPS will result in faster recombination of charge carriers.Although TGNT3 has better light absorption performance and larger surface area, the rapid recombination of carriers limits the photocatalytic reduction process and therefore leads to the lowest catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 8(b), the transient photocurrent response analyses were performed under a visible light lamp that turns on and off repeatedly to investigate the charge separation and transfer efficiency.The photocurrent response quickly after light on, and the current density of all photocatalysts can be ignored during light off.The rapid response of current to light irradiation indicates that the charge is quickly transferred in the photocatalyst 75.The corresponding reproducibility of the photocurrent is stable in several cycles of light irradiation, which leads to stable catalytic performance after multiple irradiations and repeated use.The photocurrent intensity of TGNT2 is twice that of g-C 3 N 4 NT, indicating that loading TPS greatly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 76,77.In order to further confirm the improvement of charge separation and transfer efficiency, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT2 were investigated, as shown in the Fig. 8(c).The Nyquist plot shows that the arc radius of TGNT2 is smaller than that of g-C 3 N 4 , which is attributed to the fact that the TPS composite material reduces the charge transfer resistance and increases the electronic conductivity.It results in more effective charge separation, and the excellent charge transfer capability is consistent with the above photocurrent response 78,79.As shown in Fig. 8(d), the structure of the nanotube and the load of the TPS affect the expansion of the band gap.The increase in the band gap of the TGNT can be attributed to the O defect effect due to the loading of silica 80.Photoelectrons and holes can be constrained at the defect site, and new intrinsic or extrinsic absorption bands can be generated in the band gap of SiO 2 , which optimizes the redox couple chosen as photocatalysis/photoelectrochemical applications 81.These factors lead to changes in the energy band structure, and a suitable energy band structure can thermodynamically realize the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction."}, {"llm generation": "TGNT2", "source": "The PL emission peak intensity of g-C 3 N 4 NT is significantly lower than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , and TGNT1 and TGNT2 are further lower.", "context": "The crystal structure of the g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT are investigated by XRD, as presented in Fig. 1.The diffraction peak at 12.7 is assigned the (210) plane corresponding melon-type CN with an orthorhombic structure 37,38.The peak at 27.3 is attributed to the (002) plane corresponding to the characteristic inter-planar stacking reflection of conjugated aromatic systems 39.As shown in Fig. S1(a), the peaks at 10.5 , 18.3 , 21.9 , and 27.7 are attributed to the in-planar packing and inter-planar stacking of hydrothermal intermediate MCA 40.It shows that after the hydrothermal process, the crystal structure of melamine has been completely transformed into MCA.The broad diffraction peak of TPS at 23 degrees in Fig. S1(b) indicates that it is amorphous silica 41.

The peaks at 1238, 1321, 1410, 1572, and 1637 cm -1 are attributed to the typical stretching modes of C-N heterocycles from g-C 3 N 4 NT 42.The peak at 812 cm -1 is assigned to the vibration mode of the s-triazine units 43.The broad peak around 3200 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrational modes of primary amines -NH 2 and secondary amines NH 44.In the spectra of TPS, the peak at 1085 cm -1 is due to the bond bending vibrations of Si-O-Si.The peak at 958 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrations of Si-OH 45,46.Obviously, the characteristic peaks of TGNT show that the composite photocatalysts are provided with both chemical structures of g-C 3 N 4 and TPS. The compositions and chemical states of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 NT, and TGNT are further investigated by XPS.The survey spectra of C, N, O, Si elements are shown in Fig. 3(a).The high-resolution spectra for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p are fitted and shown in Fig. 3(b) (c) (d) (e).In C 1s spectra, the peaks at 288.3, 285.8, and 284.8 eV are attributed to the carbon atom in N-CN bonds of g-C 3 N 4 , - of the adventitious carbocycles, and C-C bonds in the adventitious reference carbon on the surface 47,48.In N 1s spectra, the peaks at 401.3, 399.6, and 398.7 eV can be ascribed to N in N-(C) 3 , N-H, and C-NC 49,50.The peak at 404.4 eV is attributed to the excitation of the heptazine rings 51.In O 1s spectra, the peak at 533.7 eV is due to the CO bond formed during the hydrothermal process.The peak at 532.3 eV is derived from the C-OH bond, so that TGNT can avoid the formation of -OH groups on the photocatalyst surface, and thus O defects are formed 52,53.The Si 2p binding energy of Si peak at 103.9 eV is the chemical bond of O-Si-O 54,55.As shown in Fig. S3 (d), the three samples of TGNT exhibit obvious Si energy peaks, which prove the combination between g-C 3 N 4 and TPS.5(a).The texture characteristics calculated from the above curve, including BET specific surface area (S ), external specific surface area (S ), total pore volume (V ), and average pore size (D ), are listed in Table 1.It can reveal that with the increase of TPS loading, the N 2 adsorption capacity and pore volume of TGNT increase, thus leading to more surface adsorption vacancies.There are hysteresis loops in the curves of the three samples of TGNT, indicating that there is a process of mesoporous capillary condensation.The mesoporous structure can quickly transfer ions and penetrate to the active site 56.The intermediate MCA has almost no adsorption effect, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1.The tube structure has an enhanced specific surface area after thermal polymerization, and then it is further increased after loading TPS.The extremely increased specific surface area can provide more reactive sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 57.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the trimodal porous distribution peaks of TPS are concentrated at 1.3, 1.7, and 2.4 nm.The samples of TGNT are also showed these three distribution peaks at the pore width above, and the average pore size decreased with the increase of TPS loading.It can also be seen that the TPS load increases by the same amount but the S has a huge difference because part of the trimodal porous is blocked during the 6(a).The characteristic absorption edge at around 450 nm is displayed in all samples.The curve of g-C 3 N 4 NT is relatively blue-shifted, which may originate from the quantum confinement effect caused by the size and thickness reduction compared to bulk g-C 3 N 4 58.For g-C 3 N 4 , the introduction of quantum confinement effect could provide competent driving forces for photocatalytic reactions 59.This indicates that the construction of the nanotube structure and the load of TPS can affect the electronic structure of C 3 N 4 , thereby expanding the band gap 60.The band gap is estimated by the Kubelka-Munk transformation method 61,62, and it is presented in Fig. 6(b).The VB XPS spectra is used to calculate VB potentials (E ), which is shown in Fig. 3(f).The tangents of the curve around 0 eV are calculated, and the energy value corresponding to the position of the intersection of the tangents is the VB potential.The E of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are 1.31, 1.26, and 1.40 eV related to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Considering the band gap estimated by the UV-vis DRS, the CB potentials (E ) of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are located at 1.54, 1.63 and 1.34 eV vs NHE, respectively.They are much more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (0.33 eV vs NHE) 63.It points out that loading TPS on g-C 3 N 4 NT can cause E to be more negative and enhance CO 2 reduction performance.The absorption peak of TGNT is stronger, and its absorption peak tail extends the absorption intensity at greater than 450 nm.Therefore, TGNT loaded of TPS has a stronger light trapping ability. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity was measured under visible light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.Only ethanol was detected when performing catalytic activity evaluation using g-C 3 N 4 NT and composite TGNT as the photocatalyst.However, a large amount of methanol is detected in the reaction product solution using bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the previously published work 646566.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps of the rough mechanism are depicted as follows Eqs. ( 1)-( 5) 67,68. The incident photons of visible light produce excitons after being absorbed by the semiconductor g-C 3 N 4 , which are electron-hole pairs constrained by the Coulomb force 69, as described in Eq. (1).In order for the catalytic process to occur, the charges need respectively migrate to the reaction sites on the photocatalyst surface and avoid recombination.There, electrons and holes respectively reduce the adsorbed electron acceptor CO 2 molecules and oxidize the electron donor H 2 O, which is described in Eqs. ( 2) and (3).The production of CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH through the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is shown in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex path for multi-electron transfer, and multiple products are obtained.From the thermodynamic perspective, six electrons or twelve electrons are required to convert one CO 2 molecule to form CH 3 OH or C 2 H 5 OH.The hollow tubular structure can not only provide effective light collection ability due to multiple light reflections or scattering in the internal space, but also can reduce the diffusion distance from the inside to the surface, thereby accelerating the separation of charge carriers 70.Therefore, TGNT can undertake the conversion process of ethanol with more charge transfer, while bulk g-C 3 N 4 can only produce methanol and a small amount of ethanol. The blank experiments were operated under the same conditions in the dark or without CO 2 gas flow, which did not detect the reduction products.It indicates that both light and CO 2 gas are necessary for the photocatalytic reduction reaction.Besides, N 2 was introduced into the reactor instead of CO 2 for the comparative reaction, and then no carbon-based products were detected, and this is similar to previous reports 71,72.To further verify that the ethanol product originates from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , the 13 C isotope labeling experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 gas under identical experimental conditions.The mass spectrum of the GC-MS analysis of the product of 13 CO 2 as feed gas in the reaction is shown in Fig. 7(c).The fragment peaks of ethanol appear at m/z 31, 32, 43, and 45 instead of the peaks at m/z 29, 30, 31, 41, and 43 of the nonisotopic labeling experiment (Fig. S7).This confirms that the ethanol produced comes from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , rather than originate from carbon materials contamination.In the reaction experiment using bulk TPS as a photocatalyst, no reduction product was detected, indicating that it does not have the photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 .After 8 h of photocatalytic reaction, the ethanol yield of the prepared photocatalyst tends to be stable.The gas in the headspace of the reactor was analyzed, and no gas products of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were detected.Compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the activity of g-C 3 N 4 NT with nanotube structure is greatly enhanced, and the ethanol output is 113 mol/g.Then, the activity of composite TGNT loaded with TPS is further enhanced, and TGNT2 reached 196 mol/g.However, the ethanol yield of TGNT3 is improved less, which is due to the excessive loading of TPS that affects the photocatalytic process.As shown in Fig. 7(d), after 10 cycles of testing, the ethanol production of TGNT2 decreased by less than 5.The photocatalyst was characterized by XRD and FTIR after 10 cycles of running in Fig. S8.From the crystal plane diffraction peak and chemical bond absorption peak, it can be seen that its crystal structure and chemical structure have not changed.It indicates that this composite photocatalyst can be stably used repeatedly for a long time.The comparison of various recently reported g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts previously with the present work for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was listed in Table S2.It can be seen that the present work has prepared a composite photocatalyst with considerable catalytic activity by a universal and simple hydrothermal method. High-sensitivity steady-state PL spectra of as-prepared photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8(a).The emission peak of g-C 3 N 4 is displayed at 475 nm, but due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the TGNT composite structure, the emission peak shifts to 450 nm 73.The PL emission peak intensity of g-C 3 N 4 NT is significantly lower than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , and TGNT1 and TGNT2 are further lower.The low emission peak intensity indicates that the recombination rate of charge carriers is much lower, and the charge transfer in TGNT1 and TGNT2 is faster 74.The emission peak intensity of TGNT3 is extremely enhanced, indicating that loading a large amount of TPS will result in faster recombination of charge carriers.Although TGNT3 has better light absorption performance and larger surface area, the rapid recombination of carriers limits the photocatalytic reduction process and therefore leads to the lowest catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 8(b), the transient photocurrent response analyses were performed under a visible light lamp that turns on and off repeatedly to investigate the charge separation and transfer efficiency.The photocurrent response quickly after light on, and the current density of all photocatalysts can be ignored during light off.The rapid response of current to light irradiation indicates that the charge is quickly transferred in the photocatalyst 75.The corresponding reproducibility of the photocurrent is stable in several cycles of light irradiation, which leads to stable catalytic performance after multiple irradiations and repeated use.The photocurrent intensity of TGNT2 is twice that of g-C 3 N 4 NT, indicating that loading TPS greatly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 76,77.In order to further confirm the improvement of charge separation and transfer efficiency, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT2 were investigated, as shown in the Fig. 8(c).The Nyquist plot shows that the arc radius of TGNT2 is smaller than that of g-C 3 N 4 , which is attributed to the fact that the TPS composite material reduces the charge transfer resistance and increases the electronic conductivity.It results in more effective charge separation, and the excellent charge transfer capability is consistent with the above photocurrent response 78,79.As shown in Fig. 8(d), the structure of the nanotube and the load of the TPS affect the expansion of the band gap.The increase in the band gap of the TGNT can be attributed to the O defect effect due to the loading of silica 80.Photoelectrons and holes can be constrained at the defect site, and new intrinsic or extrinsic absorption bands can be generated in the band gap of SiO 2 , which optimizes the redox couple chosen as photocatalysis/photoelectrochemical applications 81.These factors lead to changes in the energy band structure, and a suitable energy band structure can thermodynamically realize the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction."}, {"llm generation": "TGNT2", "source": "The photocurrent intensity of TGNT2 is twice that of g-C 3 N 4 NT, indicating that loading TPS greatly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 76,77.", "context": "The crystal structure of the g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT are investigated by XRD, as presented in Fig. 1.The diffraction peak at 12.7 is assigned the (210) plane corresponding melon-type CN with an orthorhombic structure 37,38.The peak at 27.3 is attributed to the (002) plane corresponding to the characteristic inter-planar stacking reflection of conjugated aromatic systems 39.As shown in Fig. S1(a), the peaks at 10.5 , 18.3 , 21.9 , and 27.7 are attributed to the in-planar packing and inter-planar stacking of hydrothermal intermediate MCA 40.It shows that after the hydrothermal process, the crystal structure of melamine has been completely transformed into MCA.The broad diffraction peak of TPS at 23 degrees in Fig. S1(b) indicates that it is amorphous silica 41. The chemical structure of the samples is surveyed by FTIR, as shown in Fig. 2. The peaks at 1238, 1321, 1410, 1572, and 1637 cm -1 are attributed to the typical stretching modes of C-N heterocycles from g-C 3 N 4 NT 42.The peak at 812 cm -1 is assigned to the vibration mode of the s-triazine units 43.The broad peak around 3200 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrational modes of primary amines -NH 2 and secondary amines NH 44.In the spectra of TPS, the peak at 1085 cm -1 is due to the bond bending vibrations of Si-O-Si.The peak at 958 cm -1 is due to the stretching vibrations of Si-OH 45,46.Obviously, the characteristic peaks of TGNT show that the composite photocatalysts are provided with both chemical structures of g-C 3 N 4 and TPS. The compositions and chemical states of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 NT, and TGNT are further investigated by XPS.The survey spectra of C, N, O, Si elements are shown in Fig. 3(a).The high-resolution spectra for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p are fitted and shown in Fig. 3(b) (c) (d) (e).In C 1s spectra, the peaks at 288.3, 285.8, and 284.8 eV are attributed to the carbon atom in N-CN bonds of g-C 3 N 4 , - of the adventitious carbocycles, and C-C bonds in the adventitious reference carbon on the surface 47,48.In N 1s spectra, the peaks at 401.3, 399.6, and 398.7 eV can be ascribed to N in N-(C) 3 , N-H, and C-NC 49,50.The peak at 404.4 eV is attributed to the excitation of the heptazine rings 51.In O 1s spectra, the peak at 533.7 eV is due to the CO bond formed during the hydrothermal process.The peak at 532.3 eV is derived from the C-OH bond, so that TGNT can avoid the formation of -OH groups on the photocatalyst surface, and thus O defects are formed 52,53.The Si 2p binding energy of Si peak at 103.9 eV is the chemical bond of O-Si-O 54,55.As shown in Fig. S3 (d), the three samples of TGNT exhibit obvious Si energy peaks, which prove the combination between g-C 3 N 4 and TPS.5(a).The texture characteristics calculated from the above curve, including BET specific surface area (S ), external specific surface area (S ), total pore volume (V ), and average pore size (D ), are listed in Table 1.It can reveal that with the increase of TPS loading, the N 2 adsorption capacity and pore volume of TGNT increase, thus leading to more surface adsorption vacancies.There are hysteresis loops in the curves of the three samples of TGNT, indicating that there is a process of mesoporous capillary condensation.The mesoporous structure can quickly transfer ions and penetrate to the active site 56.The intermediate MCA has almost no adsorption effect, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1.The tube structure has an enhanced specific surface area after thermal polymerization, and then it is further increased after loading TPS.The extremely increased specific surface area can provide more reactive sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 57.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the trimodal porous distribution peaks of TPS are concentrated at 1.3, 1.7, and 2.4 nm.The samples of TGNT are also showed these three distribution peaks at the pore width above, and the average pore size decreased with the increase of TPS loading.It can also be seen that the TPS load increases by the same amount but the S has a huge difference because part of the trimodal porous is blocked during the 6(a).The characteristic absorption edge at around 450 nm is displayed in all samples.The curve of g-C 3 N 4 NT is relatively blue-shifted, which may originate from the quantum confinement effect caused by the size and thickness reduction compared to bulk g-C 3 N 4 58.For g-C 3 N 4 , the introduction of quantum confinement effect could provide competent driving forces for photocatalytic reactions 59.This indicates that the construction of the nanotube structure and the load of TPS can affect the electronic structure of C 3 N 4 , thereby expanding the band gap 60.The band gap is estimated by the Kubelka-Munk transformation method 61,62, and it is presented in Fig. 6(b).The VB XPS spectra is used to calculate VB potentials (E ), which is shown in Fig. 3(f).The tangents of the curve around 0 eV are calculated, and the energy value corresponding to the position of the intersection of the tangents is the VB potential.The E of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are 1.31, 1.26, and 1.40 eV related to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Considering the band gap estimated by the UV-vis DRS, the CB potentials (E ) of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are located at 1.54, 1.63 and 1.34 eV vs NHE, respectively.They are much more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (0.33 eV vs NHE) 63.It points out that loading TPS on g-C 3 N 4 NT can cause E to be more negative and enhance CO 2 reduction performance.The absorption peak of TGNT is stronger, and its absorption peak tail extends the absorption intensity at greater than 450 nm.Therefore, TGNT loaded of TPS has a stronger light trapping ability. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity was measured under visible light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.Only ethanol was detected when performing catalytic activity evaluation using g-C 3 N 4 NT and composite TGNT as the photocatalyst.However, a large amount of methanol is detected in the reaction product solution using bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the previously published work 646566.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps of the rough mechanism are depicted as follows Eqs.

The compositions and chemical states of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , g-C 3 N 4 NT, and TGNT are further investigated by XPS.The survey spectra of C, N, O, Si elements are shown in Fig. 3(a).The high-resolution spectra for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p are fitted and shown in Fig. 3(b) (c) (d) (e).In C 1s spectra, the peaks at 288.3, 285.8, and 284.8 eV are attributed to the carbon atom in N-CN bonds of g-C 3 N 4 , - of the adventitious carbocycles, and C-C bonds in the adventitious reference carbon on the surface 47,48.In N 1s spectra, the peaks at 401.3, 399.6, and 398.7 eV can be ascribed to N in N-(C) 3 , N-H, and C-NC 49,50.The peak at 404.4 eV is attributed to the excitation of the heptazine rings 51.In O 1s spectra, the peak at 533.7 eV is due to the CO bond formed during the hydrothermal process.The peak at 532.3 eV is derived from the C-OH bond, so that TGNT can avoid the formation of -OH groups on the photocatalyst surface, and thus O defects are formed 52,53.The Si 2p binding energy of Si peak at 103.9 eV is the chemical bond of O-Si-O 54,55.As shown in Fig. S3 (d), the three samples of TGNT exhibit obvious Si energy peaks, which prove the combination between g-C 3 N 4 and TPS.5(a).The texture characteristics calculated from the above curve, including BET specific surface area (S ), external specific surface area (S ), total pore volume (V ), and average pore size (D ), are listed in Table 1.It can reveal that with the increase of TPS loading, the N 2 adsorption capacity and pore volume of TGNT increase, thus leading to more surface adsorption vacancies.There are hysteresis loops in the curves of the three samples of TGNT, indicating that there is a process of mesoporous capillary condensation.The mesoporous structure can quickly transfer ions and penetrate to the active site 56.The intermediate MCA has almost no adsorption effect, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1.The tube structure has an enhanced specific surface area after thermal polymerization, and then it is further increased after loading TPS.The extremely increased specific surface area can provide more reactive sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 57.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the trimodal porous distribution peaks of TPS are concentrated at 1.3, 1.7, and 2.4 nm.The samples of TGNT are also showed these three distribution peaks at the pore width above, and the average pore size decreased with the increase of TPS loading.It can also be seen that the TPS load increases by the same amount but the S has a huge difference because part of the trimodal porous is blocked during the 6(a).The characteristic absorption edge at around 450 nm is displayed in all samples.The curve of g-C 3 N 4 NT is relatively blue-shifted, which may originate from the quantum confinement effect caused by the size and thickness reduction compared to bulk g-C 3 N 4 58.For g-C 3 N 4 , the introduction of quantum confinement effect could provide competent driving forces for photocatalytic reactions 59.This indicates that the construction of the nanotube structure and the load of TPS can affect the electronic structure of C 3 N 4 , thereby expanding the band gap 60.The band gap is estimated by the Kubelka-Munk transformation method 61,62, and it is presented in Fig. 6(b).The VB XPS spectra is used to calculate VB potentials (E ), which is shown in Fig. 3(f).The tangents of the curve around 0 eV are calculated, and the energy value corresponding to the position of the intersection of the tangents is the VB potential.The E of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are 1.31, 1.26, and 1.40 eV related to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Considering the band gap estimated by the UV-vis DRS, the CB potentials (E ) of g-C 3 N 4 NT, TGNT2, and bulk g-C 3 N 4 are located at 1.54, 1.63 and 1.34 eV vs NHE, respectively.They are much more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (0.33 eV vs NHE) 63.It points out that loading TPS on g-C 3 N 4 NT can cause E to be more negative and enhance CO 2 reduction performance.The absorption peak of TGNT is stronger, and its absorption peak tail extends the absorption intensity at greater than 450 nm.Therefore, TGNT loaded of TPS has a stronger light trapping ability. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity was measured under visible light irradiation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.Only ethanol was detected when performing catalytic activity evaluation using g-C 3 N 4 NT and composite TGNT as the photocatalyst.However, a large amount of methanol is detected in the reaction product solution using bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which is consistent with the previously published work 646566.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps of the rough mechanism are depicted as follows Eqs. ( 1)-( 5) 67,68. The incident photons of visible light produce excitons after being absorbed by the semiconductor g-C 3 N 4 , which are electron-hole pairs constrained by the Coulomb force 69, as described in Eq. (1).In order for the catalytic process to occur, the charges need respectively migrate to the reaction sites on the photocatalyst surface and avoid recombination.There, electrons and holes respectively reduce the adsorbed electron acceptor CO 2 molecules and oxidize the electron donor H 2 O, which is described in Eqs. ( 2) and (3).The production of CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH through the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is shown in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex path for multi-electron transfer, and multiple products are obtained.From the thermodynamic perspective, six electrons or twelve electrons are required to convert one CO 2 molecule to form CH 3 OH or C 2 H 5 OH.The hollow tubular structure can not only provide effective light collection ability due to multiple light reflections or scattering in the internal space, but also can reduce the diffusion distance from the inside to the surface, thereby accelerating the separation of charge carriers 70.Therefore, TGNT can undertake the conversion process of ethanol with more charge transfer, while bulk g-C 3 N 4 can only produce methanol and a small amount of ethanol. The blank experiments were operated under the same conditions in the dark or without CO 2 gas flow, which did not detect the reduction products.It indicates that both light and CO 2 gas are necessary for the photocatalytic reduction reaction.Besides, N 2 was introduced into the reactor instead of CO 2 for the comparative reaction, and then no carbon-based products were detected, and this is similar to previous reports 71,72.To further verify that the ethanol product originates from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , the 13 C isotope labeling experiment was performed by using 13 CO 2 gas under identical experimental conditions.The mass spectrum of the GC-MS analysis of the product of 13 CO 2 as feed gas in the reaction is shown in Fig. 7(c).The fragment peaks of ethanol appear at m/z 31, 32, 43, and 45 instead of the peaks at m/z 29, 30, 31, 41, and 43 of the nonisotopic labeling experiment (Fig. S7).This confirms that the ethanol produced comes from the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , rather than originate from carbon materials contamination.In the reaction experiment using bulk TPS as a photocatalyst, no reduction product was detected, indicating that it does not have the photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 .After 8 h of photocatalytic reaction, the ethanol yield of the prepared photocatalyst tends to be stable.The gas in the headspace of the reactor was analyzed, and no gas products of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were detected.Compared with the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the activity of g-C 3 N 4 NT with nanotube structure is greatly enhanced, and the ethanol output is 113 mol/g.Then, the activity of composite TGNT loaded with TPS is further enhanced, and TGNT2 reached 196 mol/g.However, the ethanol yield of TGNT3 is improved less, which is due to the excessive loading of TPS that affects the photocatalytic process.As shown in Fig. 7(d), after 10 cycles of testing, the ethanol production of TGNT2 decreased by less than 5.The photocatalyst was characterized by XRD and FTIR after 10 cycles of running in Fig. S8.From the crystal plane diffraction peak and chemical bond absorption peak, it can be seen that its crystal structure and chemical structure have not changed.It indicates that this composite photocatalyst can be stably used repeatedly for a long time.The comparison of various recently reported g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts previously with the present work for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was listed in Table S2.It can be seen that the present work has prepared a composite photocatalyst with considerable catalytic activity by a universal and simple hydrothermal method. High-sensitivity steady-state PL spectra of as-prepared photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8(a).The emission peak of g-C 3 N 4 is displayed at 475 nm, but due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the TGNT composite structure, the emission peak shifts to 450 nm 73.The PL emission peak intensity of g-C 3 N 4 NT is significantly lower than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , and TGNT1 and TGNT2 are further lower.The low emission peak intensity indicates that the recombination rate of charge carriers is much lower, and the charge transfer in TGNT1 and TGNT2 is faster 74.The emission peak intensity of TGNT3 is extremely enhanced, indicating that loading a large amount of TPS will result in faster recombination of charge carriers.Although TGNT3 has better light absorption performance and larger surface area, the rapid recombination of carriers limits the photocatalytic reduction process and therefore leads to the lowest catalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 8(b), the transient photocurrent response analyses were performed under a visible light lamp that turns on and off repeatedly to investigate the charge separation and transfer efficiency.The photocurrent response quickly after light on, and the current density of all photocatalysts can be ignored during light off.The rapid response of current to light irradiation indicates that the charge is quickly transferred in the photocatalyst 75.The corresponding reproducibility of the photocurrent is stable in several cycles of light irradiation, which leads to stable catalytic performance after multiple irradiations and repeated use.The photocurrent intensity of TGNT2 is twice that of g-C 3 N 4 NT, indicating that loading TPS greatly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 76,77.In order to further confirm the improvement of charge separation and transfer efficiency, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of g-C 3 N 4 NT and TGNT2 were investigated, as shown in the Fig. 8(c).The Nyquist plot shows that the arc radius of TGNT2 is smaller than that of g-C 3 N 4 , which is attributed to the fact that the TPS composite material reduces the charge transfer resistance and increases the electronic conductivity.It results in more effective charge separation, and the excellent charge transfer capability is consistent with the above photocurrent response 78,79.As shown in Fig. 8(d), the structure of the nanotube and the load of the TPS affect the expansion of the band gap.The increase in the band gap of the TGNT can be attributed to the O defect effect due to the loading of silica 80.Photoelectrons and holes can be constrained at the defect site, and new intrinsic or extrinsic absorption bands can be generated in the band gap of SiO 2 , which optimizes the redox couple chosen as photocatalysis/photoelectrochemical applications 81.These factors lead to changes in the energy band structure, and a suitable energy band structure can thermodynamically realize the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction."}, {"llm generation": "TPS/g-C 3 N 4 nanotube composite photocatalyst", "source": "In summary, the TPS/g-C 3 N 4 nanotube composite photocatalyst was successfully prepared by a two-step hydrothermal method, which is a promising photocatalyst for reducing CO 2 to ethanol.", "context": "In summary, the TPS/g-C 3 N 4 nanotube composite photocatalyst was successfully prepared by a two-step hydrothermal method, which is a promising photocatalyst for reducing CO 2 to ethanol.The crystal structure and chemical composition of g-C 3 N 4 NT are maintained, but the loading of TPS caused TGNT to improve the specific surface area and increase the reaction sites.Based on the investigations of UV-Vis DRS, PL, photocurrent responses, and EIS, the mechanism of improving the photocatalytic activity of TGNT composites was confirmed.Appropriate loading of TPS can increase the visible light-trapping ability, improve reduction potential and separation-transfer efficiency of photo-generated charges, reduce the charge transfer resistance, and inhibit hole-electron pair recombination.However, excessive loading of TPS enhances charge recombination.Therefore, the performance of TGNT2 in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is enhanced, reaching 196 mol/g.After several cycles of photocatalytic activity and photocurrent measurement, the reproducibility proves its excellent working stability.
