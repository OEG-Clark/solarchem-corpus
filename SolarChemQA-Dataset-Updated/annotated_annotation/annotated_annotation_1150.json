Characterization.The total fabrication procedure of 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanocomposites is schematically shown in Figure 1.Briefly, 3DF ZnO/CeO 2 has been synthesized through a hydrothermal reaction. 52,53Afterward, Ag NPs are deposited onto 3DF ZnO/CeO 2 by the photodeposition process by which the ternary 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO composite is obtained.The morphology and nanostructure of the samples prepared were examined through SEM and TEM techniques.The SEM images of the ZnO, CeO 2 , ZnO/CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ composite are revealed in Figure 2a-d.The pristine ZnO displays a 3DF flower-like morphology with smooth surfaces grown upon the aforementioned synthetic conditions consisting of many nanocones, while the as-synthesized CeO 2 consists of nanoneedles.In addition, the 3AgCZ nanostructure inherits the flower-like structure of the ZnO flower but becomes rough with a larger diameter (102 nm).As revealed in Figure 2d, the modified Ag NPs with an average particle size of nearby 60 nm are deposited on the surface of 3DF ZnO/CeO 2 .Additional examinations by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) specify that the noticeable lattice fringes with d-spacings of 0.26, 0.31, and 0.23 nm are ascribed to the ZnO (100), CeO 2 (111), and Ag (111) facets, respectively (Figure 2f). 47,54,55Furthermore, all elements in the Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO NFs are spotted from energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, and no other elements can be detected as exposed in Figure S1 and Table S1. The crystal structure and phase purity of the composites 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO and pure CeO 2 and ZnO were examined by PXRD.The corresponding X-ray diffraction patterns are shown in Figure 3a-f.As revealed in Figure 3a, ZnO shows diffraction peaks at 2 31.74,34.44, and 36.23, which are attributed respectively to the (100), (002), and (101) lattice planes of pure ZnO with a hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS No. 36-1451).In Figure 3b, the CeO 2 XRD spectrum revealed peaks at 28.4, 33.9, and 37.3equivalent to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the cubic phase of the CeO 2 phase, respectively (JCPDS no.43-1002). 41The PXRD patterns of all AgCZ have all the distinguishing peaks of ZnO, CeO 2 , and Ag, indicating that the AgCZ nanocomposite has been successfully fabricated, and there are no other unwanted phases present in the final products.PXRD patterns of AgCZ in Figure 3c-f show that the peak of Ag matching to (111) lattice planes only appears when the added quantity is over 2.0.The crystallite size was calculated from the Debye-Scherrer equation as follows: 565758 D 0.9 /( cos ) (2) where 1.5414A (the wavelength of Cu K radiation), denotes the full width at half-maximum, and represents the diffraction angle.The crystallite size was noticed to be 56.32,72.93, and 91.57nm for CeO 2 , ZnO, and Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 (sample 3AgZC), respectively.The d-spacings were determined to be 0.32 and 0.27 nm for the (111) plane of CeO 2 and (002) plane of ZnO, respectively. 59,60The evaluated d-spacing is well harmonized with that computed by HRTEM (Figure 2f). To examine the surface compositions and states of ZnO, CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ, XPS analysis was carried out.The XPS survey spectrum of ZnO shows the peaks ascribed to Zn and O elements, while that of CeO 2 expresses the peaks of the elements Ce and O (Figure 4a).As predictable, the XPS survey spectrum of 3AgZC nanocomposites show the co-presence of the peaks ascribed to Zn 2p, Ce 3d, O 1s, and Ag 3d elements, which is in definitive agreement with the energy dispersive Xray (EDX) spectroscopy result as described earlier.To determine the charge transport pathway, high resolution XPS spectra were recorded using in situ-illuminated XPS.In Figure 4b, the binding energies of Ag 3d at 368.47 and 374.33 eV are ascribed to the Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 photoelectron, respectively, indicating the existence of silver in the (1) oxidation state. 61The additional two peaks of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 at 370.77 and 375.25 eV, respectively, affirm the presence of silver in the Ag (0) state. 62,63Therefore, the metallic Ag 0 and ionic Ag species coexist in the 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanocomposite, and the presence of ionic Ag species are ascribed to the electron-giving Ag NPs when interacting with the surrounding CeO 2 and ZnO nanostructures.Depending on the robust metal Ag-assisted CeO 2 and ZnO, interaction photon-generated carriers undergo vectorial transmission in the triple system via Ag NPs as a conducting medium.The Zn 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of ZnO are detected at 1020.81 and 1043.91 eV, respectively (Figure 4d).Subsequently, during the coupling of ZnO with CeO 2 , both Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 peaks display affirmative shifts compared to ZnO. 64,65 These positive shifts can be ascribed to the transmission of electrons from ZnO to CeO 2 .The valid immigration path of ZnO electrons can be established from the high-resolution in situilluminated XPS investigation of CeO 2 (Figure 4c).The a and b are ascribed to the spin splitting orbits of 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 for the Ce ion. 66Therefore, the peaks owing to Ce 4 are specified as a, a, b, b, and b, while those of Ce 3 are referred as a and b (see the Table S2 in the Supporting Information).Due to surface defects and the synergistic interaction between ZnO and CeO 2 , some Ce 3 sites were found, which led to the construction of amorphous Ce 2 O 3 .As Ce 2 O 3 is amorphous, it cannot be distinguished by XRD, which is harmonious with the XRD results of previous reports. 67,68Therefore, it can be observed that mainly Ce ions in CeO 2 and 3AgCZ are in Ce 4 chemical states.Significantly, coupling the ZnO with CeO 2 in 3AgZC, both Ce 3d 5/2 and Ce 3d 3/2 peaks display negative shifts compared to those of CeO 2 .Consequently, after coupling ZnO with CeO 2 , the charge transporter immigration path vagaries and the electrons of ZnO transmit to CeO 2 as established by the negative shift in the locations of Ce 3d peaks. 40,41o explore the impact of Ag concentration on the binding Energy, Ce 3d XPS and Zn 2p XPS were recorded and are presented in Figure S2.Tables S2 andS3 displays that the binding energy variation of both Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 display affirmative shifts that increase with increasing Ag concentration, while both Ce 3d 5/2 and Ce 3d 3/2 peaks display negative shifts. 3.2.Optical Properties.It is clearly recognized that the optical absorption merit of the photocatalyst is a substantial aspect in defining the photocatalytic activity because the establishment of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and reactive types upon light radiation is fundamental for the photocatalytic reaction.The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the fabricated samples are displayed in Figure5a.The band edges of pure ZnO and CeO 2 are at 397 and 435 nm, respectively.Subsequently coupling ZnO with CeO 2 and Ag, xAgCZ nanocomposites (x 1,2,3,4) display considerably improved absorption to longer wavelengths compared to the original ZnO and CeO 2 , which is possibly attributed to the coinfluence of Ag and CeO 2 .In specific, the sample with 3 mol of Ag (3AgCZ) displays notable absorption capability in visible radiation compared to the other three samples.In addition, the wide absorption band of the synthesized 3AgCZ composites in the visible light part is attributed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption of Ag species.This SPR effect of Ag NPs can additionally promote light absorption and photogenerated transporter separation, which are valuable for the photocatalytic reactions. 44,69,70However, it can be observed that an additional increase in Ag over 3 mol results in a decline in the light absorption and photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity.The cause for this observation is attributed to the \"shielding effect\" in which the surplus Ag somewhat shields the light absorption of CeO 2 and ZnO. 717273 Commonly, the band gaps for ZnO and CeO 2 can be estimated through the Kubelka-Munk function. 74,75From Figure 5b, the band gaps of ZnO and CeO 2 are calculated to be 3.26 and 3.15 eV, respectively.The EVB and ECB of two semiconductors were calculated via eqs 3 and 4, respectively, and are represented in Table S4. where ECB is the edge potential of CB, EVB is the edge potential of VB, is the electronegativity of the semiconductor, Eef is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (about 4.5 eV), and Eg is the semiconductor band gap energy.The values are 5.56 and 5.79 for ZnO and CeO 2 , respectively. 76hese results suggest that the 3AgCZ composite could extend the absorption slope to the visible light section, enhancing the harvesting of the solar spectrum, which is relatively valuable to boost the photocatalytic quality.The band gaps for the heterostructures with different concentrations of Ag were calculated for the samples 1AgCZ, 2AgCZ, AgCZ, and AgCZ and were found to be 3.17, 3.12, 2.91, and 3.02 eV, respectively (Figure S3). Figure 6 shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of ZnO, CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ nanocomposites at room temperature with an excitement of 325 nm light radiation.Numerous peaks are detected for pure CeO 2 in the UV, visible, and NIR regions.The UV region peak should be ascribed to the radiative annihilation of excitons.The visible peak is produced by the radiative recombination of a photogenerated hole with an electron occupying the oxygen vacancy. 77The red peak maybe due to some defects and the morphology.In comparison to pure ZnO and CeO 2 , the 3AgCZ nanocomposite has reduced PL intensity, which implies that the great charge division and diffusion rate of photoexcited e -and h professionally applied due to the existence of Ag, which acts as a charge mediator between ZnO and CeO 2 composites.Thus, the constructed 3AgCZ can work as an additional subsequent in prominent boosted photocatalysis.The PL quenching for 3AgCZ indicates the improved charge transfer and separation, which are essential for the efficient photocatalytic activity.Thus, it can be established that the PL spectra results are in agreement with photocatalytic reduction (PCR) data.Therefore, the effective breakup of photoinduced e -and h creates huge impacts to enriching photocatalytic performance of semiconductors. The photocatalytic reduction performance for the as-grown samples was studied upon UV visible light irradiation.Figure 7a,b demonstrates the photocatalytic CO and CH 4 formation rate for the pure ZnO, pure CeO 2 , and AgCZ nanocomposites under the same conditions.The pure ZnO shows the lowest photocatalytic performance owing to the high recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.Nevertheless, the photocatalytic CO and CH 4 formation percentage for pure CeO 2 can be spontaneously understood from Figure 7a,b and Tables S5 andS6 by which the photocatalytic performance is more away from the standard.In contrast, 3DF Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 nanocomposites (1AgCZ, 2AgCZ, 3AgCZ, and 4AgCZ) display higher performance for the CO and CH 4 formation than pure ZnO and pure CeO 2 independently.With the rise in Ag content, the CO and CH 4 formation rate increases steadily, and 3AgCZ with 3 mol Ag concentration shows a considerably advanced CO production rate of 377.52 mol g -1 and CH 4 production rates of 20.12 mol g -1 with light irradiation for 5 h.Moreover, CO 2 to CO selectivity reaches up to 95 using a 3AgCZ photocatalyst.In comparison with the earlier studies on ZnO and CeO 2 grounded photocatalysts (Table S6), 3AgCZ displays the highest photocatalytic selectivity in the reduction of CO 2 to CO. Conversely, it can be mentioned that a further increase in Ag concentration over 3 mol results in a decline in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity.The decline in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 can be attributed to the decline in the light absorption due to the \"shielding effect\" in which the surplus Ag somewhat shields the light absorption of CeO 2 and ZnO. 6465566 In addition, 3D Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanoflowers exhibit enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance compared to Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanoparticles, indicating the major role played by the 3D morphology (see the Supporting Information Figure S4).In order to confirm that the reaction is certainly caused by a photocatalytic method, a chain of control tests with diverse reaction settings have been performed.For instance, the elimination of light supply or catalysts originates from the absence of product detection, advising that the reaction is photoinduced.The photostability of catalysts is a significant parameter for industrial applications.To demonstrate the photostability of 3AgCZ, the authors performed 5 cycles of tests under the identical conditions.As specified in Figure 7c, the CO and CH 4 formation rates of 3AgCZ remains nearly unaffected after five cycles.Depending on the PXRD examination of the operated sample (Figure 7d), after the photocatalytic reaction, the crystal assembly of the photocatalyst has not been altered, representing the extraordinary photostability of the 3AgCZ nanocomposite.Moreover, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 3AgCZ at 420 nm is calculated to be 4.47.A full comparison with the AQE value for other recent photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is represented in Table S8. The interaction of CO 2 molecules with the fabricated samples has been investigated by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption (CO 2 -TPD) characterization.Figure 8a illustrates the CO 2 -TPD curves for ZnO, CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ nanocomposites.The computed quantity of CO 2 desorbed from these curves is presented in Table S7.The signal peaks of pure ZnO for CO 2 desorption are tiny, representing that the interaction between CO 2 and ZnO is feeble.Meanwhile, it can be noticed that CeO 2 shows elevated CO 2 adsorption capacity (0.41 mmol/g) than ZnO (0.16 mmol/g), which is signifying to the powerful physical adsorption.However, compared to those of ZnO and CeO 2 catalysts, the strengths of CO 2 desorption curves over the 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanocomposite catalyst are considerably higher (0.59 mmol/g), suggesting the construction of stronger CO 2 adsorption active sites.These results indicate that the introduction of CeO 2 and Ag can expand the CO 2 chemisorption of the 3AgCZ nanocomposite, which is valuable to the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Efforts to examine the charge separation and transport effectiveness, photocurrent response, and EIS experiments have been employed.Figure 8b shows the photocurrent results of obtained samples upon irradiation of UV-vis light on/off cycle manners.Apparently, 3AgCZ offers the highest photocurrent strength than the CeO 2 and ZnO samples, which signifies that it has the greatest charge transport efficacy and lowest recombination rate.As revealed in Figure 8c, the Nyquist diagram of 3AgCZ owns the minimum semicircle among these three samples, indicating the smallest charge-transfer resistance among the 3AgCZ nanocomposite and electrolyte.The outcome of the above studies confirms that the 3AgCZ composite has outstanding photoelectrochemical properties, and these additional advantages are utilized for the photoreduction technology. AG-CEO 2 -ZNO The PL, photocurrent, and electrochemical impedance measurements approve the boosted charge separation and transfer in the 3AgCZ composite; however, these results are not sufficient to demonstrate the Z-scheme mechanism -among all assynthesized samples, which persuasively states that the 3AgCZ composite could supply much active species of O 2 -radicals than original constituents under same investigational conditions.Consequently, OH and O 2 -are formed under mimicked sunlight. 26,41,787980 According to the above discussion and the calculated band edge position of ZnO and CeO 2 , a probable Z-scheme mechanism for the photoreduction of CO 2 on the 3AgCZ nanocomposites has been proposed as shown in Figure 10.Initially, metallic Ag absorbs a significant quantity of energy from the visible light due to its SPR effect, which is helpful for boosting visible light absorption.Next, metallic Ag acts as an electron-conduction bridge, which performs a vital part in the formation of the Z-scheme charge transmission mechanism.Consequently, when the 3DF Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 nanocomposite is illuminated by simulated sunlight, both ZnO and CeO 2 are simply agitated and create the photogenerated electrons and holes in the CB and VB, correspondingly.Then, the photoinduced electrons in the CB of ZnO would simply transmit into metallic Ag via the Schottky barrier and recombine with the photogenerated holes in the VB of CeO 2 .The movement of charge transporters causes electrons gathering in the CB of CeO 2 (-0.515 eV), and the holes were maintained in the VB of ZnO (2.92 eV).Consequently, the photoexcited electrons left and gathered in the CB of CeO 2 have adequate energy to reduce CO 2 to CO and CH 4 .Concurrently, the holes remaining in the VB of ZnO have sufficient energy to oxidize the H 2 O to form O 2 H .Thus, Ag NPs may have dual roles in a plasmon-based Z-scheme arrangement.Primality it is to absorb visible light owing to plasmon effect, which is the source of the hot charges for CO 2 photoreduction.The further one is the transference of electrons as a solid electron mediator.As far as we know, exploring both of the roles of Ag in one structure is seldom stated.Thanks to the dual-functional Ag NPs, both the hot electron and hot holes from SPR influence might be efficiently applied in a solid Z-scheme system."}, {"llm generation": "3DF Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 nanocomposites", "source": "In contrast, 3DF Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 nanocomposites (1AgCZ, 2AgCZ, 3AgCZ, and 4AgCZ) display higher performance for the CO and CH 4 formation than pure ZnO and pure CeO 2 independently.", "context": "3.1.Morphology and Crystal Structure Characterization.The total fabrication procedure of 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanocomposites is schematically shown in Figure 1.Briefly, 3DF ZnO/CeO 2 has been synthesized through a hydrothermal reaction. 52,53Afterward, Ag NPs are deposited onto 3DF ZnO/CeO 2 by the photodeposition process by which the ternary 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO composite is obtained.The morphology and nanostructure of the samples prepared were examined through SEM and TEM techniques.The SEM images of the ZnO, CeO 2 , ZnO/CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ composite are revealed in Figure 2a-d.The pristine ZnO displays a 3DF flower-like morphology with smooth surfaces grown upon the aforementioned synthetic conditions consisting of many nanocones, while the as-synthesized CeO 2 consists of nanoneedles.In addition, the 3AgCZ nanostructure inherits the flower-like structure of the ZnO flower but becomes rough with a larger diameter (102 nm).As revealed in Figure 2d, the modified Ag NPs with an average particle size of nearby 60 nm are deposited on the surface of 3DF ZnO/CeO 2 .Additional examinations by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) specify that the noticeable lattice fringes with d-spacings of 0.26, 0.31, and 0.23 nm are ascribed to the ZnO (100), CeO 2 (111), and Ag (111) facets, respectively (Figure 2f). 47,54,55Furthermore, all elements in the Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO NFs are spotted from energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, and no other elements can be detected as exposed in Figure S1 and Table S1. The crystal structure and phase purity of the composites 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO and pure CeO 2 and ZnO were examined by PXRD.The corresponding X-ray diffraction patterns are shown in Figure 3a-f.As revealed in Figure 3a, ZnO shows diffraction peaks at 2 31.74,34.44, and 36.23, which are attributed respectively to the (100), (002), and (101) lattice planes of pure ZnO with a hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS No. 36-1451).In Figure 3b, the CeO 2 XRD spectrum revealed peaks at 28.4, 33.9, and 37.3equivalent to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the cubic phase of the CeO 2 phase, respectively (JCPDS no.43-1002). 41The PXRD patterns of all AgCZ have all the distinguishing peaks of ZnO, CeO 2 , and Ag, indicating that the AgCZ nanocomposite has been successfully fabricated, and there are no other unwanted phases present in the final products.PXRD patterns of AgCZ in Figure 3c-f show that the peak of Ag matching to (111) lattice planes only appears when the added quantity is over 2.0.The crystallite size was calculated from the Debye-Scherrer equation as follows: 565758 D 0.9 /( cos ) (2) where 1.5414A (the wavelength of Cu K radiation), denotes the full width at half-maximum, and represents the diffraction angle.The crystallite size was noticed to be 56.32,72.93, and 91.57nm for CeO 2 , ZnO, and Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 (sample 3AgZC), respectively.The d-spacings were determined to be 0.32 and 0.27 nm for the (111) plane of CeO 2 and (002) plane of ZnO, respectively. 59,60The evaluated d-spacing is well harmonized with that computed by HRTEM (Figure 2f). To examine the surface compositions and states of ZnO, CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ, XPS analysis was carried out.The XPS survey spectrum of ZnO shows the peaks ascribed to Zn and O elements, while that of CeO 2 expresses the peaks of the elements Ce and O (Figure 4a).As predictable, the XPS survey spectrum of 3AgZC nanocomposites show the co-presence of the peaks ascribed to Zn 2p, Ce 3d, O 1s, and Ag 3d elements, which is in definitive agreement with the energy dispersive Xray (EDX) spectroscopy result as described earlier.To determine the charge transport pathway, high resolution XPS spectra were recorded using in situ-illuminated XPS.In Figure 4b, the binding energies of Ag 3d at 368.47 and 374.33 eV are ascribed to the Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 photoelectron, respectively, indicating the existence of silver in the (1) oxidation state. 61The additional two peaks of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 at 370.77 and 375.25 eV, respectively, affirm the presence of silver in the Ag (0) state. 62,63Therefore, the metallic Ag 0 and ionic Ag species coexist in the 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanocomposite, and the presence of ionic Ag species are ascribed to the electron-giving Ag NPs when interacting with the surrounding CeO 2 and ZnO nanostructures.Depending on the robust metal Ag-assisted CeO 2 and ZnO, interaction photon-generated carriers undergo vectorial transmission in the triple system via Ag NPs as a conducting medium.The Zn 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of ZnO are detected at 1020.81 and 1043.91 eV, respectively (Figure 4d).Subsequently, during the coupling of ZnO with CeO 2 , both Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 peaks display affirmative shifts compared to ZnO. 64,65 These positive shifts can be ascribed to the transmission of electrons from ZnO to CeO 2 .The valid immigration path of ZnO electrons can be established from the high-resolution in situilluminated XPS investigation of CeO 2 (Figure 4c).The a and b are ascribed to the spin splitting orbits of 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 for the Ce ion. 66Therefore, the peaks owing to Ce 4 are specified as a, a, b, b, and b, while those of Ce 3 are referred as a and b (see the Table S2 in the Supporting Information).Due to surface defects and the synergistic interaction between ZnO and CeO 2 , some Ce 3 sites were found, which led to the construction of amorphous Ce 2 O 3 .As Ce 2 O 3 is amorphous, it cannot be distinguished by XRD, which is

electrons of ZnO transmit to CeO 2 as established by the negative shift in the locations of Ce 3d peaks. 40,41o explore the impact of Ag concentration on the binding Energy, Ce 3d XPS and Zn 2p XPS were recorded and are presented in Figure S2.Tables S2 andS3 displays that the binding energy variation of both Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 display affirmative shifts that increase with increasing Ag concentration, while both Ce 3d 5/2 and Ce 3d 3/2 peaks display negative shifts. 3.2.Optical Properties.It is clearly recognized that the optical absorption merit of the photocatalyst is a substantial

Figure 6 shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of ZnO, CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ nanocomposites at room temperature with an excitement of 325 nm light radiation.Numerous peaks are detected for pure CeO 2 in the UV, visible, and NIR regions.The UV region peak should be ascribed to the radiative annihilation of excitons.The visible peak is produced by the radiative recombination of a photogenerated hole with an electron occupying the oxygen vacancy. 77The red peak maybe due to some defects and the morphology.In comparison to pure ZnO and CeO 2 , the 3AgCZ nanocomposite has reduced PL intensity, which implies that the great charge division and diffusion rate of photoexcited e -and h professionally applied due to the existence of Ag, which acts as a charge mediator between ZnO and CeO 2 composites.Thus, the constructed 3AgCZ can work as an additional subsequent in prominent boosted photocatalysis.The PL quenching for 3AgCZ indicates the improved charge transfer and separation, which are essential for the efficient photocatalytic activity.Thus, it can be established that the PL spectra results are in agreement with photocatalytic reduction (PCR) data.Therefore, the effective breakup of photoinduced e -and h creates huge impacts to enriching photocatalytic performance of semiconductors. The photocatalytic reduction performance for the as-grown samples was studied upon UV visible light irradiation.Figure 7a,b demonstrates the photocatalytic CO and CH 4 formation rate for the pure ZnO, pure CeO 2 , and AgCZ nanocomposites under the same conditions.The pure ZnO shows the lowest photocatalytic performance owing to the high recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.Nevertheless, the photocatalytic CO and CH 4 formation percentage for pure CeO 2 can be spontaneously understood from Figure 7a,b and Tables S5 andS6 by which the photocatalytic performance is more away from the standard.In contrast, 3DF Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 nanocomposites (1AgCZ, 2AgCZ, 3AgCZ, and 4AgCZ) display higher performance for the CO and CH 4 formation than pure ZnO and pure CeO 2 independently.With the rise in Ag content, the CO and CH 4 formation rate increases steadily, and 3AgCZ with 3 mol Ag concentration shows a considerably advanced CO production rate of 377.52 mol g -1 and CH 4 production rates of 20.12 mol g -1 with light irradiation for 5 h.Moreover, CO 2 to CO selectivity reaches up to 95 using a 3AgCZ photocatalyst.In comparison with the earlier studies on ZnO and CeO 2 grounded photocatalysts (Table S6), 3AgCZ displays the highest photocatalytic selectivity in the reduction of CO 2 to CO. Conversely, it can be mentioned that a further increase in Ag concentration over 3 mol results in a decline in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity.The decline in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 can be attributed to the decline in the light absorption due to the \"shielding effect\" in which the surplus Ag somewhat shields the light absorption of CeO 2 and ZnO. 6465566 In addition, 3D Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanoflowers exhibit enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance compared to Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanoparticles, indicating the major role played by the 3D morphology (see the Supporting Information Figure S4).In order to confirm that the reaction is certainly caused by a photocatalytic method, a chain of control tests with diverse reaction settings have been performed.For instance, the elimination of light supply or catalysts originates from the absence of product detection, advising that the reaction is photoinduced.The photostability of catalysts is a significant parameter for industrial applications.To demonstrate the photostability of 3AgCZ, the authors performed 5 cycles of tests under the identical conditions.As specified in Figure 7c, the CO and CH 4 formation rates of 3AgCZ remains nearly unaffected after five cycles.Depending on the PXRD examination of the operated sample (Figure 7d), after the photocatalytic reaction, the crystal assembly of the photocatalyst has not been altered, representing the extraordinary photostability of the 3AgCZ nanocomposite.Moreover, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 3AgCZ at 420 nm is calculated to be 4.47.A full comparison with the AQE value for other recent photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is represented in Table S8. The interaction of CO 2 molecules with the fabricated samples has been investigated by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption (CO 2 -TPD) characterization.Figure 8a illustrates the CO 2 -TPD curves for ZnO, CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ nanocomposites.The computed quantity of CO 2 desorbed from these curves is presented in Table S7.The signal peaks of pure ZnO for CO 2 desorption are tiny, representing that the interaction between CO 2 and ZnO is feeble.Meanwhile, it can be noticed that CeO 2 shows elevated CO 2 adsorption capacity (0.41 mmol/g) than ZnO (0.16 mmol/g), which is signifying to the powerful physical adsorption.However, compared to those of ZnO and CeO 2 catalysts, the strengths of CO 2 desorption curves over the 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanocomposite catalyst are considerably higher (0.59 mmol/g), suggesting the construction of stronger CO 2 adsorption active sites.These results indicate that the introduction of CeO 2 and Ag can expand the CO 2 chemisorption of the 3AgCZ nanocomposite, which is valuable to the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Efforts to examine the charge separation and transport effectiveness, photocurrent response, and EIS experiments have been employed.Figure 8b shows the photocurrent results of obtained samples upon irradiation of UV-vis light on/off cycle manners.Apparently, 3AgCZ offers the highest photocurrent strength than the CeO 2 and ZnO samples, which signifies that it has the greatest charge transport efficacy and lowest recombination rate.As revealed in Figure 8c, the Nyquist diagram of 3AgCZ owns the minimum semicircle among these three samples, indicating the smallest charge-transfer resistance among the 3AgCZ nanocomposite and electrolyte.The outcome of the above studies confirms that the 3AgCZ composite has outstanding photoelectrochemical properties, and these additional advantages are utilized for the photoreduction technology. AG-CEO 2 -ZNO The PL, photocurrent, and electrochemical impedance measurements approve the boosted charge separation and transfer in the 3AgCZ composite; however, these results are not sufficient to demonstrate the Z-scheme mechanism -among all assynthesized samples, which persuasively states that the 3AgCZ composite could supply much active species of O 2 -radicals than original constituents under same investigational conditions.Consequently, OH and O 2 -are formed under mimicked sunlight. 26,41,787980 According to the above discussion and the calculated band edge position of ZnO and CeO 2 , a probable Z-scheme mechanism for the photoreduction of CO 2 on the 3AgCZ nanocomposites has been proposed as shown in Figure 10.Initially, metallic Ag absorbs a significant quantity of energy from the visible light due to its SPR effect, which is helpful for boosting visible light absorption.Next, metallic Ag acts as an electron-conduction bridge, which performs a vital part in the formation of the Z-scheme charge transmission mechanism.Consequently, when the 3DF Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 nanocomposite is illuminated by simulated sunlight, both ZnO and CeO 2 are simply agitated and create the photogenerated electrons and holes in the CB and VB, correspondingly.Then, the photoinduced electrons in the CB of ZnO would simply transmit into metallic Ag via the Schottky barrier and recombine with the photogenerated holes in the VB of CeO 2 .The movement of charge transporters causes electrons gathering in the CB of CeO 2 (-0.515 eV), and the holes were maintained in the VB of ZnO (2.92 eV).Consequently, the photoexcited electrons left and gathered in the CB of CeO 2 have adequate energy to reduce CO 2 to CO and CH 4 .Concurrently, the holes remaining in the VB of ZnO have sufficient energy to oxidize the H 2 O to form O 2 H .Thus, Ag NPs may have dual roles in a plasmon-based Z-scheme arrangement.Primality it is to absorb visible light owing to plasmon effect, which is the source of the hot charges for CO 2 photoreduction.The further one is the transference of electrons as a solid electron mediator.As far as we know, exploring both of the roles of Ag in one structure is seldom stated.Thanks to the dual-functional Ag NPs, both the hot electron and hot holes from SPR influence might be efficiently applied in a solid Z-scheme system."}, {"llm generation": "3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO", "source": "In conclusion, a plasmonic photocatalyst (3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO) has been reasonably fabricated through a low-cost hydrothermal-photodeposition process.", "context": "In conclusion, a plasmonic photocatalyst (3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO) has been reasonably fabricated through a low-cost hydrothermal-photodeposition process.By means of manipulating the multifunctional constituent (Ag), the adjusted 3AgCZ photocatalyst displays considerably higher activity than pure ZnO, CeO 2 , binary systems, and xAgCZ composites (x 1,2,4) for CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 .The optimum CO and CH 4 evolution rates on 3AgCZ were 377.75 and 20.12 mol g -1 under mimicked sunlight radiation.A possible mechanism for 3AgCZ plasmonic photocatalyst reduction of CO 2 has been also proposed.This improved photocatalytic performance is attributed to the subsequent synergistic effects: (i) the prolonged absorption in the visible light region; (ii) SPR effect; and (iii) Z-scheme system, which boosts the separation of photogenerated transporters, employs the influential electrons and holes, and optimize the redox potential.The present study offers new inspirations for scheming other plasmonic multicomponent semiconductorbased photocatalytic CO 2 reduction systems.

Electrochemical Measurement.The photocurrent densities of the fabricated samples were quantified using a CHI 608e electrochemical analyzer.Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass spincoated with the investigated sample was utilized as the working electrode.The Ag/AgCl electrode and platinum wire are utilized as reference and counter electrodes, respectively.The three electrodes were deep in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 in the electrolyte through the photocurrent determined.Before the measurements, the electrolyte was purged with Ar for 30 min.The working electrode was irradiated with 100 mW by means of a 250 W xenon lamp and the photocurrent was determined at 0 V throughout the on-off cycle.The working electrode was fabricated as follows.Disperse 5 mg sample in 2 mL isopropanol.Nafion solution (Sigma Aldrich, 4 mL, 5 wt ) was added into water, and the solution was sonicated for 20 min.The solution prepared was then spin-coated on a clean FTO glass (1 cm 2 cm).Then, the electrode was dehydrated in air and then sintered at 400 C for 40 min to improve adhesion.Electrochemical impednce was measured using the same setup (open circuit, frequency: 1 to 10 5 Hz, AC voltage: 5 mV amplitude) (open circuit, frequency: 1 to 105 Hz, AC voltage: 5 mV amplitude).2.6.TPD-CO 2 Analysis.A MicrotracBEL analyzer (BELCAT II) was utilized to record temperature-programmed desorption (TPD).Around 100 mg of the tested sample was pretreated in N 2 flow at 200 C for 1 h.The adsorption of CO 2 was carried out at room temperature upon the flow of a combination of 10 CO 2 and 95 H 2 at a flow rate of 40 mL/ min for 60 min.The physically adsorbed CO 2 was discarded via purifying the sample with He (40 mL/min) for 2 h.The sample was then heated up to 600 C at a heating rate of 10 C min -1 upon a 40 mL/min flow of He.The CO 2 concentration was observed by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) indicator.

The crystal structure and phase purity of the composites 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO and pure CeO 2 and ZnO were examined by PXRD.The corresponding X-ray diffraction patterns are shown in Figure 3a-f.As revealed in Figure 3a, ZnO shows diffraction peaks at 2 31.74,34.44, and 36.23, which are attributed respectively to the (100), (002), and (101) lattice planes of pure ZnO with a hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS No. 36-1451).In Figure 3b, the CeO 2 XRD spectrum revealed peaks at 28.4, 33.9, and 37.3equivalent to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the cubic phase of the CeO 2 phase, respectively (JCPDS no.43-1002). 41The PXRD patterns of all AgCZ have all the distinguishing peaks of ZnO, CeO 2 , and Ag, indicating that the AgCZ nanocomposite has been successfully fabricated, and there are no other unwanted phases present in the final products.PXRD patterns of AgCZ in Figure 3c-f show that the peak of Ag matching to (111) lattice planes only appears when the added quantity is over 2.0.The crystallite size was calculated from the Debye-Scherrer equation as follows: 565758 D 0.9 /( cos ) (2) where 1.5414A (the wavelength of Cu K radiation), denotes the full width at half-maximum, and represents the diffraction angle.The crystallite size was noticed to be 56.32,72.93, and 91.57nm for CeO 2 , ZnO, and Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 (sample 3AgZC), respectively.The d-spacings were determined to be 0.32 and 0.27 nm for the (111) plane of CeO 2 and (002) plane of ZnO, respectively. 59,60The evaluated d-spacing is well harmonized with that computed by HRTEM (Figure 2f). To examine the surface compositions and states of ZnO, CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ, XPS analysis was carried out.The XPS survey spectrum of ZnO shows the peaks ascribed to Zn and O elements, while that of CeO 2 expresses the peaks of the elements Ce and O (Figure 4a).As predictable, the XPS survey spectrum of 3AgZC nanocomposites show the co-presence of the peaks ascribed to Zn 2p, Ce 3d, O 1s, and Ag 3d elements, which is in definitive agreement with the energy dispersive Xray (EDX) spectroscopy result as described earlier.To determine the charge transport pathway, high resolution XPS spectra were recorded using in situ-illuminated XPS.In Figure 4b, the binding energies of Ag 3d at 368.47 and 374.33 eV are ascribed to the Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 photoelectron, respectively, indicating the existence of silver in the (1) oxidation state. 61The additional two peaks of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 at 370.77 and 375.25 eV, respectively, affirm the presence of silver in the Ag (0) state. 62,63Therefore, the metallic Ag 0 and ionic Ag species coexist in the 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanocomposite, and the presence of ionic Ag species are ascribed to the electron-giving Ag NPs when interacting with the surrounding CeO 2 and ZnO nanostructures.Depending on the robust metal Ag-assisted CeO 2 and ZnO, interaction photon-generated carriers undergo vectorial transmission in the triple system via Ag NPs as a conducting medium.The Zn 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of ZnO are detected at 1020.81 and 1043.91 eV, respectively (Figure 4d).Subsequently, during the coupling of ZnO with CeO 2 , both Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 peaks display affirmative shifts compared to ZnO. 64,65 These positive shifts can be ascribed to the transmission of electrons from ZnO to CeO 2 .The valid immigration path of ZnO electrons can be established from the high-resolution in situilluminated XPS investigation of CeO 2 (Figure 4c).The a and b are ascribed to the spin splitting orbits of 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 for the Ce ion. 66Therefore, the peaks owing to Ce 4 are specified as a, a, b, b, and b, while those of Ce 3 are referred as a and b (see the Table S2 in the Supporting Information).Due to surface defects and the synergistic interaction between ZnO and CeO 2 , some Ce 3 sites were found, which led to the construction of amorphous Ce 2 O 3 .As Ce 2 O 3 is amorphous, it cannot be distinguished by XRD, which is harmonious with the XRD results of previous reports. 67,68Therefore, it can be observed that mainly Ce ions in CeO 2 and 3AgCZ are in Ce 4 chemical states.Significantly, coupling the ZnO with CeO 2 in 3AgZC, both Ce 3d 5/2 and Ce 3d 3/2 peaks display negative shifts compared to those of CeO 2 .Consequently, after coupling ZnO with CeO 2 , the charge transporter immigration path vagaries and the electrons of ZnO transmit to CeO 2 as established by the negative shift in the locations of Ce 3d peaks. 40,41o explore the impact of Ag concentration on the binding Energy, Ce 3d XPS and Zn 2p XPS were recorded and are presented in Figure S2.Tables S2 andS3 displays that the binding energy variation of both Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 display affirmative shifts that increase with increasing Ag concentration, while both Ce 3d 5/2 and Ce 3d 3/2 peaks display negative shifts. 3.2.Optical Properties.It is clearly recognized that the optical absorption merit of the photocatalyst is a substantial aspect in defining the photocatalytic activity because the establishment of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and reactive types upon light radiation is fundamental for the photocatalytic reaction.The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the fabricated samples are displayed in Figure5a.The band edges of pure ZnO and CeO 2 are at 397 and 435 nm, respectively.Subsequently coupling ZnO with CeO 2 and Ag, xAgCZ nanocomposites (x 1,2,3,4) display considerably improved absorption to longer wavelengths compared to the original ZnO and CeO 2 , which is possibly attributed to the coinfluence of Ag and CeO 2 .In specific, the sample with 3 mol of Ag (3AgCZ) displays notable absorption capability in visible radiation compared to the other three samples.In addition, the wide absorption band of the synthesized 3AgCZ composites in the visible light part is attributed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption of Ag species.This SPR effect of Ag NPs can additionally promote light absorption and photogenerated transporter separation, which are valuable for the photocatalytic reactions. 44,69,70However, it can be observed that an additional increase in Ag over 3 mol results in a decline in the light absorption and photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity.The cause for this observation is attributed to the \"shielding effect\" in which the surplus Ag somewhat shields the light absorption of CeO 2 and ZnO. 717273 Commonly, the band gaps for ZnO and CeO 2 can be estimated through the Kubelka-Munk function. 74,75From Figure 5b, the band gaps of ZnO and CeO 2 are calculated to be 3.26 and 3.15 eV, respectively.The EVB and ECB of two semiconductors were calculated via eqs 3 and 4, respectively, and are represented in Table S4. where ECB is the edge potential of CB, EVB is the edge potential of VB, is the electronegativity of the semiconductor, Eef is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (about 4.5 eV), and Eg is the semiconductor band gap energy.The values are 5.56 and 5.79 for ZnO and CeO 2 , respectively. 76hese results suggest that the 3AgCZ composite could extend the absorption slope to the visible light section, enhancing the harvesting of the solar spectrum, which is relatively valuable to boost the photocatalytic quality.The band gaps for the heterostructures with different concentrations of Ag were calculated for the samples 1AgCZ, 2AgCZ, AgCZ, and AgCZ and were found to be 3.17, 3.12, 2.91, and 3.02 eV, respectively (Figure S3). Figure 6 shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of ZnO, CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ nanocomposites at room temperature with an excitement of 325 nm light radiation.Numerous peaks are detected for pure CeO 2 in the UV, visible, and NIR regions.The UV region peak should be ascribed to the radiative annihilation of excitons.The visible peak is produced by the radiative recombination of a photogenerated hole with an electron occupying the oxygen vacancy. 77The red peak maybe due to some defects and the morphology.In comparison to pure ZnO and CeO 2 , the 3AgCZ nanocomposite has reduced PL intensity, which implies that the great charge division and diffusion rate of photoexcited e -and h professionally applied due to the existence of Ag, which acts as a charge mediator between ZnO and CeO 2 composites.Thus, the constructed 3AgCZ can work as an additional subsequent in prominent boosted photocatalysis.The PL quenching for 3AgCZ indicates the improved charge transfer and separation, which are essential for the efficient photocatalytic activity.Thus, it can be established that the PL spectra results are in agreement with photocatalytic reduction (PCR) data.Therefore, the effective breakup of photoinduced e -and h creates huge impacts to enriching photocatalytic performance of semiconductors. The photocatalytic reduction performance for the as-grown samples was studied upon UV visible light irradiation.Figure 7a,b demonstrates the photocatalytic CO and CH 4 formation rate for the pure ZnO, pure CeO 2 , and AgCZ nanocomposites under the same conditions.The pure ZnO shows the lowest photocatalytic performance owing to the high recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.Nevertheless, the photocatalytic CO and CH 4 formation percentage for pure CeO 2 can be spontaneously understood from Figure 7a,b and Tables S5 andS6 by which the photocatalytic performance is more away from the standard.In contrast, 3DF Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 nanocomposites (1AgCZ, 2AgCZ, 3AgCZ, and 4AgCZ) display higher performance for the CO and CH 4 formation than pure ZnO and pure CeO 2 independently.With the rise in Ag content, the CO and CH 4 formation rate increases steadily, and 3AgCZ with 3 mol Ag concentration shows a considerably advanced CO production rate of 377.52 mol g -1 and CH 4 production rates of 20.12 mol g -1 with light irradiation for 5 h.Moreover, CO 2 to CO selectivity reaches up to 95 using a 3AgCZ photocatalyst.In comparison with the earlier studies on ZnO and CeO 2 grounded photocatalysts (Table S6), 3AgCZ displays the highest photocatalytic selectivity in the reduction of CO 2 to CO. Conversely, it can be mentioned that a further increase in Ag concentration over 3 mol results in a decline in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity.The decline in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 can be attributed to the decline in the light absorption due to the \"shielding effect\" in which the surplus Ag somewhat shields the light absorption of CeO 2 and ZnO. 6465566 In addition, 3D Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanoflowers exhibit enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance compared to Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanoparticles, indicating the major role played by the 3D morphology (see the Supporting Information Figure S4).In order to confirm that the reaction is certainly caused by a photocatalytic method, a chain of control tests with diverse reaction settings have been performed.For instance, the elimination of light supply or catalysts originates from the absence of product detection, advising that the reaction is photoinduced.The photostability of catalysts is a significant parameter for industrial applications.To demonstrate the photostability of 3AgCZ, the authors performed 5 cycles of tests under the identical conditions.As specified in Figure 7c, the CO and CH 4 formation rates of 3AgCZ remains nearly unaffected after five cycles.Depending on the PXRD examination of the operated sample (Figure 7d), after the photocatalytic reaction, the crystal assembly of the photocatalyst has not been altered, representing the extraordinary photostability of the 3AgCZ nanocomposite.Moreover, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 3AgCZ at 420 nm is calculated to be 4.47.A full comparison with the AQE value for other recent photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is represented in Table S8. The interaction of CO 2 molecules with the fabricated samples has been investigated by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption (CO 2 -TPD) characterization.Figure 8a illustrates the CO 2 -TPD curves for ZnO, CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ nanocomposites.The computed quantity of CO 2 desorbed from these curves is presented in Table S7.The signal peaks of pure ZnO for CO 2 desorption are tiny, representing that the interaction between CO 2 and ZnO is feeble.Meanwhile, it can be noticed that CeO 2 shows elevated CO 2 adsorption capacity (0.41 mmol/g) than ZnO (0.16 mmol/g), which is signifying to the powerful physical adsorption.However, compared to those of ZnO and CeO 2 catalysts, the strengths of CO 2 desorption curves over the 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanocomposite catalyst are considerably higher (0.59 mmol/g), suggesting the construction of stronger CO 2 adsorption active sites.These results indicate that the introduction of CeO 2 and Ag can expand the CO 2 chemisorption of the 3AgCZ nanocomposite, which is valuable to the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Efforts to examine the charge separation and transport effectiveness, photocurrent response, and EIS experiments have been employed.Figure 8b shows the photocurrent results of obtained samples upon irradiation of UV-vis light on/off cycle manners.Apparently, 3AgCZ offers the highest photocurrent strength than the CeO 2 and ZnO samples, which signifies that it has the greatest charge transport efficacy and lowest recombination rate.As revealed in Figure 8c, the Nyquist diagram of 3AgCZ owns the minimum semicircle among these three samples, indicating the smallest charge-transfer resistance among the 3AgCZ nanocomposite and electrolyte.The outcome of the above studies confirms that the 3AgCZ composite has outstanding photoelectrochemical properties, and these additional advantages are utilized for the photoreduction technology. AG-CEO 2 -ZNO The PL, photocurrent, and electrochemical impedance measurements approve the boosted charge separation and transfer in the 3AgCZ composite; however, these results are not sufficient to demonstrate the Z-scheme mechanism -among all assynthesized samples, which persuasively states that the 3AgCZ composite could supply much active species of O 2 -radicals than original constituents under same investigational conditions.Consequently, OH and O 2 -are formed under mimicked sunlight. 26,41,787980 According to the above discussion and the calculated band edge position of ZnO and CeO 2 , a probable Z-scheme mechanism for the photoreduction of CO 2 on the 3AgCZ nanocomposites has been proposed as shown in Figure 10.Initially, metallic Ag absorbs a significant quantity of energy from the visible light due to its SPR effect, which is helpful for boosting visible light absorption.Next, metallic Ag acts as an electron-conduction bridge, which performs a vital part in the formation of the Z-scheme charge transmission mechanism.Consequently, when the 3DF Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 nanocomposite is illuminated by simulated sunlight, both ZnO and CeO 2 are simply agitated and create the photogenerated electrons and holes in the CB and VB, correspondingly.Then, the photoinduced electrons in the CB of ZnO would simply transmit into metallic Ag via the Schottky barrier and recombine with the photogenerated holes in the VB of CeO 2 .The movement of charge transporters causes electrons gathering in the CB of CeO 2 (-0.515 eV), and the holes were maintained in the VB of ZnO (2.92 eV).Consequently, the photoexcited electrons left and gathered in the CB of CeO 2 have adequate energy to reduce CO 2 to CO and CH 4 .Concurrently, the holes remaining in the VB of ZnO have sufficient energy to oxidize the H 2 O to form O 2 H .Thus, Ag NPs may have dual roles in a plasmon-based Z-scheme arrangement.Primality it is to absorb visible light owing to plasmon effect, which is the source of the hot charges for CO 2 photoreduction.The further one is the transference of electrons as a solid electron mediator.As far as we know, exploring both of the roles of Ag in one structure is seldom stated.Thanks to the dual-functional Ag NPs, both the hot electron and hot holes from SPR influence might be efficiently applied in a solid Z-scheme system."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic (325 nm)", "source": "Figure 6 shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of ZnO, CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ nanocomposites at room temperature with an excitement of 325 nm light radiation.", "context": "3.1.Morphology and Crystal Structure Characterization.The total fabrication procedure of 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanocomposites is schematically shown in Figure 1.Briefly, 3DF ZnO/CeO 2 has been synthesized through a hydrothermal reaction. 52,53Afterward, Ag NPs are deposited onto 3DF ZnO/CeO 2 by the photodeposition process by which the ternary 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO composite is obtained.The morphology and nanostructure of the samples prepared were examined through SEM and TEM techniques.The SEM images of the ZnO, CeO 2 , ZnO/CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ composite are revealed in Figure 2a-d.The pristine ZnO displays a 3DF flower-like morphology with smooth surfaces grown upon the aforementioned synthetic conditions consisting of many nanocones, while the as-synthesized CeO 2 consists of nanoneedles.In addition, the 3AgCZ nanostructure inherits the flower-like structure of the ZnO flower but becomes rough with a larger diameter (102 nm).As revealed in Figure 2d, the modified Ag NPs with an average particle size of nearby 60 nm are deposited on the surface of 3DF ZnO/CeO 2 .Additional examinations by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) specify that the noticeable lattice fringes with d-spacings of 0.26, 0.31, and 0.23 nm are ascribed to the ZnO (100), CeO 2 (111), and Ag (111) facets, respectively (Figure 2f). 47,54,55Furthermore, all elements in the Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO NFs are spotted from energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, and no other elements can be detected as exposed in Figure S1 and Table S1. The crystal structure and phase purity of the composites 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO and pure CeO 2 and ZnO were examined by PXRD.The corresponding X-ray diffraction patterns are shown in Figure 3a-f.As revealed in Figure 3a, ZnO shows diffraction peaks at 2 31.74,34.44, and 36.23, which are attributed respectively to the (100), (002), and (101) lattice planes of pure ZnO with a hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS No. 36-1451).In Figure 3b, the CeO 2 XRD spectrum revealed peaks at 28.4, 33.9, and 37.3equivalent to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the cubic phase of the CeO 2 phase, respectively (JCPDS no.43-1002). 41The PXRD patterns of all AgCZ have all the distinguishing peaks of ZnO, CeO 2 , and Ag, indicating that the AgCZ nanocomposite has been successfully fabricated, and there are no other unwanted phases present in the final products.PXRD patterns of AgCZ in Figure 3c-f show that the peak of Ag matching to (111) lattice planes only appears when the added quantity is over 2.0.The crystallite size was calculated from the Debye-Scherrer equation as follows: 565758 D 0.9 /( cos ) (2) where 1.5414A (the wavelength of Cu K radiation), denotes the full width at half-maximum, and represents the diffraction angle.The crystallite size was noticed to be 56.32,72.93, and 91.57nm for CeO 2 , ZnO, and Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 (sample 3AgZC), respectively.The d-spacings were determined to be 0.32 and 0.27 nm for the (111) plane of CeO 2 and (002) plane of ZnO, respectively. 59,60The evaluated d-spacing is well harmonized with that computed by HRTEM (Figure 2f). To examine the surface compositions and states of ZnO, CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ, XPS analysis was carried out.The XPS survey spectrum of ZnO shows the peaks ascribed to Zn and O elements, while that of CeO 2 expresses the peaks of the elements Ce and O (Figure 4a).As predictable, the XPS survey spectrum of 3AgZC nanocomposites show the co-presence of the peaks ascribed to Zn 2p, Ce 3d, O 1s, and Ag 3d elements, which is in definitive agreement with the energy dispersive Xray (EDX) spectroscopy result as described earlier.To determine the charge transport pathway, high resolution XPS spectra were recorded using in situ-illuminated XPS.In Figure 4b, the binding energies of Ag 3d at 368.47 and 374.33 eV are ascribed to the Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 photoelectron, respectively, indicating the existence of silver in the (1) oxidation state. 61The additional two peaks of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 at 370.77 and 375.25 eV, respectively, affirm the presence of silver in the Ag (0) state. 62,63Therefore, the metallic Ag 0 and ionic Ag species coexist in the 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanocomposite, and the presence of ionic Ag species are ascribed to the electron-giving Ag NPs when interacting with the surrounding CeO 2 and ZnO nanostructures.Depending on the robust metal Ag-assisted CeO 2 and ZnO, interaction photon-generated carriers undergo vectorial transmission in the triple system via Ag NPs as a conducting medium.The Zn 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of ZnO are detected at 1020.81 and 1043.91 eV, respectively (Figure 4d).Subsequently, during the coupling of ZnO with CeO 2 , both Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 peaks display affirmative shifts compared to ZnO. 64,65 These positive shifts can be ascribed to the transmission of electrons from ZnO to CeO 2 .The valid immigration path of ZnO electrons can be established from the high-resolution in situilluminated XPS investigation of CeO 2 (Figure 4c).The a and b are ascribed to the spin splitting orbits of 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 for the Ce ion. 66Therefore, the peaks owing to Ce 4 are specified as a, a, b, b, and b, while those of Ce 3 are referred as a and b (see the Table S2 in the Supporting Information).Due to surface defects and the synergistic interaction between ZnO and CeO 2 , some Ce 3 sites were found, which led to the construction of amorphous Ce 2 O 3 .As Ce 2 O 3 is amorphous, it cannot be distinguished by XRD, which is harmonious with the XRD results of previous reports. 67,68Therefore, it can be observed that mainly Ce ions in CeO 2 and 3AgCZ are in Ce 4 chemical states.Significantly, coupling the ZnO with CeO 2 in 3AgZC, both Ce 3d 5/2 and Ce 3d 3/2 peaks display negative shifts compared to those of CeO 2 .Consequently, after coupling ZnO with CeO 2 , the charge transporter immigration path vagaries and the electrons of ZnO transmit to CeO 2 as established by the negative shift in the locations of Ce 3d peaks. 40,41o explore the impact of Ag concentration on the binding Energy, Ce 3d XPS and Zn 2p XPS were recorded and are presented in Figure S2.Tables S2 andS3 displays that the binding energy variation of both Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 display affirmative shifts that increase with increasing Ag concentration, while both Ce 3d 5/2 and Ce 3d 3/2 peaks display negative shifts. 3.2.Optical Properties.It is clearly recognized that the optical absorption merit of the photocatalyst is a substantial aspect in defining the photocatalytic activity because the establishment of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and reactive types upon light radiation is fundamental for the photocatalytic reaction.The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the fabricated samples are displayed in Figure5a.The band edges of pure ZnO and CeO 2 are at 397 and 435 nm, respectively.Subsequently coupling ZnO with CeO 2 and Ag, xAgCZ nanocomposites (x 1,2,3,4) display considerably improved absorption to longer wavelengths compared to the original ZnO and CeO 2 , which is possibly attributed to the coinfluence of Ag and CeO 2 .In specific, the sample with 3 mol of Ag (3AgCZ) displays notable absorption capability in visible radiation compared to the other three samples.In addition, the wide absorption band of the synthesized 3AgCZ composites in the visible light part is attributed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption of Ag species.This SPR effect of Ag NPs can additionally promote light absorption and photogenerated transporter separation, which are valuable for the photocatalytic reactions. 44,69,70However, it can be observed that an additional increase in Ag over 3 mol results in a decline in the light absorption and photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity.The cause for this observation is attributed to the \"shielding effect\" in which the surplus Ag somewhat shields the light absorption of CeO 2 and ZnO. 717273 Commonly, the band gaps for ZnO and CeO 2 can be estimated through the Kubelka-Munk function. 74,75From Figure 5b, the band gaps of ZnO and CeO 2 are calculated to be 3.26 and 3.15 eV, respectively.The EVB and ECB of two semiconductors were calculated via eqs 3 and 4, respectively, and are represented in Table S4. where ECB is the edge potential of CB, EVB is the edge potential of VB, is the electronegativity of the semiconductor, Eef is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (about 4.5 eV), and Eg is the semiconductor band gap energy.The values are 5.56 and 5.79 for ZnO and CeO 2 , respectively. 76hese results suggest that the 3AgCZ composite could extend the absorption slope to the visible light section, enhancing the harvesting of the solar spectrum, which is relatively valuable to boost the photocatalytic quality.The band gaps for the heterostructures with different concentrations of Ag were calculated for the samples 1AgCZ, 2AgCZ, AgCZ, and AgCZ and were found to be 3.17, 3.12, 2.91, and 3.02 eV, respectively (Figure S3). Figure 6 shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of ZnO, CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ nanocomposites at room temperature with an excitement of 325 nm light radiation.Numerous peaks are detected for pure CeO 2 in the UV, visible, and NIR regions.The UV region peak should be ascribed to the radiative annihilation of excitons.The visible peak is produced by the radiative recombination of a photogenerated hole with an electron occupying the oxygen vacancy. 77The red peak maybe due to some defects and the morphology.In comparison to pure ZnO and CeO 2 , the 3AgCZ nanocomposite has reduced PL intensity, which implies that the great charge division and diffusion rate of photoexcited e -and h professionally applied due to the existence of Ag, which acts as a charge mediator between ZnO and CeO 2 composites.Thus, the constructed 3AgCZ can work as an additional subsequent in prominent boosted photocatalysis.The PL quenching for 3AgCZ indicates the improved charge transfer and separation, which are essential for the efficient photocatalytic activity.Thus, it can be established that the PL spectra results are in agreement with photocatalytic reduction (PCR) data.Therefore, the effective breakup of photoinduced e -and h creates huge impacts to enriching photocatalytic performance of semiconductors. The photocatalytic reduction performance for the as-grown samples was studied upon UV visible light irradiation.Figure 7a,b demonstrates the photocatalytic CO and CH 4 formation rate for the pure ZnO, pure CeO 2 , and AgCZ nanocomposites under the same conditions.The pure ZnO shows the lowest photocatalytic performance owing to the high recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.Nevertheless, the photocatalytic CO and CH 4 formation percentage for pure CeO 2 can be spontaneously understood from Figure 7a,b and Tables S5 andS6 by which the photocatalytic performance is more away from the standard.In contrast, 3DF Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 nanocomposites (1AgCZ, 2AgCZ, 3AgCZ, and 4AgCZ) display higher performance for the CO and CH 4 formation than pure ZnO and pure CeO 2 independently.With the rise in Ag content, the CO and CH 4 formation rate increases steadily, and 3AgCZ with 3 mol Ag concentration shows a considerably advanced CO production rate of 377.52 mol g -1 and CH 4 production rates of 20.12 mol g -1 with light irradiation for 5 h.Moreover, CO 2 to CO selectivity reaches up to 95 using a 3AgCZ photocatalyst.In comparison with the earlier studies on ZnO and CeO 2 grounded photocatalysts (Table S6), 3AgCZ displays the highest photocatalytic selectivity in the reduction of CO 2 to CO. Conversely, it can be mentioned that a further increase in Ag concentration over 3 mol results in a decline in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 activity.The decline in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 can be attributed to the decline in the light absorption due to the \"shielding effect\" in which the surplus Ag somewhat shields the light absorption of CeO 2 and ZnO. 6465566 In addition, 3D Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanoflowers exhibit enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance compared to Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanoparticles, indicating the major role played by the 3D morphology (see the Supporting Information Figure S4).In order to confirm that the reaction is certainly caused by a photocatalytic method, a chain of control tests with diverse reaction settings have been performed.For instance, the elimination of light supply or catalysts originates from the absence of product detection, advising that the reaction is photoinduced.The photostability of catalysts is a significant parameter for industrial applications.To demonstrate the photostability of 3AgCZ, the authors performed 5 cycles of tests under the identical conditions.As specified in Figure 7c, the CO and CH 4 formation rates of 3AgCZ remains nearly unaffected after five cycles.Depending on the PXRD examination of the operated sample (Figure 7d), after the photocatalytic reaction, the crystal assembly of the photocatalyst has not been altered, representing the extraordinary photostability of the 3AgCZ nanocomposite.Moreover, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 3AgCZ at 420 nm is calculated to be 4.47.A full comparison with the AQE value for other recent photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is represented in Table S8. The interaction of CO 2 molecules with the fabricated samples has been investigated by the temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption (CO 2 -TPD) characterization.Figure 8a illustrates the CO 2 -TPD curves for ZnO, CeO 2 , and 3AgCZ nanocomposites.The computed quantity of CO 2 desorbed from these curves is presented in Table S7.The signal peaks of pure ZnO for CO 2 desorption are tiny, representing that the interaction between CO 2 and ZnO is feeble.Meanwhile, it can be noticed that CeO 2 shows elevated CO 2 adsorption capacity (0.41 mmol/g) than ZnO (0.16 mmol/g), which is signifying to the powerful physical adsorption.However, compared to those of ZnO and CeO 2 catalysts, the strengths of CO 2 desorption curves over the 3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO nanocomposite catalyst are considerably higher (0.59 mmol/g), suggesting the construction of stronger CO 2 adsorption active sites.These results indicate that the introduction of CeO 2 and Ag can expand the CO 2 chemisorption of the 3AgCZ nanocomposite, which is valuable to the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Efforts to examine the charge separation and transport effectiveness, photocurrent response, and EIS experiments have been employed.Figure 8b shows the photocurrent results of obtained samples upon irradiation of UV-vis light on/off cycle manners.Apparently, 3AgCZ offers the highest photocurrent strength than the CeO 2 and ZnO samples, which signifies that it has the greatest charge transport efficacy and lowest recombination rate.As revealed in Figure 8c, the Nyquist diagram of 3AgCZ owns the minimum semicircle among these three samples, indicating the smallest charge-transfer resistance among the 3AgCZ nanocomposite and electrolyte.The outcome of the above studies confirms that the 3AgCZ composite has outstanding photoelectrochemical properties, and these additional advantages are utilized for the photoreduction technology. AG-CEO 2 -ZNO The PL, photocurrent, and electrochemical impedance measurements approve the boosted charge separation and transfer in the 3AgCZ composite; however, these results are not sufficient to demonstrate the Z-scheme mechanism -among all assynthesized samples, which persuasively states that the 3AgCZ composite could supply much active species of O 2 -radicals than original constituents under same investigational conditions.Consequently, OH and O 2 -are formed under mimicked sunlight. 26,41,787980 According to the above discussion and the calculated band edge position of ZnO and CeO 2 , a probable Z-scheme mechanism for the photoreduction of CO 2 on the 3AgCZ nanocomposites has been proposed as shown in Figure 10.Initially, metallic Ag absorbs a significant quantity of energy from the visible light due to its SPR effect, which is helpful for boosting visible light absorption.Next, metallic Ag acts as an electron-conduction bridge, which performs a vital part in the formation of the Z-scheme charge transmission mechanism.Consequently, when the 3DF Ag-ZnO-CeO 2 nanocomposite is illuminated by simulated sunlight, both ZnO and CeO 2 are simply agitated and create the photogenerated electrons and holes in the CB and VB, correspondingly.Then, the photoinduced electrons in the CB of ZnO would simply transmit into metallic Ag via the Schottky barrier and recombine with the photogenerated holes in the VB of CeO 2 .The movement of charge transporters causes electrons gathering in the CB of CeO 2 (-0.515 eV), and the holes were maintained in the VB of ZnO (2.92 eV).Consequently, the photoexcited electrons left and gathered in the CB of CeO 2 have adequate energy to reduce CO 2 to CO and CH 4 .Concurrently, the holes remaining in the VB of ZnO have sufficient energy to oxidize the H 2 O to form O 2 H .Thus, Ag NPs may have dual roles in a plasmon-based Z-scheme arrangement.Primality it is to absorb visible light owing to plasmon effect, which is the source of the hot charges for CO 2 photoreduction.The further one is the transference of electrons as a solid electron mediator.As far as we know, exploring both of the roles of Ag in one structure is seldom stated.Thanks to the dual-functional Ag NPs, both the hot electron and hot holes from SPR influence might be efficiently applied in a solid Z-scheme system."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The light supplier was a 300 W xenon lamp.", "context": "2.3.Characterization.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Rigaku Smart Lab II, CuK radiation, 1.5414A) was employed to characterize the crystal phase structure of the photocatalysts.The surface morphology of the catalysts was examined by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-3400 N).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOl JEM 2100) offers a deep outlook of the structure with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.The elemental analysis (EDX) was done via a Thermo Scientific energy dispersive Xray spectrometer linked to the SEM.In addition, to investigate the chemical state of surface elements and determine the charge transport pathway under light illumination, in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out using a Thermo Scientific (ESCALAB 250Xi) instrument equipped with a lowpower 365 nm LED light (Shenzhen LAMPLIC Science Co. Ltd., China) as the illumination source.The LED was kept off during recording the survey spectra and on during recording high-resolution spectra.Photoluminescence spectrophotometry (PL, F-2700) was employed to examine the recombination of photogenerated carriers.UV-vis absorbance spectra were recorded by a UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer (UV-vis DRS, Thermo Scientific Evolution 220). 2.4.Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction.The photocatalytic performance of the fabricated samples was established through examining the CO 2 reduction upon mimicked sunlight irradiation in a 135 mL quartz reactor at room temperature (Scheme S2).In the standard process, 50 mg of the photocatalyst was distributed in 10 mL of ultrapure DI water and sonicated for 30 min.The quartz reactor was heated at 80 C in a hot air oven till the water was removed, and a thin film was generated.Next, 0.12 g of NaHCO 3 was added into the reactor, and then it was wrapped with a rubber septum.Before the lighting, the reactor was purified with Ar for 30 min to achieve an anaerobic circumstance.For in situ manufacture of CO 2 and H 2 O gas, a 0.35 M HCl aqueous solution was introduced.The light supplier was a 300 W xenon lamp.The quantity of gas produced was measured in steady time breaks by means of a GC-2014C Shimadzu GC with an FID detector.The durability test was carried with 5 h per cycle.To estimate the apparent quantum efficacy, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were done via a 420 nm band-pass filter for all samples of AgCZ, and the five CO and CH 4 amounts at the unit time was computed.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is computed by the subsequent equation:"}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The working electrode was irradiated with 100 mW by means of a 250 W xenon lamp and the photocurrent was determined at 0 V throughout the on-off cycle.", "context": "In conclusion, a plasmonic photocatalyst (3DF Ag-CeO 2 -ZnO) has been reasonably fabricated through a low-cost hydrothermal-photodeposition process.By means of manipulating the multifunctional constituent (Ag), the adjusted 3AgCZ photocatalyst displays considerably higher activity than pure ZnO, CeO 2 , binary systems, and xAgCZ composites (x 1,2,4) for CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 .The optimum CO and CH 4 evolution rates on 3AgCZ were 377.75 and 20.12 mol g -1 under mimicked sunlight radiation.A possible mechanism for 3AgCZ plasmonic photocatalyst reduction of CO 2 has been also proposed.This improved photocatalytic performance is attributed to the subsequent synergistic effects: (i) the prolonged absorption in the visible light region; (ii) SPR effect; and (iii) Z-scheme system, which boosts the separation of photogenerated transporters, employs the influential electrons and holes, and optimize the redox potential.The present study offers new inspirations for scheming other plasmonic multicomponent semiconductorbased photocatalytic CO 2 reduction systems.
