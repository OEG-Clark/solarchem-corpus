Ltd and used without further purification.L-cysteine was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. The carboxylated g-C 3 N 4 substrates were fabricated by refluxing g-C 3 N 4 bulks in HNO 3 solution 51.In detail, the mixtures of urea and dicyandiamide with mass ratio 7:3 were firstly heated to 550 C with the heating ramp of 2 C/min and then kept for 4 h in the furnace to obtain g-C 3 N 4 bulks (abbreviated as CN) through thermal polymerization process.Secondly, 1 g of g-C 3 N 4 bulks was added into 100 mL of 5 M HNO 3 solution and refluxed for 24 h at 125 C. The obtained suspensions were naturally cooled to room temperature.Through centrifugation and washing with deionized water, the solid products was vacuum dried at 35 C for 12 h to obtain carboxylated g-C 3 N 4 (denoted as CCN) . A series of CuInZnS (abbreviated as CIZS) photocatalysts were prepared via a facile solvothermal method.In a typical synthesis process, mmol CuCl, 1 mmol InCl 3 4H 2 O and X mmol (X 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively) Zn(Ac) 2 2H 2 O were firstly dissolved in 80 mL of DMF solvents, and then 2 mmol L-cysteine was introduced into the mixture solutions.Meanwhile, 6 M HCl were slowly introduced to the mixtures under constant stirring to obtain the clear solution, which were transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 180 C for 18 h.After the autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature, the products were collected by filtration and washed for several times with deionized water and ethanol and finally dried under vacuum at -40 C for 8 h 48.The as-obtained CIZS catalysts were denoted as CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3), CIZS(1-4), CIZS(1-5), and CIZS (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6), where the molar ratios of In 3 ions and Zn 2 ions during synthesis process were 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, and 1:6, respectively. In order to prepare CIZS/CCN hybrids, the first step was similar to the preparation process of CIZS.The difference is that a certain amount of CCN powder was uniformly dispersed in the transparent solution after the introduction of HCl.As CIZS is a ternary-binary solid solution composed of ternary chalcopyrite CuInS 2 and binary zincblende ZnS, its optical band gap is adjustable.Simultaneously, due to their similar ionic radii, the occupation sites of Cu , In 3 and Zn 2 may be random in real crystals.The nominal proportion of CIZS and CCN in the hybrids was calculated by the molar mass of the added precursor.When the precursors used for the synthesis of CIZS include 1 mmol CuCl, 1 mmol InCl 3 4H 2 O, 3 mmol Zn(Ac) 2 2H 2 O, and 2.5 mmol L-cysteine, and 0.5 g of CCN substrates, the as-prepared hybrid was denoted as 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN.In the same way, 17 CIZS(1-3)/CCN, 29 CIZS(1-3)/CCN, CIZS(1-3)/CCN and 56 CIZS (1-3)/CCN can be well synthesized by reducing or expanding the amount of precursors added in proportion.In order to prepare different 47 CIZS/CCN hybrids, the nominal mass of CIZS and the molar ratio of Cu , In 3 and L-cysteine (1:1:2.5)were kept as constant, while the molar ratio of In 3 to Zn 2 changed.Thus, 47 CIZS(1-2)/CCN, 47 CIZS (1-4)/CCN, 47 CIZS (1-5)/CCN, and 47 CIZS (1-6)/CCN hybrids can be obtained. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of CIZS/CCN hybrids were performed on an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Ka source with In order to test the migration properties of photogenerated carriers in different samples under visible light irradiation, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photocurrent were measured on a CHI 660E electrochemical station using a conventional three electrode system.The working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode were FTO glass coated with samples, SCE electrode and platinum wire respectively.Among them, the working electrode was prepared by adding 10 mg of sample powder into Nafion solution diluted with ethanol and evenly distributing on FTO glass (2 cm 2 cm).The electrolyte used in this experiment was 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution. CO 2 reduction performance of the samples was tested in a 120 mL cylindrical glassware reactor with quartz glass on the top.The light source was provided by a 300 W Xe lamp with 400 nm cut-off filter.50 mg of catalyst sample was evenly dispersed on a round Petri dish with an area of 9 cm 2 and placed in the reactor.The distance between sample and light source was fixed at 11 cm, and the visible light was irradiated on the surface of sample through the quartz glass on the upper part of the reactor.Before photoreduction experiment, high purity CO 2 (99.9) should be continuously pumped into the reactor for 15 min to remove the residual air and keep the ambient pressure in the reactor.At the same time, 2 mL of deionized water should be injected into the bottom of reactor as reducing agent.During the photoreduction experiment, 0.5 mL of gas product was extracted from the reactor every 2 h as a sample, and was quantitatively identified by GC-7920 gas chromatography equipped with flame ionization detector (FID).The photocatalytic stability of the samples was evaluated by four cycle experiments. The photocatalytic performance of different samples was evaluated by near-infrared degradation of methyl orange (MO) solution.The nearinfrared light source was provided by a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a total reflector and a 700 nm cut-off filter.In a typical experiment, 50 mg of pure CIZS(1-3) or CIZS/CCN hybrids was added into 100 mL of MO (10 mg/L) aqueous solution, and the suspension was obtained by ultrasound.Before the reaction, the suspension was stirred magnetically in the dark for 30 min in order to reach the adsorption-desorption equilibrium.In the process of illumination, 4 mL of aliquots was collected from the suspension every 1 h and the photocatalysts powder were removed by centrifugation to obtain a clear solution.The concentration of the clear solution was determined by a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 463 nm.During the reaction, the active species were determined by capture experiments.1 mM potassium iodide (KI), 1 mM isopropanol (IPA) and argon (Ar) were used as h , OH and scavengers respectively."}, {"llm generation": "CIZS/CCN hybrids (e.g., 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN)", "source": "At 284.92 eV, the C 1 s peak of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN is attributed to the carbon impurity adsorbed on the catalyst surface, and the other two peaks at 285.94 eV and 287.9 eV are ascribed to the defect position (C N) and the sp 2 hybridized C (N-C N) atoms in Fig. 5e 49.", "context": "Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of CIZS samples prepared with different ratios of In and Zn.For all samples, the main diffraction peaks located at 28.0 , 46.6 , and 55.2 can be attributed to CIZS with cubic zinc blende structure (PDF 47-1370), corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 2 0), and (1 3 1) planes 45.In addition, the diffraction peaks at 27.9 , 46.5 , and 55.2 in the pattern of CIZS(1-2) sample are observed 49, which can be indexed to CuInS 2 phases (PDF 75-0106).With the increase of In and Zn ratio from 1:2 to 1:3, the diffraction peaks of CuInS 2 phases disappear and the pure CIZS phases are obtained.It can be seen that the diffraction peak of the sample is wider, indicating that the particle size of the sample is smaller.Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of the synthesized CIZS/CCN hybrids and the bare CCN sample.Two characteristic peaks of graphite carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) phase at 13.7 and 27.4 are observed in all samples.In particular, the bare CCN exhibits a sharp diffraction peak, which proves that the refluxing process in nitric acid solution has no effect on the crystallinity of g-C 3 N 4 .For all CIZS/CCN hybrids with different ratios of In and Zn, there is no significant difference in the XRD peak position and strength.In addition to two diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 , three characteristic peaks of CIZS are also found, indicating that CIZS has been successfully deposited on the surface of CCN. In order to further study the microstructure of different samples, the morphology and composition of pure CCN, CIZS and CIZS/CCN hybrids were investigated by SEM and TEM images.As shown in Fig. 2a and2b, CCN clearly displays the characteristic morphology of nanosheets and nanoparticles, indicating that the refluxing process in HNO 3 solution effectively reduces the size of g-C 3 N 4 bulks.Fig. 2c and2d show the morphology of pure CIZS(1-3).It can be seen that pure CIZS(1-3) consists of numerous nanosheets and nanoparticles.During the synthesis process, the morphology of CIZS samples prepared with different ratios of In and Zn did not change significantly as shown in Fig. S1a-S1d.After coupling CIZS with CCN, CIZS is uniformly loaded on the surface of CCN, as shown in Fig. 2e and2f.For CIZS/CCN hybrids different mass ratios of CCN and CIZS, there is no obvious morphological change, as observed in Fig. S1e-S1j.The HRTEM images and EDS spectra of 47 CIZS(1-3)/ CCN hybrids are further shown in Fig. 3. Typical sheet-on-sheet and particle-on-sheet structures can be clearly observed in Fig. 3a and3b, which is accordance with the SEM results.The lattice images of composite are shown in Fig. 3c and3d.The interplanar crystal spacing of 0.31 nm is consistent with the (1 1 1) plane of CIZS 52, indicating that CIZS grows on the surface of CCN.The corresponding element mapping images in Fig. 3d-3j further verify the compositions of hybrids are S2.In order to explore the specific surface areas of samples, a nitrogen adsorption-analysis study was carried out.As shown in Fig. 4, the three samples exhibit type IV isotherms with a type H3 hysteresis loops at a higher relative pressure, indicating that the pores are produced by the accumulation of sheet-like structures 53.The specific surface areas of the CCN sample, the CIZS(1-3) sample and the 47 CIZS (1-3)/CCN hybrids are 81.93 mfoot0 g -1 , 43.12 m 2 g -1 and 52.81 m 2 g -1 , respectively.As compared to pure CIZS(1-3), 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids exhibit the larger specific surface area, which may promote the surface adsorption of target molecules and enhance the photocatalytic performance. The surface chemical compositions of as-obtained samples were investigated by XPS.As shown in Fig. S3, the measured scanning spectra of pure CIZS(1-3) and 47 CIZS (1-3)/CCN hybrids show the Cu, In, Zn and S elements in CIZS, also C and N elements in CCN.The high resolution spectra of Cu 2p 3/2 (931.83eV) and Cu 2p 1/2 (951.68 eV) correspond to the Cu in CIZS(1-3) 52, which shift to 932.03 eV and 951.87 eV for 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample in Fig. 5a.Similarly, the high resolution spectra of In 3d, Zn 2p and S 2p are located at 444.58 eV (In 3d 5/ which are consistent with the previous reports.After coupling with CCN, the peak values are 444.88eV, 452.48 eV, 1022.19 eV, 1045.36 eV, 161.78 eV, 162.82 eV, respectively.At 284.92 eV, the C 1 s peak of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN is attributed to the carbon impurity adsorbed on the catalyst surface, and the other two peaks at 285.94 eV and 287.9 eV are ascribed to the defect position (C N) and the sp 2 hybridized C (N-C N) atoms in Fig. 5e 49.The N 1 s spectra of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN can be fitted into four peaks at 398.3 eV (sp 2 -bonded N atoms, C-N C), 399.1 eV (ternary N groups, N-(C) 3 ), 400.4 eV (amine groups, C-N-H) and 404.0 eV (-excitations), respectively, as shown in Fig. 5f.All these results clearly show that the heterojunction structure is successfully formed between CCN and CIZS, rather than simple physical mixture. The FT-IR spectra of CIZS(1-3), g-C 3 N 4 (CN), CCN and 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN are shown in Fig. 6a.All the absorption bands of pure CCN belong to its typical molecular structure.The peak at 1646 cm -1 is attributed to the C N stretching vibration, while the peaks of 1565 cm -1 , 1408 cm -1 , 1320 cm -1 and 1238 cm -1 are related to stretching vibration of aromatic C-N.The intense band at 807 cm -1 can be assigned to the out-plane vibration mode of triazine units 54.The broad band at 3430 cm -1 is attributed to OH -groups adsorbed on the surface 55.For pure CIZS(1-3), the peak located at 1624 cm -1 is caused by stretching vibration C O.The apparent absorption peak of the -OH group at 3452 cm -1 and the characteristic peak of -COO-at 1394 cm -1 are observed, which may be ascribed to L-cysteine biomolecules assisted hydrothermal strategy.The disappearance of -SH peak at 2550 cm -1 indicates that there is a close relationship between thiol groups and metal atoms are formed 56.Similar results are also found in FTIR spectra of CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-4), CIZS(1-5) and CIZS(1-6) samples, as shown in Fig. S4a.In addition, the spectrum of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids is similar to that of pure CCN, indicating that the chemical structure of CCN in 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids is not destroyed.In the 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample, the vibration band of triazine unites at 805 cm -1 shifts slightly to the direction of higher wavenumber, which indicates that the chemical bond is formed between CCN and CIZS rather than simple physical connection.Fig. S4b shows the same trend for the other CIZS/CCN hybrids.The enlarged FTIR spectra of CN and CCN are shown in Fig. 6b.The peak at 1675 cm -1 corresponds to the C O bending band, while the absorption band at 1558 cm -1 and 1386 cm -1 can be attributed to -COO-groups, indicating the successful functionalization of carboxyl groups on CCN surface 57.FITR results show that carboxylated CCN can form stable bond with CIZS, which may promote the formation of electron transfer channels and improve the photocatalytic performance. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained samples was evaluated by reducing CO 2 to CO under visible light irradiation and degrading MO under near-infrared irradiation.Fig. 7a shows the yields of CO over all the different 47 CIZS/CCN hybrids.Compared with pure CCN sample, the yields of CO for all 47 CIZS/CCN hybrids have been greatly enhanced, following the order 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-2)/ CCN 47 CIZS(1-4)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-5)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-6)/ CCN CCN.The 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample exhibits the highest CO yield of 38.93 mol/g within 8 h, which is 4.93 times higher than that of pure CCN (7.9 mol/g).Fig. 7b shows the recycle capacity of 47 CIZS (1-3)/CCN sample for CO 2 reduction.It can be seen that the yields of CO slightly decreases after four cycles, indicating that the photostability of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample is excellent.Meanwhile, as show in Fig. 7c, the CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids with different mass ratios are explored for CO 2 reduction performance.In a series of CIZS(1-3)/CCN samples, the CO 2 reduction ability follows the order 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 29 CIZS (1-3)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 17 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 56 CIZS(1-3)/CCN.Among different samples, 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample exhibits the highest CO yields of 50.04 mol/g within 8 h, which is 6.33 times higher than that of pure CCN.Mass ratio and CIZS types are the main factors that affect the final performance of hybrids.Fig. 7d shows the recycle capacity of 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample for CO 2 reduction.The 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample also demonstrates the excellent photostability after four cycles. To further evaluate the photocatalytic performance of different samples, near-infrared degradation of MO is displayed in Fig. 7e.The degradation efficiency of MO over 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids reaches 96.5 in 5 h, which is approximately 2.80 times higher than that of pure CIZS(1-3) sample.In addition, before exploring the near-infrared degradation performance of the photocatalyst, the MO adsorption experiments were carried out over different samples in dark, as shown in Fig. S5.All MO adsorption curves show that the adsorption-desorption equilibrium reaches in 5 min.Interestingly, the MO adsorption rate is increased with the increase of CIZS(1-3) content in hybrids.Meanwhile, the capture experiments of reactive species are shown in Fig. 7f.The degradation efficiency of MO over 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids is greatly inhibited with the Ar gas introduction, indicating -is the main active specie in the photocatalytic process.When KI was introduced into the solution, the activity of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN is also seriously restrained, suggesting that h is another active specie.However, there is no significant change when IPA was added, suggesting that OH is not the main active substance in the degradation process.As shown in Table 1 5859606162636465, CO 2 reduction performance and MO near-infrared degradation performance of CIZS/CCN hybrids in this paper are compared with the other references. In order to explore the possible photocatalytic mechanism, the recombination rate and separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs on different samples were studied by PEC experiments.The photocurrent density of CIZS/CCN hybrid films prepared with different ratio of In to Zn was firstly analyzed.Higher photocurrent response usually means better electron-hole pairs separation efficiency.As shown in Fig. 8a, it can be observed that the hybrid film prepared by 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN respectively, which are reduced to 3.84 ns and 3.59 ns for 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN and 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN samples, indicating a nonradioactive pathway from the electronic interaction between CCN and CIZS(1-3), and the acceleration of the photogenerated charges transfer 66.In addition, PEC results of CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrid films with different mass ratios were also conducted and shown in Fig. 8e.It can be observed the hybrid films prepared by 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN and 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN show the similar photocurrent density.However, as the mass ratio of CIZS increases to 56, the photocurrent density of film decreases to 1.2 Acm -2 , resulting in the increase of interface charge recombination and the decrease of electron transfer efficiency.As shown in Fig. 8f, 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample displays the minimum radius of Nyquist curve, which further verifies the results of photocurrent experiment.Fig. 9 shows the UV-vis-NIR DRS spectra of CN, CCN and CIZS samples.In Fig. 9a, the absorption edge of CCN sample shows a blue shift compared with CN sample.Combined with the results of Fig. 6b, it can be concluded that the carboxylation of CCN is successful.As shown in Fig. 9b, the optical band gaps of different samples are calculated according to the relationship between (ah) 2 and (h), in which the band gaps of CN and CCN are determined to be 2.71 eV and 2.82 eV.Fig. 9c shows the absorption spectra of CIZS with different molar ratios of In and Zn.Obviously, CIZS samples have strong absorption ability from UV to NIR region, which indicates that CIZS may have near-infrared photocatalytic activity.With the increase of molar ratio of In to Zn from 1:2 to 1:6, the near-infrared absorption capacity of CIZS decreases.In Fig. 9d, band gaps of CIZS samples are calculated as 1.56 eV (CIZS(1-2)), 1.66 eV (CIZS(1-3)), 1.76 eV (CIZS(1-4)) and 1.84 eV (CIZS(1-5)) and 1.90 eV (CIZS(1-6)).It can be observed that band gap can be adjusted by changing the molar ratio of In 3 to Zn 2 . The ionization potentials (equivalent to the valence band energy (E v )) of CCN, CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3) and CIZS(1-6) were analyzed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).The E v of CCN, CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3) and CIZS (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6) samples are calculated to be 1.6 eV, 1.76 eV, 1.83 eV and 2.05 eV by subtracting the width of the He I UPS spectrum from the excitation energy (21.22 eV), as shown in Fig. S7.Therefore, the conduction band energies (E c ) of different samples are estimated to be -1.22 eV, 0.2 eV, 0.17 eV and 0.15 eV, respectively 67.According to equation h E Cutoff -E Ferm , the measured work function is the absolute value of the work function, which is only related to the excitation source energy hv (which is known, Hel hv 21.22 eV).In order to clearly distinguish the secondary electron emission cutoff (E Cutoff ) from the spectrometer cutoff, the negative bias on the sample is usually measured.According to Fig. S8, the work functions of CCN, CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3) and CIZS(1-6) can be calculated as 4.38 eV, 5.98 eV, 5.9 eV and 6.18 eV, respectively. Based on the above calculations, the possible mechanism over CIZS/ CCN hybrids is proposed in Fig. 10.When CIZS contacts CCN, the free electrons of CCN may transfer to CIZS due to its low work function until their Fermi levels reach equilibrium.As a result, the internal electric field is constructed, and the band edge bending occurs at the interface with positive charge on CCN side and negative charge on CIZS side.Under light irradiation, electrons are photoexcited from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band.In this case, the existence of internal electric field is conducive to the recombination between the photogenerated electrons in CIZS conduction band and holes in CCN valence band, which is consistent with the direct Zscheme charge transfer mode.Factors including internal electric field and Coulomb repulsion may hinder the electrons transfer from CCN to CIZS and the holes transfer from CIZS to CCN.The capture experiments of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids (Fig. 7f) can effectively support this theoretical analysis.As the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO is at -0.53 V vs. NHE, which is more positive than the CB potential of CCN (-1.22 V) and negative than that of CIZS(1-3) (0.17 V).Therefore, the traditional type II charge transfer mode can be eliminated because the CB potential of CIZS could not reduce CO 2 to CO.Alternatively, the charge transfer is more likely to form direct Z-scheme route as shown in the left of Fig. 68.Compared with CIZS(1-2) and CIZS (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6), the work function of CIZS (1-3) sample is much closer to CCN.After semiconductors coupling, the electrons in conduction band of CCN at CIZS(1-3)/CCN heterojunction may possess the stronger reduction ability compared with CIZS(1-2)/ CCN and CIZS(1-6)/CCN hybrids.On the other hand, the optical absorption capacity of hybrids is closely related to the band gap of the semiconductor.As shown in Table 2, the band gap of CIZS(1-3) (1.66 eV) is between CIZS(1-2) (1.56 eV) and CIZS(1-6) (1.90 eV).Therefore, the CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample may have good light absorption capacity.Meanwhile, the light absorption edge of CIZS(1-3) is greater than nm, which is beneficial to improve the near-infrared degradation of MO over CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids.From these conclusions, we can conclude that the fine adjustment of the energy band position in semiconductor heterojunction can effectively balance the optical absorption capacity and energy band matching in the photocatalytic reaction, thus effectively improving the photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction."}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [{"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The photocatalytic activity of the obtained samples was evaluated by reducing CO 2 to CO under visible light irradiation and degrading MO under near-infrared irradiation.", "context": "Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of CIZS samples prepared with different ratios of In and Zn.For all samples, the main diffraction peaks located at 28.0 , 46.6 , and 55.2 can be attributed to CIZS with cubic zinc blende structure (PDF 47-1370), corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 2 0), and (1 3 1) planes 45.In addition, the diffraction peaks at 27.9 , 46.5 , and 55.2 in the pattern of CIZS(1-2) sample are observed 49, which can be indexed to CuInS 2 phases (PDF 75-0106).With the increase of In and Zn ratio from 1:2 to 1:3, the diffraction peaks of CuInS 2 phases disappear and the pure CIZS phases are obtained.It can be seen that the diffraction peak of the sample is wider, indicating that the particle size of the sample is smaller.Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of the synthesized CIZS/CCN hybrids and the bare CCN sample.Two characteristic peaks of graphite carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) phase at 13.7 and 27.4 are observed in all samples.In particular, the bare CCN exhibits a sharp diffraction peak, which proves that the refluxing process in nitric acid solution has no effect on the crystallinity of g-C 3 N 4 .For all CIZS/CCN hybrids with different ratios of In and Zn, there is no significant difference in the XRD peak position and strength.In addition to two diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 , three characteristic peaks of CIZS are also found, indicating that CIZS has been successfully deposited on the surface of CCN. In order to further study the microstructure of different samples, the morphology and composition of pure CCN, CIZS and CIZS/CCN hybrids were investigated by SEM and TEM images.As shown in Fig. 2a and2b, CCN clearly displays the characteristic morphology of nanosheets and nanoparticles, indicating that the refluxing process in HNO 3 solution effectively reduces the size of g-C 3 N 4 bulks.Fig. 2c and2d show the morphology of pure CIZS(1-3).It can be seen that pure CIZS(1-3) consists of numerous nanosheets and nanoparticles.During the synthesis process, the morphology of CIZS samples prepared with different ratios of In and Zn did not change significantly as shown in Fig. S1a-S1d.After coupling CIZS with CCN, CIZS is uniformly loaded on the surface of CCN, as shown in Fig. 2e and2f.For CIZS/CCN hybrids different mass ratios of CCN and CIZS, there is no obvious morphological change, as observed in Fig. S1e-S1j.The HRTEM images and EDS spectra of 47 CIZS(1-3)/ CCN hybrids are further shown in Fig. 3. Typical sheet-on-sheet and particle-on-sheet structures can be clearly observed in Fig. 3a and3b, which is accordance with the SEM results.The lattice images of composite are shown in Fig. 3c and3d.The interplanar crystal spacing of 0.31 nm is consistent with the (1 1 1) plane of CIZS 52, indicating that CIZS grows on the surface of CCN.The corresponding element mapping images in Fig. 3d-3j further verify the compositions of hybrids are S2.In order to explore the specific surface areas of samples, a nitrogen adsorption-analysis study was carried out.As shown in Fig. 4, the three samples exhibit type IV isotherms with a type H3 hysteresis loops at a higher relative pressure, indicating that the pores are produced by the accumulation of sheet-like structures 53.The specific surface areas of the CCN sample, the CIZS(1-3) sample and the 47 CIZS (1-3)/CCN hybrids are 81.93 mfoot0 g -1 , 43.12 m 2 g -1 and 52.81 m 2 g -1 , respectively.As compared to pure CIZS(1-3), 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids exhibit the larger specific surface area, which may promote the surface adsorption of target molecules and enhance the photocatalytic performance. The surface chemical compositions of as-obtained samples were investigated by XPS.As shown in Fig. S3, the measured scanning spectra of pure CIZS(1-3) and 47 CIZS (1-3)/CCN hybrids show the Cu, In, Zn and S elements in CIZS, also C and N elements in CCN.The high resolution spectra of Cu 2p 3/2 (931.83eV) and Cu 2p 1/2 (951.68 eV) correspond to the Cu in CIZS(1-3) 52, which shift to 932.03 eV and 951.87 eV for 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample in Fig. 5a.Similarly, the high resolution spectra of In 3d, Zn 2p and S 2p are located at 444.58 eV (In 3d 5/ which are consistent with the previous reports.After coupling with CCN, the peak values are 444.88eV, 452.48 eV, 1022.19 eV, 1045.36 eV, 161.78 eV, 162.82 eV, respectively.At 284.92 eV, the C 1 s peak of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN is attributed to the carbon impurity adsorbed on the catalyst surface, and the other two peaks at 285.94 eV and 287.9 eV are ascribed to the defect position (C N) and the sp 2 hybridized C (N-C N) atoms in Fig. 5e 49.The N 1 s spectra of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN can be fitted into four peaks at 398.3 eV (sp 2 -bonded N atoms, C-N C), 399.1 eV (ternary N groups, N-(C) 3 ), 400.4 eV (amine groups, C-N-H) and 404.0 eV (-excitations), respectively, as shown in Fig. 5f.All these results clearly show that the heterojunction structure is successfully formed between CCN and CIZS, rather than simple physical mixture. The FT-IR spectra of CIZS(1-3), g-C 3 N 4 (CN), CCN and 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN are shown in Fig. 6a.All the absorption bands of pure CCN belong to its typical molecular structure.The peak at 1646 cm -1 is attributed to the C N stretching vibration, while the peaks of 1565 cm -1 , 1408 cm -1 , 1320 cm -1 and 1238 cm -1 are related to stretching vibration of aromatic C-N.The intense band at 807 cm -1 can be assigned to the out-plane vibration mode of triazine units 54.The broad band at 3430 cm -1 is attributed to OH -groups adsorbed on the surface 55.For pure CIZS(1-3), the peak located at 1624 cm -1 is caused by stretching vibration C O.The apparent absorption peak of the -OH group at 3452 cm -1 and the characteristic peak of -COO-at 1394 cm -1 are observed, which may be ascribed to L-cysteine biomolecules assisted hydrothermal strategy.The disappearance of -SH peak at 2550 cm -1 indicates that there is a close relationship between thiol groups and metal atoms are formed 56.Similar results are also found in FTIR spectra of CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-4), CIZS(1-5) and CIZS(1-6) samples, as shown in Fig. S4a.In addition, the spectrum of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids is similar to that of pure CCN, indicating that the chemical structure of CCN in 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids is not destroyed.In the 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample, the vibration band of triazine unites at 805 cm -1 shifts slightly to the direction of higher wavenumber, which indicates that the chemical bond is formed between CCN and CIZS rather than simple physical connection.Fig. S4b shows the same trend for the other CIZS/CCN hybrids.The enlarged FTIR spectra of CN and CCN are shown in Fig. 6b.The peak at 1675 cm -1 corresponds to the C O bending band, while the absorption band at 1558 cm -1 and 1386 cm -1 can be attributed to -COO-groups, indicating the successful functionalization of carboxyl groups on CCN surface 57.FITR results show that carboxylated CCN can form stable bond with CIZS, which may promote the formation of electron transfer channels and improve the photocatalytic performance. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained samples was evaluated by reducing CO 2 to CO under visible light irradiation and degrading MO under near-infrared irradiation.Fig. 7a shows the yields of CO over all the different 47 CIZS/CCN hybrids.Compared with pure CCN sample, the yields of CO for all 47 CIZS/CCN hybrids have been greatly enhanced, following the order 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-2)/ CCN 47 CIZS(1-4)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-5)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-6)/ CCN CCN.The 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample exhibits the highest CO yield of 38.93 mol/g within 8 h, which is 4.93 times higher than that of pure CCN (7.9 mol/g).Fig. 7b shows the recycle capacity of 47 CIZS (1-3)/CCN sample for CO 2 reduction.It can be seen that the yields of CO slightly decreases after four cycles, indicating that the photostability of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample is excellent.Meanwhile, as show in Fig. 7c, the CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids with different mass ratios are explored for CO 2 reduction performance.In a series of CIZS(1-3)/CCN samples, the CO 2 reduction ability follows the order 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 29 CIZS (1-3)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 17 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 56 CIZS(1-3)/CCN.Among different samples, 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample exhibits the highest CO yields of 50.04 mol/g within 8 h, which is 6.33 times higher than that of pure CCN.Mass ratio and CIZS types are the main factors that affect the final performance of hybrids.Fig. 7d shows the recycle capacity of 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample for CO 2 reduction.The 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample also demonstrates the excellent photostability after four cycles. To further evaluate the photocatalytic performance of different samples, near-infrared degradation of MO is displayed in Fig. 7e.The degradation efficiency of MO over 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids reaches 96.5 in 5 h, which is approximately 2.80 times higher than that of pure CIZS(1-3) sample.In addition, before exploring the near-infrared degradation performance of the photocatalyst, the MO adsorption experiments were carried out over different samples in dark, as shown in Fig. S5.All MO adsorption curves show that the adsorption-desorption equilibrium reaches in 5 min.Interestingly, the MO adsorption rate is increased with the increase of CIZS(1-3) content in hybrids.Meanwhile, the capture experiments of reactive species are shown in Fig. 7f.The degradation efficiency of MO over 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids is greatly inhibited with the Ar gas introduction, indicating -is the main active specie in the photocatalytic process.When KI was introduced into the solution, the activity of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN is also seriously restrained, suggesting that h is another active specie.However, there is no significant change when IPA was added, suggesting that OH is not the main active substance in the degradation process.As shown in Table 1 5859606162636465, CO 2 reduction performance and MO near-infrared degradation performance of CIZS/CCN hybrids in this paper are compared with the other references. In order to explore the possible photocatalytic mechanism, the recombination rate and separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs on different samples were studied by PEC experiments.The photocurrent density of CIZS/CCN hybrid films prepared with different ratio of In to Zn was firstly analyzed.Higher photocurrent response usually means better electron-hole pairs separation efficiency.As shown in Fig. 8a, it can be observed that the hybrid film prepared by 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN respectively, which are reduced to 3.84 ns and 3.59 ns for 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN and 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN samples, indicating a nonradioactive pathway from the electronic interaction between CCN and CIZS(1-3), and the acceleration of the photogenerated charges transfer 66.In addition, PEC results of CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrid films with different mass ratios were also conducted and shown in Fig. 8e.It can be observed the hybrid films prepared by 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN and 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN show the similar photocurrent density.However, as the mass ratio of CIZS increases to 56, the photocurrent density of film decreases to 1.2 Acm -2 , resulting in the increase of interface charge recombination and the decrease of electron transfer efficiency.As shown in Fig. 8f, 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample displays the minimum radius of Nyquist curve, which further verifies the results of photocurrent experiment.Fig. 9 shows the UV-vis-NIR DRS spectra of CN, CCN and CIZS samples.In Fig. 9a, the absorption edge of CCN sample shows a blue shift compared with CN sample.Combined with the results of Fig. 6b, it can be concluded that the carboxylation of CCN is successful.As shown in Fig. 9b, the optical band gaps of different samples are calculated according to the relationship between (ah) 2 and (h), in which the band gaps of CN and CCN are determined to be 2.71 eV and 2.82 eV.Fig. 9c shows the absorption spectra of CIZS with different molar ratios of In and Zn.Obviously, CIZS samples have strong absorption ability from UV to NIR region, which indicates that CIZS may have near-infrared photocatalytic activity.With the increase of molar ratio of In to Zn from 1:2 to 1:6, the near-infrared absorption capacity of CIZS decreases.In Fig. 9d, band gaps of CIZS samples are calculated as 1.56 eV (CIZS(1-2)), 1.66 eV (CIZS(1-3)), 1.76 eV (CIZS(1-4)) and 1.84 eV (CIZS(1-5)) and 1.90 eV (CIZS(1-6)).It can be observed that band gap can be adjusted by changing the molar ratio of In 3 to Zn 2 . The ionization potentials (equivalent to the valence band energy (E v )) of CCN, CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3) and CIZS(1-6) were analyzed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).The E v of CCN, CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3) and CIZS (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6) samples are calculated to be 1.6 eV, 1.76 eV, 1.83 eV and 2.05 eV by subtracting the width of the He I UPS spectrum from the excitation energy (21.22 eV), as shown in Fig. S7.Therefore, the conduction band energies (E c ) of different samples are estimated to be -1.22 eV, 0.2 eV, 0.17 eV and 0.15 eV, respectively 67.According to equation h E Cutoff -E Ferm , the measured work function is the absolute value of the work function, which is only related to the excitation source energy hv (which is known, Hel hv 21.22 eV).In order to clearly distinguish the secondary electron emission cutoff (E Cutoff ) from the spectrometer cutoff, the negative bias on the sample is usually measured.According to Fig. S8, the work functions of CCN, CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3) and CIZS(1-6) can be calculated as 4.38 eV, 5.98 eV, 5.9 eV and 6.18 eV, respectively. Based on the above calculations, the possible mechanism over CIZS/ CCN hybrids is proposed in Fig. 10.When CIZS contacts CCN, the free electrons of CCN may transfer to CIZS due to its low work function until their Fermi levels reach equilibrium.As a result, the internal electric field is constructed, and the band edge bending occurs at the interface with positive charge on CCN side and negative charge on CIZS side.Under light irradiation, electrons are photoexcited from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band.In this case, the existence of internal electric field is conducive to the recombination between the photogenerated electrons in CIZS conduction band and holes in CCN valence band, which is consistent with the direct Zscheme charge transfer mode.Factors including internal electric field and Coulomb repulsion may hinder the electrons transfer from CCN to CIZS and the holes transfer from CIZS to CCN.The capture experiments of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids (Fig. 7f) can effectively support this theoretical analysis.As the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO is at -0.53 V vs. NHE, which is more positive than the CB potential of CCN (-1.22 V) and negative than that of CIZS(1-3) (0.17 V).Therefore, the traditional type II charge transfer mode can be eliminated because the CB potential of CIZS could not reduce CO 2 to CO.Alternatively, the charge transfer is more likely to form direct Z-scheme route as shown in the left of Fig. 68.Compared with CIZS(1-2) and CIZS (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6), the work function of CIZS (1-3) sample is much closer to CCN.After semiconductors coupling, the electrons in conduction band of CCN at CIZS(1-3)/CCN heterojunction may possess the stronger reduction ability compared with CIZS(1-2)/ CCN and CIZS(1-6)/CCN hybrids.On the other hand, the optical absorption capacity of hybrids is closely related to the band gap of the semiconductor.As shown in Table 2, the band gap of CIZS(1-3) (1.66 eV) is between CIZS(1-2) (1.56 eV) and CIZS(1-6) (1.90 eV).Therefore, the CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample may have good light absorption capacity.Meanwhile, the light absorption edge of CIZS(1-3) is greater than nm, which is beneficial to improve the near-infrared degradation of MO over CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids.From these conclusions, we can conclude that the fine adjustment of the energy band position in semiconductor heterojunction can effectively balance the optical absorption capacity and energy band matching in the photocatalytic reaction, thus effectively improving the photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction."}, {"llm generation": "Solar", "source": "In addition, the hybrids developed in this research have good near-infrared activity, which provides a new method for the development of photocatalysts for full spectrum utilization of solar energy.", "context": "In summary, a series of CIZS/CCN hybrids were successfully synthesized via a facile solvothermal method for CO 2 reduction and MO near-infrared degradation.The results show that the band gap of CIZS can be regularly adjusted from 1.56 eV to 1.90 eV by changing the molar ratio of In and Zn in the precursors.In addition, the interaction between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of CCN and the functional groups of L-cysteine promotes the binding of heterojunction interface, which enhances the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers on the interface.Due to the tunable energy band structure of CIZS and the light absorption capacity of CIZS/CCN hybrids, the optimized CIZS/CCN hybrids exhibit a MO near-infrared degradation efficiency of 96.5 in 5 h and CO production rate of 50.04 mol/g in 8 h.Moreover, the CIZS/CCN hybrids show good photostability. O 2 -and h are the main active species in the process of photocatalytic degradation.This study provides a valuable way to adjust the band matching of heterostructures and improve the photocatalytic performance.In addition, the hybrids developed in this research have good near-infrared activity, which provides a new method for the development of photocatalysts for full spectrum utilization of solar energy.

Ltd and used without further purification.L-cysteine was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. The carboxylated g-C 3 N 4 substrates were fabricated by refluxing g-C 3 N 4 bulks in HNO 3 solution 51.In detail, the mixtures of urea and dicyandiamide with mass ratio 7:3 were firstly heated to 550 C with the heating ramp of 2 C/min and then kept for 4 h in the furnace to obtain g-C 3 N 4 bulks (abbreviated as CN) through thermal polymerization process.Secondly, 1 g of g-C 3 N 4 bulks was added into 100 mL of 5 M HNO 3 solution and refluxed for 24 h at 125 C. The obtained suspensions were naturally cooled to room temperature.Through centrifugation and washing with deionized water, the solid products was vacuum dried at 35 C for 12 h to obtain carboxylated g-C 3 N 4 (denoted as CCN) . A series of CuInZnS (abbreviated as CIZS) photocatalysts were prepared via a facile solvothermal method.In a typical synthesis process, mmol CuCl, 1 mmol InCl 3 4H 2 O and X mmol (X 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively) Zn(Ac) 2 2H 2 O were firstly dissolved in 80 mL of DMF solvents, and then 2 mmol L-cysteine was introduced into the mixture solutions.Meanwhile, 6 M HCl were slowly introduced to the mixtures under constant stirring to obtain the clear solution, which were transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 180 C for 18 h.After the autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature, the products were collected by filtration and washed for several times with deionized water and ethanol and finally dried under vacuum at -40 C for 8 h 48.The as-obtained CIZS catalysts were denoted as CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3), CIZS(1-4), CIZS(1-5), and CIZS (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6), where the molar ratios of In 3 ions and Zn 2 ions during synthesis process were 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, and 1:6, respectively. In order to prepare CIZS/CCN hybrids, the first step was similar to the preparation process of CIZS.The difference is that a certain amount of CCN powder was uniformly dispersed in the transparent solution after the introduction of HCl.As CIZS is a ternary-binary solid solution composed of ternary chalcopyrite CuInS 2 and binary zincblende ZnS, its optical band gap is adjustable.Simultaneously, due to their similar ionic radii, the occupation sites of Cu , In 3 and Zn 2 may be random in real crystals.The nominal proportion of CIZS and CCN in the hybrids was calculated by the molar mass of the added precursor.When the precursors used for the synthesis of CIZS include 1 mmol CuCl, 1 mmol InCl 3 4H 2 O, 3 mmol Zn(Ac) 2 2H 2 O, and 2.5 mmol L-cysteine, and 0.5 g of CCN substrates, the as-prepared hybrid was denoted as 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN.In the same way, 17 CIZS(1-3)/CCN, 29 CIZS(1-3)/CCN, CIZS(1-3)/CCN and 56 CIZS (1-3)/CCN can be well synthesized by reducing or expanding the amount of precursors added in proportion.In order to prepare different 47 CIZS/CCN hybrids, the nominal mass of CIZS and the molar ratio of Cu , In 3 and L-cysteine (1:1:2.5)were kept as constant, while the molar ratio of In 3 to Zn 2 changed.Thus, 47 CIZS(1-2)/CCN, 47 CIZS (1-4)/CCN, 47 CIZS (1-5)/CCN, and 47 CIZS (1-6)/CCN hybrids can be obtained. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of CIZS/CCN hybrids were performed on an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Ka source with In order to test the migration properties of photogenerated carriers in different samples under visible light irradiation, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photocurrent were measured on a CHI 660E electrochemical station using a conventional three electrode system.The working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode were FTO glass coated with samples, SCE electrode and platinum wire respectively.Among them, the working electrode was prepared by adding 10 mg of sample powder into Nafion solution diluted with ethanol and evenly distributing on FTO glass (2 cm 2 cm).The electrolyte used in this experiment was 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution. CO 2 reduction performance of the samples was tested in a 120 mL cylindrical glassware reactor with quartz glass on the top.The light source was provided by a 300 W Xe lamp with 400 nm cut-off filter.50 mg of catalyst sample was evenly dispersed on a round Petri dish with an area of 9 cm 2 and placed in the reactor.The distance between sample and light source was fixed at 11 cm, and the visible light was irradiated on the surface of sample through the quartz glass on the upper part of the reactor.Before photoreduction experiment, high purity CO 2 (99.9) should be continuously pumped into the reactor for 15 min to remove the residual air and keep the ambient pressure in the reactor.At the same time, 2 mL of deionized water should be injected into the bottom of reactor as reducing agent.During the photoreduction experiment, 0.5 mL of gas product was extracted from the reactor every 2 h as a sample, and was quantitatively identified by GC-7920 gas chromatography equipped with flame ionization detector (FID).The photocatalytic stability of the samples was evaluated by four cycle experiments. The photocatalytic performance of different samples was evaluated by near-infrared degradation of methyl orange (MO) solution.The nearinfrared light source was provided by a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a total reflector and a 700 nm cut-off filter.In a typical experiment, 50 mg of pure CIZS(1-3) or CIZS/CCN hybrids was added into 100 mL of MO (10 mg/L) aqueous solution, and the suspension was obtained by ultrasound.Before the reaction, the suspension was stirred magnetically in the dark for 30 min in order to reach the adsorption-desorption equilibrium.In the process of illumination, 4 mL of aliquots was collected from the suspension every 1 h and the photocatalysts powder were removed by centrifugation to obtain a clear solution.The concentration of the clear solution was determined by a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 463 nm.During the reaction, the active species were determined by capture experiments.1 mM potassium iodide (KI), 1 mM isopropanol (IPA) and argon (Ar) were used as h , OH and scavengers respectively."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The photocatalytic activity of the obtained samples was evaluated by reducing CO 2 to CO under visible light irradiation and degrading MO under near-infrared irradiation.", "context": "Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of CIZS samples prepared with different ratios of In and Zn.For all samples, the main diffraction peaks located at 28.0 , 46.6 , and 55.2 can be attributed to CIZS with cubic zinc blende structure (PDF 47-1370), corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 2 0), and (1 3 1) planes 45.In addition, the diffraction peaks at 27.9 , 46.5 , and 55.2 in the pattern of CIZS(1-2) sample are observed 49, which can be indexed to CuInS 2 phases (PDF 75-0106).With the increase of In and Zn ratio from 1:2 to 1:3, the diffraction peaks of CuInS 2 phases disappear and the pure CIZS phases are obtained.It can be seen that the diffraction peak of the sample is wider, indicating that the particle size of the sample is smaller.Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of the synthesized CIZS/CCN hybrids and the bare CCN sample.Two characteristic peaks of graphite carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) phase at 13.7 and 27.4 are observed in all samples.In particular, the bare CCN exhibits a sharp diffraction peak, which proves that the refluxing process in nitric acid solution has no effect on the crystallinity of g-C 3 N 4 .For all CIZS/CCN hybrids with different ratios of In and Zn, there is no significant difference in the XRD peak position and strength.In addition to two diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 , three characteristic peaks of CIZS are also found, indicating that CIZS has been successfully deposited on the surface of CCN. In order to further study the microstructure of different samples, the morphology and composition of pure CCN, CIZS and CIZS/CCN hybrids were investigated by SEM and TEM images.As shown in Fig. 2a and2b, CCN clearly displays the characteristic morphology of nanosheets and nanoparticles, indicating that the refluxing process in HNO 3 solution effectively reduces the size of g-C 3 N 4 bulks.Fig. 2c and2d show the morphology of pure CIZS(1-3).It can be seen that pure CIZS(1-3) consists of numerous nanosheets and nanoparticles.During the synthesis process, the morphology of CIZS samples prepared with different ratios of In and Zn did not change significantly as shown in Fig. S1a-S1d.After coupling CIZS with CCN, CIZS is uniformly loaded on the surface of CCN, as shown in Fig. 2e and2f.For CIZS/CCN hybrids different mass ratios of CCN and CIZS, there is no obvious morphological change, as observed in Fig. S1e-S1j.The HRTEM images and EDS spectra of 47 CIZS(1-3)/ CCN hybrids are further shown in Fig. 3. Typical sheet-on-sheet and particle-on-sheet structures can be clearly observed in Fig. 3a and3b, which is accordance with the SEM results.The lattice images of composite are shown in Fig. 3c and3d.The interplanar crystal spacing of 0.31 nm is consistent with the (1 1 1) plane of CIZS 52, indicating that CIZS grows on the surface of CCN.The corresponding element mapping images in Fig. 3d-3j further verify the compositions of hybrids are S2.In order to explore the specific surface areas of samples, a nitrogen adsorption-analysis study was carried out.As shown in Fig. 4, the three samples exhibit type IV isotherms with a type H3 hysteresis loops at a higher relative pressure, indicating that the pores are produced by the accumulation of sheet-like structures 53.The specific surface areas of the CCN sample, the CIZS(1-3) sample and the 47 CIZS (1-3)/CCN hybrids are 81.93 mfoot0 g -1 , 43.12 m 2 g -1 and 52.81 m 2 g -1 , respectively.As compared to pure CIZS(1-3), 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids exhibit the larger specific surface area, which may promote the surface adsorption of target molecules and enhance the photocatalytic performance. The surface chemical compositions of as-obtained samples were investigated by XPS.As shown in Fig. S3, the measured scanning spectra of pure CIZS(1-3) and 47 CIZS (1-3)/CCN hybrids show the Cu, In, Zn and S elements in CIZS, also C and N elements in CCN.The high resolution spectra of Cu 2p 3/2 (931.83eV) and Cu 2p 1/2 (951.68 eV) correspond to the Cu in CIZS(1-3) 52, which shift to 932.03 eV and 951.87 eV for 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample in Fig. 5a.Similarly, the high resolution spectra of In 3d, Zn 2p and S 2p are located at 444.58 eV (In 3d 5/ which are consistent with the previous reports.After coupling with CCN, the peak values are 444.88eV, 452.48 eV, 1022.19 eV, 1045.36 eV, 161.78 eV, 162.82 eV, respectively.At 284.92 eV, the C 1 s peak of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN is attributed to the carbon impurity adsorbed on the catalyst surface, and the other two peaks at 285.94 eV and 287.9 eV are ascribed to the defect position (C N) and the sp 2 hybridized C (N-C N) atoms in Fig. 5e 49.The N 1 s spectra of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN can be fitted into four peaks at 398.3 eV (sp 2 -bonded N atoms, C-N C), 399.1 eV (ternary N groups, N-(C) 3 ), 400.4 eV (amine groups, C-N-H) and 404.0 eV (-excitations), respectively, as shown in Fig. 5f.All these results clearly show that the heterojunction structure is successfully formed between CCN and CIZS, rather than simple physical mixture. The FT-IR spectra of CIZS(1-3), g-C 3 N 4 (CN), CCN and 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN are shown in Fig. 6a.All the absorption bands of pure CCN belong to its typical molecular structure.The peak at 1646 cm -1 is attributed to the C N stretching vibration, while the peaks of 1565 cm -1 , 1408 cm -1 , 1320 cm -1 and 1238 cm -1 are related to stretching vibration of aromatic C-N.The intense band at 807 cm -1 can be assigned to the out-plane vibration mode of triazine units 54.The broad band at 3430 cm -1 is attributed to OH -groups adsorbed on the surface 55.For pure CIZS(1-3), the peak located at 1624 cm -1 is caused by stretching vibration C O.The apparent absorption peak of the -OH group at 3452 cm -1 and the characteristic peak of -COO-at 1394 cm -1 are observed, which may be ascribed to L-cysteine biomolecules assisted hydrothermal strategy.The disappearance of -SH peak at 2550 cm -1 indicates that there is a close relationship between thiol groups and metal atoms are formed 56.Similar results are also found in FTIR spectra of CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-4), CIZS(1-5) and CIZS(1-6) samples, as shown in Fig. S4a.In addition, the spectrum of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids is similar to that of pure CCN, indicating that the chemical structure of CCN in 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids is not destroyed.In the 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample, the vibration band of triazine unites at 805 cm -1 shifts slightly to the direction of higher wavenumber, which indicates that the chemical bond is formed between CCN and CIZS rather than simple physical connection.Fig. S4b shows the same trend for the other CIZS/CCN hybrids.The enlarged FTIR spectra of CN and CCN are shown in Fig. 6b.The peak at 1675 cm -1 corresponds to the C O bending band, while the absorption band at 1558 cm -1 and 1386 cm -1 can be attributed to -COO-groups, indicating the successful functionalization of carboxyl groups on CCN surface 57.FITR results show that carboxylated CCN can form stable bond with CIZS, which may promote the formation of electron transfer channels and improve the photocatalytic performance. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained samples was evaluated by reducing CO 2 to CO under visible light irradiation and degrading MO under near-infrared irradiation.Fig. 7a shows the yields of CO over all the different 47 CIZS/CCN hybrids.Compared with pure CCN sample, the yields of CO for all 47 CIZS/CCN hybrids have been greatly enhanced, following the order 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-2)/ CCN 47 CIZS(1-4)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-5)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-6)/ CCN CCN.The 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample exhibits the highest CO yield of 38.93 mol/g within 8 h, which is 4.93 times higher than that of pure CCN (7.9 mol/g).Fig. 7b shows the recycle capacity of 47 CIZS (1-3)/CCN sample for CO 2 reduction.It can be seen that the yields of CO slightly decreases after four cycles, indicating that the photostability of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample is excellent.Meanwhile, as show in Fig. 7c, the CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids with different mass ratios are explored for CO 2 reduction performance.In a series of CIZS(1-3)/CCN samples, the CO 2 reduction ability follows the order 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 29 CIZS (1-3)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 17 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 56 CIZS(1-3)/CCN.Among different samples, 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample exhibits the highest CO yields of 50.04 mol/g within 8 h, which is 6.33 times higher than that of pure CCN.Mass ratio and CIZS types are the main factors that affect the final performance of hybrids.Fig. 7d shows the recycle capacity of 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample for CO 2 reduction.The 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample also demonstrates the excellent photostability after four cycles. To further evaluate the photocatalytic performance of different samples, near-infrared degradation of MO is displayed in Fig. 7e.The degradation efficiency of MO over 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids reaches 96.5 in 5 h, which is approximately 2.80 times higher than that of pure CIZS(1-3) sample.In addition, before exploring the near-infrared degradation performance of the photocatalyst, the MO adsorption experiments were carried out over different samples in dark, as shown in Fig. S5.All MO adsorption curves show that the adsorption-desorption equilibrium reaches in 5 min.Interestingly, the MO adsorption rate is increased with the increase of CIZS(1-3) content in hybrids.Meanwhile, the capture experiments of reactive species are shown in Fig. 7f.The degradation efficiency of MO over 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids is greatly inhibited with the Ar gas introduction, indicating -is the main active specie in the photocatalytic process.When KI was introduced into the solution, the activity of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN is also seriously restrained, suggesting that h is another active specie.However, there is no significant change when IPA was added, suggesting that OH is not the main active substance in the degradation process.As shown in Table 1 5859606162636465, CO 2 reduction performance and MO near-infrared degradation performance of CIZS/CCN hybrids in this paper are compared with the other references. In order to explore the possible photocatalytic mechanism, the recombination rate and separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs on different samples were studied by PEC experiments.The photocurrent density of CIZS/CCN hybrid films prepared with different ratio of In to Zn was firstly analyzed.Higher photocurrent response usually means better electron-hole pairs separation efficiency.As shown in Fig. 8a, it can be observed that the hybrid film prepared by 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN respectively, which are reduced to 3.84 ns and 3.59 ns for 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN and 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN samples, indicating a nonradioactive pathway from the electronic interaction between CCN and CIZS(1-3), and the acceleration of the photogenerated charges transfer 66.In addition, PEC results of CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrid films with different mass ratios were also conducted and shown in Fig. 8e.It can be observed the hybrid films prepared by 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN and 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN show the similar photocurrent density.However, as the mass ratio of CIZS increases to 56, the photocurrent density of film decreases to 1.2 Acm -2 , resulting in the increase of interface charge recombination and the decrease of electron transfer efficiency.As shown in Fig. 8f, 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample displays the minimum radius of Nyquist curve, which further verifies the results of photocurrent experiment.Fig. 9 shows the UV-vis-NIR DRS spectra of CN, CCN and CIZS samples.In Fig. 9a, the absorption edge of CCN sample shows a blue shift compared with CN sample.Combined with the results of Fig. 6b, it can be concluded that the carboxylation of CCN is successful.As shown in Fig. 9b, the optical band gaps of different samples are calculated according to the relationship between (ah) 2 and (h), in which the band gaps of CN and CCN are determined to be 2.71 eV and 2.82 eV.Fig. 9c shows the absorption spectra of CIZS with different molar ratios of In and Zn.Obviously, CIZS samples have strong absorption ability from UV to NIR region, which indicates that CIZS may have near-infrared photocatalytic activity.With the increase of molar ratio of In to Zn from 1:2 to 1:6, the near-infrared absorption capacity of CIZS decreases.In Fig. 9d, band gaps of CIZS samples are calculated as 1.56 eV (CIZS(1-2)), 1.66 eV (CIZS(1-3)), 1.76 eV (CIZS(1-4)) and 1.84 eV (CIZS(1-5)) and 1.90 eV (CIZS(1-6)).It can be observed that band gap can be adjusted by changing the molar ratio of In 3 to Zn 2 . The ionization potentials (equivalent to the valence band energy (E v )) of CCN, CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3) and CIZS(1-6) were analyzed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).The E v of CCN, CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3) and CIZS (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6) samples are calculated to be 1.6 eV, 1.76 eV, 1.83 eV and 2.05 eV by subtracting the width of the He I UPS spectrum from the excitation energy (21.22 eV), as shown in Fig. S7.Therefore, the conduction band energies (E c ) of different samples are estimated to be -1.22 eV, 0.2 eV, 0.17 eV and 0.15 eV, respectively 67.According to equation h E Cutoff -E Ferm , the measured work function is the absolute value of the work function, which is only related to the excitation source energy hv (which is known, Hel hv 21.22 eV).In order to clearly distinguish the secondary electron emission cutoff (E Cutoff ) from the spectrometer cutoff, the negative bias on the sample is usually measured.According to Fig. S8, the work functions of CCN, CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3) and CIZS(1-6) can be calculated as 4.38 eV, 5.98 eV, 5.9 eV and 6.18 eV, respectively. Based on the above calculations, the possible mechanism over CIZS/ CCN hybrids is proposed in Fig. 10.When CIZS contacts CCN, the free electrons of CCN may transfer to CIZS due to its low work function until their Fermi levels reach equilibrium.As a result, the internal electric field is constructed, and the band edge bending occurs at the interface with positive charge on CCN side and negative charge on CIZS side.Under light irradiation, electrons are photoexcited from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band.In this case, the existence of internal electric field is conducive to the recombination between the photogenerated electrons in CIZS conduction band and holes in CCN valence band, which is consistent with the direct Zscheme charge transfer mode.Factors including internal electric field and Coulomb repulsion may hinder the electrons transfer from CCN to CIZS and the holes transfer from CIZS to CCN.The capture experiments of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids (Fig. 7f) can effectively support this theoretical analysis.As the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO is at -0.53 V vs. NHE, which is more positive than the CB potential of CCN (-1.22 V) and negative than that of CIZS(1-3) (0.17 V).Therefore, the traditional type II charge transfer mode can be eliminated because the CB potential of CIZS could not reduce CO 2 to CO.Alternatively, the charge transfer is more likely to form direct Z-scheme route as shown in the left of Fig. 68.Compared with CIZS(1-2) and CIZS (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6), the work function of CIZS (1-3) sample is much closer to CCN.After semiconductors coupling, the electrons in conduction band of CCN at CIZS(1-3)/CCN heterojunction may possess the stronger reduction ability compared with CIZS(1-2)/ CCN and CIZS(1-6)/CCN hybrids.On the other hand, the optical absorption capacity of hybrids is closely related to the band gap of the semiconductor.As shown in Table 2, the band gap of CIZS(1-3) (1.66 eV) is between CIZS(1-2) (1.56 eV) and CIZS(1-6) (1.90 eV).Therefore, the CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample may have good light absorption capacity.Meanwhile, the light absorption edge of CIZS(1-3) is greater than nm, which is beneficial to improve the near-infrared degradation of MO over CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids.From these conclusions, we can conclude that the fine adjustment of the energy band position in semiconductor heterojunction can effectively balance the optical absorption capacity and energy band matching in the photocatalytic reaction, thus effectively improving the photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The photocatalytic activity of the obtained samples was evaluated by reducing CO 2 to CO under visible light irradiation and degrading MO under near-infrared irradiation.", "context": "Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of CIZS samples prepared with different ratios of In and Zn.For all samples, the main diffraction peaks located at 28.0 , 46.6 , and 55.2 can be attributed to CIZS with cubic zinc blende structure (PDF 47-1370), corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 2 0), and (1 3 1) planes 45.In addition, the diffraction peaks at 27.9 , 46.5 , and 55.2 in the pattern of CIZS(1-2) sample are observed 49, which can be indexed to CuInS 2 phases (PDF 75-0106).With the increase of In and Zn ratio from 1:2 to 1:3, the diffraction peaks of CuInS 2 phases disappear and the pure CIZS phases are obtained.It can be seen that the diffraction peak of the sample is wider, indicating that the particle size of the sample is smaller.Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of the synthesized CIZS/CCN hybrids and the bare CCN sample.Two characteristic peaks of graphite carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) phase at 13.7 and 27.4 are observed in all samples.In particular, the bare CCN exhibits a sharp diffraction peak, which proves that the refluxing process in nitric acid solution has no effect on the crystallinity of g-C 3 N 4 .For all CIZS/CCN hybrids with different ratios of In and Zn, there is no significant difference in the XRD peak position and strength.In addition to two diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 , three characteristic peaks of CIZS are also found, indicating that CIZS has been successfully deposited on the surface of CCN. In order to further study the microstructure of different samples, the morphology and composition of pure CCN, CIZS and CIZS/CCN hybrids were investigated by SEM and TEM images.As shown in Fig. 2a and2b, CCN clearly displays the characteristic morphology of nanosheets and nanoparticles, indicating that the refluxing process in HNO 3 solution effectively reduces the size of g-C 3 N 4 bulks.Fig. 2c and2d show the morphology of pure CIZS(1-3).It can be seen that pure CIZS(1-3) consists of numerous nanosheets and nanoparticles.During the synthesis process, the morphology of CIZS samples prepared with different ratios of In and Zn did not change significantly as shown in Fig. S1a-S1d.After coupling CIZS with CCN, CIZS is uniformly loaded on the surface of CCN, as shown in Fig. 2e and2f.For CIZS/CCN hybrids different mass ratios of CCN and CIZS, there is no obvious morphological change, as observed in Fig. S1e-S1j.The HRTEM images and EDS spectra of 47 CIZS(1-3)/ CCN hybrids are further shown in Fig. 3. Typical sheet-on-sheet and particle-on-sheet structures can be clearly observed in Fig. 3a and3b, which is accordance with the SEM results.The lattice images of composite are shown in Fig. 3c and3d.The interplanar crystal spacing of 0.31 nm is consistent with the (1 1 1) plane of CIZS 52, indicating that CIZS grows on the surface of CCN.The corresponding element mapping images in Fig. 3d-3j further verify the compositions of hybrids are S2.In order to explore the specific surface areas of samples, a nitrogen adsorption-analysis study was carried out.As shown in Fig. 4, the three samples exhibit type IV isotherms with a type H3 hysteresis loops at a higher relative pressure, indicating that the pores are produced by the accumulation of sheet-like structures 53.The specific surface areas of the CCN sample, the CIZS(1-3) sample and the 47 CIZS (1-3)/CCN hybrids are 81.93 mfoot0 g -1 , 43.12 m 2 g -1 and 52.81 m 2 g -1 , respectively.As compared to pure CIZS(1-3), 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids exhibit the larger specific surface area, which may promote the surface adsorption of target molecules and enhance the photocatalytic performance. The surface chemical compositions of as-obtained samples were investigated by XPS.As shown in Fig. S3, the measured scanning spectra of pure CIZS(1-3) and 47 CIZS (1-3)/CCN hybrids show the Cu, In, Zn and S elements in CIZS, also C and N elements in CCN.The high resolution spectra of Cu 2p 3/2 (931.83eV) and Cu 2p 1/2 (951.68 eV) correspond to the Cu in CIZS(1-3) 52, which shift to 932.03 eV and 951.87 eV for 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample in Fig. 5a.Similarly, the high resolution spectra of In 3d, Zn 2p and S 2p are located at 444.58 eV (In 3d 5/ which are consistent with the previous reports.After coupling with CCN, the peak values are 444.88eV, 452.48 eV, 1022.19 eV, 1045.36 eV, 161.78 eV, 162.82 eV, respectively.At 284.92 eV, the C 1 s peak of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN is attributed to the carbon impurity adsorbed on the catalyst surface, and the other two peaks at 285.94 eV and 287.9 eV are ascribed to the defect position (C N) and the sp 2 hybridized C (N-C N) atoms in Fig. 5e 49.The N 1 s spectra of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN can be fitted into four peaks at 398.3 eV (sp 2 -bonded N atoms, C-N C), 399.1 eV (ternary N groups, N-(C) 3 ), 400.4 eV (amine groups, C-N-H) and 404.0 eV (-excitations), respectively, as shown in Fig. 5f.All these results clearly show that the heterojunction structure is successfully formed between CCN and CIZS, rather than simple physical mixture. The FT-IR spectra of CIZS(1-3), g-C 3 N 4 (CN), CCN and 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN are shown in Fig. 6a.All the absorption bands of pure CCN belong to its typical molecular structure.The peak at 1646 cm -1 is attributed to the C N stretching vibration, while the peaks of 1565 cm -1 , 1408 cm -1 , 1320 cm -1 and 1238 cm -1 are related to stretching vibration of aromatic C-N.The intense band at 807 cm -1 can be assigned to the out-plane vibration mode of triazine units 54.The broad band at 3430 cm -1 is attributed to OH -groups adsorbed on the surface 55.For pure CIZS(1-3), the peak located at 1624 cm -1 is caused by stretching vibration C O.The apparent absorption peak of the -OH group at 3452 cm -1 and the characteristic peak of -COO-at 1394 cm -1 are observed, which may be ascribed to L-cysteine biomolecules assisted hydrothermal strategy.The disappearance of -SH peak at 2550 cm -1 indicates that there is a close relationship between thiol groups and metal atoms are formed 56.Similar results are also found in FTIR spectra of CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-4), CIZS(1-5) and CIZS(1-6) samples, as shown in Fig. S4a.In addition, the spectrum of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids is similar to that of pure CCN, indicating that the chemical structure of CCN in 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids is not destroyed.In the 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample, the vibration band of triazine unites at 805 cm -1 shifts slightly to the direction of higher wavenumber, which indicates that the chemical bond is formed between CCN and CIZS rather than simple physical connection.Fig. S4b shows the same trend for the other CIZS/CCN hybrids.The enlarged FTIR spectra of CN and CCN are shown in Fig. 6b.The peak at 1675 cm -1 corresponds to the C O bending band, while the absorption band at 1558 cm -1 and 1386 cm -1 can be attributed to -COO-groups, indicating the successful functionalization of carboxyl groups on CCN surface 57.FITR results show that carboxylated CCN can form stable bond with CIZS, which may promote the formation of electron transfer channels and improve the photocatalytic performance. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained samples was evaluated by reducing CO 2 to CO under visible light irradiation and degrading MO under near-infrared irradiation.Fig. 7a shows the yields of CO over all the different 47 CIZS/CCN hybrids.Compared with pure CCN sample, the yields of CO for all 47 CIZS/CCN hybrids have been greatly enhanced, following the order 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-2)/ CCN 47 CIZS(1-4)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-5)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-6)/ CCN CCN.The 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample exhibits the highest CO yield of 38.93 mol/g within 8 h, which is 4.93 times higher than that of pure CCN (7.9 mol/g).Fig. 7b shows the recycle capacity of 47 CIZS (1-3)/CCN sample for CO 2 reduction.It can be seen that the yields of CO slightly decreases after four cycles, indicating that the photostability of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample is excellent.Meanwhile, as show in Fig. 7c, the CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids with different mass ratios are explored for CO 2 reduction performance.In a series of CIZS(1-3)/CCN samples, the CO 2 reduction ability follows the order 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 29 CIZS (1-3)/CCN 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 17 CIZS(1-3)/CCN 56 CIZS(1-3)/CCN.Among different samples, 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample exhibits the highest CO yields of 50.04 mol/g within 8 h, which is 6.33 times higher than that of pure CCN.Mass ratio and CIZS types are the main factors that affect the final performance of hybrids.Fig. 7d shows the recycle capacity of 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample for CO 2 reduction.The 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample also demonstrates the excellent photostability after four cycles. To further evaluate the photocatalytic performance of different samples, near-infrared degradation of MO is displayed in Fig. 7e.The degradation efficiency of MO over 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids reaches 96.5 in 5 h, which is approximately 2.80 times higher than that of pure CIZS(1-3) sample.In addition, before exploring the near-infrared degradation performance of the photocatalyst, the MO adsorption experiments were carried out over different samples in dark, as shown in Fig. S5.All MO adsorption curves show that the adsorption-desorption equilibrium reaches in 5 min.Interestingly, the MO adsorption rate is increased with the increase of CIZS(1-3) content in hybrids.Meanwhile, the capture experiments of reactive species are shown in Fig. 7f.The degradation efficiency of MO over 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids is greatly inhibited with the Ar gas introduction, indicating -is the main active specie in the photocatalytic process.When KI was introduced into the solution, the activity of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN is also seriously restrained, suggesting that h is another active specie.However, there is no significant change when IPA was added, suggesting that OH is not the main active substance in the degradation process.As shown in Table 1 5859606162636465, CO 2 reduction performance and MO near-infrared degradation performance of CIZS/CCN hybrids in this paper are compared with the other references. In order to explore the possible photocatalytic mechanism, the recombination rate and separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs on different samples were studied by PEC experiments.The photocurrent density of CIZS/CCN hybrid films prepared with different ratio of In to Zn was firstly analyzed.Higher photocurrent response usually means better electron-hole pairs separation efficiency.As shown in Fig. 8a, it can be observed that the hybrid film prepared by 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN respectively, which are reduced to 3.84 ns and 3.59 ns for 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN and 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN samples, indicating a nonradioactive pathway from the electronic interaction between CCN and CIZS(1-3), and the acceleration of the photogenerated charges transfer 66.In addition, PEC results of CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrid films with different mass ratios were also conducted and shown in Fig. 8e.It can be observed the hybrid films prepared by 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN and 38 CIZS(1-3)/CCN show the similar photocurrent density.However, as the mass ratio of CIZS increases to 56, the photocurrent density of film decreases to 1.2 Acm -2 , resulting in the increase of interface charge recombination and the decrease of electron transfer efficiency.As shown in Fig. 8f, 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample displays the minimum radius of Nyquist curve, which further verifies the results of photocurrent experiment.Fig. 9 shows the UV-vis-NIR DRS spectra of CN, CCN and CIZS samples.In Fig. 9a, the absorption edge of CCN sample shows a blue shift compared with CN sample.Combined with the results of Fig. 6b, it can be concluded that the carboxylation of CCN is successful.As shown in Fig. 9b, the optical band gaps of different samples are calculated according to the relationship between (ah) 2 and (h), in which the band gaps of CN and CCN are determined to be 2.71 eV and 2.82 eV.Fig. 9c shows the absorption spectra of CIZS with different molar ratios of In and Zn.Obviously, CIZS samples have strong absorption ability from UV to NIR region, which indicates that CIZS may have near-infrared photocatalytic activity.With the increase of molar ratio of In to Zn from 1:2 to 1:6, the near-infrared absorption capacity of CIZS decreases.In Fig. 9d, band gaps of CIZS samples are calculated as 1.56 eV (CIZS(1-2)), 1.66 eV (CIZS(1-3)), 1.76 eV (CIZS(1-4)) and 1.84 eV (CIZS(1-5)) and 1.90 eV (CIZS(1-6)).It can be observed that band gap can be adjusted by changing the molar ratio of In 3 to Zn 2 . The ionization potentials (equivalent to the valence band energy (E v )) of CCN, CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3) and CIZS(1-6) were analyzed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).The E v of CCN, CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3) and CIZS (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6) samples are calculated to be 1.6 eV, 1.76 eV, 1.83 eV and 2.05 eV by subtracting the width of the He I UPS spectrum from the excitation energy (21.22 eV), as shown in Fig. S7.Therefore, the conduction band energies (E c ) of different samples are estimated to be -1.22 eV, 0.2 eV, 0.17 eV and 0.15 eV, respectively 67.According to equation h E Cutoff -E Ferm , the measured work function is the absolute value of the work function, which is only related to the excitation source energy hv (which is known, Hel hv 21.22 eV).In order to clearly distinguish the secondary electron emission cutoff (E Cutoff ) from the spectrometer cutoff, the negative bias on the sample is usually measured.According to Fig. S8, the work functions of CCN, CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3) and CIZS(1-6) can be calculated as 4.38 eV, 5.98 eV, 5.9 eV and 6.18 eV, respectively. Based on the above calculations, the possible mechanism over CIZS/ CCN hybrids is proposed in Fig. 10.When CIZS contacts CCN, the free electrons of CCN may transfer to CIZS due to its low work function until their Fermi levels reach equilibrium.As a result, the internal electric field is constructed, and the band edge bending occurs at the interface with positive charge on CCN side and negative charge on CIZS side.Under light irradiation, electrons are photoexcited from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band.In this case, the existence of internal electric field is conducive to the recombination between the photogenerated electrons in CIZS conduction band and holes in CCN valence band, which is consistent with the direct Zscheme charge transfer mode.Factors including internal electric field and Coulomb repulsion may hinder the electrons transfer from CCN to CIZS and the holes transfer from CIZS to CCN.The capture experiments of 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids (Fig. 7f) can effectively support this theoretical analysis.As the reduction potential of CO 2 /CO is at -0.53 V vs. NHE, which is more positive than the CB potential of CCN (-1.22 V) and negative than that of CIZS(1-3) (0.17 V).Therefore, the traditional type II charge transfer mode can be eliminated because the CB potential of CIZS could not reduce CO 2 to CO.Alternatively, the charge transfer is more likely to form direct Z-scheme route as shown in the left of Fig. 68.Compared with CIZS(1-2) and CIZS (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6), the work function of CIZS (1-3) sample is much closer to CCN.After semiconductors coupling, the electrons in conduction band of CCN at CIZS(1-3)/CCN heterojunction may possess the stronger reduction ability compared with CIZS(1-2)/ CCN and CIZS(1-6)/CCN hybrids.On the other hand, the optical absorption capacity of hybrids is closely related to the band gap of the semiconductor.As shown in Table 2, the band gap of CIZS(1-3) (1.66 eV) is between CIZS(1-2) (1.56 eV) and CIZS(1-6) (1.90 eV).Therefore, the CIZS(1-3)/CCN sample may have good light absorption capacity.Meanwhile, the light absorption edge of CIZS(1-3) is greater than nm, which is beneficial to improve the near-infrared degradation of MO over CIZS(1-3)/CCN hybrids.From these conclusions, we can conclude that the fine adjustment of the energy band position in semiconductor heterojunction can effectively balance the optical absorption capacity and energy band matching in the photocatalytic reaction, thus effectively improving the photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Due to the tunable energy band structure of CIZS and the light absorption capacity of CIZS/CCN hybrids, the optimized CIZS/CCN hybrids exhibit a MO near-infrared degradation efficiency of 96.5 in 5 h and CO production rate of 50.04 mol/g in 8 h.", "context": "In summary, a series of CIZS/CCN hybrids were successfully synthesized via a facile solvothermal method for CO 2 reduction and MO near-infrared degradation.The results show that the band gap of CIZS can be regularly adjusted from 1.56 eV to 1.90 eV by changing the molar ratio of In and Zn in the precursors.In addition, the interaction between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of CCN and the functional groups of L-cysteine promotes the binding of heterojunction interface, which enhances the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers on the interface.Due to the tunable energy band structure of CIZS and the light absorption capacity of CIZS/CCN hybrids, the optimized CIZS/CCN hybrids exhibit a MO near-infrared degradation efficiency of 96.5 in 5 h and CO production rate of 50.04 mol/g in 8 h.Moreover, the CIZS/CCN hybrids show good photostability. O 2 -and h are the main active species in the process of photocatalytic degradation.This study provides a valuable way to adjust the band matching of heterostructures and improve the photocatalytic performance.In addition, the hybrids developed in this research have good near-infrared activity, which provides a new method for the development of photocatalysts for full spectrum utilization of solar energy.

Ltd and used without further purification.L-cysteine was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. The carboxylated g-C 3 N 4 substrates were fabricated by refluxing g-C 3 N 4 bulks in HNO 3 solution 51.In detail, the mixtures of urea and dicyandiamide with mass ratio 7:3 were firstly heated to 550 C with the heating ramp of 2 C/min and then kept for 4 h in the furnace to obtain g-C 3 N 4 bulks (abbreviated as CN) through thermal polymerization process.Secondly, 1 g of g-C 3 N 4 bulks was added into 100 mL of 5 M HNO 3 solution and refluxed for 24 h at 125 C. The obtained suspensions were naturally cooled to room temperature.Through centrifugation and washing with deionized water, the solid products was vacuum dried at 35 C for 12 h to obtain carboxylated g-C 3 N 4 (denoted as CCN) . A series of CuInZnS (abbreviated as CIZS) photocatalysts were prepared via a facile solvothermal method.In a typical synthesis process, mmol CuCl, 1 mmol InCl 3 4H 2 O and X mmol (X 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively) Zn(Ac) 2 2H 2 O were firstly dissolved in 80 mL of DMF solvents, and then 2 mmol L-cysteine was introduced into the mixture solutions.Meanwhile, 6 M HCl were slowly introduced to the mixtures under constant stirring to obtain the clear solution, which were transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 180 C for 18 h.After the autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature, the products were collected by filtration and washed for several times with deionized water and ethanol and finally dried under vacuum at -40 C for 8 h 48.The as-obtained CIZS catalysts were denoted as CIZS(1-2), CIZS(1-3), CIZS(1-4), CIZS(1-5), and CIZS (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6), where the molar ratios of In 3 ions and Zn 2 ions during synthesis process were 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, and 1:6, respectively. In order to prepare CIZS/CCN hybrids, the first step was similar to the preparation process of CIZS.The difference is that a certain amount of CCN powder was uniformly dispersed in the transparent solution after the introduction of HCl.As CIZS is a ternary-binary solid solution composed of ternary chalcopyrite CuInS 2 and binary zincblende ZnS, its optical band gap is adjustable.Simultaneously, due to their similar ionic radii, the occupation sites of Cu , In 3 and Zn 2 may be random in real crystals.The nominal proportion of CIZS and CCN in the hybrids was calculated by the molar mass of the added precursor.When the precursors used for the synthesis of CIZS include 1 mmol CuCl, 1 mmol InCl 3 4H 2 O, 3 mmol Zn(Ac) 2 2H 2 O, and 2.5 mmol L-cysteine, and 0.5 g of CCN substrates, the as-prepared hybrid was denoted as 47 CIZS(1-3)/CCN.In the same way, 17 CIZS(1-3)/CCN, 29 CIZS(1-3)/CCN, CIZS(1-3)/CCN and 56 CIZS (1-3)/CCN can be well synthesized by reducing or expanding the amount of precursors added in proportion.In order to prepare different 47 CIZS/CCN hybrids, the nominal mass of CIZS and the molar ratio of Cu , In 3 and L-cysteine (1:1:2.5)were kept as constant, while the molar ratio of In 3 to Zn 2 changed.Thus, 47 CIZS(1-2)/CCN, 47 CIZS (1-4)/CCN, 47 CIZS (1-5)/CCN, and 47 CIZS (1-6)/CCN hybrids can be obtained. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of CIZS/CCN hybrids were performed on an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Ka source with In order to test the migration properties of photogenerated carriers in different samples under visible light irradiation, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photocurrent were measured on a CHI 660E electrochemical station using a conventional three electrode system.The working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode were FTO glass coated with samples, SCE electrode and platinum wire respectively.Among them, the working electrode was prepared by adding 10 mg of sample powder into Nafion solution diluted with ethanol and evenly distributing on FTO glass (2 cm 2 cm).The electrolyte used in this experiment was 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution. CO 2 reduction performance of the samples was tested in a 120 mL cylindrical glassware reactor with quartz glass on the top.The light source was provided by a 300 W Xe lamp with 400 nm cut-off filter.50 mg of catalyst sample was evenly dispersed on a round Petri dish with an area of 9 cm 2 and placed in the reactor.The distance between sample and light source was fixed at 11 cm, and the visible light was irradiated on the surface of sample through the quartz glass on the upper part of the reactor.Before photoreduction experiment, high purity CO 2 (99.9) should be continuously pumped into the reactor for 15 min to remove the residual air and keep the ambient pressure in the reactor.At the same time, 2 mL of deionized water should be injected into the bottom of reactor as reducing agent.During the photoreduction experiment, 0.5 mL of gas product was extracted from the reactor every 2 h as a sample, and was quantitatively identified by GC-7920 gas chromatography equipped with flame ionization detector (FID).The photocatalytic stability of the samples was evaluated by four cycle experiments. The photocatalytic performance of different samples was evaluated by near-infrared degradation of methyl orange (MO) solution.The nearinfrared light source was provided by a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a total reflector and a 700 nm cut-off filter.In a typical experiment, 50 mg of pure CIZS(1-3) or CIZS/CCN hybrids was added into 100 mL of MO (10 mg/L) aqueous solution, and the suspension was obtained by ultrasound.Before the reaction, the suspension was stirred magnetically in the dark for 30 min in order to reach the adsorption-desorption equilibrium.In the process of illumination, 4 mL of aliquots was collected from the suspension every 1 h and the photocatalysts powder were removed by centrifugation to obtain a clear solution.The concentration of the clear solution was determined by a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 463 nm.During the reaction, the active species were determined by capture experiments.1 mM potassium iodide (KI), 1 mM isopropanol (IPA) and argon (Ar) were used as h , OH and scavengers respectively."}]}}
