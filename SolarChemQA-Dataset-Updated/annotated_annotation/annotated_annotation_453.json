The composite catalysts were investigated by XRD to understand their phase composition.Clearly, all of the samples feature two distinct diffraction peaks and no impurity can be detected, indicating that the composites have similar crystal structure (Figure 2).Two characteristic peaks indexed as the (100) and (002) reflections of g-C 3 N 4 could be observed.The weaker peak at 13.0 o corresponding to an interlayer distance of 0.68 nm is assigned to the in-plane repeated unites, and the stronger one at 27.5 o with a distance of 0.33 nm can be attributed to the interlayer stacking of the aromatic systems. 20Noticeably, the increase of carbon content in the composites causes a reduction in the peak intensity of H-g-C 3 N 4 /C catalysts, which is in accordance with the TG results.Further observation of (002) peak shows that all H-g-C 3 N 4 /C samples have weaker and broader peaks compared with bulk g-C 3 N 4 . This observation could be attributed to the existence of carbon.Nevertheless, no distinct diffraction peaks corresponding to carbon are observed in Figure 2, which should be due to the formation of amorphous carbon. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of above H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composite catalysts were shown in Figure 3a.The isotherms exhibit that all samples are of type IV with hysteresis loop at high relative pressure range of 0.5-0.95,suggesting the presence of some mesoporosity.The hysteresis loops are similar to the type H 3 , which are frequently observed on the aggregates of platelike nanoparticles forming slit-shaped pores. 37It should be mentioned that the mesoporous features of these composite catalysts become more significant with increasing the content of carbon, indicating the presence of carbon in g-C 3 N 4 is beneficial for the formation of mesopores.As shown in the pore size distribution curves derived from the desorption branch of the isotherms (Figure 3b), all samples have relatively narrow distribution in pore sizes centered at around 4 nm.The textural properties of all samples are listed in Table 1.Compared with bulk g-C 3 N 4 , these H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composite catalysts have a relative larger BET surface area and pore volume, both values are increasing with the enhancement of carbon content.The enlargement of the specific surface area is probably due to the hindered crystal growth of graphitic carbon nitride by the introduction of hybrid carbon, which mainly arises from mesopores according to our measurement. The morphology and structural features of the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composites were elucidated by SEM and TEM. Figure 4 exhibits the SEM and TEM images of the representative H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6 sample and bulk g-C 3 N 4 .From Figure 4a, it can be clearly seen that the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6 displays crumpled multi-layer thin nanosheets with a typical wrinkled morphology, and the TEM image given in Figure 4b reveals that the domains with worm-like mesoporous channels are presented in these nanosheets, which is consistent with the result of BJH analysis.Such hierarchical nanostructures are highly desirable in heterogeneous catalytic systems since it is benefit to the reactive molecular diffusion/transfer.While the bulk g-C 3 N 4 prepared without carbon exhibits a big and platelet-like morphology with less mesoporous characters, as shown in Figure 4c and4d. The compositions and chemical states of the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6 and bulk g-C 3 N 4 were studied by XPS.As shown in Figure 5, both bulk g-C 3 N 4 and the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6 display distinct characteristic peaks of C 1s (287 eV), N 1s (400 eV) and O 1s (533 eV).High resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s and O 1s are provided in Figure 5b-d, respectively.In the case of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the C 1s peak is deconvoluted into two small peaks.The first peak at 284.6 eV is ascribed to the surface adventitious carbon or sp 2 C-C bonds, 36 while the second peak at 287.5 eV is assigned to the sp 2 -bonded carbon (the major carbon species in the g-C 3 N 4 polymer) in N-containing aromatic rings (N-CN). 38Different from the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , the C 1s XPS spectrum of H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6 exhibits a new peak at 286.5 eV, this peak could be attributed to CN bonds, which originate from the hybrid carbon, and the heating-induced generation of a C-O-C bond between g-C 3 N 4 and carbon, 39 functioning as a \"bridge\" linking g-C 3 N 4 with the formed carbon, suggesting that there are some interactions between carbon and g-C 3 N 4 , which can be confirmed by the following FTIR results.The high resolution N 1s spectrum of bulk g-C 3 N 4 (as shown in Figure 5c) can be also fitted into four different peaks at binding energies of 398.1, 399.3, 400.8, and 404.2 eV, which are respectively attributed to sp 2 hybridized N bonded with C (C-NC), the bridging tertiary N (N-(C) 3 ), graphitic N, and amino functional groups (C-N-H). 404142 However, in case of H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6, the N 1s peaks show a slight positive shift relative to that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , perhaps caused by the partial doping carbon in the g-C 3 N 4 . 43In addition, the surface C/N ratio (atomic) has increased from 0.77 (for bulk g-C 3 N 4 ) to 0.84 (for H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6) according to the XPS analysis.The O 1s spectrum of bulk g-C 3 N 4 can be deconvoluted into two peaks, and the binding energies of 532.9.0 eV and 533.9 eV can be ascribed to C-OH groups and adsorbed O 2 , respectively. 44terestingly, a new peak appears at a low binding energy of ca.531.6 eV for the O1s spectra of H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6 compared to that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , this signal is assigned to the generation of N-C-O species and suggests that the oxygen can directly bond with the sp 2 -hybridized C in the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6. 45 investigate the atomic structure of H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composites, the FT-IR spectra were carried out.As shown in Figure 6, all the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composites manifest almost similar characteristic features to the bulk g-C 3 N 4 , proving that the structural integrity of g-C 3 N 4 remained intact after the introduction of hybrid carbon.The broad absorption peak ranging from 2800 to 3400 cm -1 originates from the stretching vibrational modes of the N-H and O-H, respectively, suggesting that the amino groups and adsorbed hydroxyl species still exist in the products.A series of peaks found in the region from 1200 to 1700 cm -1 could be assigned to the stretching modes like C(sp 2 )-N and C(sp 2 )N in the CN heterocycles with peaks positioned at 1635, 1573, 1420, 1332 and 1250 cm -1 .Additionally, the typical bending vibration of s-triazine units at ca. 807 cm -1 is observed. 46Note that, after introducing the hybrid carbon, the characteristic peak from the s-triazine vibration of bulk g-C 3 N 4 depicts a slight shift to the lower wavenumber of ca.802 cm -1 in the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composites. The red shift of the peak suggests that some interactions between the \"nitrogen pots\" of g-C 3 N 4 and carbon species have already appeared, which was consistent with the XPS results.Meanwhile, it should be pointed that the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composites display a stronger FT-IR mode compared with bulk g-C 3 N 4 owing to the enhancement of the exposed surface functional groups, which provides combination fundamental for the composites. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to examine the charge transfer resistance and the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers, as a pivotal factor to the photocatalytic activity.Figure 7a exhibits the EIS Nyquist plots of the representative H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6 and bulk g-C 3 N 4 .On the Nyquist diagram, a smaller radius indicates lower overall charge transfer resistance or in other words, higher charge transfer efficiency and more efficient separation of photo-excited electron-hole pairs. 47,48One can see that the arc radius of H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6 is much smaller than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , indicating that the hybrid carbon in composites was of great benefit to enhance the separation and transfer efficiency of electrons and holes.Photoluminescence (PL) emission measurements were further used to characterize the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and separation in the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composite catalysts.A lower PL intensity generally reflects a better sepatation of photogenerated charge carriers.Figure 7b shows the PL spectra of the representative H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6 and bulk g-C 3 N 4 .It can be found that the PL intensity of H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6 significantly decreases in comparison with bulk g-C 3 N 4 , indicating that introduction of hybrid carbon in g-C 3 N 4 has accelerated electron-hole separation, which should be attributed to the electron transfer from g-C 3 N 4 to carbon under light irradiation.These results thus suggest that the accelerated electron-hole separation of the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composites allows them as promising catalysts for sun-light driven photocatalytic applications. Finally, the photocatalytic activity of the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composite catalysts with different carbon contents toward gas-phase CO 2 photoreduction under simulated solar irradiation was experimentally determined.Figure 8 illustrates how the two primary products (CO and CH 4 ) evolve with irradiation time for all samples.Clearly, the yields of CO and CH 4 both increase with the reaction time, and the carbon monoxide formation on H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composites is more favorable compared to methane formation.Interestingly, Figure 8 also shows that the production rates of solar fuel increase with the increase of carbon content from 1.02 wt to 3.77 wt .However, a decreased activity was caused with further increase of carbon content in H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-1 and H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-2 composites, suggesting that the carbon content is important for the optimal photocatalytic activity.The highest CO and CH 4 yield of 22.6 and 12.59 mol g -1 -cat., respectively, are achieved with 3.77 wt of carbon content in the sample H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6 after 9 h of simulated solar irradiation, noticeably both values are much better than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 . This enhanced activity of the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composite catalysts is ascribed to the synergistic effect of hybrid carbon and g-C 3 N 4 .The introduction of hybrid carbon into the g-C 3 N 4 can improve the electrical conductivity of the catalysts, increase light absorption and enhance photoinduced electron-hole separation efficiency. 49anwhile, carbon content is a critical factor deciding the optimal photocatalytic activity: when the carbon content is above that in H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6, a further increase would decelerate the CO 2 photoreduction conversion.The reason is that carbon with an appropriate content can well disperse on the g-C 3 N 4 surfaces, which contributes to the migration and separation of charge carriers.However, the carbon content above that in H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6, the carbon overlaps as agglomerates to smother the surface of g-C 3 N 4 , thus partly block light absorption and decelerate the interfacial charge transfer, resulting in a decrease of CO 2 photocatalytic conversion efficiency (as shown in Figure 9)."}, {"llm generation": "Hybrid graphitic carbon nitride and carbon composite catalysts", "source": "Hybrid graphitic carbon nitride and carbon composite catalysts with different carbon contents were prepared via a facile one-pot pyrolysis method using melamine and natural soybean oil as precursors.", "context": "Hybrid graphitic carbon nitride and carbon composite catalysts with different carbon contents were prepared via a facile one-pot pyrolysis method using melamine and natural soybean oil as precursors.After introduction of carbon in the g-C 3 N 4 , the hybrid composite catalysts show significantly improved catalytic activities for the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.The optimal carbon content is determined to be 3.77 wt. on the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6 sample with CO and CH 4 yield of 22.60 mol/g-cat.and 12.5 mol/g-cat.under 9 h light irradiation, respectively, both values were more than twice as high as that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 .The remarkably increased performance of H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composite catalysts was ascribed mainly to the synergistic effect of hybrid carbon and g-C 3 N 4 , which is pivotal to the separation of photogenerated charge carriers.This study offers a new method to prepare various semiconductor-carbon hybrid materials with high performance for environmental applications. Pore size (nm) shows the TG curves of all catalysts from 50 o C to 1200 o C at a heating rate of 10 o C min -1 under Ar flow.The weight loss of H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composite catalysts and bulk g-C 3 N 4 with the same steep downtrend occurring from 540 o C to 750 o C were observed, which is assigned to the decomposing of g-C 3 N 4 .In addition, there is a slightly weight loss in the range of 750-1100 o C for the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composites compared to bulk g-C 3 N 4 with no residue, indicating that the introduction of carbon enhances the thermal stability of the composites.Thus the content of carbon in the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composites could be easily calculated from the TG curves, and the actual weight percentage of carbon in composites for H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-10, H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-6, H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-2 and H-g-C 3 N 4 /C-1 is computed to be 1.02, 3.77, 9.41 and 13.02, respectively.To further reveal the different element contents in the H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composites, elemental analyses (C, N, H) were carried out and the obtained data are listed in Table Figure 1.(a) TG thermograms for heating all H-g-C 3 N 4 /C composite catalysts from 50 Figure 2.
