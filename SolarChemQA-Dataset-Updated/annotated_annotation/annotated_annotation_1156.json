Bulk g-C 3 N 4 (BCN) was synthesized by putting 5 g of urea powder into a quartz crucible with a cover and heated to 550 C for 2 h with a heating rate 5 C/min.BCN was collected after cooling down to room temperature. As shown in Fig. 1, the porous g-C 3 N 4 /TiN was synthesized by a onepot calcination method.Typically, 5 g of urea was dissolved in pure ethanol, then a certain amount of TiN was physically mixed in the solution and dried at 90 C. Following, the dried mixture was loaded into a covered quartz crucible, and an aluminum foil was further wrapped around the quartz crucible tightly to create the sealing effect.Finally, the precursors were calcined at 550 C with a ramp rate of 10 C/min for 4 h under Ar atmosphere 5,35.Finally, the samples synthesized with different TiN loadings were denoted as PCN/TNO-x (where the weight ratio of TiN: urea x:1000).Porous g-C 3 N 4 (PCN) is prepared by the same procedure for PCN/TNO mentioned above, but without the addition of TiN.Pure TiN was also heat-treated in the same way to achieve the contrast effect.Composites were also synthesized by hydrothermal method and physical mixing.For the hydrothermal method, 100 mg PCN and 4 mg TiN was added to 20 mL pure ethanol.After stirred for 30 min, the suspension was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 150 C for 16 h.Finally, the cooled product was dried at 90 C for 6 h.For physical mixing, the same procedure of hydrothermal method was used, but without heat treatment in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The crystal structures were recorded by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker, D8 Advance) with Cu-K radiation ( 1.5418A).The micromorphology was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss, GeminiSEM 300) and a field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM, Thermo scientific, FEI Talos F200S).The chemical states of the photocatalysts were probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo scientific, ESCALAB 250Xi) using a monochromatic Al K radiation (h 1486.65 eV) as the excitation source.The carbonaceous C 1s peak (284.80 eV) was used as a reference for the calibration of binding energy values.The optical absorption properties were quantified by a UV-vis absorption spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda 1050) equipped with an integrating sphere.The photogenerated electron-hole separation efficiencies were evaluated by photo-luminescence (PL) spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 1000) with an excitation wavelength of 375 nm.The chemical bondings were observed by using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Nicolet iS50) with samples dispersed in KBr pellets in a 1:100 ratio.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was applied to Fig. 1.Schematic of the synthesis process of the g-C 3 N 4 /TiN composites. Q. Zhu et al. carry out the specific surface area and pore volume of the samples (Micromeritics, ASAP 2460).and the average pore diameter was analyzed by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method from the desorption branch of isotherm.The chemical composition was analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES, Agilent, Vista MPX).Raman spectra were obtained using a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer at ambient temperature with a 532 nm-laser and a x50 objective.A typical collection time of 20 s was performed with 2 accumulations to eliminate artifacts. Without noble cocatalysts, g-C 3 N 4 usually requires the help of sacrificial agents and photosensitizers to drive the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 6.Wang 36 applied a mixture of water and acetonitrile (MeCN), triethanolamine (TEOA), and Co(bpy) 3 Cl 2 for g-C 3 N 4 based CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and found that without any of the components in the system, no conversion could take place.Herein, the sacrificial agents and photosensitizers were used in this work, and the contrasting experiments were also conducted to explain the role of the components. The photocatalytic reduction is conducted in a Schlenk flask (as shown in Fig. S1).A mixture of 4 mL water, 6 mL acetonitrile (MeCN) were used as the solvent.The compound Co(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (by adding 40 L of 0.1 M CoCl 2 solution and 15 mg bipyridine (bpy)) was used as the photosensitizer.For the sacrificial agent, 2 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) was used.A 300 W Xe lamp (Microsolar 300, Beijing Perfect Light Technology Co., Ltd.) with a wavelength range of 320-780 nm (as shown in Fig. S2) was chosen as the light source.The flux distribution of the Xe lamp was tested by a self-designed flux mapping system (as shown in Fig. S3), consisting of a two-dimensional displacement system with a circular foil type heat flow meter 37.The averaged irradiation intensity is 417.5 mW/cm 2 according to the measured data.Gaseous products were analyzed by using a GC9720plus gas chromatography (GC, Zhejiang Fuli Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID).To confirm the carbon source of the reaction products is CO 2 , the 13 CO 2 is used instead of 12 CO 2 .A chromatography-mass spectrometry (Agilent, 7890B-5977B) was used to analyze the products."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "The optical adsorption properties of the samples are measured by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra.", "context": "XRD patterns were used for analyzing the crystallinity and crystalline phases of the prepared samples (as shown in Fig. 2).The diffraction patterns of BCN exhibit two typical diffraction peaks at 13.0 and 27.4 of bare g-C 3 N 4 (JCPDS Card No. 87-1526) 8,38.The weak peak at 13.0 corresponding to the (1 0 0) in-plane structural packing motifs of s-triazine ring units and the other peak at 27.4 can be attributed to the (0 0 2) interlayer stacking reflection of the conjugated aromatic systems 39,40.The diffraction patterns of TiN (JCPDS Card No. 38-1420) confirm the existence of TiN in PCN/TNO-x, and the peaks of the PCN/TNO-x are in line with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , indicating that the added TiN does not affect the crystal structure of pure g-C 3 N 4 .It is worth noting that, after heat-treated in Ar, the TNO shows the diffraction patterns of TiO 2 , meaning that parts of the TiN are oxidized to TiO 2 .According to the subsequent experimental results, TiN nanoparticles instead of TiO nanoparticles plays a decisive role for the catalytic performance, so the role of TiO 2 is not discussed in this work. The FTIR tests were performed to carried out to characterize functional groups of samples.Fig. 3 presents the spectra of BCN, PCN, and PCN/TNO-3.The absorption at 1600 and 3400 cm -1 are the surfaces absorbed H 2 O and -OH on the samples 24.The sharp peak at cm -1 can be assigned to the out-of-plane bending vibration of the 3-s-triazine unit of g-C 3 N 4 41.The strong and wide absorption peaks in the range of 1200 to 1700 cm -1 are related to the typical C -N and CN-stretching vibrations of the 3-s-triazine ring 42.For PCN/TNO-3, the XRD patterns in Fig. 2 and the FTIR spectra in Fig. 3 show all the characteristic peaks of the pristine g-C 3 N 4 , revealing that the original framework of carbon nitride remained unchanged after the introduction of TiN in the calcination process. In Fig. 4(a), the SEM image exhibits the porous morphology of PCN/ TNO-3, indicating a high specific area ratio, which is in line with the BET test results in Fig. 6.The porous structures are mainly contributed by the condensation of urea during the calcination process.The TEM image in Fig. 4 S2.However, according to the ICP results of PCN/TNO-3 listed in Table S3, there is 3.02 weight ratio of Ti element, meaning that the Ti is inside the g-C 3 N 4 rather than near the surface, which is in line with the TEM images in Fig. 4. The BET specific surface area and pore size distributions of the prepared samples were evaluated by the N 2 -adsorption/desorption measurements at 77.3 K.As shown in Fig. 6 (a), The specific surface areas of PCN is 63.76 m 2 /g, which is 2.45 times higher than that of BCN (26.00 m 2 /g), indicating that it is favorable to generate more active sites on the surface.The introduction of TiN cannot further enlarge the specific surface area.Meanwhile, the peak intensity of PCN/TNO-3 lies between 13 nm and 22 nm in BJH pore distribution curves (as shown in Fig. 6(b)) indicates that the photocatalyst may has a good gas diffusion ability 46. The optical adsorption properties of the samples are measured by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra.Fig. 7 BCN is 445 nm, and a red-shift of the absorption edge of PCN/TNO-1 is revealed when the TIN is introduced to the g-C 3 N 4 , revealing a better utilization in the visible region.The PCN/TNO-3 showed a high absorption in the visible-light region, which means a high thermal utilization of the incident light.Fig. 7(b) displays the bandgap E g of samples calculate by Kubelka-Munk transformed functions 47.The BCN has a bandgap of 2.64 eV, which is in agreement with previously reported values 48.After adding the TiN into g-C 3 N 4 , the bandgap is clearly decreased.Thus, upon increasing the amount of TiN, it is beneficial to reduce the bandgap and improve the absorption of incident light.The slight peaks at 500 nm of PCN/TNO-1 and PCN/TNO-3 are probably caused by the LSPR effect of TiN nanoparticles.To further confirm this judgement, we performed Raman spectroscopy tests on TiN, and the Fig. S8 shows that the Raman peak appears shifted under laser excitation at 532 nm, and the large number of hot electrons generated by the LSPR effect makes the redshift phenomenon appear even at weak laser power with obvious local thermal effects 49. The optical harvesting ability of photocatalyst is limited by several unavoidable losses.For a photocatalyst with a single bandgap E g under the radiation of AM 1.5 G spectrum I AM1.5 (), where the wavelength is in the range of 320 nm-780 nm, the utilized energy P u can be defined as 50: where () is the wavelength related absorptivity of photocatalyst, which can be transformed from absorptance by Kubelka-Munk theory, h is the energy of the incident photon, and g .is the absorption edge of the photocatalyst.The thermalization energy, where the energy in excess of E g lost in the form of heat, can be defined as 50: The incomplete absorption, where absorbed photons with energies below E g , can be described as 50: The reflection loss energy can be explained as 50: By applying the UV-vis absorption spectrum data of PCN and PCN/TNO-3 displayed in Fig. 7, the theoretical energy allocation ratio of samples under light can be calculated.Fig. 14 shows the theoretical energy allocation ratio of PCN and PCN/TNO-3 under AM 1.5 G irradiation.The theoretically utilized energy ratio of PCN/TNO-3 are 2.44 times higher than that of PCN, due to the suppressed bandgap and enhanced absorptivity.The reflection loss of PCN/TNO-3 is much lower than that of PCN, owing to the high absorptivity of TiN.Therefore, the ability of harvesting useful photons and heat energy, which might be beneficial for boosting the photocatalytic performance (Fig. 8). Efficient charge separation and strong transfer ability are important for high-performance photocatalysts.Fig. 9(a) shows the PL spectra of the samples under radiation at 375 nm.The PL emission peak intensity of BCN is larger than the other two samples, implying that the high electron-holes recombination rate.On the contrary, PCN/TNO-3 has the lowest PL intensity, indicating a better photoinduced carrier separation.The emission peak of PCN/TNO-3 is blue-shifted from 470 nm to nm, owing to quantum confinement after exfoliation 51.Moreover, the LSPR effect of TiN nanoparticles generates large number of available electrons near the initial energy of the laser excitation, and radiative decay directly from the high-energy LSPR modes is possible due to the fast damping rate of each LSPR mode.Thus, radiative decay occurs through plasmon emission, causing a blue-shift of the emission peak of PCN/TNO-3.The suppressed PL emission intensity of PCN/TNO-3 indicates that the introduction of Ti suppressed the recombination of carriers.In addition, the decay lifetime of the photoexcited charge carriers was measured by time-resolved PL spectroscopy.The average lifetime is calculated by tri-exponential fitting, detailed in Table S4.Transient PL decays of samples in Fig. 9(b) reveal that the PCN/TNO-3 has a longer average lifetime than BCN and PCN.The slower PL decay indicates that it will increase the possibility of charge carriers migrating to the composite surface to participate in the reaction 52,53. To explore the effect of enhanced optical absorption and carrier transfer capabilities on the CO 2 reduction performance, experiments were conducted under irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp.The performances of the various photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction are displayed in Fig. 10(a).The main products of the reaction are CO and H 2 .The pure bulk g-C 3 N 4 shows the lowest CO production rate.By increasing the surface area of the g-C 3 N 4 , PCN shows a higher CO production rate, which is 2.18 times higher than that of BCN.The H 2 produced by BCN and PCN is higher than that of CO, indicating a strong competing reaction between hydrogen evolution by water reduction and CO reduction.After introducing TiN, the PCN/TNO-x shows improved performance of CO production rate, until the excess TiN amounts lead to a suppressed performance.Detailed component ratios and performance comparisons of all the samples can be found in Fig. S5.The introduction of TiN can form an interface between g-C 3 N 4 and TiN, and facilitates carrier migration, which in turn improves the CO 2 reduction performance.The optimized PCN/TNO-3 gets the highest CO production rate of 210.46 mol/g/h, which is 6.15 times higher than BCN, and 2.77 times higher than that of PCN.The CO yield is compares favorably with the published works listed in the Table S5.Besides, the H 2 generation is suppressed after the TiN is added, meaning the improvement of the selectivity of CO 2 reaction productions. The 13 C isotopic labeling experiment was conducted to directly confirm the carbon source of the produced CO.Fig. 10(c) shows that the strong MS spectrum at m/z 29 is confirmed as 13 CO, which can be indexed to the reduction product of 13 CO 2 .This result shows a reliable evidence that the carbon source is coming from the CO 2 .In addition, contrastive experiments with different reaction conditions were also performed (Fig. 10(b)).No production is observed under dark conditions, pointing out that the CO 2 reduction reaction is powered by the light source.When Ar is used to replace CO 2 , no CO is detected and only H 2 is generated, revealing that the CO 2 is the only carbon source to produce CO.Without TEOA, no CO is detected, showing that the vital importance of sacrificial agent.Without the photocatalyst, there is only little amount of CO, meaning that the main reaction occurs at the photocatalyst other than the solvent.However, H 2 is still generated without photocatalyst, mainly due to the Co(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (by adding CoCl 2 and bipyridine (bpy)) acting as a reductive co-catalyst 6.In summary, the components of the experiment are all essential, and without any of them, no conversion can be performed. The stability of PCN/TNO-3 in the CO 2 reduction process was tested by conducting recycling experiments.The photocatalysts were exposed for multiple cycles.Each cycle was performed for 9 h of irradiation.Fig. 10(d) displays five cycles of the reaction, which is 45 h in total.The temporal gas production losses at the second and forth cycles are probably due to the inadequate of TEOA.After the TEOA is reloaded, the gas production is restored.After five cycles, the catalyst remains up to 72.7 of its initial CO production activity, which means a good stability of the photocatalyst.The corresponding characterizations of the catalyst before and after the long-term test are also performed.Fig. S6 demonstrates that the catalyst retains its original composition after a long reaction time, proving its stability.The SEM images in Fig. S7 show no obvious morphological changes after 27 h of irradiation.When the irradiation time was increased to 45 h, the catalyst shows some agglomeration, but still had a relatively intact porous morphology, which also proved its stability.In addition, the H 2 production rate is not only affected by the catalyst, but also by the photosensitizer and sacrificial agent.According to Wang's work 36, the H 2 production rate increases significantly with the increase of Co 2 , while the CO production rate reaches a plateau quickly and no longer changes.Therefore, the yield of H 2 is strongly correlated with the photosensitizer, while the yield of CO can remain relatively stable.Due to the fact that no additional photosensitizers were added during the whole cycle test and the photosensitizer will be partially degraded after a long time of reaction, the H 2 production was not stable during the long-term reaction.As shown in Fig. S9, in addition, comparison of the reproducibility data of the product yields under the same conditions reveals that the yield of H 2 varies more significantly, which should result from the effect of the actual concentration error of Co 2 during the experiment, which is also consistent with the phenomenon observed in the recycling experiments. Based on the XPS and ICP results, it can be assumed that the TiN nanoparticles are inside the g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets instead of exposed on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 .To investigate the effect of TiN exposure on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 , PCN/TNO-3 was also synthesized by the hydrothermal method and physical mixture for comparison.Fig. 11(a) shows that the hydrothermal synthesis or physical mixing of PCN/TNO-3 has similar CO and H 2 production rates as the PCN, but is much lower than that produced by the one-pot calcination method of PCN/TNO-3.Thus, the current one-pot calcination method allows for the preparation of higher performance photocatalysts.Because TiN forms better contact with g-C 3 N 4 when it is inside g-C 3 N 4 and does not prevent g-C 3 N 4 from exposing the active sites. The effect of TiN nanoparticles on spectral broadening was also experimentally investigated.Fig. 11(b) exhibits a comparison of the performance of BCN and PCN/TNO-3 at different spectral ranges of incidence.When the 455 nm cut-off filter is used, no catalytic products are produced by BCN, indicating that the absorption edge of BCN is smaller than 455 nm, which was consistent with the UV-vis results in Fig. 7. To investigate the LSPR effect of TiN particles, FDTD calculation was carried out to simulate the local nanometer-scale electric field distribution 54.The detailed model set up is described in Fig. S4.Fig. 12presents the electric field distribution at the TiN/g-C 3 N 4 interfaces.Electric field intensity is highly enhanced at the interface, indicating that the LSPR has a strong effect on the light-harvesting.However, as the TiN particle diameter increases, the peak wavelength is red-shifted 55.This means that when the peak wavelength is red-shifted, TiN can only provide carriers below the band gap energy, which helps to heat the reaction, but cannot be used to enhance the photocatalytic process.Combined with the UV-vis characterization results and photocatalytic experimental results, the peak wavelength of TiN matches the band gap at a diameter of about 20 nm, and has a strong LSPR effect, so it can achieve a high catalytic effect. Fig. 13shows that the CO generation rate is decreasing with increasing TiN size and the performance of TiN is similar at 15 nm and 20 nm.Combined with the simulation results in Fig. 12, it can be seen that the equipartition excitation peak of TiN can play a good role in promoting catalysis when it matches the band gap, while when the TiN size is too large and the excitation wavelength is too long, it is detrimental to the reaction and even causes a significant decrease in performance. Based on the obtained experimental results, a possible photo-driven reaction mechanism towards CO 2 reduction is illustrated in Fig. (Eq.( 6)).Afterward, CO 2 and H are reduced to CO and H 2 by PCN/TNO -(Eqs.( 7) and ( 8)).To end, the sacrificial agent TEOA is"}, {"llm generation": "AM 1.5 G irradiation (Solar Simulator)", "source": "Fig. 8.

The photocatalytic reduction is conducted in a Schlenk flask (as shown in Fig. S1).A mixture of 4 mL water, 6 mL acetonitrile (MeCN) were used as the solvent.The compound Co(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (by adding 40 L of 0.1 M CoCl 2 solution and 15 mg bipyridine (bpy)) was used as the photosensitizer.For the sacrificial agent, 2 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) was used.A 300 W Xe lamp (Microsolar 300, Beijing Perfect Light Technology Co., Ltd.) with a wavelength range of 320-780 nm (as shown in Fig. S2) was chosen as the light source.The flux distribution of the Xe lamp was tested by a self-designed flux mapping system (as shown in Fig. S3), consisting of a two-dimensional displacement system with a circular foil type heat flow meter 37.The averaged irradiation intensity is 417.5 mW/cm 2 according to the measured data.Gaseous products were analyzed by using a GC9720plus gas chromatography (GC, Zhejiang Fuli Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID).To confirm the carbon source of the reaction products is CO 2 , the 13 CO 2 is used instead of 12 CO 2 .A chromatography-mass spectrometry (Agilent, 7890B-5977B) was used to analyze the products."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "To explore the effect of enhanced optical absorption and carrier transfer capabilities on the CO 2 reduction performance, experiments were conducted under irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp.", "context": "XRD patterns were used for analyzing the crystallinity and crystalline phases of the prepared samples (as shown in Fig. 2).The diffraction patterns of BCN exhibit two typical diffraction peaks at 13.0 and 27.4 of bare g-C 3 N 4 (JCPDS Card No. 87-1526) 8,38.The weak peak at 13.0 corresponding to the (1 0 0) in-plane structural packing motifs of s-triazine ring units and the other peak at 27.4 can be attributed to the (0 0 2) interlayer stacking reflection of the conjugated aromatic systems 39,40.The diffraction patterns of TiN (JCPDS Card No. 38-1420) confirm the existence of TiN in PCN/TNO-x, and the peaks of the PCN/TNO-x are in line with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , indicating that the added TiN does not affect the crystal structure of pure g-C 3 N 4 .It is worth noting that, after heat-treated in Ar, the TNO shows the diffraction patterns of TiO 2 , meaning that parts of the TiN are oxidized to TiO 2 .According to the subsequent experimental results, TiN nanoparticles instead of TiO nanoparticles plays a decisive role for the catalytic performance, so the role of TiO 2 is not discussed in this work. The FTIR tests were performed to carried out to characterize functional groups of samples.Fig. 3 presents the spectra of BCN, PCN, and PCN/TNO-3.The absorption at 1600 and 3400 cm -1 are the surfaces absorbed H 2 O and -OH on the samples 24.The sharp peak at cm -1 can be assigned to the out-of-plane bending vibration of the 3-s-triazine unit of g-C 3 N 4 41.The strong and wide absorption peaks in the range of 1200 to 1700 cm -1 are related to the typical C -N and CN-stretching vibrations of the 3-s-triazine ring 42.For PCN/TNO-3, the XRD patterns in Fig. 2 and the FTIR spectra in Fig. 3 show all the characteristic peaks of the pristine g-C 3 N 4 , revealing that the original framework of carbon nitride remained unchanged after the introduction of TiN in the calcination process. In Fig. 4(a), the SEM image exhibits the porous morphology of PCN/ TNO-3, indicating a high specific area ratio, which is in line with the BET test results in Fig. 6.The porous structures are mainly contributed by the condensation of urea during the calcination process.The TEM image in Fig. 4 S2.However, according to the ICP results of PCN/TNO-3 listed in Table S3, there is 3.02 weight ratio of Ti element, meaning that the Ti is inside the g-C 3 N 4 rather than near the surface, which is in line with the TEM images in Fig. 4. The BET specific surface area and pore size distributions of the prepared samples were evaluated by the N 2 -adsorption/desorption measurements at 77.3 K.As shown in Fig. 6 (a), The specific surface areas of PCN is 63.76 m 2 /g, which is 2.45 times higher than that of BCN (26.00 m 2 /g), indicating that it is favorable to generate more active sites on the surface.The introduction of TiN cannot further enlarge the specific surface area.Meanwhile, the peak intensity of PCN/TNO-3 lies between 13 nm and 22 nm in BJH pore distribution curves (as shown in Fig. 6(b)) indicates that the photocatalyst may has a good gas diffusion ability 46. The optical adsorption properties of the samples are measured by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra.Fig. 7 BCN is 445 nm, and a red-shift of the absorption edge of PCN/TNO-1 is revealed when the TIN is introduced to the g-C 3 N 4 , revealing a better utilization in the visible region.The PCN/TNO-3 showed a high absorption in the visible-light region, which means a high thermal utilization of the incident light.Fig. 7(b) displays the bandgap E g of samples calculate by Kubelka-Munk transformed functions 47.The BCN has a bandgap of 2.64 eV, which is in agreement with previously reported values 48.After adding the TiN into g-C 3 N 4 , the bandgap is clearly decreased.Thus, upon increasing the amount of TiN, it is beneficial to reduce the bandgap and improve the absorption of incident light.The slight peaks at 500 nm of PCN/TNO-1 and PCN/TNO-3 are probably caused by the LSPR effect of TiN nanoparticles.To further confirm this judgement, we performed Raman spectroscopy tests on TiN, and the Fig. S8 shows that the Raman peak appears shifted under laser excitation at 532 nm, and the large number of hot electrons generated by the LSPR effect makes the redshift phenomenon appear even at weak laser power with obvious local thermal effects 49. The optical harvesting ability of photocatalyst is limited by several unavoidable losses.For a photocatalyst with a single bandgap E g under the radiation of AM 1.5 G spectrum I AM1.5 (), where the wavelength is in the range of 320 nm-780 nm, the utilized energy P u can be defined as 50: where () is the wavelength related absorptivity of photocatalyst, which can be transformed from absorptance by Kubelka-Munk theory, h is the energy of the incident photon, and g .is the absorption edge of the photocatalyst.The thermalization energy, where the energy in excess of E g lost in the form of heat, can be defined as 50: The incomplete absorption, where absorbed photons with energies below E g , can be described as 50: The reflection loss energy can be explained as 50: By applying the UV-vis absorption spectrum data of PCN and PCN/TNO-3 displayed in Fig. 7, the theoretical energy allocation ratio of samples under light can be calculated.Fig. 14 shows the theoretical energy allocation ratio of PCN and PCN/TNO-3 under AM 1.5 G irradiation.The theoretically utilized energy ratio of PCN/TNO-3 are 2.44 times higher than that of PCN, due to the suppressed bandgap and enhanced absorptivity.The reflection loss of PCN/TNO-3 is much lower than that of PCN, owing to the high absorptivity of TiN.Therefore, the ability of harvesting useful photons and heat energy, which might be beneficial for boosting the photocatalytic performance (Fig. 8). Efficient charge separation and strong transfer ability are important for high-performance photocatalysts.Fig. 9(a) shows the PL spectra of the samples under radiation at 375 nm.The PL emission peak intensity of BCN is larger than the other two samples, implying that the high electron-holes recombination rate.On the contrary, PCN/TNO-3 has the lowest PL intensity, indicating a better photoinduced carrier separation.The emission peak of PCN/TNO-3 is blue-shifted from 470 nm to nm, owing to quantum confinement after exfoliation 51.Moreover, the LSPR effect of TiN nanoparticles generates large number of available electrons near the initial energy of the laser excitation, and radiative decay directly from the high-energy LSPR modes is possible due to the fast damping rate of each LSPR mode.Thus, radiative decay occurs through plasmon emission, causing a blue-shift of the emission peak of PCN/TNO-3.The suppressed PL emission intensity of PCN/TNO-3 indicates that the introduction of Ti suppressed the recombination of carriers.In addition, the decay lifetime of the photoexcited charge carriers was measured by time-resolved PL spectroscopy.The average lifetime is calculated by tri-exponential fitting, detailed in Table S4.Transient PL decays of samples in Fig. 9(b) reveal that the PCN/TNO-3 has a longer average lifetime than BCN and PCN.The slower PL decay indicates that it will increase the possibility of charge carriers migrating to the composite surface to participate in the reaction 52,53. To explore the effect of enhanced optical absorption and carrier transfer capabilities on the CO 2 reduction performance, experiments were conducted under irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp.The performances of the various photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction are displayed in Fig. 10(a).The main products of the reaction are CO and H 2 .The pure bulk g-C 3 N 4 shows the lowest CO production rate.By increasing the surface area of the g-C 3 N 4 , PCN shows a higher CO production rate, which is 2.18 times higher than that of BCN.The H 2 produced by BCN and PCN is higher than that of CO, indicating a strong competing reaction between hydrogen evolution by water reduction and CO reduction.After introducing TiN, the PCN/TNO-x shows improved performance of CO production rate, until the excess TiN amounts lead to a suppressed performance.Detailed component ratios and performance comparisons of all the samples can be found in Fig. S5.The introduction of TiN can form an interface between g-C 3 N 4 and TiN, and facilitates carrier migration, which in turn improves the CO 2 reduction performance.The optimized PCN/TNO-3 gets the highest CO production rate of 210.46 mol/g/h, which is 6.15 times higher than BCN, and 2.77 times higher than that of PCN.The CO yield is compares favorably with the published works listed in the Table S5.Besides, the H 2 generation is suppressed after the TiN is added, meaning the improvement of the selectivity of CO 2 reaction productions. The 13 C isotopic labeling experiment was conducted to directly confirm the carbon source of the produced CO.Fig. 10(c) shows that the strong MS spectrum at m/z 29 is confirmed as 13 CO, which can be indexed to the reduction product of 13 CO 2 .This result shows a reliable evidence that the carbon source is coming from the CO 2 .In addition, contrastive experiments with different reaction conditions were also performed (Fig. 10(b)).No production is observed under dark conditions, pointing out that the CO 2 reduction reaction is powered by the light source.When Ar is used to replace CO 2 , no CO is detected and only H 2 is generated, revealing that the CO 2 is the only carbon source to produce CO.Without TEOA, no CO is detected, showing that the vital importance of sacrificial agent.Without the photocatalyst, there is only little amount of CO, meaning that the main reaction occurs at the photocatalyst other than the solvent.However, H 2 is still generated without photocatalyst, mainly due to the Co(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (by adding CoCl 2 and bipyridine (bpy)) acting as a reductive co-catalyst 6.In summary, the components of the experiment are all essential, and without any of them, no conversion can be performed. The stability of PCN/TNO-3 in the CO 2 reduction process was tested by conducting recycling experiments.The photocatalysts were exposed for multiple cycles.Each cycle was performed for 9 h of irradiation.Fig. 10(d) displays five cycles of the reaction, which is 45 h in total.The temporal gas production losses at the second and forth cycles are probably due to the inadequate of TEOA.After the TEOA is reloaded, the gas production is restored.After five cycles, the catalyst remains up to 72.7 of its initial CO production activity, which means a good stability of the photocatalyst.The corresponding characterizations of the catalyst before and after the long-term test are also performed.Fig. S6 demonstrates that the catalyst retains its original composition after a long reaction time, proving its stability.The SEM images in Fig. S7 show no obvious morphological changes after 27 h of irradiation.When the irradiation time was increased to 45 h, the catalyst shows some agglomeration, but still had a relatively intact porous morphology, which also proved its stability.In addition, the H 2 production rate is not only affected by the catalyst, but also by the photosensitizer and sacrificial agent.According to Wang's work 36, the H 2 production rate increases significantly with the increase of Co 2 , while the CO production rate reaches a plateau quickly and no longer changes.Therefore, the yield of H 2 is strongly correlated with the photosensitizer, while the yield of CO can remain relatively stable.Due to the fact that no additional photosensitizers were added during the whole cycle test and the photosensitizer will be partially degraded after a long time of reaction, the H 2 production was not stable during the long-term reaction.As shown in Fig. S9, in addition, comparison of the reproducibility data of the product yields under the same conditions reveals that the yield of H 2 varies more significantly, which should result from the effect of the actual concentration error of Co 2 during the experiment, which is also consistent with the phenomenon observed in the recycling experiments. Based on the XPS and ICP results, it can be assumed that the TiN nanoparticles are inside the g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets instead of exposed on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 .To investigate the effect of TiN exposure on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 , PCN/TNO-3 was also synthesized by the hydrothermal method and physical mixture for comparison.Fig. 11(a) shows that the hydrothermal synthesis or physical mixing of PCN/TNO-3 has similar CO and H 2 production rates as the PCN, but is much lower than that produced by the one-pot calcination method of PCN/TNO-3.Thus, the current one-pot calcination method allows for the preparation of higher performance photocatalysts.Because TiN forms better contact with g-C 3 N 4 when it is inside g-C 3 N 4 and does not prevent g-C 3 N 4 from exposing the active sites. The effect of TiN nanoparticles on spectral broadening was also experimentally investigated.Fig. 11(b) exhibits a comparison of the performance of BCN and PCN/TNO-3 at different spectral ranges of incidence.When the 455 nm cut-off filter is used, no catalytic products are produced by BCN, indicating that the absorption edge of BCN is smaller than 455 nm, which was consistent with the UV-vis results in Fig. 7. To investigate the LSPR effect of TiN particles, FDTD calculation was carried out to simulate the local nanometer-scale electric field distribution 54.The detailed model set up is described in Fig. S4.Fig. 12presents the electric field distribution at the TiN/g-C 3 N 4 interfaces.Electric field intensity is highly enhanced at the interface, indicating that the LSPR has a strong effect on the light-harvesting.However, as the TiN particle diameter increases, the peak wavelength is red-shifted 55.This means that when the peak wavelength is red-shifted, TiN can only provide carriers below the band gap energy, which helps to heat the reaction, but cannot be used to enhance the photocatalytic process.Combined with the UV-vis characterization results and photocatalytic experimental results, the peak wavelength of TiN matches the band gap at a diameter of about 20 nm, and has a strong LSPR effect, so it can achieve a high catalytic effect. Fig. 13shows that the CO generation rate is decreasing with increasing TiN size and the performance of TiN is similar at 15 nm and 20 nm.Combined with the simulation results in Fig. 12, it can be seen that the equipartition excitation peak of TiN can play a good role in promoting catalysis when it matches the band gap, while when the TiN size is too large and the excitation wavelength is too long, it is detrimental to the reaction and even causes a significant decrease in performance. Based on the obtained experimental results, a possible photo-driven reaction mechanism towards CO 2 reduction is illustrated in Fig. (Eq.( 6)).Afterward, CO 2 and H are reduced to CO and H 2 by PCN/TNO -(Eqs.( 7) and ( 8)).To end, the sacrificial agent TEOA is"}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The main products of the reaction are CO and H 2 .", "context": "XRD patterns were used for analyzing the crystallinity and crystalline phases of the prepared samples (as shown in Fig. 2).The diffraction patterns of BCN exhibit two typical diffraction peaks at 13.0 and 27.4 of bare g-C 3 N 4 (JCPDS Card No. 87-1526) 8,38.The weak peak at 13.0 corresponding to the (1 0 0) in-plane structural packing motifs of s-triazine ring units and the other peak at 27.4 can be attributed to the (0 0 2) interlayer stacking reflection of the conjugated aromatic systems 39,40.The diffraction patterns of TiN (JCPDS Card No. 38-1420) confirm the existence of TiN in PCN/TNO-x, and the peaks of the PCN/TNO-x are in line with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , indicating that the added TiN does not affect the crystal structure of pure g-C 3 N 4 .It is worth noting that, after heat-treated in Ar, the TNO shows the diffraction patterns of TiO 2 , meaning that parts of the TiN are oxidized to TiO 2 .According to the subsequent experimental results, TiN nanoparticles instead of TiO nanoparticles plays a decisive role for the catalytic performance, so the role of TiO 2 is not discussed in this work.

Efficient charge separation and strong transfer ability are important for high-performance photocatalysts.Fig. 9(a) shows the PL spectra of the samples under radiation at 375 nm.The PL emission peak intensity of BCN is larger than the other two samples, implying that the high electron-holes recombination rate.On the contrary, PCN/TNO-3 has the lowest PL intensity, indicating a better photoinduced carrier separation.The emission peak of PCN/TNO-3 is blue-shifted from 470 nm to nm, owing to quantum confinement after exfoliation 51.Moreover, the LSPR effect of TiN nanoparticles generates large number of available electrons near the initial energy of the laser excitation, and radiative decay directly from the high-energy LSPR modes is possible due to the fast damping rate of each LSPR mode.Thus, radiative decay occurs through plasmon emission, causing a blue-shift of the emission peak of PCN/TNO-3.The suppressed PL emission intensity of PCN/TNO-3 indicates that the introduction of Ti suppressed the recombination of carriers.In addition, the decay lifetime of the photoexcited charge carriers was measured by time-resolved PL spectroscopy.The average lifetime is calculated by tri-exponential fitting, detailed in Table S4.Transient PL decays of samples in Fig. 9(b) reveal that the PCN/TNO-3 has a longer average lifetime than BCN and PCN.The slower PL decay indicates that it will increase the possibility of charge carriers migrating to the composite surface to participate in the reaction 52,53.

The effect of TiN nanoparticles on spectral broadening was also experimentally investigated.Fig. 11(b) exhibits a comparison of the performance of BCN and PCN/TNO-3 at different spectral ranges of incidence.When the 455 nm cut-off filter is used, no catalytic products are produced by BCN, indicating that the absorption edge of BCN is smaller than 455 nm, which was consistent with the UV-vis results in Fig. 7. To investigate the LSPR effect of TiN particles, FDTD calculation was carried out to simulate the local nanometer-scale electric field distribution 54.The detailed model set up is described in Fig. S4.Fig. 12presents the electric field distribution at the TiN/g-C 3 N 4 interfaces.Electric field intensity is highly enhanced at the interface, indicating that the LSPR has a strong effect on the light-harvesting.However, as the TiN particle diameter increases, the peak wavelength is red-shifted 55.This means that when the peak wavelength is red-shifted, TiN can only provide carriers below the band gap energy, which helps to heat the reaction, but cannot be used to enhance the photocatalytic process.Combined with the UV-vis characterization results and photocatalytic experimental results, the peak wavelength of TiN matches the band gap at a diameter of about 20 nm, and has a strong LSPR effect, so it can achieve a high catalytic effect. Fig. 13shows that the CO generation rate is decreasing with increasing TiN size and the performance of TiN is similar at 15 nm and 20 nm.Combined with the simulation results in Fig. 12, it can be seen that the equipartition excitation peak of TiN can play a good role in promoting catalysis when it matches the band gap, while when the TiN size is too large and the excitation wavelength is too long, it is detrimental to the reaction and even causes a significant decrease in performance. Based on the obtained experimental results, a possible photo-driven reaction mechanism towards CO 2 reduction is illustrated in Fig. (Eq.( 6)).Afterward, CO 2 and H are reduced to CO and H 2 by PCN/TNO -(Eqs.( 7) and ( 8)).To end, the sacrificial agent TEOA is"}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
