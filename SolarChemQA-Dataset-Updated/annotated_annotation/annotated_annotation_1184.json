DFT calculation was performed using Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP), with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) density functional 21,22.The core electrons were described by Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) pseudopotentials 23 and the cutoff energy was set to be 600 eV.A gamma-centered 1 1 1 k-point mesh was used to calculate the lattice constant and single-point-energy (SPE) of single oxygen and single hydroxyl in slab.Gamma-centered k-point meshes were applied for anatase and hydroxyl containing titania including Ti 24,25, and their material ID on Material Project are mp-1193009, mp-1191976, mp-626550, and mp-757493, respectively.The anatase (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) surfaces, (1 1 0) surface with bridging hydroxyl (OH B ) and (1 0 0) surface with top hydroxyl (OH T ) were built with 15 A vacuum slab for calculations of dissociation energies of surface O atoms and OH groups.The surface two-atom layer was unfixed while the below two-atom layer was fixed to mimicking the surface model during the optimization calculation.The bulk and surface structure models are shown in the Supporting Information (Fig. S1f-i).The bond dissociation energy for Ti-O or Ti-OH was calculated by the following equations, take Ti 6 H 8 O 16 for example. where D, E X (X Ti 6 O 11 , O, TiO 2 , Ti 6 H 8 O 16 , OH or Ti 6 H 7 O 15 ) represent the calculated bond dissociation energy and the single point energy of X structure, respectively. In-situ FTIR spectra of CO 2 photoreduction were collected on a Nicolet iS 10 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT) detector.Before the FTIR measurement, the sample was put into the reaction chamber and treated in continuous N 2 flow at room temperature for 1 h to remove air in the chamber.After that, CO 2 gas bubbled through H 2 O was inlet into the chamber for 1 h in dark, then the chamber was sealed.Subsequently, the adsorption spectra in dark were recorded, which was set as the background to further record the photocatalytic spectra under different time light irradiation. Ti-N 2 -600 and P25 electrodes were prepared according to the method reported by Domen's group 26 with some modifications.mg of photocatalyst and 10 mg of iodine were grinded together and put into 50 mL of acetone, followed by sonication for 5 min to get a homogeneous ink.Subsequently, the dispersion was transferred into an electrolytic cell with two pieces of Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) conductive glass.10 V voltage was applied to deposit the photocatalyst onto the FTO glass.Finally, a homogeneous film was obtained on FTO glass after vacuum-dried at 100 C for 5 h.Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted on a CHI 660A electrochemical work station (Chenhua Instrument, Inc.) with a three-electrode configuration system consisting of an FTO working electrode, a Pt plate counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.1.0 M NaOH aqueous solution was chosen as the electrolyte.The photocurrent was tested using a 300 W Xenon lamp as the light source (light intensity was 145 mW cm -2 , tested by FieldMaxIITO, Coherent) under 0.231 V voltage vs. Ag/AgCl.Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded at open circuit potential (OCP) under light illumination.
