SAED pattern (Fig. 2a) of flat-end CoeZnO NRs was obtained corresponding to the HRTEM image, which evident the hexagonal orientation of the Lau's spot around central spot, proves the presence of the crystalline single hexagonal phase of the CoeZnO NRs, consistent with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) results.Lattice fringes, depicted in the HRTEM image (Fig. 2b), are separated by 2.42 nm distance, illustrate the high crystalline nature of NRs that grow along the (011) plane.EDX profile of the CoeZnO NRs, possess the Co and Zn peaks that confirms the Co-doping onto ZnO lattice (Fig. 2c).Fig. 2d exhibits the HRTEM image of CdS loaded Co doped ZnO that revealed the presence of the heterojunction between CdS and Co-doped ZnO.i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y x x x ( 2 0 1 5 ) 1 e9 accounts for the hexagonal crystal growth in both samples along the 011 plane.Diffraction patterns of the pristine ZnO and CoeZnO NRs, shown by Fig. 3a, confirm that both belongs to the P6 3 mC space group and their corresponding lattice parameters are a 14 Minor shifting in XRD-peaks of CoeZnO was found towards lower angles in comparison to the pristine ZnO NRs (Fig. 3b) that strongly recommends the incorporation of the slightly bigger ions i.e.Co 2 (IR 14 0.075 nm Zn 2 ; IR 14 0.074 nm) into ZnO lattice.Value of c/a ratio was estimated as 1.626 (1.633 for ideal tetrahedra) for the CoeZnO system that reflected the hexagonal packing of the atoms by geometric occupation of ions at dissimilar sites of slightly distorted tetrahedra.The tetrahedral positions are occupied by anions at four apices and by cations at centre 40.good agreement with the standard CdS (JCPDS card No. 80-0006).It proves the successful loading of the hexagonal CdS nanoparticles onto the ZnO NR's and CoeZnO NR's surface as shown in Fig. 3c.XRD patterns of the all studied samples are shown in Fig. 3aec and following Equation (2) 41, is used to measure the crystallinity of the samples. Diffuse reflectance UVevisible absorption spectrum was recorded for the dry and pressed disk samples of powdered ZnO NRs to confirm the doping of Co and deposition of CdS on ZnO NRs, by using UVevisible spectrophotometer (UV-1700, Shimazdu, Japan with UV Probe device).Moisture free BaSO 4 was used as a reflectance standard in a UVeVis diffuse reflectance experiment.Instrumental error was noticed around the wavelength 350 nm due to the shifting of the light source from UV to Visible region, which was found responsible for the noise.Characteristic diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 4a andb) of the samples illustrate the red shifts in their edges with broadening in the main peak (300e525 nm) on successive advancement (addition of Co or CdS) in the ZnO NRs for making of the hetero-assembly CdS/CoeZnO NRs.First excitation peak centred at 450 nm, represents the presence of the CdS.Co 2 -incorporated samples (CoeZnO NRs and CdS/CoeZnO NRs) exhibits a secondary peak around 525e700 nm that is attributed to the multiple ded transitions of Co(II) 42.Band gap (E g ) of the studied system has been estimated at different stages of the advancement of ZnO NRs using the KubelkaeMunk function F(R) vs wavelength plot (Fig. 4a andb).Successive surface modification of ZnO nanostructures reduces their band gaps, as follows 3.18 eV (ZnO NRs), 3.00 eV (CoeZnO NRs), 2.48 eV (CdS/ZnO NRs) and 2.25 eV (CdS/CoeZnO NRs).Band gap of the CdS/CoeZnO NRs, ensures us about the good possibility of using it for photocatalytic hydrogen generation.First excitonic peak of DRS spectrum was utilized to determine the particle size of the sensitizer CdS (ca 5.24 nm) in CdS/CoeZnO NRs by using following power Equation (3) 43, where, D (nm) is the size of the CdS nanosensitizer in heterostructure, and l (nm) is the first excitonic absorption wavelength i.e. 450 nm for the corresponding sample.It represented that the incorporation of 5.24 nm CdS nanoparticles on CoeZnO NRs (400 nm broad and 2 mm long). X-Ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), was used to examine the local electronic environment around the centre atom.XAS (XANES/EXAFS) was recorded at BL-8 dispersive EXAFS beamline at INDUS-2 synchrotron radiation source at RRCAT, Indore.Measurements were made at the Zn K-edge (9659 eV) in fluorescence mode at room temperature with a sevenelement HPGe detector and double crystal Si (111) monochromator.Measurements were performed along the c axis perpendicular to electric field vector and along the c axis in the plane of the electric field vector.The raw X-ray absorption data were analysed using a standard procedure (software program ATHENA) that includes the subtraction of the preand post-edge background, edge calibration with a reference Zn foil, and normalization of edge jump.The Fourier transform of the normalized k 3 -weighted EXAFS spectra was taken using the program ARTEMIS for k from 2 to 11.5 A A1 and Hanning window function followed by a nonlinear leastsquares fit between 1.0 and 3.6 A. Theoretical phase and amplitude functions were calculated using the FEFF (V.8.4) code.This technique identifies the lattice disorders and shortrange local atomic arrangement around the central atoms, which XRD can't observe 44.XAS profiles of the ZnO, CoeZnO and CdS/CoeZnO NRs, were recorded at Zn K edge.Typical normalized XAS plot between X-ray absorption cross-section and photonic energy (PE) are displayed in Fig. 5aec.XAS profile was divided into four prominent zones with respect to the photonic energy of incoming photons i.e. pre-edge, edge, near-edge (XANES; X-rays absorption near edge spectroscopy) and fine structures (EXAFS; extended X-rays absorption fine structures and NEXAFS; near edge X-ray absorption fine structure) regions.Absence of pre-edge features (ls / 3d; dipole forbidden transition, PE 9659 eV) in all samples are credited to the fully occupied 3 d 10 configuration of Zn 2 ions 39 and negligible p-band defects.Edge features (ls / 4p) of CoeZnO shifted towards the higher PE 14 9660.23 eV with respect to the pure ZnO and CdS/CoeZnO NRs (PE 14 9659 eV) are attributed to the replacement of the high polarity ZneO bonds by the low polarity CoeO and CoeZn bonds in CoeZnO. Eventually, the presence of the highly polar bonds of CdS/ CoeZnO NRs i.e.CdeO, CdeS and ZneS, nullified the shifting in edge.It also confirms the existence of the highly oxidised Zn atoms (2 oxidation state) in CoeZnO NRs, attributed to the adsorption process 45.Almost same edge position of the pristine ZnO and CdS/CoeZnO NRs, signify the retention of similar oxidation state of Zn (2) in both.Intense, symmetrical and superimposed white line (WL) peak features of ZnO and CoeZnO NRs, centred at 9668.50 eV (10.01 eV/step), are originated due to ls-4p hybridization, reflected the similar electronic surroundings in both the species.Short heighted WL peak of CdS/CoeZnO NRs, predicts the low degree of anisotropy, and highly disordered arrangement of elements around Zn atom 6.Electronic transition 1s / 4d in Zn is attributed to the EXAFS features at P E 9668.50 50 eV.Shoulder peak was observed at 9678.52 eV, followed by the symmetrical third and fourth peaks at PE 9695.96 and 9714.00 eV, respectively for both sample.These fine features reflected that the anions envelop the central Zn atoms in a regular tetrahedral fashion in above two samples.Absence of the 9695.96eV peak in CoeZnO, reveals the existence of the cobalt (II) oxide with few Co atoms that substitute zinc in the ZnO system 46.It stimulates the distorted tetrahedral surrounding around Zn and deviation in the lattice parameters 45.NEXAFS features for ZnO and CdS/CoeZnO NRs, coincide within 1 eV PE range, suggesting that both have similar regular tetrahedral environment of anions for Zn atoms.The results also suggested about the distorted tetrahedral arrangement in the CoeZnO system, where the metallic species Co (II) and Zn are at the centre of the tetrahedra and anions (O 2A ) are situated at the four apexes of the tetrahedra.NEXAFS features of the all examined systems were refined by keeping typical k 3weightage in the range of 3.5e12 A A1 and using software FEFF (V-7) (Fig. S2a andb) 47.Respective refined parameters (leastsquares refined R-factor, mean first-shell metaleoxygen bond length, coordination number, and Debye-Waller factor) are extracted for ZnO (3.8wt, 1.99(8) A, 5.10 and 0.96 A 10 A2 A 2 ), CoeZnO (4.10wt, 2.01(4) A, 5.40 and 0.82 A 10 A2 A 2 ) and CdS/ CoeZnO (4.20wt, 1.95(7) A, 5.80 and 0.86 A 10 A2 A 2 ). The catalyst (0.3 g) was suspended in 140 mL of aqueous electrolyte of 0.35 M Na 2 S and 0.25 M K 2 SO 3 in a double walled-Pyrex glass reaction cell (volume 220 mL, with water jacket) that was sealed with a rubber septum.To expel the aircontent from the solution, the sample was purged with Ar for 1 h prior to start the photochemical reaction.Ar gas flows continuously in inner jacket, to maintain 1 atm pressure of the solution.Temperature of the outer jacket was set at 25 C.The suspension was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp (420 nm, light intensity 1 A 10 22 photons per hour Xe lamp-HX1, Model PE300UV, Perkin Elmer).All the experiments are carried out under ambient conditions.Photocatalytic responses were hourly monitored in terms of the amount of hydrogen generated at 1e7 h time intervals, using gas chromatograph (Shimazdu, Japan, thermal conductivity detector and molecular sieve with 5 A columns) throughout the course of the reaction.Photocatalytic cleavage of water was carried out in presence of the hole-scavenger electrolyte (0.25 M K 2 SO 3 0.35 M Na 2 S) solution of 13 pH, under the irradiation of 1 Sun (100 mW/cm 2 , AM1.5 G) visible light.Rough and hexagonal crystalline surface of the CdS/CoeZnO, loaded with co-catalyst (Pt) to facilitate the active sites for the oxidation (photohole rich) and reduction (photoelectron rich) of water.These active sites suppress the recombination of the photoelectric current carriers i.e. photoelectrons and photoholes.Hole-scavenger electrolyte was used to avoid the photooxidation of CdS nanoparticles present in the nanomolecular device by irreversible consumption of photogenerated holes that prohibited the oxidation of water 48.Corresponding amount of H 2 evolved without any noticeable degradation of the photocatalytic devices, such as 1.5 Pt/ ZnO, 1.5 Pt/CoeZnO, 1.5 Pt/CdS/ZnO and 1.5 Pt/CdS/ CoeZnO, was recorded as 10.2, 22.56, 50.57and 67.20 mmol/ H 2 g, respectively (Fig. 6a).Quantitative rise in the rate of H 2 evolved, was noticed after each step of the advancement on ZnO NRs, which follows a quadratic relation y 14 1.022(03) x 2 14.734 (15) x A 6.900 (16) and satisfy 3/2 order kinetics for advancement paradigm of nanomolecular device (Fig. 6b).Apparent quantum yield (AQY) was estimated for the tested device using Equation ( 4) with the assumption that all of the incident photons are absorbed during the photochemical reactions 49.where, the number of incident photons was 4.48 A 10 24 photon h A1 , measured using a Si photodiode, at 420 nm wavelength.Corresponding water splitting ability of the device was estimated in terms of AQY at 420 nm.These were found to be 0.30, 0.66, 1.49 and 1.98, respectively for above mentioned systems (1.5 Pt/ZnO, 1.5 Pt/CoeZnO, 1.5 Pt/CdS/ZnO and 1.5 Pt/CdS/CoeZnO).Reproducibility of these systems against their photocatalytic water splitting ability was checked thrice by using the same photocatalytic material (suspended particles in aqueous electrolyte) after their five times washing with the pure de-ionized water and drying at 100 C for 1 h.Electrochemical analyzer (Auto lab potentiostat model PGSTAT30) in the midst of software GPES (general purpose electrochemical study) manager, was used to monitor the photovoltaic responses of the test samples.Power density of the light source was controlled at 100 mWcm A2 (AM1.5 G), using thermopile (Gentec () Solo-2, Model-UP12E105-H5) at the beginning and checked at end of the each PEC run.Pyrex glass photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell with water jacket was well equipped with a small quartz window and conventional three electrode-system, comprising of a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode, a Pt flag as counter electrode and uniform film of the sample loaded on fluorinedoped tin oxide (FTO) substrate (using doctor blade method) as the working electrode (WE).A wide potential window with a width of 1.5 V (A0.9 to 0.6 V) recorded during photovoltaic study of 1.5 Pt/CdS/CoeZnO NRs device, was attributed to good electron exchange quality of the system (Fig. 6c) 50.Significantly, no saturation in photocurrent was observed at applied positive potentials, which indicates efficient charge separation upon light illumination that is responsible for higher hydrogen evolution amount 51. On the basis of this study and other supportive analytical evidences 7,52, the most plausible overall photocatalytic water splitting mechanism for the nanodevice (1.5 Pt/CdS/ CoeZnO NRs) in presence of hole sacrificial electrolyte under visible light exposure, is suggested and illustrated by Fig. 7. During electron transfer, when the surface of the device was illuminated with light, an electron was excited from VB to CB, which generates a pair of photohole and photoelectron in corresponding VB and CB of CoeZnO.Nascent photoelectrons of CB (CoeZnO) are transported to the CB of quantum confined nano-sized sensitizer (CdS).This electron arrived at the junction of Pt/electrolyte interface by passing through the electron-pool of the metallic Pt.At the interface, photoelectrons interacts with H ions 53 of the solution and liberates nascent H that combined with another nascent H atom to generate H 2 gas.Hole accumulated at VB of CoeZnO and CdS, were consumed by hole-scavenger electrolyte.Major chemical reactions 54, responsible for hydrogen evolution by photocatalytic cleavage of the water, are given by the Equations (5e8).

SAED pattern (Fig. 2a) of flat-end CoeZnO NRs was obtained corresponding to the HRTEM image, which evident the hexagonal orientation of the Lau's spot around central spot, proves the presence of the crystalline single hexagonal phase of the CoeZnO NRs, consistent with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) results.Lattice fringes, depicted in the HRTEM image (Fig. 2b), are separated by 2.42 nm distance, illustrate the high crystalline nature of NRs that grow along the (011) plane.EDX profile of the CoeZnO NRs, possess the Co and Zn peaks that confirms the Co-doping onto ZnO lattice (Fig. 2c).Fig. 2d exhibits the HRTEM image of CdS loaded Co doped ZnO that revealed the presence of the heterojunction between CdS and Co-doped ZnO.i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y x x x ( 2 0 1 5 ) 1 e9 accounts for the hexagonal crystal growth in both samples along the 011 plane.Diffraction patterns of the pristine ZnO and CoeZnO NRs, shown by Fig. 3a, confirm that both belongs to the P6 3 mC space group and their corresponding lattice parameters are a 14 Minor shifting in XRD-peaks of CoeZnO was found towards lower angles in comparison to the pristine ZnO NRs (Fig. 3b) that strongly recommends the incorporation of the slightly bigger ions i.e.Co 2 (IR 14 0.075 nm Zn 2 ; IR 14 0.074 nm) into ZnO lattice.Value of c/a ratio was estimated as 1.626 (1.633 for ideal tetrahedra) for the CoeZnO system that reflected the hexagonal packing of the atoms by geometric occupation of ions at dissimilar sites of slightly distorted tetrahedra.The tetrahedral positions are occupied by anions at four apices and by cations at centre 40.good agreement with the standard CdS (JCPDS card No. 80-0006).It proves the successful loading of the hexagonal CdS nanoparticles onto the ZnO NR's and CoeZnO NR's surface as shown in Fig. 3c.XRD patterns of the all studied samples are shown in Fig. 3aec and following Equation (2) 41, is used to measure the crystallinity of the samples. Diffuse reflectance UVevisible absorption spectrum was recorded for the dry and pressed disk samples of powdered ZnO NRs to confirm the doping of Co and deposition of CdS on ZnO NRs, by using UVevisible spectrophotometer (UV-1700, Shimazdu, Japan with UV Probe device).Moisture free BaSO 4 was used as a reflectance standard in a UVeVis diffuse reflectance experiment.Instrumental error was noticed around the wavelength 350 nm due to the shifting of the light source from UV to Visible region, which was found responsible for the noise.Characteristic diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 4a andb) of the samples illustrate the red shifts in their edges with broadening in the main peak (300e525 nm) on successive advancement (addition of Co or CdS) in the ZnO NRs for making of the hetero-assembly CdS/CoeZnO NRs.First excitation peak centred at 450 nm, represents the presence of the CdS.Co 2 -incorporated samples (CoeZnO NRs and CdS/CoeZnO NRs) exhibits a secondary peak around 525e700 nm that is attributed to the multiple ded transitions of Co(II) 42.Band gap (E g ) of the studied system has been estimated at different stages of the advancement of ZnO NRs using the KubelkaeMunk function F(R) vs wavelength plot (Fig. 4a andb).Successive surface modification of ZnO nanostructures reduces their band gaps, as follows 3.18 eV (ZnO NRs), 3.00 eV (CoeZnO NRs), 2.48 eV (CdS/ZnO NRs) and 2.25 eV (CdS/CoeZnO NRs).Band gap of the CdS/CoeZnO NRs, ensures us about the good possibility of using it for photocatalytic hydrogen generation.First excitonic peak of DRS spectrum was utilized to determine the particle size of the sensitizer CdS (ca 5.24 nm) in CdS/CoeZnO NRs by using following power Equation (3) 43, where, D (nm) is the size of the CdS nanosensitizer in heterostructure, and l (nm) is the first excitonic absorption wavelength i.e. 450 nm for the corresponding sample.It represented that the incorporation of 5.24 nm CdS nanoparticles on CoeZnO NRs (400 nm broad and 2 mm long). X-Ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), was used to examine the local electronic environment around the centre atom.XAS (XANES/EXAFS) was recorded at BL-8 dispersive EXAFS beamline at INDUS-2 synchrotron radiation source at RRCAT, Indore.Measurements were made at the Zn K-edge (9659 eV) in fluorescence mode at room temperature with a sevenelement HPGe detector and double crystal Si (111) monochromator.Measurements were performed along the c axis perpendicular to electric field vector and along the c axis in the plane of the electric field vector.The raw X-ray absorption data were analysed using a standard procedure (software program ATHENA) that includes the subtraction of the preand post-edge background, edge calibration with a reference Zn foil, and normalization of edge jump.The Fourier transform of the normalized k 3 -weighted EXAFS spectra was taken using the program ARTEMIS for k from 2 to 11.5 A A1 and Hanning window function followed by a nonlinear leastsquares fit between 1.0 and 3.6 A. Theoretical phase and amplitude functions were calculated using the FEFF (V.8.4) code.This technique identifies the lattice disorders and shortrange local atomic arrangement around the central atoms, which XRD can't observe 44.XAS profiles of the ZnO, CoeZnO and CdS/CoeZnO NRs, were recorded at Zn K edge.Typical normalized XAS plot between X-ray absorption cross-section and photonic energy (PE) are displayed in Fig. 5aec.XAS profile was divided into four prominent zones with respect to the photonic energy of incoming photons i.e. pre-edge, edge, near-edge (XANES; X-rays absorption near edge spectroscopy) and fine structures (EXAFS; extended X-rays absorption fine structures and NEXAFS; near edge X-ray absorption fine structure) regions.Absence of pre-edge features (ls / 3d; dipole forbidden transition, PE 9659 eV) in all samples are credited to the fully occupied 3 d 10 configuration of Zn 2 ions 39 and negligible p-band defects.Edge features (ls / 4p) of CoeZnO shifted towards the higher PE 14 9660.23 eV with respect to the pure ZnO and CdS/CoeZnO NRs (PE 14 9659 eV) are attributed to the replacement of the high polarity ZneO bonds by the low polarity CoeO and CoeZn bonds in CoeZnO. Eventually, the presence of the highly polar bonds of CdS/ CoeZnO NRs i.e.CdeO, CdeS and ZneS, nullified the shifting in edge.It also confirms the existence of the highly oxidised Zn atoms (2 oxidation state) in CoeZnO NRs, attributed to the adsorption process 45.Almost same edge position of the pristine ZnO and CdS/CoeZnO NRs, signify the retention of similar oxidation state of Zn (2) in both.Intense, symmetrical and superimposed white line (WL) peak features of ZnO and CoeZnO NRs, centred at 9668.50 eV (10.01 eV/step), are originated due to ls-4p hybridization, reflected the similar electronic surroundings in both the species.Short heighted WL peak of CdS/CoeZnO NRs, predicts the low degree of anisotropy, and highly disordered arrangement of elements around Zn atom 6.Electronic transition 1s / 4d in Zn is attributed to the EXAFS features at P E 9668.50 50 eV.Shoulder peak was observed at 9678.52 eV, followed by the symmetrical third and fourth peaks at PE 9695.96 and 9714.00 eV, respectively for both sample.These fine features reflected that the anions envelop the central Zn atoms in a regular tetrahedral fashion in above two samples.Absence of the 9695.96eV peak in CoeZnO, reveals the existence of the cobalt (II) oxide with few Co atoms that substitute zinc in the ZnO system 46.It stimulates the distorted tetrahedral surrounding around Zn and deviation in the lattice parameters 45.NEXAFS features for ZnO and CdS/CoeZnO NRs, coincide within 1 eV PE range, suggesting that both have similar regular tetrahedral environment of anions for Zn atoms.The results also suggested about the distorted tetrahedral arrangement in the CoeZnO system, where the metallic species Co (II) and Zn are at the centre of the tetrahedra and anions (O 2A ) are situated at the four apexes of the tetrahedra.NEXAFS features of the all examined systems were refined by keeping typical k 3weightage in the range of 3.5e12 A A1 and using software FEFF (V-7) (Fig. S2a andb) 47.Respective refined parameters (leastsquares refined R-factor, mean first-shell metaleoxygen bond length, coordination number, and Debye-Waller factor) are extracted for ZnO (3.8wt, 1.99(8) A, 5.10 and 0.96 A 10 A2 A 2 ), CoeZnO (4.10wt, 2.01(4) A, 5.40 and 0.82 A 10 A2 A 2 ) and CdS/ CoeZnO (4.20wt, 1.95(7) A, 5.80 and 0.86 A 10 A2 A 2 ). The catalyst (0.3 g) was suspended in 140 mL of aqueous electrolyte of 0.35 M Na 2 S and 0.25 M K 2 SO 3 in a double walled-Pyrex glass reaction cell (volume 220 mL, with water jacket) that was sealed with a rubber septum.To expel the aircontent from the solution, the sample was purged with Ar for 1 h prior to start the photochemical reaction.Ar gas flows continuously in inner jacket, to maintain 1 atm pressure of the solution.Temperature of the outer jacket was set at 25 C.The suspension was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp (420 nm, light intensity 1 A 10 22 photons per hour Xe lamp-HX1, Model PE300UV, Perkin Elmer).All the experiments are carried out under ambient conditions.Photocatalytic responses were hourly monitored in terms of the amount of hydrogen generated at 1e7 h time intervals, using gas chromatograph (Shimazdu, Japan, thermal conductivity detector and molecular sieve with 5 A columns) throughout the course of the reaction.Photocatalytic cleavage of water was carried out in presence of the hole-scavenger electrolyte (0.25 M K 2 SO 3 0.35 M Na 2 S) solution of 13 pH, under the irradiation of 1 Sun (100 mW/cm 2 , AM1.5 G) visible light.Rough and hexagonal crystalline surface of the CdS/CoeZnO, loaded with co-catalyst (Pt) to facilitate the active sites for the oxidation (photohole rich) and reduction (photoelectron rich) of water.These active sites suppress the recombination of the photoelectric current carriers i.e. photoelectrons and photoholes.Hole-scavenger electrolyte was used to avoid the photooxidation of CdS nanoparticles present in the nanomolecular device by irreversible consumption of photogenerated holes that prohibited the oxidation of water 48.Corresponding amount of H 2 evolved without any noticeable degradation of the photocatalytic devices, such as 1.5 Pt/ ZnO, 1.5 Pt/CoeZnO, 1.5 Pt/CdS/ZnO and 1.5 Pt/CdS/ CoeZnO, was recorded as 10.2, 22.56, 50.57and 67.20 mmol/ H 2 g, respectively (Fig. 6a).Quantitative rise in the rate of H 2 evolved, was noticed after each step of the advancement on ZnO NRs, which follows a quadratic relation y 14 1.022(03) x 2 14.734 (15) x A 6.900 (16) and satisfy 3/2 order kinetics for advancement paradigm of nanomolecular device (Fig. 6b).Apparent quantum yield (AQY) was estimated for the tested device using Equation ( 4) with the assumption that all of the incident photons are absorbed during the photochemical reactions 49.where, the number of incident photons was 4.48 A 10 24 photon h A1 , measured using a Si photodiode, at 420 nm wavelength.Corresponding water splitting ability of the device was estimated in terms of AQY at 420 nm.These were found to be 0.30, 0.66, 1.49 and 1.98, respectively for above mentioned systems (1.5 Pt/ZnO, 1.5 Pt/CoeZnO, 1.5 Pt/CdS/ZnO and 1.5 Pt/CdS/CoeZnO).Reproducibility of these systems against their photocatalytic water splitting ability was checked thrice by using the same photocatalytic material (suspended particles in aqueous electrolyte) after their five times washing with the pure de-ionized water and drying at 100 C for 1 h.Electrochemical analyzer (Auto lab potentiostat model PGSTAT30) in the midst of software GPES (general purpose electrochemical study) manager, was used to monitor the photovoltaic responses of the test samples.Power density of the light source was controlled at 100 mWcm A2 (AM1.5 G), using thermopile (Gentec () Solo-2, Model-UP12E105-H5) at the beginning and checked at end of the each PEC run.Pyrex glass photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell with water jacket was well equipped with a small quartz window and conventional three electrode-system, comprising of a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode, a Pt flag as counter electrode and uniform film of the sample loaded on fluorinedoped tin oxide (FTO) substrate (using doctor blade method) as the working electrode (WE).A wide potential window with a width of 1.5 V (A0.9 to 0.6 V) recorded during photovoltaic study of 1.5 Pt/CdS/CoeZnO NRs device, was attributed to good electron exchange quality of the system (Fig. 6c) 50.Significantly, no saturation in photocurrent was observed at applied positive potentials, which indicates efficient charge separation upon light illumination that is responsible for higher hydrogen evolution amount 51. On the basis of this study and other supportive analytical evidences 7,52, the most plausible overall photocatalytic water splitting mechanism for the nanodevice (1.5 Pt/CdS/ CoeZnO NRs) in presence of hole sacrificial electrolyte under visible light exposure, is suggested and illustrated by Fig. 7. During electron transfer, when the surface of the device was illuminated with light, an electron was excited from VB to CB, which generates a pair of photohole and photoelectron in corresponding VB and CB of CoeZnO.Nascent photoelectrons of CB (CoeZnO) are transported to the CB of quantum confined nano-sized sensitizer (CdS).This electron arrived at the junction of Pt/electrolyte interface by passing through the electron-pool of the metallic Pt.At the interface, photoelectrons interacts with H ions 53 of the solution and liberates nascent H that combined with another nascent H atom to generate H 2 gas.Hole accumulated at VB of CoeZnO and CdS, were consumed by hole-scavenger electrolyte.Major chemical reactions 54, responsible for hydrogen evolution by photocatalytic cleavage of the water, are given by the Equations (5e8). On photo A exposure : Overall Redox Reaction :"}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The catalyst (0.3 g) was suspended in 140 mL of aqueous electrolyte of 0.35 M Na 2 S and 0.25 M K 2 SO 3 in a double walled-Pyrex glass reaction cell (volume 220 mL, with water jacket) that was sealed with a rubber septum.", "context": "As fabricated nanomolecular device (1.5 Pt/CdS/CoeZnO NRs) was rigorously characterised at every step of fabrication process, using variety of analytic tools.Morphological images of ZnO NRs, was recorded using a field emission-scanning electron microscope (FESEM; Hitachi S-4000) after every step of advancement.High resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM; JEM-2100F, at 200 kV) and corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, were used to know the lattice fringes and growth directions from selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and elemental ratio.Products of hydrothermal process at varying concentration of aqueous CTAB and seeds, were examined by using FESEM (Fig. S1).All concentrations of CTAB (17.5, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40) was kept greater than its critical micelle concentration (CMC; 0.95 mM) to promote one dimensional (1D) augmentation of CoeZnO seeds 31.According to the principle of dynamic solvation, there is a selective adsorption (electrostatic) of the cationic surfactant on the hexagonal facets i.e. (100) and (111) planes, which was also evident from HRTEM images of CoeZnO seeds 32.Dissimilar rate of attachment/detachment of surfactant on above planes, effectively reduce the energy and growth rate along these planes that allows NRs to grow along (011) plane 33,34.Sterically bulky cationic surfactant, CTAB plays two major roles in production of one dimensional CoeZnO structures: (i) As micellizer, it induces 1D molecular aggregation of micelles in aqueous medium and (ii) As stabilizer, it stabilises the micelle-captivated CoeZnO nanoclusters by preventing their uncontrollable growth.Results of both of these actions collectively promote cylindrical aggregation (wormlike micelle) of ZnO or CoeZnO seeds (scaffold by CTAB) in opposite directions with time that creates a junction in the middle of the rods (revealed from FESEM images) 35,36.The growth process of NRs will continuous till the critical mass of the nanorods of ZnO or CoeZnO, was attained.Afterwards, NRs split into two parts, as illustrated in Fig. 1.Final size of the NRs strictly depend on the size of the reaction volume i.e. driven by the radius of the cavity in water droplets with surfactant R w , which is expressed by the following Equation (1) 37. where, ss 14 polar group area of surfactants' head and V aq H 2 O 14 volume of water.It means the size of the nanorod can be regulated by changing the volume of water and the polar head area of micelles (controlled by CTAB concentration).Increase in volume of water droplet directed to increase the volume of the surfactant in surfactant-incorporated water droplets.Increase in CTAB concentration tends to increase in head area of polar group.Both of these effects, contribute equally in keeping the size of the CoeZnO NRs (400 nm broad and 2 mm long) same even at higher CTAB concentration reactions.FESEM images (Fig. S1a andb) of the CoeZnO nanoarchitects fabricated at different concentrations of the CTAB and the supporting literature 38, give some significant hints about their physical growth mechanism.Gradual morphological transformations were observed in finishing-end shape of the CoeZnO NRs with augmentation in CTAB amount/ concentrations.At 17.5, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 CTAB concentration, corresponding shuttle-end, flat end, cocoon-end (without hole), cocoon-end (with hole), cocoon-end (with big hole) and cocoon-end (with hole) hexagonal rods were obtained, respectively.Due to the apt salt/surfactant ratio (CoeZnO/CTAB 14 1:0.20) in 20 CTAB 39, the flat-end CoeZnO NRs were produced.Beyond 20 CTAB concentration, the enhancement in CTAB concentration, promotes the formation of excess of bromide ions by cleavage of CTAB.These bromide ions induced chemical inching in nanooxides, which was initiated from the centre of the (011) plane of the hexagonal CoeZnO NRs and created a hole at centre.The size of this hole increases with CTAB concentration from 50 nm (30 CTAB) to 76 nm (35 CTAB) to 98 nm (40 CTAB).Further, whatever may be the concentration of CTAB was used for synthesis, almost same sized (400 nm wide and 2 mm long) hexagonal-nanorods were obtained. SAED pattern (Fig. 2a) of flat-end CoeZnO NRs was obtained corresponding to the HRTEM image, which evident the hexagonal orientation of the Lau's spot around central spot, proves the presence of the crystalline single hexagonal phase of the CoeZnO NRs, consistent with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) results.Lattice fringes, depicted in the HRTEM image (Fig. 2b), are separated by 2.42 nm distance, illustrate the high crystalline nature of NRs that grow along the (011) plane.EDX profile of the CoeZnO NRs, possess the Co and Zn peaks that confirms the Co-doping onto ZnO lattice (Fig. 2c).Fig. 2d exhibits the HRTEM image of CdS loaded Co doped ZnO that revealed the presence of the heterojunction between CdS and Co-doped ZnO.i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y x x x ( 2 0 1 5 ) 1 e9 accounts for the hexagonal crystal growth in both samples along the 011 plane.Diffraction patterns of the pristine ZnO and CoeZnO NRs, shown by Fig. 3a, confirm that both belongs to the P6 3 mC space group and their corresponding lattice parameters are a 14 Minor shifting in XRD-peaks of CoeZnO was found towards lower angles in comparison to the pristine ZnO NRs (Fig. 3b) that strongly recommends the incorporation of the slightly bigger ions i.e.Co 2 (IR 14 0.075 nm Zn 2 ; IR 14 0.074 nm) into ZnO lattice.Value of c/a ratio was estimated as 1.626 (1.633 for ideal tetrahedra) for the CoeZnO system that reflected the hexagonal packing of the atoms by geometric occupation of ions at dissimilar sites of slightly distorted tetrahedra.The tetrahedral positions are occupied by anions at four apices and by cations at centre 40.good agreement with the standard CdS (JCPDS card No. 80-0006).It proves the successful loading of the hexagonal CdS nanoparticles onto the ZnO NR's and CoeZnO NR's surface as shown in Fig. 3c.XRD patterns of the all studied samples are shown in Fig. 3aec and following Equation (2) 41, is used to measure the crystallinity of the samples. Diffuse reflectance UVevisible absorption spectrum was recorded for the dry and pressed disk samples of powdered ZnO NRs to confirm the doping of Co and deposition of CdS on ZnO NRs, by using UVevisible spectrophotometer (UV-1700, Shimazdu, Japan with UV Probe device).Moisture free BaSO 4 was used as a reflectance standard in a UVeVis diffuse reflectance experiment.Instrumental error was noticed around the wavelength 350 nm due to the shifting of the light source from UV to Visible region, which was found responsible for the noise.Characteristic diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 4a andb) of the samples illustrate the red shifts in their edges with broadening in the main peak (300e525 nm) on successive advancement (addition of Co or CdS) in the ZnO NRs for making of the hetero-assembly CdS/CoeZnO NRs.First excitation peak centred at 450 nm, represents the presence of the CdS.Co 2 -incorporated samples (CoeZnO NRs and CdS/CoeZnO NRs) exhibits a secondary peak around 525e700 nm that is attributed to the multiple ded transitions of Co(II) 42.Band gap (E g ) of the studied system has been estimated at different stages of the advancement of ZnO NRs using the KubelkaeMunk function F(R) vs wavelength plot (Fig. 4a andb).Successive surface modification of ZnO nanostructures reduces their band gaps, as follows 3.18 eV (ZnO NRs), 3.00 eV (CoeZnO NRs), 2.48 eV (CdS/ZnO NRs) and 2.25 eV (CdS/CoeZnO NRs).Band gap of the CdS/CoeZnO NRs, ensures us about the good possibility of using it for photocatalytic hydrogen generation.First excitonic peak of DRS spectrum was utilized to determine the particle size of the sensitizer CdS (ca 5.24 nm) in CdS/CoeZnO NRs by using following power Equation (3) 43, where, D (nm) is the size of the CdS nanosensitizer in heterostructure, and l (nm) is the first excitonic absorption wavelength i.e. 450 nm for the corresponding sample.It represented that the incorporation of 5.24 nm CdS nanoparticles on CoeZnO NRs (400 nm broad and 2 mm long). X-Ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), was used to examine the local electronic environment around the centre atom.XAS (XANES/EXAFS) was recorded at BL-8 dispersive EXAFS beamline at INDUS-2 synchrotron radiation source at RRCAT, Indore.Measurements were made at the Zn K-edge (9659 eV) in fluorescence mode at room temperature with a sevenelement HPGe detector and double crystal Si (111) monochromator.Measurements were performed along the c axis perpendicular to electric field vector and along the c axis in the plane of the electric field vector.The raw X-ray absorption data were analysed using a standard procedure (software program ATHENA) that includes the subtraction of the preand post-edge background, edge calibration with a reference Zn foil, and normalization of edge jump.The Fourier transform of the normalized k 3 -weighted EXAFS spectra was taken using the program ARTEMIS for k from 2 to 11.5 A A1 and Hanning window function followed by a nonlinear leastsquares fit between 1.0 and 3.6 A. Theoretical phase and amplitude functions were calculated using the FEFF (V.8.4) code.This technique identifies the lattice disorders and shortrange local atomic arrangement around the central atoms, which XRD can't observe 44.XAS profiles of the ZnO, CoeZnO and CdS/CoeZnO NRs, were recorded at Zn K edge.Typical normalized XAS plot between X-ray absorption cross-section and photonic energy (PE) are displayed in Fig. 5aec.XAS profile was divided into four prominent zones with respect to the photonic energy of incoming photons i.e. pre-edge, edge, near-edge (XANES; X-rays absorption near edge spectroscopy) and fine structures (EXAFS; extended X-rays absorption fine structures and NEXAFS; near edge X-ray absorption fine structure) regions.Absence of pre-edge features (ls / 3d; dipole forbidden transition, PE 9659 eV) in all samples are credited to the fully occupied 3 d 10 configuration of Zn 2 ions 39 and negligible p-band defects.Edge features (ls / 4p) of CoeZnO shifted towards the higher PE 14 9660.23 eV with respect to the pure ZnO and CdS/CoeZnO NRs (PE 14 9659 eV) are attributed to the replacement of the high polarity ZneO bonds by the low polarity CoeO and CoeZn bonds in CoeZnO. Eventually, the presence of the highly polar bonds of CdS/ CoeZnO NRs i.e.CdeO, CdeS and ZneS, nullified the shifting in edge.It also confirms the existence of the highly oxidised Zn atoms (2 oxidation state) in CoeZnO NRs, attributed to the adsorption process 45.Almost same edge position of the pristine ZnO and CdS/CoeZnO NRs, signify the retention of similar oxidation state of Zn (2) in both.Intense, symmetrical and superimposed white line (WL) peak features of ZnO and CoeZnO NRs, centred at 9668.50 eV (10.01 eV/step), are originated due to ls-4p hybridization, reflected the similar electronic surroundings in both the species.Short heighted WL peak of CdS/CoeZnO NRs, predicts the low degree of anisotropy, and highly disordered arrangement of elements around Zn atom 6.Electronic transition 1s / 4d in Zn is attributed to the EXAFS features at P E 9668.50 50 eV.Shoulder peak was observed at 9678.52 eV, followed by the symmetrical third and fourth peaks at PE 9695.96 and 9714.00 eV, respectively for both sample.These fine features reflected that the anions envelop the central Zn atoms in a regular tetrahedral fashion in above two samples.Absence of the 9695.96eV peak in CoeZnO, reveals the existence of the cobalt (II) oxide with few Co atoms that substitute zinc in the ZnO system 46.It stimulates the distorted tetrahedral surrounding around Zn and deviation in the lattice parameters 45.NEXAFS features for ZnO and CdS/CoeZnO NRs, coincide within 1 eV PE range, suggesting that both have similar regular tetrahedral environment of anions for Zn atoms.The results also suggested about the distorted tetrahedral arrangement in the CoeZnO system, where the metallic species Co (II) and Zn are at the centre of the tetrahedra and anions (O 2A ) are situated at the four apexes of the tetrahedra.NEXAFS features of the all examined systems were refined by keeping typical k 3weightage in the range of 3.5e12 A A1 and using software FEFF (V-7) (Fig. S2a andb) 47.Respective refined parameters (leastsquares refined R-factor, mean first-shell metaleoxygen bond length, coordination number, and Debye-Waller factor) are extracted for ZnO (3.8wt, 1.99(8) A, 5.10 and 0.96 A 10 A2 A 2 ), CoeZnO (4.10wt, 2.01(4) A, 5.40 and 0.82 A 10 A2 A 2 ) and CdS/ CoeZnO (4.20wt, 1.95(7) A, 5.80 and 0.86 A 10 A2 A 2 ). The catalyst (0.3 g) was suspended in 140 mL of aqueous electrolyte of 0.35 M Na 2 S and 0.25 M K 2 SO 3 in a double walled-Pyrex glass reaction cell (volume 220 mL, with water jacket) that was sealed with a rubber septum.To expel the aircontent from the solution, the sample was purged with Ar for 1 h prior to start the photochemical reaction.Ar gas flows continuously in inner jacket, to maintain 1 atm pressure of the solution.Temperature of the outer jacket was set at 25 C.The suspension was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp (420 nm, light intensity 1 A 10 22 photons per hour Xe lamp-HX1, Model PE300UV, Perkin Elmer).All the experiments are carried out under ambient conditions.Photocatalytic responses were hourly monitored in terms of the amount of hydrogen generated at 1e7 h time intervals, using gas chromatograph (Shimazdu, Japan, thermal conductivity detector and molecular sieve with 5 A columns) throughout the course of the reaction.Photocatalytic cleavage of water was carried out in presence of the hole-scavenger electrolyte (0.25 M K 2 SO 3 0.35 M Na 2 S) solution of 13 pH, under the irradiation of 1 Sun (100 mW/cm 2 , AM1.5 G) visible light.Rough and hexagonal crystalline surface of the CdS/CoeZnO, loaded with co-catalyst (Pt) to facilitate the active sites for the oxidation (photohole rich) and reduction (photoelectron rich) of water.These active sites suppress the recombination of the photoelectric current carriers i.e. photoelectrons and photoholes.Hole-scavenger electrolyte was used to avoid the photooxidation of CdS nanoparticles present in the nanomolecular device by irreversible consumption of photogenerated holes that prohibited the oxidation of water 48.Corresponding amount of H 2 evolved without any noticeable degradation of the photocatalytic devices, such as 1.5 Pt/ ZnO, 1.5 Pt/CoeZnO, 1.5 Pt/CdS/ZnO and 1.5 Pt/CdS/ CoeZnO, was recorded as 10.2, 22.56, 50.57and 67.20 mmol/ H 2 g, respectively (Fig. 6a).Quantitative rise in the rate of H 2 evolved, was noticed after each step of the advancement on ZnO NRs, which follows a quadratic relation y 14 1.022(03) x 2 14.734 (15) x A 6.900 (16) and satisfy 3/2 order kinetics for advancement paradigm of nanomolecular device (Fig. 6b).Apparent quantum yield (AQY) was estimated for the tested device using Equation ( 4) with the assumption that all of the incident photons are absorbed during the photochemical reactions 49.where, the number of incident photons was 4.48 A 10 24 photon h A1 , measured using a Si photodiode, at 420 nm wavelength.Corresponding water splitting ability of the device was estimated in terms of AQY at 420 nm.These were found to be 0.30, 0.66, 1.49 and 1.98, respectively for above mentioned systems (1.5 Pt/ZnO, 1.5 Pt/CoeZnO, 1.5 Pt/CdS/ZnO and 1.5 Pt/CdS/CoeZnO).Reproducibility of these systems against their photocatalytic water splitting ability was checked thrice by using the same photocatalytic material (suspended particles in aqueous electrolyte) after their five times washing with the pure de-ionized water and drying at 100 C for 1 h.Electrochemical analyzer (Auto lab potentiostat model PGSTAT30) in the midst of software GPES (general purpose electrochemical study) manager, was used to monitor the photovoltaic responses of the test samples.Power density of the light source was controlled at 100 mWcm A2 (AM1.5 G), using thermopile (Gentec () Solo-2, Model-UP12E105-H5) at the beginning and checked at end of the each PEC run.Pyrex glass photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell with water jacket was well equipped with a small quartz window and conventional three electrode-system, comprising of a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode, a Pt flag as counter electrode and uniform film of the sample loaded on fluorinedoped tin oxide (FTO) substrate (using doctor blade method) as the working electrode (WE).A wide potential window with a width of 1.5 V (A0.9 to 0.6 V) recorded during photovoltaic study of 1.5 Pt/CdS/CoeZnO NRs device, was attributed to good electron exchange quality of the system (Fig. 6c) 50.Significantly, no saturation in photocurrent was observed at applied positive potentials, which indicates efficient charge separation upon light illumination that is responsible for higher hydrogen evolution amount 51. On the basis of this study and other supportive analytical evidences 7,52, the most plausible overall photocatalytic water splitting mechanism for the nanodevice (1.5 Pt/CdS/ CoeZnO NRs) in presence of hole sacrificial electrolyte under visible light exposure, is suggested and illustrated by Fig. 7.

Another crystal parameter b/c (u) 14 0.615 (0.375 for an ideal crystal), shows the existence of the anionecation bond, parallel to the c-axis.c/a parameter follows an inversely proportional relationship with u.Therefore, on decreasing c/a value with respect to ideal tetrahedra, u adjusts itself in such a way that the four tetrahedral distances get balanced through the distortion in tetrahedral angles and distances.Prominent and sharp peak (011) around 2q 14 36.26 , reconfirms the crystal growth along (011) plane.Crystalline domain of the flat end CoeZnO NRs, was calculated using Debye-Sherrer equation i.e. 385 nm, which is quite near to the average size (400 nm) of the NRs that measured by FESEM images.Fig.3cexpressed the significantly broad XRD peaks of CdS accompanied with regular wurtzite CoeZnO peaks, in CdS/CoeZnO NR's sample.In the same sample presence of the first broad peak centred at 2q 14 27 is an aggregation of (100), (002), and (101) peaks of CdS, (110) peak at 2q 14 44 , and (112) peak at 2q 14 52.5 , are also in Fig. 2 e HRTEM micrographs of CoeZnO NRs including the (a) SAED pattern, (b) lattice fringes, (c) EDX analysis.This shows well ordered crystalline planes along with hexagonal packing of atoms and a lattice spacing of 2.42 nm, corresponding to the growth 011-plane of Co doped-ZnO lattice and (d) HRTEM image of CdS nanoparticles loaded Co-doped ZnO that revealed the presence of the heterojunction between CdS and Co-doped ZnO.
