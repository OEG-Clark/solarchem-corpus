the concomitant reduction of water competing with that of CO 2 .", "context": "Structural analysis by XRD (Fig. 1) shows in all cases the characteristic diffraction peaks of the anatase phase (PDF 01-084-1286).No other features are visible with charges below 10, indicating the poor crystallinity of La phases or their small crystal size.In the case of 10 and 15 additional peaks are observed which can be indexed to crystalline La 2 O 2 CO 3 with mixed monoclinic (PDF 023-0322) and hexagonal (PDF 01-084-1963) phases without a clear dominance of any of them.Crystallite sizes and lattice parameters of the anatase phase in the different catalysts derived from Pawley analysis are summarized in Table 1.The slight variations found in these parameters indicate that lanthanum deposition does not cause any significant structural change in TiO 2 , or, in other words, that the anatase phase is not doped with La 3 ions.Raman spectra of the La phases observed by XRD were described by Orera et al. 16.The contribution of these species to the Raman spectra of the prepared catalysts (Fig. 2) can be only appreciated in the high energy side of the anatase E g band at ca. photon flux 145 cm -1 , which width is augmented by La-related band contributions, and in the increased intensity of the region of the E g anatase band at ca. 196 cm -1 .Otherwise, the spectra of all samples show, in addition to those features, the other characteristic bands of anatase at 396 (B 1g ), 516 (A 1g B 1g ) and 639 (E g ) cm -1 22.The TEM micrographs of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3.In samples with La contents lower than 5, a homogeneous distribution of particles with sizes between 5 and 12 nm is observed.EDX analyses of selected zones reveal La contents in good agreement with nominal ones.On the other hand, lanthanum-rich areas are not observed, indicating small particle sizes and good dispersion of La phases in agreement with XRD and XPS studies (see below).However, in the catalysts that contain higher amounts of lanthanum (10-15), an agglomeration of the La-particles is observed in specific regions with larger particle sizes.At the extreme composition of 15La/ TiO 2 , La was only detected in these agglomerations, with only EDX signals attributable to O and Ti in the areas composed of small particles.The textural properties of bare TiO 2 and La-modified catalysts examined by N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Table 1) indicate that lanthanum leads to an increase in the BET surface areas up to 5 charge, in accordance with the contribution of small-sized La phases in these samples.Surface areas decrease with the highest La loadings in line with the particle agglomeration observed in TEM images.The opto-electronic properties of the samples were examined from diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra, shown in Fig. 4a.As expected, the absorption edge of La 2 O 3 occurs at higher energy than in the case of TiO 2 .In turn, La/TiO 2 samples show no effect in the absorption properties of mixed photocatalysts with respect to titania, as reflected by the band gap values estimated from Tauc plots (Table 1).Figure 4b depicts the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all samples.In the case of bare TiO 2 and La/TiO 2 materials a broad band from 350 to 600 nm (3.5-2.1 eV) composed by multiple emission contributions is observed for all samples.Due to the selected experimental settings, the emission attributed to the direct recombination (336 nm) does not appear 23.The first peaks located at the beginning of the band (around 400 nm) can be assigned to the contribution of the band to band recombination (BTBR) process 24.This value is close to the indirect edge absorption transition observed for this material.Previous studies carried out in anatase 25 stated that the emission peaks located in that region are due to band-to-band indirect recombination routes with the assistance of optical phonons.PL bands from 400 to 600 nm can be divided in two regions: (1) peaks between 400 and 515 nm are related to the excitonic PL peaks trapped by surface.In the case of La/TiO 2 photocatalysts the band structure is almost the same but intensities considerably decrease with respect to bare titania, which in general terms can be related to lower electron-hole recombination rates 26.This synergy between La oxides and TiO 2 was previously reported by Yu et al. 19, evidencing that the photoelectron transfer resistance is considerably reduced in this materials, improving the electronic conductivity.These authors determined that this enhanced conductivity is due to a passivation effect ascribed the formation of electron blocking La oxide layer due to its higher band gap. Figure 5 shows the XPS spectra in the La3d and O1s regions for all the La-TiO 2 catalysts, where the La3d 5/2 peak is observed at the binding energy of 834.8 0.1 eV typical for La 3 states.The obtained spectra reveal an important overlap between the La MNN Auger electron peaks and the 3d La photoelectron peaks 27 which has been subtracted to allow the convolution and quantification.More in detail, the convolution (after subtraction) of 3d core level was performed into two peaks: One main peak corresponding to the final state without charge transfer, and a second contribution that include satellite peaks for the bonding and antibonding component of the final state with charge transfer 27,28.Taking into account the low amount of La, the plasmon contribution was neglected.The La/Ti ratios show an increase of La dispersion in the TiO 2 surface except for the 15La/TiO 2 sample, indicating an increase of La 2 O 3 particle size as corroborated by TEM studies. In addition, final state-satellite peaks ratio change with the La amount.The increase of satellite contribution indicate higher amount of La(OH) 3 instead of La 2 O 3 in the catalyst surface.This fact indicates that lower amount of La leads to smaller particles with higher amount of OH groups in their surface.These data are corroborated by O1s signals where in all cases a doublet is observed (Fig. 5).The most intense peak is located at 531.4 eV BE, is attributed to oxidic bonds due to TiO 2 and La phases.In addition, the second peak is ascribed to the presence of OH groups in the surface which proportion is higher in the case of lower lanthanum charges (Table 2). Figure 6 shows the evolution of the accumulated amounts of the main products with reaction time.As expected considering its large band gap, the calcined La 2 O 3 reference did not give rise to any production beyond experimental error.With TiO 2 and La/TiO 2 catalysts, the main CO 2 reduction products are CO and CH 4 , together with H 2 coming from the concomitant reduction of water competing with that of CO 2 .Trace amounts of other products like C 2 Fig. 6 From left to right and top to bottom, cumulative productions of H 2 , CO and CH 4 including associate error bars for each case.Bottom right Selectivity to the main products: H 2 (black), CO (red) and CH 4 (blue), and QYI (white circles) for the different catalysts hydrocarbons, methanol and ethanol are obtained, which represent altogether less than 1 of the total production in all cases.As observed in Fig. 6, a plateau in cumulative production is observed in all cases except for methane production, which is attributed to a catalyst deactivation related to the formation of carbonate and bicarbonate species blocking the active sites 29.In tests without irradiation, or in the absence of catalyst, no product formation was observed.Reactions in an Ar H 2 O atmosphere led to the production of mainly CO.This outcome may come from the total decomposition of the present amount of La 2 O 2 CO 3 , or from organic residues on the surface of the photocatalysts (see elemental analysis results in Table 2).In addition, previous studies performed in the group ascribed this production to the presence of carbonate/bicarbonate species on the surface of TiO 2 and/or to CO 2 dissolved in the fed water 29. A first analysis of the displayed results reveals that low contents of La (5 wt) lead to higher amounts of CO 2 reduction products, both CO and CH 4 , than neat TiO 2 .In the case of CO production, the samples containing 0.5, 1 and 5 La lead to similar results if experimental errors are taken into account, while 10 and 15 give rise to similar and lower production, respectively, compared to bare titania.The situation is alike in the case of methane production, although a particularly remarkable improvement is obtained over the 0.5La/TiO 2 catalyst.On the other hand, all the assayed La-containing catalysts give rise to higher H 2 production than titania, with a similar trend of yield versus La content as in the case of methane and with the 0.5La/ TiO 2 sample producing the highest amount in the studied period.Figure 6 also depicts the selectivities towards the main reaction products obtained with the different catalysts, calculated on the basis of these products only.The high selectivity to CO rather than to more reduced products is a common characteristic of TiO 2 photocatalysts without the presence of a metal co-catalyst 10,21,30.In line with this, the selectivity of carbon reduction is strongly directed towards carbon monoxide with all the catalysts studied here, with only a significant variation of CH 4 selectivity in the case of 0.5La/TiO 2 , which doubles that of titania.This has been related to a longer lifetime of photogenerated electron and holes, which permits the system to yield larger amounts of highly reduced carbon products 10,21,30, in line with the observations made by PL spectroscopy.Regarding quantum yields, absolute AQY values range from 0.14 to 0.26.The relative QYI values, calculated according to Eqs. 1 and 2 and included in Fig. 6, reveal better electron transport and transfer with respect to TiO 2 with La contents up to 5, in accordance with CO production.The best QYI obtained with the 0.5La/TiO 2 sample is therefore the reflection of the higher selectivity of this sample towards the 8-electron reduction of CO 2 to methane.In addition, Yu et al. 19, reported a promoter effect of La in TiO 2 that favour the photoelectron conductivity and transfer.This synergetic effect leads, in this case, to an increase in the CO 2 photoreduction that is more evident for samples with greater La dispersion (0.5La/TiO 2 ), which exhibit an enhancement in highly electron-demanding products (i.e.CH 4 ).Thus, better conductivity and electron transfer and the lower electron-hole recombination observed by PL spectroscopy can be suggested to account for this enhanced use of photogenerated charges, as the electronic contribution of the La promoter to improved photocatalytic activity. In order to study the second expected contribution of La invoked in the introduction of this work, that is, adsorption effects induced by the promoter, CO 2 TPD analyses were performed with all samples, the results of which are collected in Table 1 and Fig. 7.All samples show similar CO 2 TPD profiles, exhibiting the contribution of weak basic sites for the adsorption of carbon dioxide.Regarding adsorption types, the peak temperatures of CO 2 physisorption are essentially the same in all cases, but differences appear when the peak temperatures of CO 2 chemisorption are concerned.This temperature (243-248 C) decreases in La/TiO 2 samples with respect to bare titania (300 C), indicating that the strength of the basic sites of TiO 2 is decreased by the addition of lanthanum.Regarding adsorption capacities, quantitative variations are observed (see Fig. 7 Temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption profiles of all catalysts Table 1).This capacity is higher in the catalysts that contain lanthanum than in TiO 2 and reaches a maximum for the 10La/TiO 2 sample.In the catalyst with the highest content, however, this situation is reversed and 15La/TiO 2 shows a similar capacity as TiO 2 itself.Assuming that La phases are the cause of increased adsorption, the poor distribution and large particle size of La phases observed by TEM, and therefore the scarce contribution of these phases to surface area, may explain the broken trend in this sample.Therefore, the observed promotion of CO 2 reduction photoactivity induced by La in TiO 2 appears to come by the hand of two factors: an electronic one related to hindered electron-hole recombination and a surficial one resulting in enhanced reactant adsorption.Regarding the second factor, not only quantitatively enhanced adsorption is observed with the introduction of La phases, but also adsorbed CO 2 appears to be more labile in La/TiO 2 catalysts with respect to bare titania that favors the formation of more stable carbonate and bicarbonate species, as revealed by the desorption temperatures 31,32.The combination of both factors result in enhanced activity in La/TiO 2 samples with La content up to 5, with optimal quantum efficiency in the 0.5La/TiO 2 catalyst.A further increase in La charge, as represented by the 10 and 15 La/TiO 2 samples does not further contribute to photocatalytic activity, which can be ascribed to La agglomeration."}, {"llm generation": "La/TiO2 catalysts", "source": "With TiO 2 and La/TiO 2 catalysts, the main CO 2 reduction products are CO and

A first analysis of the displayed results reveals that low contents of La (5 wt) lead to higher amounts of CO 2 reduction products, both CO and CH 4 , than neat TiO 2 .In the case of CO production, the samples containing 0.5, 1 and 5 La lead to similar results if experimental errors are taken into account, while 10 and 15 give rise to similar and lower production, respectively, compared to bare titania.The situation is alike in the case of methane production, although a particularly remarkable improvement is obtained over the 0.5La/TiO 2 catalyst.On the other hand, all the assayed La-containing catalysts give rise to higher H 2 production than titania, with a similar trend of yield versus La content as in the case of methane and with the 0.5La/ TiO 2 sample producing the highest amount in the studied period.Figure 6 also depicts the selectivities towards the main reaction products obtained with the different catalysts, calculated on the basis of these products only.The high selectivity to CO rather than to more reduced products is a common characteristic of TiO 2 photocatalysts without the presence of a metal co-catalyst 10,21,30.In line with this, the selectivity of carbon reduction is strongly directed towards carbon monoxide with all the catalysts studied here, with only a significant variation of CH 4 selectivity in the case of 0.5La/TiO 2 , which doubles that of titania.This has been related to a longer lifetime of photogenerated electron and holes, which permits the system to yield larger amounts of highly reduced carbon products 10,21,30, in line with the observations made by PL spectroscopy.Regarding quantum yields, absolute AQY values range from 0.14 to 0.26.The relative QYI values, calculated according to Eqs. 1 and 2 and included in Fig. 6, reveal better electron transport and transfer with respect to TiO 2 with La contents up to 5, in accordance with CO production.The best QYI obtained with the 0.5La/TiO 2 sample is therefore the reflection of the higher selectivity of this sample towards the 8-electron reduction of CO 2 to methane.In addition, Yu et al. 19, reported a promoter effect of La in TiO 2 that favour the photoelectron conductivity and transfer.This synergetic effect leads, in this case, to an increase in the CO 2 photoreduction that is more evident for samples with greater La dispersion (0.5La/TiO 2 ), which exhibit an enhancement in highly electron-demanding products (i.e.CH 4 ).Thus, better conductivity and electron transfer and the lower electron-hole recombination observed by PL spectroscopy can be suggested to account for this enhanced use of photogenerated charges, as the electronic contribution of the La promoter to improved photocatalytic activity. In order to study the second expected contribution of La invoked in the introduction of this work, that is, adsorption effects induced by the promoter, CO 2 TPD analyses were performed with all samples, the results of which are collected in Table 1 and Fig. 7.All samples show similar CO 2 TPD profiles, exhibiting the contribution of weak basic sites for the adsorption of carbon dioxide.Regarding adsorption types, the peak temperatures of CO 2 physisorption are essentially the same in all cases, but differences appear when the peak temperatures of CO 2 chemisorption are concerned.This temperature (243-248 C) decreases in La/TiO 2 samples with respect to bare titania (300 C), indicating that the strength of the basic sites of TiO 2 is decreased by the addition of lanthanum.Regarding adsorption capacities, quantitative variations are observed (see Fig. 7 Temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption profiles of all catalysts Table 1).This capacity is higher in the catalysts that contain lanthanum than in TiO 2 and reaches a maximum for the 10La/TiO 2 sample.In the catalyst with the highest content, however, this situation is reversed and 15La/TiO 2 shows a similar capacity as TiO 2 itself.Assuming that La phases are the cause of increased adsorption, the poor distribution and large particle size of La phases observed by TEM, and therefore the scarce contribution of these phases to surface area, may explain the broken trend in this sample.Therefore, the observed promotion of CO 2 reduction photoactivity induced by La in TiO 2 appears to come by the hand of two factors: an electronic one related to hindered electron-hole recombination and a surficial one resulting in enhanced reactant adsorption.Regarding the second factor, not only quantitatively enhanced adsorption is observed with the introduction of La phases, but also adsorbed CO 2 appears to be more labile in La/TiO 2 catalysts with respect to bare titania that favors the formation of more stable carbonate and bicarbonate species, as revealed by the desorption temperatures 31,32.The combination of both factors result in enhanced activity in La/TiO 2 samples with La content up to 5, with optimal quantum efficiency in the 0.5La/TiO 2 catalyst.A further increase in La charge, as represented by the 10 and 15 La/TiO 2 samples does not further contribute to photocatalytic activity, which can be ascribed to La agglomeration."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2", "source": "In this work, the effect of lanthanum as TiO 2 promoter for CO 2 photoreduction using water as electron donor has been studied.", "context": "In this work, the effect of lanthanum as TiO 2 promoter for CO 2 photoreduction using water as electron donor has been studied.Even in the case that La 2 O 3 was used as reagent, the thermal treatment leads to different La-phases detected by XRD, Raman and XPS analysis that deepened on the promoter amount.Lower charges of La give rise to well dispersed La(OH) 3 that cover the TiO 2 surface and produce a decrease of the electron-hole recombination rate determined by photoluminescence spectroscopies.The increase of La (10-15 wt) leads to the formation of different Laoxycarbonates phases indicating its capacity to chemisorb CO 2 .Regarding photocatalytic reactions, the main detected products are in all cases H 2 , CO and CH 4 , the samples with La charges below to 10 wt reaching improved activity with respect to bare TiO 2 , which is optimized in the case of 0.5 wt La that exhibits the highest quantum efficiency.This superior photocatalytic CO 2 conversion for lower lanthanum loadings can be explained in terms of two key factors: First, the synergetic effect of the La/TiO 2 heterojunctions that show retarded electron-hole recombination and better charge transport and transfer.Second, these photocatalysts exhibit an enhancement in the CO 2 adsorption but in weaker basic active sites than un-promoted TiO 2 avoiding the stable bicarbonate formation.

4a.", "context": "Structural analysis by XRD (Fig. 1) shows in all cases the characteristic diffraction peaks of the anatase phase (PDF 01-084-1286).No other features are visible with charges below 10, indicating the poor crystallinity of La phases or their small crystal size.In the case of 10 and 15 additional peaks are observed which can be indexed to crystalline La 2 O 2 CO 3 with mixed monoclinic (PDF 023-0322) and hexagonal (PDF 01-084-1963) phases without a clear dominance of any of them.Crystallite sizes and lattice parameters of the anatase phase in the different catalysts derived from Pawley analysis are summarized in Table 1.The slight variations found in these parameters indicate that lanthanum deposition does not cause any significant structural change in TiO 2 , or, in other words, that the anatase phase is not doped with La 3 ions.Raman spectra of the La phases observed by XRD were described by Orera et al. 16.The contribution of these species to the Raman spectra of the prepared catalysts (Fig. 2) can be only appreciated in the high energy side of the anatase E g band at ca. photon flux 145 cm -1 , which width is augmented by La-related band contributions, and in the increased intensity of the region of the E g anatase band at ca. 196 cm -1 .Otherwise, the spectra of all samples show, in addition to those features, the other characteristic bands of anatase at 396 (B 1g ), 516 (A 1g B 1g ) and 639 (E g ) cm -1 22.The TEM micrographs of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3.In samples with La contents lower than 5, a homogeneous distribution of particles with sizes between 5 and 12 nm is observed.EDX analyses of selected zones reveal La contents in good agreement with nominal ones.On the other hand, lanthanum-rich areas are not observed, indicating small particle sizes and good dispersion of La phases in agreement with XRD and XPS studies (see below).However, in the catalysts that contain higher amounts of lanthanum (10-15), an agglomeration of the La-particles is observed in specific regions with larger particle sizes.At the extreme composition of 15La/ TiO 2 , La was only detected in these agglomerations, with only EDX signals attributable to O and Ti in the areas composed of small particles.The textural properties of bare TiO 2 and La-modified catalysts examined by N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Table 1) indicate that lanthanum leads to an increase in the BET surface areas up to 5 charge, in accordance with the contribution of small-sized La phases in these samples.Surface areas decrease with the highest La loadings in line with the particle agglomeration observed in TEM images.The opto-electronic properties of the samples were examined from diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra, shown in Fig. 4a.As expected, the absorption edge of La 2 O 3 occurs at higher energy than in the case of TiO 2 .In turn, La/TiO 2 samples show no effect in the absorption properties of mixed photocatalysts with respect to titania, as reflected by the band gap values estimated from Tauc plots (Table 1).Figure 4b depicts the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all samples.In the case of bare TiO 2 and La/TiO 2 materials a broad band from 350 to 600 nm (3.5-2.1 eV) composed by multiple emission contributions is observed for all samples.Due to the selected experimental settings, the emission attributed to the direct recombination (336 nm) does not appear 23.The first peaks located at the beginning of the band (around 400 nm) can be assigned to the contribution of the band to band recombination (BTBR) process 24.This value is close to the indirect edge absorption transition observed for this material.Previous studies carried out in anatase 25 stated that the emission peaks located in that region are due to band-to-band indirect recombination routes with the assistance of optical phonons.PL bands from 400 to 600 nm can be divided in two regions: (1) peaks between 400 and 515 nm are related to the excitonic PL peaks trapped by surface.In the case of La/TiO 2 photocatalysts the band structure is almost the same but intensities considerably decrease with respect to bare titania, which in general terms can be related to lower electron-hole recombination rates 26.This synergy between La oxides and TiO 2 was previously reported by Yu et al. 19, evidencing that the photoelectron transfer resistance is considerably reduced in this materials, improving the electronic conductivity.These authors determined that this enhanced conductivity is due to a passivation effect ascribed the formation of electron blocking La oxide layer due to its higher band gap. Figure 5 shows the XPS spectra in the La3d and O1s regions for all the La-TiO 2 catalysts, where the La3d 5/2 peak is observed at the binding energy of 834.8 0.1 eV typical for La 3 states.The obtained spectra reveal an important overlap between the La MNN Auger electron peaks and the 3d La photoelectron peaks 27 which has been subtracted to allow the convolution and quantification.More in detail, the convolution (after subtraction) of 3d core level was performed into two peaks: One main peak corresponding to the final state without charge transfer, and a second contribution that include satellite peaks for the bonding and antibonding component of the final state with charge transfer 27,28.Taking into account the low amount of La, the plasmon contribution was neglected.The La/Ti ratios show an increase of La dispersion in the TiO 2 surface except for the 15La/TiO 2 sample, indicating an increase of La 2 O 3 particle size as corroborated by TEM studies. In addition, final state-satellite peaks ratio change with the La amount.The increase of satellite contribution indicate higher amount of La(OH) 3 instead of La 2 O 3 in the catalyst surface.This fact indicates that lower amount of La leads to smaller particles with higher amount of OH groups in their surface.These data are corroborated by O1s signals where in all cases a doublet is observed (Fig. 5).The most intense peak is located at 531.4 eV BE, is attributed to oxidic bonds due to TiO 2 and La phases.In addition, the second peak is ascribed to the presence of OH groups in the surface which proportion is higher in the case of lower lanthanum charges (Table 2). Figure 6 shows the evolution of the accumulated amounts of the main products with reaction time.As expected considering its large band gap, the calcined La 2 O 3 reference did not give rise to any production beyond experimental error.With TiO 2 and La/TiO 2 catalysts, the main CO 2 reduction products are CO and CH 4 , together with H 2 coming from the concomitant reduction of water competing with that of CO 2 .Trace amounts of other products like C 2 Fig. 6 From left to right and top to bottom, cumulative productions of H 2 , CO and CH 4 including associate error bars for each case.Bottom right Selectivity to the main products: H 2 (black), CO (red) and CH 4 (blue), and QYI (white circles) for the different catalysts hydrocarbons, methanol and ethanol are obtained, which represent altogether less than 1 of the total production in all cases.As observed in Fig. 6, a plateau in cumulative production is observed in all cases except for methane production, which is attributed to a catalyst deactivation related to the formation of carbonate and bicarbonate species blocking the active sites 29.In tests without irradiation, or in the absence of catalyst, no product formation was observed.Reactions in an Ar H 2 O atmosphere led to the production of mainly CO.This outcome may come from the total decomposition of the present amount of La 2 O 2 CO 3 , or from organic residues on the surface of the photocatalysts (see elemental analysis results in Table 2).In addition, previous studies performed in the group ascribed this production to the presence of carbonate/bicarbonate species on the surface of TiO 2 and/or to CO 2 dissolved in the fed water 29. A first analysis of the displayed results reveals that low contents of La (5 wt) lead to higher amounts of CO 2 reduction products, both CO and CH 4 , than neat TiO 2 .In the case of CO production, the samples containing 0.5, 1 and 5 La lead to similar results if experimental errors are taken into account, while 10 and 15 give rise to similar and lower production, respectively, compared to bare titania.The situation is alike in the case of methane production, although a particularly remarkable improvement is obtained over the 0.5La/TiO 2 catalyst.On the other hand, all the assayed La-containing catalysts give rise to higher H 2 production than titania, with a similar trend of yield versus La content as in the case of methane and with the 0.5La/ TiO 2 sample producing the highest amount in the studied period.Figure 6 also depicts the selectivities towards the main reaction products obtained with the different catalysts, calculated on the basis of these products only.The high selectivity to CO rather than to more reduced products is a common characteristic of TiO 2 photocatalysts without the presence of a metal co-catalyst 10,21,30.In line with this, the selectivity of carbon reduction is strongly directed towards carbon monoxide with all the catalysts studied here, with only a significant variation of CH 4 selectivity in the case of 0.5La/TiO 2 , which doubles that of titania.This has been related to a longer lifetime of photogenerated electron and holes, which permits the system to yield larger amounts of highly reduced carbon products 10,21,30, in line with the observations made by PL spectroscopy.Regarding quantum yields, absolute AQY values range from 0.14 to 0.26.The relative QYI values, calculated according to Eqs. 1 and 2 and included in Fig. 6, reveal better electron transport and transfer with respect to TiO 2 with La contents up to 5, in accordance with CO production.The best QYI obtained with the 0.5La/TiO 2 sample is therefore the reflection of the higher selectivity of this sample towards the 8-electron reduction of CO 2 to methane.In addition, Yu et al. 19, reported a promoter effect of La in TiO 2 that favour the photoelectron conductivity and transfer.This synergetic effect leads, in this case, to an increase in the CO 2 photoreduction that is more evident for samples with greater La dispersion (0.5La/TiO 2 ), which exhibit an enhancement in highly electron-demanding products (i.e.CH 4 ).Thus, better conductivity and electron transfer and the lower electron-hole recombination observed by PL spectroscopy can be suggested to account for this enhanced use of photogenerated charges, as the electronic contribution of the La promoter to improved photocatalytic activity. In order to study the second expected contribution of La invoked in the introduction of this work, that is, adsorption effects induced by the promoter, CO 2 TPD analyses were performed with all samples, the results of which are collected in Table 1 and Fig. 7.All samples show similar CO 2 TPD profiles, exhibiting the contribution of weak basic sites for the adsorption of carbon dioxide.Regarding adsorption types, the peak temperatures of CO 2 physisorption are essentially the same in all cases, but differences appear when the peak temperatures of CO 2 chemisorption are concerned.This temperature (243-248 C) decreases in La/TiO 2 samples with respect to bare titania (300 C), indicating that the strength of the basic sites of TiO 2 is decreased by the addition of lanthanum.Regarding adsorption capacities, quantitative variations are observed (see Fig. 7 Temperature-programmed CO 2 desorption profiles of all catalysts Table 1).This capacity is higher in the catalysts that contain lanthanum than in TiO 2 and reaches a maximum for the 10La/TiO 2 sample.In the catalyst with the highest content, however, this situation is reversed and 15La/TiO 2 shows a similar capacity as TiO 2 itself.Assuming that La phases are the cause of increased adsorption, the poor distribution and large particle size of La phases observed by TEM, and therefore the scarce contribution of these phases to surface area, may explain the broken trend in this sample.Therefore, the observed promotion of CO 2 reduction photoactivity induced by La in TiO 2 appears to come by the hand of two factors: an electronic one related to hindered electron-hole recombination and a surficial one resulting in enhanced reactant adsorption.Regarding the second factor, not only quantitatively enhanced adsorption is observed with the introduction of La phases, but also adsorbed CO 2 appears to be more labile in La/TiO 2 catalysts with respect to bare titania that favors the formation of more stable carbonate and bicarbonate species, as revealed by the desorption temperatures 31,32.The combination of both factors result in enhanced activity in La/TiO 2 samples with La content up to 5, with optimal quantum efficiency in the 0.5La/TiO 2 catalyst.A further increase in La charge, as represented by the 10 and 15 La/TiO 2 samples does not further contribute to photocatalytic activity, which can be ascribed to La agglomeration."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Fluorescent", "source": "Irradiation was provided by four UV fluorescent lamps of 6 W each ( max 365 nm).", "context": "Commercial anatase-type titanium dioxide (TiO 2 , PC500) was supplied by CrystalACTIV TM and commercial La 2 O 3 was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.For the preparation of the mixed oxides, appropriate amounts of each of them for a final content of 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0 and 15.0 wt of La 2 O 3 were suspended in 10 ml of deionized water.The solution was then treated in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h and water was eliminated by evaporation at 100 C.Afterwards, the samples were ground in an agate mortar, calcined in air at 400 C for 4 h with a temperature ramp of 10 C/ min and finally ground again.The catalysts were labelled as xLa/TiO 2 , where x indicates the nominal La 2 O 3 loading (0.5-15.0 wt).Samples of the commercial TiO 2 and La 2 O 3 were treated at the same temperature as the La/TiO 2 samples and used as references.

1) shows in all cases the characteristic diffraction peaks of the anatase phase (PDF 01-084-1286).No other features are visible with charges below 10, indicating the poor crystallinity of La phases or their small crystal size.In the case of 10 and 15 additional peaks are observed which can be indexed to crystalline La 2 O 2 CO 3 with mixed monoclinic (PDF 023-0322) and hexagonal (PDF 01-084-1963) phases without a clear dominance of any of them.Crystallite sizes and lattice parameters of the anatase phase in the different catalysts derived from Pawley analysis are summarized in Table 1.The slight variations found in these parameters indicate that lanthanum deposition does not cause any significant structural change in TiO 2 , or, in other words, that the anatase phase is not doped with La 3 ions.Raman spectra of the La phases observed by XRD were described by Orera et al. 16.The contribution of these species to the Raman spectra of the prepared catalysts (Fig. 2) can be only appreciated in the high energy side of the anatase E g band at ca. photon flux 145 cm -1 , which width is augmented by La-related band contributions, and in the increased intensity of the region of the E g anatase band at ca. 196 cm -1 .Otherwise, the spectra of all samples show, in addition to those features, the other characteristic bands of anatase at 396 (B 1g ), 516 (A 1g B 1g ) and 639 (E g ) cm -1 22.The TEM micrographs of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3.In samples with La contents lower than 5, a homogeneous distribution of particles with sizes between 5 and 12 nm is observed.EDX analyses of selected zones reveal La contents in good agreement with nominal ones.On the other hand, lanthanum-rich areas are not observed, indicating small particle sizes and good dispersion of La phases in agreement with XRD and XPS studies (see below).However, in the catalysts that contain higher amounts of lanthanum (10-15), an agglomeration of the La-particles is observed in specific regions with larger particle sizes.At the extreme composition of 15La/ TiO 2 , La was only detected in these agglomerations, with only EDX signals attributable to O and Ti in the areas composed of small particles.The textural properties of bare TiO 2 and La-modified catalysts examined by N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Table 1) indicate that lanthanum leads to an increase in the BET surface areas up to 5 charge, in accordance with the contribution of small-sized La phases in these samples.Surface areas decrease with the highest La loadings in line with the particle agglomeration observed in TEM images.The opto-electronic properties of the samples were examined from diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra, shown in Fig. 4a.As expected, the absorption edge of La 2 O 3 occurs at higher energy than in the case of TiO 2 .In turn, La/TiO 2 samples show no effect in the absorption properties of mixed photocatalysts with respect to titania, as reflected by the band gap values estimated from Tauc plots (Table 1).Figure 4b depicts the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all samples.In the case of bare TiO 2 and La/TiO 2 materials a broad band from 350 to 600 nm (3.5-2.1 eV) composed by multiple emission contributions is observed for all samples.Due to the selected experimental settings, the emission attributed to the direct recombination (336 nm) does not appear 23.The first peaks located at the beginning of the band (around 400 nm) can be assigned to the contribution of the band to band recombination (BTBR) process 24.This value is close to the indirect edge absorption transition observed for this material.Previous studies carried out in anatase 25 stated that the emission peaks located in that region are due to band-to-band indirect recombination routes with the assistance of optical phonons.PL bands from 400 to 600 nm can be divided in two regions: (1) peaks between 400 and 515 nm are related to the excitonic PL peaks trapped by surface.In the case of La/TiO 2 photocatalysts the band structure is almost the same but intensities considerably decrease with respect to bare titania, which in general terms can be related to lower electron-hole recombination rates 26.This synergy between La oxides and TiO 2 was previously reported by Yu et al. 19, evidencing that the photoelectron transfer resistance is considerably reduced in this materials, improving the electronic conductivity.These authors determined that this enhanced conductivity is due to a passivation effect ascribed the formation of electron blocking La oxide layer due to its higher band gap. Figure 5 shows the XPS spectra in the La3d and O1s regions for all the La-TiO 2 catalysts, where the La3d 5/2 peak is observed at the binding energy of 834.8 0.1 eV typical for La 3 states.The obtained spectra reveal an important overlap between the La MNN Auger electron peaks and the 3d La photoelectron peaks 27 which has been subtracted to allow the convolution and quantification.More in detail, the convolution (after subtraction) of 3d core level was performed into two peaks: One main peak corresponding to the final state without charge transfer, and a second contribution that include satellite peaks for the bonding and antibonding component of the final state with charge transfer 27,28.Taking into account the low amount of La, the plasmon contribution was neglected.The La/Ti ratios show an increase of La dispersion in the TiO 2 surface except for the 15La/TiO 2 sample, indicating an increase of La 2 O 3 particle size as corroborated by TEM studies. In addition, final state-satellite peaks ratio change with the La amount.The increase of satellite contribution indicate higher amount of La(OH) 3 instead of La 2 O 3 in the catalyst surface.This fact indicates that lower amount of La leads to smaller particles with higher amount of OH groups in their surface.These data are corroborated by O1s signals where in all cases a doublet is observed (Fig. 5).The most intense peak is located at 531.4 eV BE, is attributed to oxidic bonds due to TiO 2 and La phases.In addition, the second peak is ascribed to the presence of OH groups in the surface which proportion is higher in the case of lower lanthanum charges (Table 2). Figure 6 shows the evolution of the accumulated amounts of the main products with reaction time.As expected considering its large band gap, the calcined La 2 O 3 reference did not give rise to any production beyond experimental error.With TiO 2 and La/TiO 2 catalysts, the main CO 2 reduction products are CO and CH 4 , together with H 2 coming from the concomitant reduction of water competing with that of CO 2 .Trace amounts of other products like C 2 Fig. 6 From left to right and top to bottom, cumulative productions of H 2 , CO and CH 4 including associate error bars for each case.Bottom right Selectivity to the main products: H 2 (black), CO (red) and CH 4 (blue), and QYI (white circles) for the different catalysts hydrocarbons, methanol and ethanol are obtained, which represent altogether less than 1 of the total production in all cases.As observed in Fig. 6, a plateau in cumulative production is observed in all cases except for methane production, which is attributed to a catalyst deactivation related to the formation of carbonate and bicarbonate species blocking the active sites 29.In tests without irradiation, or in the absence of catalyst, no product formation was observed.Reactions in an Ar H 2 O atmosphere led to the production of mainly CO.This outcome may come from the total decomposition of the present amount of La 2 O 2 CO 3 , or from organic residues on the surface of the photocatalysts (see elemental analysis results in Table 2).In addition, previous studies performed in the group ascribed this production to the presence of carbonate/bicarbonate species on the surface of TiO 2 and/or to CO 2 dissolved in the fed water 29. A first analysis of the displayed results reveals that low contents of La (5 wt) lead to higher amounts of CO 2 reduction products, both CO and CH 4 , than neat TiO 2 .In the case of CO production, the samples containing 0.5, 1 and 5 La lead to similar results if experimental errors are taken into account, while 10 and 15 give rise to similar and lower production, respectively, compared to bare titania.The situation is alike in the case of methane production, although a particularly remarkable improvement is obtained over the 0.5La/TiO 2 catalyst.On the other hand, all the assayed La-containing catalysts give rise to higher H 2 production than titania, with a similar trend of yield versus La content as in the case of methane and with the 0.5La/ TiO 2 sample producing the highest amount in the studied period.Figure 6 also depicts the selectivities towards the main reaction products obtained with the different catalysts, calculated on the basis of these products only.The high selectivity to CO rather than to more reduced products is a common characteristic of TiO 2 photocatalysts without the presence of a metal co-catalyst 10,21,30.In line with this, the selectivity of carbon reduction is strongly directed towards carbon monoxide with all the catalysts studied here, with only a significant variation of CH 4 selectivity in the case of 0.5La/TiO 2 , which doubles that of titania.This has been related to a longer lifetime of photogenerated electron and holes, which permits the system to yield larger amounts of highly reduced carbon products 10,21,30, in line with the observations made by PL spectroscopy.Regarding quantum yields, absolute AQY values range from 0.14 to 0.26.The relative QYI values, calculated according to Eqs. 1 and 2 and included in Fig. 6, reveal better electron transport and transfer with respect to TiO 2 with La contents up to 5, in accordance with CO production.The best QYI obtained with the 0.5La/TiO 2 sample is therefore the reflection of the higher selectivity of this sample towards the 8-electron reduction of CO 2 to methane.In addition, Yu et al. 19, reported a promoter effect of La in TiO 2 that favour the photoelectron conductivity and transfer.This synergetic effect leads, in this case, to an increase in the CO 2 photoreduction that is more evident for samples with greater La dispersion (0.5La/TiO 2 ), which exhibit an enhancement in highly electron-demanding products (i.e.CH 4 ).Thus, better conductivity and electron transfer and the lower electron-hole recombination observed by PL spectroscopy can be suggested to account for this enhanced use of photogenerated charges, as the electronic contribution of the La promoter to improved photocatalytic activity.
