The intermediate hypochlorite was detected by the spectrophotometry method with the N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) reagent as a chromogenic agent (Experimental Section S1.2 in Supporting Information). 2.3.Photocatalytic Performance Tests.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activities of catalysts were tested in a 200 mL stainlesssteel reactor with a 300 W Xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfectlight Co., Ltd.) as the light source.The catalyst powders (20 mg) were dispersed on a glass substrate uniformly and placed into the stainless-steel reactor.Prior to photoreduction CO 2 tests, the reactor was vacuum-treated and scavenged with high purity CO 2 gas (99.995) five times.Then, the compressed high purity CO 2 gas was passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor.The mixed CO 2 /H 2 O gas was introduced to the stainless steel reactor to act as a reactant. The products from the reactor were detected by gas chromatography (Agilent 7820A).A flame-ionized detector was adopted to determine CH 4 and CO yields, while a thermal conductivity detector was employed to detect the O 2 yield.It should be noted that apart from CO and CH 4 , other products, including H 2 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , HCHO, and CH 3 OH, were not detected within the detection limits of our instrument.The 13 C isotope tracing technique was carried out under identical conditions to verify the source of CH 4 and CO.The obtained products were identified by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Agilent 7890B and OmniStar GSD 320). 2.4.Theoretical Calculations.Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the plane-wave technique mentioned in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code. 32The interactions between ions and valence electrons were described by the projector-augmented wave method. 33The generalized gradient approximation expressed by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was adopted to handle the exchange correlations between electrons. 34,35The detailed computational parameters are shown in Supporting Information.The equilibrium lattice constants of an orthogonal Bi 2 WO 6 unit cell were optimized, when using a 6 6 2 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid for Brillouin zone sampling.We then use it to construct an O-Bi-O terminated Bi 2 WO 6 (001) surface model with p (2 1) periodicity in the x and y directions and one stoichiometric layer in the z direction with a vacuum layer of 15 A in depth in order to separate the surface slab from its periodic duplicates.The detailed computational parameters are shown in Supporting Information."}, {"llm generation": "BiOCl", "source": "For comparison, pure Bi 2 WO 6 and BiOCl were prepared using the same method.", "context": "For comparison, pure Bi 2 WO 6 and BiOCl were prepared using the same method.The Bi 2 WO 6 nanosheets were synthesized without adding NaCl, and the product is denoted as BW for brevity.The BiOCl was synthesized without adding Na 2 WO 4 2H 2 O. 2.2.Characterization.Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; PANalytical X'Pert PRO) was employed to characterize the crystal phases of the catalysts.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM; FEI Tecnai G 2 F20-S-TWIN) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Carl Zeiss Sigma 500) were used to observe the morphology of the synthesized samples.The crystal orientation of the samples was determined by a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image and a fast-Fourier transform (FFT) diffraction pattern.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS; Agilent Cary 5000) were obtained to investigate the light-harvesting ability of the catalysts.Raman spectra (Renishaw InVia) were employed to characterize the surface structure of the catalysts.The CO 2 adsorption ability was evaluated by CO 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Quantachrome Autosorb-IQ2) at 0 C and CO 2 temperature programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD; Autosorb-iQ) from 50 to 500 C.The chemical environments of elements on the catalyst's surface were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; PerkinElmer PHI 5300).
