We used high-resolution TEM for detailed morphological analysis of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure, as shown in Fig. 1(a-c). .The peak at 887.2 cm -1 is attributed to the deformation of amine (N-H) 40.We attributed the broad peaks observed at 3400-3000 cm -1 to N-H from the residual amino (-NH 2 ) groups and hydroxyl (O-H) stretching modes 41. We used XPS analysis to characterize the chemical bonds of TiO 2 / MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and analyze its binding energy, as shown in Fig. 2. In the Ti 2p spectrum of the heterostructure, the peaks at 458.6 and 464.2 eV were fitted to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively.To compare the Ti 2p spectra of the TiO 2 NFs and TiO 2 /MoS 2 , they were fitted on one graph, as shown in Fig. S3(a).When MoS 2 was grown on the TiO 2 NFs, the binding energy decreased, allowing easier electron transfer from the conduction band of the TiO 2 NFs to that of the MoS 2 .Similarly, when g-C 3 N 4 was coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structure, the binding energy again decreased; the energy of the conduction band of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 was lower than that of the MoS 2 .In the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2(b)), the three peaks were deconvoluted at 529.8, 531.6, and 533.1 eV which we assigned to the Ti and O bonds of Ti-O-Ti, Ti-O-C, and Ti-O-H, respectively 42.When the g-C 3 N 4 was coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, the Ti-O-C peak showed higher intensity compared to that of the bare TiO 2 NFs and TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, suggesting a high binding energy due to the interaction between the g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, as shown in Fig. S3(b) 43.The main peaks of Mo 4 3d 5/2 and Mo 4 3d 3/2 were detected at 228.8 and 232.1 eV, respectively, while the peak at 225.8 eV was assigned to S 2s, as shown in Fig. 2(c) 44.The Mo 3d spectrum of TiO 2 /MoS 2 shown in Fig. S3(c) indicates that the peaks at 235.1 and 235.9 eV correspond to Mo 6 3d 5/2 and Mo 6 3d 3/2 , respectively, due to slight oxidation of the MoS 2 surface after applying the hydrothermal synthesis method 45.Similarly, for TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , we detected weak oxidation peaks for Mo 6 3d 5/2 (234.8 eV) and Mo 6 3d 3/2 (235.6 eV).Additionally, the S 2p spectrum of the heterostructure exhibited two main peaks at 162.2 and 168.9 eV, corresponding to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 , respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(d).To confirm the presence of g-C 3 N 4 in the TiO 2 /MoS 2 heterostructure, we analyzed the C 1s and N 1s spectra (Fig. 2(e-f)).The three main peaks, at 284.8, 286.4,and 288.2 eV, were assigned to C-C graphitic carbon bonding, C-NH x for three-coordinated C atoms, and N-C--N for sp 2 -hybridized carbon in the triazine group, respectively 46,47.The peak intensity of N-C--N was lower in the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure compared to that of g-C 3 N 4 , possibly due to the low amount of g-C 3 N 4 coating on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, as indicated in Fig. S3(e).Furthermore, the peaks in the N 1s spectrum of the heterostructure were assigned to C--N-C for sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen, N-(C) 3 for tertiary nitrogen, C-N-H bonding, and -excitations at 398.6, 399.4,401.0, and 404.2 eV, respectively (Fig. 2(f)) 46.Particularly, TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 showed significant evidence of N-Mo bonding at 394.4 eV, suggesting a strong interaction between the MoS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 , while the bare g-C 3 N 4 did not exhibit an N 1s spectrum, as shown in Fig. S3(f) 48,49.Therefore, FTIR and XPS analysis of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 indicated that this heterostructure has been created successfully due to the strong bonding between the g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 /MoS 2 . Along with the morphological and chemical characterization of the as-prepared samples, we evaluated their photoresponses to assess their optical properties.First, the optical absorbance was measured within the UV-Vis range of 300-900 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(a), to calculate the bandgap.In the inset, we can see that the TiO 2 NFs showed the lowest absorbance in the visible range; bare g-C 3 N 4 showed a band edge, with a wavelength of 475 nm.However, when the flower-like MoS 2 was grown on the TiO 2 NFs, the band edge of the TiO 2 NFs shifted from 400 to 450 nm.Moreover, when the g-C 3 N 4 was coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, the band edge shifted slightly, with lower absorbance compared to that of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures.Based on the band edge absorbance results, the bandgap energy was 2.86, 2.33, 2.27, and 2.50 eV for the TiO 2 NFs, TiO 2 /MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, based on tauc plots.As expected, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N showed the lowest bandgap.We conducted PL measurements to observe the recombination of the as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 3(b), the g-C 3 N 4 had the strongest PL emission, with a broad range around nm, while a slightly shifted PL spectrum of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 was observed at 470 nm, suggesting an effective separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs under 325 nm laser excitation.However, the TiO 2 NFs and TiO 2 /MoS 2 exhibited no photoemission under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. S4.Therefore, PL analysis indicated that the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure effectively reduced the recombination of charge carriers.Fig. 3(c) shows the photocurrent density measured while switching the light on and off every 60 s, which was done to determine the photoresponse of the as-prepared samples.The transient photocurrent density of the TiO 2 NFs and g-C 3 N 4 showed the lowest values, of 1.8 and 1.6 A/cm 2 respectively, while the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structure showed a lower photocurrent density, of 2.8 A/cm 2 , than that of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure.In the case of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , the photocurrent density (3.7 A/cm 2 ) was 2.3 times higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 .Moreover, even while the light was off, both the TiO 2 /MoS 2 and TiO 2 /MoS 2 / g-C 3 N 4 structures showed slower decay of photogenerated electron-hole pairs than the bare TiO 2 or g-C 3 N 4 , as indicated by the green circle in Fig. 3(c).The slowest decay and highest photocurrent density of TiO 2 / MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 confirmed an effective photogenerated electron channel and an excellent photoresponse 50.Nyquist plots of the EIS were used to determine the kinetics of the charge movements, as shown in Fig. 3 (d).Regarding the photocurrent density, the impedance values were divided by the exposed area, of 8 cm 2 .As shown in the figure, the resistance value for charge transfer between electrolytes and catalysts is denoted R ct .Under light irradiation, semicircles formed on the plots of the TiO 2 NFs, TiO 2 /MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 , with radii of 73, 93, and 94 k/cm 2 , respectively.As expected, the radius was smaller for TiO 2 /-MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 (53 k/cm 2 ), due to the fast transport of photogenerated electrons through well-connected interfaces, than for TiO 2 NFs, TiO 2 /-MoS 2, and g-C 3 N 4 . Finally, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis was performed to determine the photoinduced charge carrier lifetime using the following equation 51,52: The average carrier lifetime of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 was 5.28 ns, which was longer than that of the g-C 3 N 4 only (4.41 ns), as shown in Fig. 3(e); the lifetimes of these structures are summarized in Fig. 3(f). Generally, TRPL analysis revealed that excellent photocatalytic reaction performance is usually due to a long carrier lifetime, the separation of charge carriers, and a low recombination rate under light irradiation 53.As mentioned above, TiO 2 /MoS 2 showed no photoemission response under the same condition.Based on the photoresponse parameters, including the optical absorbance, recombination rate, photocurrent density, charge transfer, and carrier lifetime, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure clearly exhibited an effective electron pathway through interconnections among its TiO 2 , MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 components, with outstanding transportation of the photo-induced electrons and a longer charge carrier lifetime than the g-C 3 N 4 . We explored the as-prepared catalysts in terms of photocatalytic CO reduction (specifically, their photoreaction activity under UV-Vis irradiation).H 2 , CO, and CH 4 were the main products of TiO 2 NFs, TiO 2 / MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 , as shown in Fig. S5.To ensure reliability, Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was tested three times under the same conditions, results are summarized in Fig. 4(a).The amounts of CO from TiO 2 NFs, TiO 2 /MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 were 22.81, 38.69, 42.52, and 12.80 mol/g, respectively, while the respective amounts of CH 4 were 10.36, 17.19, 21.78, and 6.13 mol/g.The TiO 2 NFs and g-C 3 N 4 alone showed exceptionally low yields of both CO and CH 4 , with the g-C 3 N 4 giving the lowest yields, possibly due to its high recombination rate for photoinduced electron and hole pairs.However, after the flower-like MoS 2 grown on the TiO 2 NFs, the CO and CH 4 yields were 1.7 and 1.6 times higher, respectively, than those of the TiO 2 NFs alone.Furthermore, after the g-C 3 N 4 has been uniformly coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 , the CO and CH 4 yields dramatically increased to 3.3 and 3.6 times those of g-C 3 N 4 alone, respectively.These high yields confirmed that the interconnected interfaces in these materials enhance the electron transport and thus, a high oxidation and reduction capability.To investigate the stability of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N heterostructure, a recycling test was performed three times, up to 5 h for each cycle; the results are shown in Fig. 4(b).The yields of CO and CH 4 were reasonably stable.The CO 2 conversion, given by the sum of the CO and CH 4 yields, is shown in Fig. 4(c).The TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 exhibited a high CO 2 conversion rate of 67.41 mol/g; for the TiO 2 NFs, TiO 2 /MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 , the respective values were 36.16,52.80, and 21.68 mol/g, respectively. The band diagrams of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructures are used to interpret the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction mechanism based on the measured bandgaps, as well as the Mott-Schottky plots and the valence bands measured via XPS.Details of the band diagram equations and calculations are provided in Figs.S6(a-f).According to the calculation, the conduction band level of g-C 3 N 4 is located a bit higher than that of the TiO 2 or MoS 2 conduction band as shown in Fig. 4(d).Moreover, according to the band diagrams for TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , the CH 4 kinetic overpotential (E a,CH4 ) values were calculated to be 0.18 eV E a,CH4 is typically used to determine the distance from the conduction band of a catalyst to the reduction potential of CH 4 /CO 2 (-0.24V) 9,54.Based on the calculated values, TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 has sufficient E a,CH4 for superior electron transport, and hence CO 2 conversion, compared to the other materials.Conventionally, the desorption of CO or CH 4 molecules from a catalyst is equally important as that of adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Based on DFT calculation in literature, adsorption energies of H 2 O, CO 2 , H 2 , CO, and CH 4 on g-C 3 N 4 were -0.513, -0.226, -0.078, -0.155, and -0.163 eV, respectively 55.Here, H 2 O and CO 2 were reported to have more negative adsorption energies than those of H 2 , CO, and CH 4 gases.Thus, it explains why we have strong adsorption of CO 2 molecules on the fabricated heterostructure of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in effective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with easy desorption of productive gases. Depending on its electronic band diagram of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure, the S-scheme with charge transfer is suggested as a possible mechanism.Prior to the formation of the heterostructure, Fig. 5 (a) showed band diagrams of each TiO 2 , MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 with its Fermi level (E f ), estimated from the work function Fig. S5, equation 4.As TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure was formed, the electrons from g-C 3 N 4 will transfer to both TiO 2 and MoS 2 , reaching an equilibrium E f level.This causes band bending and depletion layer along with an internal electric field at the interfaces between g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 /MoS 2 (Fig. 5(b)).When the light was irradiated into the catalysts, electron and hole pairs were photogenerated at TiO 2 , MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 separately.The excited electrons from the CB of TiO 2 are transferred to VB of g-C 3 N 4 and these photogenerated electrons and hole pairs will recombine easily due to its Coulombic attraction at the interface between TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 .Afterwards, the powerful electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 will move into the CB of MoS 2 , reacting with absorbed CO 2 molecules through the surfaces and reducing hydrocarbons mainly to CO and CH 4 while the holes in the VB of TiO 2 and MoS 2 have reacted with TEOA, to oxidize TEOA into TEOA .Therefore, the designed S-scheme heterostructure offers the fast electron transportation of one-dimensional TiO 2 NFs, interfacing with active sites of flower-like MoS 2 as well as g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.Therefore, the recombination of charge carriers due to Coulombic attraction at the interfaces of TiO 2 /g-C 3 N 4, leads to effective movements of useful charge carriers to CB of MoS 2 as well as VBs of MoS 2 and TiO 2. Overall, this S-scheme heterojunction shows a strong redox on each surface to result in superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was considered in terms of the effect of g-C 3 N 4 loaded onto the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures.For reliability, TiO 2 / MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -2 and TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -3 each were tested three times under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. S7(b-c).The results regarding the amounts of the evolved gases (CO and CH 4 ) up to 5 h of collection time are shown in Fig. 6 6(b) S CO2 can be calculated using the following equation 56: where n is the evolved yield of S1.The CO 2 adsorption amounts for the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -1, TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -2, and TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -3 were 0.55, 1.05, and 1.28 cm 3 /g STP, respectively.The porous structure of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 / g-C 3 N 4 -3 provided more active sites for CO 2 diffusion and adsorption, as well as efficient electron transfer through its interfaces 57.Moreover, the increased porosity with additional g-C 3 N 4 probably expanded the adsorption of CO 2 on photocatalysts due to Lewis basic functions of the -NH 2 in g-C 3 N 4 to capture CO 2 molecules by forming H 2 bonds with CO 2 58,59.Here, the presence of -NH 2 has expanded CO 2 adsorption as well as CO 2 activation 60.According to these CO 2 adsorption results, TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -3 exhibited much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -1 or TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -2, due to the higher porosity of the g-C 3 N 4 , as shown in Fig. 6(d).Furthermore, we summarized preliminary studies comparing TiO 2 , MoS 2 , or g-C 3 N 4 based materials for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction as shown in Table S2.The S CO2 value 90 observed for this noble metal-free TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure, is attributed to the maximization of CO 2 adsorption due to its specific surface area and porous g-C 3 N 4 structure, along with the interconnections among the TiO 2 , MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 components, which promoted efficient electron transfer."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure", "source": "A noble-metal-free TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure with S CO2 90 was successfully produced using hydro-and solvothermal methods followed by electrospinning.", "context": "A noble-metal-free TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure with S CO2 90 was successfully produced using hydro-and solvothermal methods followed by electrospinning.Flower-like MoS 2 nanosheets were grown on TiO 2 NFs and then acetic-acid treated g-C 3 N 4 was uniformly coated.Chemical binding energy and morphological analyses revealed strong interactions among the TiO 2 , MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 components of the heterostructure.Photoresponse analysis showed that the heterostructure showed the smallest bandgap and lowest PL intensity (470 nm), as well as the highest photocurrent density and lowest charge transfer resistance, suggesting an effective separation of photoinduced charge carriers.Moreover, TRPL analysis revealed a longer carrier lifetime for the heterostructure than for the g-C 3 N 4 .Regarding photocatalytic CO reduction, the heterostructure showed 1.9 and 3.1 times higher CO conversion than the TiO 2 NFs and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.Electronic band diagrams based on the measured bandgaps, valence bands obtained by XPS, and flat band potentials indicated that the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N showed sufficient E a,CH4 (0.18 eV) to produce CH 4 during CO 2 reduction.We found that it follows S-scheme mechanism where n-type semiconductors tend to migrate the electrons from the CB of TiO 2 to VB of g-C 3 N 4 due to its formation of internal electric field, inducing recombination of pointless charge carriers, so that strong photocatalytic CO 2 reduction redox ability in the CB of MoS 2 as well as VB of TiO 2 and MoS 2, was obtained eventually.To optimize the heterostructure, the amount of g-C 3 N 4 was increased; TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -3, with 100 mg of g-C 3 N 4 , showed the highest S CO2, of 90.Due to the larger surface area and smaller pore size provided by the amino (-NH 2 ) groups of g-C 3 N structure, along with well-connected interfaces, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 / g-C 3 N 4 -3 has significantly more CO 2 adsorption sites and allows for easier electron movement, resulting in high S CO2 under light irradiation without the need to incorporate any noble metal. Suhee Kang: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Fig. (a) shows the flower-like shape of the MoS 2 on the TiO 2 NFs, which are uniformly covered with g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets; the areas labeled 1 and were analyzed in detail to confirm the presence of TiO 2 and MoS phases.Fig. 1(b) shows that the d-spacing of the flower-like MoS 2 was d (100) 0.642 nm on the TiO 2 NFs which had both rutile (d (110) 0.319 nm) and anatase (d (101) 0.349 nm) phases.The uniformly coated g-C 3 N 4 was observed on the MoS 2 ; amorphous structures under the yellow dotted line can be seen in Fig. 1(c).Furthermore, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure was scanned via HAADF-STEM for elemental mapping, to confirm the uniform growth and coating status of the as-prepared materials (Fig. 1(d)).The presence of the g-C 3 N 4 coating on the TiO 2 / MoS 2 was confirmed by comparison with the TEM images of the uncoated TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, as shown by the HAADF-STEM elemental map in Fig. S2.After magnifying the pink dotted circle in Fig. S2(a), we measured the d-spacing of the rutile (d (110) 0.315 nm) and anatase (d (101) 0.341 nm) phases in the TiO 2 NFs, and the d-spacing of the MoS 2 (d (110) 0.643 nm) on the TiO 2 NFs, as shown in Fig. S2(b).As shown in Fig. S2(c), in the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structure, we only detected the elements O, S, Ti, and Mo.Therefore, MoS 2 was grown successfully on the TiO 2 NFs, while g-C 3 N 4 was uniformly coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures (indicated by the presence of C, O, S, Ti, Mo, and N).X-ray diffraction was used to evaluate the crystalline phases of all prepared samples; the results are shown in Fig. 1(e).Peaks for crystalline TiO 2 appeared at 25.22, 38.22, 47.96, 53.81, 54.98, 62.03, and 70.21 , which correspond to index planes of the anatase phase (No. 72-7058) of (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), and (220) respectively.The peaks at 27.39, 36.02,39.10, 41.24, 44.02, 54.32, 56.52, 62.72, 68.96, 69.76, and 76.42 of the rutile phase (No. 75-1748) correspond to the (110), (101), (200), (111), (210), (211), (220), (002), (301), (112), and (202) planes, respectively.The peaks for MoS 2 at 14.23, 33.02, 39.62, 49.53, and 58.87 correspond to the (002), (100), (103), (105), and (110) planes (No. 75-1539), respectively.Moreover, we ascribed the peaks detected for g-C 3 N 4 at 12.87 and 27.85 to the (100) plane for the tri-s-triazine structural packing, and the (002) plane for the inter-planar spacing, of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively37.However, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 and TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 structures showed low-intensity MoS 2 phases compared to their TiO 2 phases, due to the small amounts of their MoS precursors.In the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure, no significant peaks for g-C 3 N 4 were observed due to overlapping with the rutile (101) plane.To investigate the presence of g-C 3 N 4 , FTIR analysis of g-C 3 N 4 peaks was performed, as shown in Fig.1(f).The TiO 2 NFs showed peaks at 691.6 and 510.1 cm -1 , which were related to Ti-O bonds38.After the MoS 2 had been grown on the TiO 2 NFs, and g-C 3 N 4 coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, the Ti-O bond peak at 691.6 cm -1 was broader compared to that of the bare TiO 2 NFs, indicating successful MoS coating of the NFs.The bare g-C 3 N 4 showed peaks corresponding to C-N heterocycles at 1644.5, 1558.7,1453.5, 1415.5, 1327.4,and 1243.8 cm -1 , and breathing vibration of tri-s-triazine at 805.1 cm -1 39.As expected, g-C 3 N 4 peaks were detected for the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure.Heterocycle rings were observed with TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N at 1634.0, 1557.4,1455.6,1408.8,1320.3, and 1243.7 cm -1 , attributed to aromatic C--N and the C-N stretching mode.Graphite-like sp bonding for tri-s-triazine was observed at 807.7 cm -1 Fig. 1.TEM images of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 (a) at low magnification and (b) high magnification, showing the TiO 2 and MoS 2 d-spacings and (c) the interfaces between MoS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 .(d) HADDF-STEM with EDS mappings.(e) XRD analysis and (f) FT-IR analysis of TiO 2 nanofibers of TiO 2 /MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 .

We used high-resolution TEM for detailed morphological analysis of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure, as shown in Fig. 1(a-c). .The peak at 887.2 cm -1 is attributed to the deformation of amine (N-H) 40.We attributed the broad peaks observed at 3400-3000 cm -1 to N-H from the residual amino (-NH 2 ) groups and hydroxyl (O-H) stretching modes 41. We used XPS analysis to characterize the chemical bonds of TiO 2 / MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 and analyze its binding energy, as shown in Fig. 2. In the Ti 2p spectrum of the heterostructure, the peaks at 458.6 and 464.2 eV were fitted to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively.To compare the Ti 2p spectra of the TiO 2 NFs and TiO 2 /MoS 2 , they were fitted on one graph, as shown in Fig. S3(a).When MoS 2 was grown on the TiO 2 NFs, the binding energy decreased, allowing easier electron transfer from the conduction band of the TiO 2 NFs to that of the MoS 2 .Similarly, when g-C 3 N 4 was coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structure, the binding energy again decreased; the energy of the conduction band of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 was lower than that of the MoS 2 .In the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2(b)), the three peaks were deconvoluted at 529.8, 531.6, and 533.1 eV which we assigned to the Ti and O bonds of Ti-O-Ti, Ti-O-C, and Ti-O-H, respectively 42.When the g-C 3 N 4 was coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, the Ti-O-C peak showed higher intensity compared to that of the bare TiO 2 NFs and TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, suggesting a high binding energy due to the interaction between the g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, as shown in Fig. S3(b) 43.The main peaks of Mo 4 3d 5/2 and Mo 4 3d 3/2 were detected at 228.8 and 232.1 eV, respectively, while the peak at 225.8 eV was assigned to S 2s, as shown in Fig. 2(c) 44.The Mo 3d spectrum of TiO 2 /MoS 2 shown in Fig. S3(c) indicates that the peaks at 235.1 and 235.9 eV correspond to Mo 6 3d 5/2 and Mo 6 3d 3/2 , respectively, due to slight oxidation of the MoS 2 surface after applying the hydrothermal synthesis method 45.Similarly, for TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , we detected weak oxidation peaks for Mo 6 3d 5/2 (234.8 eV) and Mo 6 3d 3/2 (235.6 eV).Additionally, the S 2p spectrum of the heterostructure exhibited two main peaks at 162.2 and 168.9 eV, corresponding to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 , respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(d).To confirm the presence of g-C 3 N 4 in the TiO 2 /MoS 2 heterostructure, we analyzed the C 1s and N 1s spectra (Fig. 2(e-f)).The three main peaks, at 284.8, 286.4,and 288.2 eV, were assigned to C-C graphitic carbon bonding, C-NH x for three-coordinated C atoms, and N-C--N for sp 2 -hybridized carbon in the triazine group, respectively 46,47.The peak intensity of N-C--N was lower in the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure compared to that of g-C 3 N 4 , possibly due to the low amount of g-C 3 N 4 coating on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, as indicated in Fig. S3(e).Furthermore, the peaks in the N 1s spectrum of the heterostructure were assigned to C--N-C for sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen, N-(C) 3 for tertiary nitrogen, C-N-H bonding, and -excitations at 398.6, 399.4,401.0, and 404.2 eV, respectively (Fig. 2(f)) 46.Particularly, TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 showed significant evidence of N-Mo bonding at 394.4 eV, suggesting a strong interaction between the MoS 2 and g-C 3 N 4 , while the bare g-C 3 N 4 did not exhibit an N 1s spectrum, as shown in Fig. S3(f) 48,49.Therefore, FTIR and XPS analysis of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 indicated that this heterostructure has been created successfully due to the strong bonding between the g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 /MoS 2 . Along with the morphological and chemical characterization of the as-prepared samples, we evaluated their photoresponses to assess their optical properties.First, the optical absorbance was measured within the UV-Vis range of 300-900 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(a), to calculate the bandgap.In the inset, we can see that the TiO 2 NFs showed the lowest absorbance in the visible range; bare g-C 3 N 4 showed a band edge, with a wavelength of 475 nm.However, when the flower-like MoS 2 was grown on the TiO 2 NFs, the band edge of the TiO 2 NFs shifted from 400 to 450 nm.Moreover, when the g-C 3 N 4 was coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures, the band edge shifted slightly, with lower absorbance compared to that of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures.Based on the band edge absorbance results, the bandgap energy was 2.86, 2.33, 2.27, and 2.50 eV for the TiO 2 NFs, TiO 2 /MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, based on tauc plots.As expected, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N showed the lowest bandgap.We conducted PL measurements to observe the recombination of the as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 3(b), the g-C 3 N 4 had the strongest PL emission, with a broad range around nm, while a slightly shifted PL spectrum of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 was observed at 470 nm, suggesting an effective separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs under 325 nm laser excitation.However, the TiO 2 NFs and TiO 2 /MoS 2 exhibited no photoemission under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. S4.Therefore, PL analysis indicated that the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure effectively reduced the recombination of charge carriers.Fig. 3(c) shows the photocurrent density measured while switching the light on and off every 60 s, which was done to determine the photoresponse of the as-prepared samples.The transient photocurrent density of the TiO 2 NFs and g-C 3 N 4 showed the lowest values, of 1.8 and 1.6 A/cm 2 respectively, while the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structure showed a lower photocurrent density, of 2.8 A/cm 2 , than that of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure.In the case of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , the photocurrent density (3.7 A/cm 2 ) was 2.3 times higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 .Moreover, even while the light was off, both the TiO 2 /MoS 2 and TiO 2 /MoS 2 / g-C 3 N 4 structures showed slower decay of photogenerated electron-hole pairs than the bare TiO 2 or g-C 3 N 4 , as indicated by the green circle in Fig. 3(c).The slowest decay and highest photocurrent density of TiO 2 / MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 confirmed an effective photogenerated electron channel and an excellent photoresponse 50.Nyquist plots of the EIS were used to determine the kinetics of the charge movements, as shown in Fig. 3 (d).Regarding the photocurrent density, the impedance values were divided by the exposed area, of 8 cm 2 .As shown in the figure, the resistance value for charge transfer between electrolytes and catalysts is denoted R ct .Under light irradiation, semicircles formed on the plots of the TiO 2 NFs, TiO 2 /MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 , with radii of 73, 93, and 94 k/cm 2 , respectively.As expected, the radius was smaller for TiO 2 /-MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 (53 k/cm 2 ), due to the fast transport of photogenerated electrons through well-connected interfaces, than for TiO 2 NFs, TiO 2 /-MoS 2, and g-C 3 N 4 . Finally, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis was performed to determine the photoinduced charge carrier lifetime using the following equation 51,52: The average carrier lifetime of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 was 5.28 ns, which was longer than that of the g-C 3 N 4 only (4.41 ns), as shown in Fig. 3(e); the lifetimes of these structures are summarized in Fig. 3(f). Generally, TRPL analysis revealed that excellent photocatalytic reaction performance is usually due to a long carrier lifetime, the separation of charge carriers, and a low recombination rate under light irradiation 53.As mentioned above, TiO 2 /MoS 2 showed no photoemission response under the same condition.Based on the photoresponse parameters, including the optical absorbance, recombination rate, photocurrent density, charge transfer, and carrier lifetime, the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure clearly exhibited an effective electron pathway through interconnections among its TiO 2 , MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 components, with outstanding transportation of the photo-induced electrons and a longer charge carrier lifetime than the g-C 3 N 4 . We explored the as-prepared catalysts in terms of photocatalytic CO reduction (specifically, their photoreaction activity under UV-Vis irradiation).H 2 , CO, and CH 4 were the main products of TiO 2 NFs, TiO 2 / MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 , as shown in Fig. S5.To ensure reliability, Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was tested three times under the same conditions, results are summarized in Fig. 4(a).The amounts of CO from TiO 2 NFs, TiO 2 /MoS 2 , TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 were 22.81, 38.69, 42.52, and 12.80 mol/g, respectively, while the respective amounts of CH 4 were 10.36, 17.19, 21.78, and 6.13 mol/g.The TiO 2 NFs and g-C 3 N 4 alone showed exceptionally low yields of both CO and CH 4 , with the g-C 3 N 4 giving the lowest yields, possibly due to its high recombination rate for photoinduced electron and hole pairs.However, after the flower-like MoS 2 grown on the TiO 2 NFs, the CO and CH 4 yields were 1.7 and 1.6 times higher, respectively, than those of the TiO 2 NFs alone.Furthermore, after the g-C 3 N 4 has been uniformly coated on the TiO 2 /MoS 2 , the CO and CH 4 yields dramatically increased to 3.3 and 3.6 times those of g-C 3 N 4 alone, respectively.These high yields confirmed that the interconnected interfaces in these materials enhance the electron transport and thus, a high oxidation and reduction capability.To investigate the stability of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N heterostructure, a recycling test was performed three times, up to 5 h for each cycle; the results are shown in Fig. 4(b).The yields of CO and CH 4 were reasonably stable.The CO 2 conversion, given by the sum of the CO and CH 4 yields, is shown in Fig. 4(c).The TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 exhibited a high CO 2 conversion rate of 67.41 mol/g; for the TiO 2 NFs, TiO 2 /MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 , the respective values were 36.16,52.80, and 21.68 mol/g, respectively. The band diagrams of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructures are used to interpret the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction mechanism based on the measured bandgaps, as well as the Mott-Schottky plots and the valence bands measured via XPS.Details of the band diagram equations and calculations are provided in Figs.S6(a-f).According to the calculation, the conduction band level of g-C 3 N 4 is located a bit higher than that of the TiO 2 or MoS 2 conduction band as shown in Fig. 4(d).Moreover, according to the band diagrams for TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , the CH 4 kinetic overpotential (E a,CH4 ) values were calculated to be 0.18 eV E a,CH4 is typically used to determine the distance from the conduction band of a catalyst to the reduction potential of CH 4 /CO 2 (-0.24V) 9,54.Based on the calculated values, TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 has sufficient E a,CH4 for superior electron transport, and hence CO 2 conversion, compared to the other materials.Conventionally, the desorption of CO or CH 4 molecules from a catalyst is equally important as that of adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Based on DFT calculation in literature, adsorption energies of H 2 O, CO 2 , H 2 , CO, and CH 4 on g-C 3 N 4 were -0.513, -0.226, -0.078, -0.155, and -0.163 eV, respectively 55.Here, H 2 O and CO 2 were reported to have more negative adsorption energies than those of H 2 , CO, and CH 4 gases.Thus, it explains why we have strong adsorption of CO 2 molecules on the fabricated heterostructure of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 , resulting in effective photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with easy desorption of productive gases. Depending on its electronic band diagram of TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure, the S-scheme with charge transfer is suggested as a possible mechanism.Prior to the formation of the heterostructure, Fig. 5 (a) showed band diagrams of each TiO 2 , MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 with its Fermi level (E f ), estimated from the work function Fig. S5, equation 4.As TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure was formed, the electrons from g-C 3 N 4 will transfer to both TiO 2 and MoS 2 , reaching an equilibrium E f level.This causes band bending and depletion layer along with an internal electric field at the interfaces between g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 /MoS 2 (Fig. 5(b)).When the light was irradiated into the catalysts, electron and hole pairs were photogenerated at TiO 2 , MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 separately.The excited electrons from the CB of TiO 2 are transferred to VB of g-C 3 N 4 and these photogenerated electrons and hole pairs will recombine easily due to its Coulombic attraction at the interface between TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 .Afterwards, the powerful electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 will move into the CB of MoS 2 , reacting with absorbed CO 2 molecules through the surfaces and reducing hydrocarbons mainly to CO and CH 4 while the holes in the VB of TiO 2 and MoS 2 have reacted with TEOA, to oxidize TEOA into TEOA .Therefore, the designed S-scheme heterostructure offers the fast electron transportation of one-dimensional TiO 2 NFs, interfacing with active sites of flower-like MoS 2 as well as g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.Therefore, the recombination of charge carriers due to Coulombic attraction at the interfaces of TiO 2 /g-C 3 N 4, leads to effective movements of useful charge carriers to CB of MoS 2 as well as VBs of MoS 2 and TiO 2. Overall, this S-scheme heterojunction shows a strong redox on each surface to result in superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was considered in terms of the effect of g-C 3 N 4 loaded onto the TiO 2 /MoS 2 structures.For reliability, TiO 2 / MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -2 and TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -3 each were tested three times under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. S7(b-c).The results regarding the amounts of the evolved gases (CO and CH 4 ) up to 5 h of collection time are shown in Fig. 6 6(b) S CO2 can be calculated using the following equation 56: where n is the evolved yield of S1.The CO 2 adsorption amounts for the TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -1, TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -2, and TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -3 were 0.55, 1.05, and 1.28 cm 3 /g STP, respectively.The porous structure of the TiO 2 /MoS 2 / g-C 3 N 4 -3 provided more active sites for CO 2 diffusion and adsorption, as well as efficient electron transfer through its interfaces 57.Moreover, the increased porosity with additional g-C 3 N 4 probably expanded the adsorption of CO 2 on photocatalysts due to Lewis basic functions of the -NH 2 in g-C 3 N 4 to capture CO 2 molecules by forming H 2 bonds with CO 2 58,59.Here, the presence of -NH 2 has expanded CO 2 adsorption as well as CO 2 activation 60.According to these CO 2 adsorption results, TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -3 exhibited much higher CO 2 adsorption capacity than TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -1 or TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 -2, due to the higher porosity of the g-C 3 N 4 , as shown in Fig. 6(d).Furthermore, we summarized preliminary studies comparing TiO 2 , MoS 2 , or g-C 3 N 4 based materials for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction as shown in Table S2.The S CO2 value 90 observed for this noble metal-free TiO 2 /MoS 2 /g-C 3 N 4 heterostructure, is attributed to the maximization of CO 2 adsorption due to its specific surface area and porous g-C 3 N 4 structure, along with the interconnections among the TiO 2 , MoS 2 , and g-C 3 N 4 components, which promoted efficient electron transfer."}], "lamp": [], "reaction medium": [], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
