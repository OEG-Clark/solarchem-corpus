Compared to the ZnO nanorods, the photocatalytic activity is enhanced when the Cu 2 O content is increased, such as over the ZnO/Cu 2 O-45s catalyst.The CO amount further increases over the ZnO/Cu 2 O-60s sample, in that more Cu 2 O means higher efficiency for the generation, separation and transport of charge carriers, as confirmed by the above photoelectrochemical analysis.Moreover, the Cu 2 O-tipped ZnO nanorods can provide a large contact area between the ZnO and carbon source in the electrolyte, promoting the unidirectional transfer of holes to the Cu 2 O tip and electrons confined within the ZnO nanorods.

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was acquired on an FTIR spectrophotometer (Spectrum One, Perkin Elmer, USA). The photoelectrochemical performance was tested in a three-electrode configuration with the as-prepared nanostructure as working electrode, Pt as counter electrode and SCE as reference electrode.All electrochemical measurements were carried out in CO 2 saturated 0.1 molL -1 KHCO 3 (pH was performed on the electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D, Chenhua, China) under the irradiation of Xe lamp (120 mWcm -2 ).The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was obtained on the electrochemical workstation (IM6, Zahner, Germany) with a tunable light source (TLS 03, Zahner, Germany).The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and controlled intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) were implemented using an electrochemical workstation (IM6, Zahner, Germany) under UV-visible light (100 mWcm -2 , WLC02, Zahner, Germany).The EIS measurements were carried out from 4 MHz to 1 mHz with an AC amplitude of of 0.20.9V (vs.RHE) on the electrochemical workstation (IM6, Zahner, Germany). The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was performed under both visible and UV-visible light irradiation in a gas-closed circulation system at 15 oC and a pressure of 2830 kPa.The 0.25 molL -1 Na 2 SO 3 and 1 molL -1 NaOH aqueous solution were used for the CO 2 photoreduction reaction.The electrodes of ZnO or ZnO/Cu 2 O heterostructures were placed in the solution and kept in upward direction.The system was purged with CO 2 for 90 min in dark to obtain maximum adsorption of CO 2 molecules on the active sites of the samples.Then a 300-W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300) was used to illuminate on the electrodes surface.A 420-nm cut-off filter was used to achieve the visible-light illumination.The identification of the products was valued by a gas chromatography system (GC, 7890A, Agilent, USA) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD), which was directly connected with the photochemical reaction system.The product yield was evaluated every one hour for totally 8 h in series.In-depth analysis on the structure of ZnO and ZnO/Cu 2 O-60s was further carried out by TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM).The length of the ZnO nanorods is 800 nm (Figure 3a).ZnO (0002) fringe is perpendicular to the rod axis with a lattice spacing of 0.26 nm on average (Figure 3b), indicating that ZnO nanorods grow along the 0001 direction as also confirmed by the XRD analysis.The selected area electron diffraction (SEAD) result further proves that the as-prepared ZnO nanorod is single crystalline (Figure 3c).3e).The SEAD of the heterostructure indicates that the Cu 2 O is polycrystalline (Figure 3f), indicating that the photodeposited Cu 2 O has high crystallinity and constructed by small particles, as also observed in the zoom-in SEM image (inset of Figure 2b).To further investigate the growth sites of the Cu 2 O particles, STEM imaging was carried out (Figure 3g).The Cu element mapping reveals that Cu only distributes on the tip of the ZnO nanorod, confirming the tip-selective deposition of the Cu 2 O particles."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
