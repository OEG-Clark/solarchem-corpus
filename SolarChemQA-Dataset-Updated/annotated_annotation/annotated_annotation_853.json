The structural characterization was carried out by X-ray powder diffraction using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu K radiation (40 kV, 30 mA).BET surface area was carried out by N adsorption-desorption isotherms using a Bel-Japan Minisorp II surface area and a pore size analyzer.The morphology was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy using a JEOL 6490 LV.For this purpose, the samples were covered with Au-Pd alloy.High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to identify the interface in the composite formed using a microscope JEOL 2010.The surface groups in the samples were studied by FTIR using a Thermo FTIR Nicolet iS50 with ATR accessory in a range of 500-4000 cm A 1 .A Thermo scientific XRD Raman microscope was employed to measure the Raman spectra of all the samples.All spectra were taken in the backscattering configuration at room temperature.Photoluminescence analysis was performed at room temperature in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Cary Eclipse) integrated with a Xenon flash lamp.The samples were excited at nm, using a scanning speed of 600 nm/min, and an excitation width and emission slit of 10 nm.

The representative SEM images of the dolomite and the samples synthesized are depicted in Fig. 3. Dolomite mineral showed a morphology composed of big (2.5 m) and smooth particles (Fig. 3a), which were converted into regular and well-distributed semi-spherical particles of an average size of 140 nm in DA sample (Fig. 3b).On the other hand, Cu 2 O pure exhibited octahedral morphology of a higher size than the Cu/DA sample (Fig. 3d).The Cu/DA composite exhibited a spherical morphology with an average size of 1 m (Fig. 3e), with some small particles formed on its surface.According to EDS mapping, these small particles deposited on the DA are Cu 2 O.The average particle size is shown in Table 1. To study the elemental distribution in the samples, an EDS mapping was obtained.As can be seen in Fig. 3c, Mg, Ca, Si, and O were detected.These elements were well distributed in the DA sample.The same elements were detected in the Cu/DA sample with the obvious apparition of Cu (Fig. 3f). HRTEM analysis was performed in Cu/DA sample to analyze the interface of Cu 2 O and the dolomite-activated sample, which results are shown in Fig. 4. The interface of the Cu/DA composite showed the presence of Cu 2 O (111) and Mg(OH) 2 (001), as is shown in Fig. 4b.Indexing of reflections of other compounds was not possible because of its low crystallinity. N 2 isotherms of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 5. Pristine dolomite and Cu 2 O showed a type-III profile related to a non-porous surface.Instead, the activated dolomite and Cu/DA exhibited a small hysteresis around 0.4 and 0.9 of relative pressure, which indicated the formation of porous particles in the DA and the Cu/DA samples.Further analysis from the t-plot of both samples revealed that part of them is composed of micropores (pores with a diameter 2 nm), as it was revealed in the Inset-plot in Fig. 5. DA sample showed pores of 2 nm of diameter, however, when Cu 2 O was impregnated in the composites, the pores tend to shrinkage until 1.5 nm.It is worth to mention that the strategy to decrease the pore size could be beneficial to capture CO from gas effluents (such as the post-combustion streams) because of its small size (3.3A) in comparison with other gaseous molecules such as O (3.4 A), N 2 (3.6 A), and CO (3.7 A) 23. From these data, the specific surface area was obtained, which is summarized in Table 1.The reference mineral exhibited a low surface area (1 m 2 g A 1 ), as it was expected.The activation of the dolomite resulted in a significant increase in the surface area, obtaining 125 m g A 1 .After Cu 2 O incorporation in the DA sample, the area decreased 1.7 times.However, the surface area of the composite was higher (73 m g A 1 ) than the reference Cu 2 O material (41 m 2 g A 1 ). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to determine the optical properties of the as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 6, both Cu/DA and bare-Cu 2 O showed an evident absorption in the visible region, with band gap energies of 1.8 and 1.7 eV, respectively (Table 1).Instead, the activation of the dolomite promoted a blue shift of the DRS spectra due to the crystal phases present in the DA sample (Mg(OH) 2 and CaCO 3 ).The visible absorption of the pristine mineral can be associated with carbonates and small impurities present in it. Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra of the as-prepared samples.In the case of the Raman spectra of bare-Cu 2 O, two bands at 218 and 1590 cm A 1 were detected, which are in agreement with previous reports 242526.The signal at 218 cm A 1 is assigned to the second-order overtone of the primary Raman signal of 2 A 12 24.The presence of this band in Cu 2 O has been correlated with high crystallinity in the samples 25.2 A 12 band was lower in Cu/DA sample, which confirms a lower crystallinity in the composite in comparison with bare-Cu 2 O, as it was also seen by X-ray diffraction.Regarding the DA sample, a wide band was observed around 1020 cm A 1 , which can be assigned to Mg(OH) 2 27.This band was also present in the Cu/DA sample, which confirms its presence in the composite. Fig. 8 shows the efficiency of CO 2 capture of the synthesized materials at NTP conditions in the gas phase GC.The dolomite-activated sample (DA) showed the highest capacity to capture CO 2 (180 mg CO2 g A 1 ), which could be related to its highest surface area and its homogeneous spherical morphology.Also, the high efficiency of CO 2 capture of the Cu/DA sample could be attributed to its crystalline phases (Mg (OH) 2 /SiO 2 ).Mainly, the adsorption of CO 2 on Mg(OH) 2 is a thermodynamically spontaneous process (H 14 -26.4 kJ mol A 1 ) 28.The presence of SiO 2 on the composite could affect the kinetics of carbonation of the dolomite, although SiO 2 by itself has not reactive groups to interact with CO 2 29.In the presence of a second phase such as Mg (OH) 2 , SiO 2 can improve the process efficiency through enhancement in the dispersibility of Mg(OH) 2 in the medium promoting higher surface area.This would yield a more significant number of small-reactive Mg (OH) 2 particles directly exposed to CO 2 , which otherwise would be placed in the interior of the agglomerates wherein the diffusive transfer of CO 2 is slow 30.This effect promoted the carbonation in the DA sample. After the impregnation of Cu 2 O in the Cu/DA composite, the CO 2 capture capacity of the material decrease around 20 of its initial efficiency, probably due to the blockage of its active sites.Also, the adsorption of CO 2 on Cu 2 O is not a spontaneous process 31, which also could contribute to decreasing the capture of the gas on the sample.However, the impregnation of Cu 2 O on the activated dolomite sample resulted in an excellent result to capture CO 2 from gas effluents, as can be seen in Fig. 8. FTIR analysis was performed to investigate the type of CO 2 -binding on the synthesized samples.The FTIR spectra of DA and Cu/DA samples exhibited two absorption bands at 1560 and 1350 cm A 1 , as is shown in Fig. 9. Previous works had suggested that the distance (known as 3 splitting) between these bands can provide information about the basic strength of the active sites on IPMs materials 32,33.Also, the splitting is related to the type of CO 2 -species adsorbed on IPMs: unidentate ( 3 14 100 cm A 1 , bidentate ( 3 14 300 cm A 1 , and bridged species ( 3 14 400 cm A 1 32.According to the FTIR shown in Fig. 9, the 3 splittings for DA and Cu/DA samples were 201 and 181 cm A 1 , respectively.These values indicate the presence of unidentate carbonate species, which requires strong basic sites 34.The 3 splitting in DA was higher than in Cu/DA sample, which suggests stronger CO 2 adsorption in this sample.The basic sites in these samples are related to Mg(OH) 2 phase.An additional band at 1022 cm A 1 was observed in the DA sample related to C--O groups 35.On the other hand, the spectra of bare--Cu 2 O showed two different absorption bands.These bands appear at 1450 cm A 1 and are related to the scissoring of C-H, while the asymmetric stretching vibration of C-O appears at 878 cm A 1 36,37. The photocatalytic conversion to CO 2 to solar fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH) was studying at NTP conditions under visible light.First, control experiments were performed to confirm all the products were obtained from the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.These results confirmed that carbon-containing compounds were not detected in the reaction system without reactants or light irradiations. The photocatalytic yield for solar fuels production using the pristine and the as-prepared samples is shown in Fig. 10.HCOH was detected as the main product of the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion in all the samples.Dolomite-sample exhibited the lowest photocatalytic activity probably due to their crystalline phases (Mg(OH) 2 , CaCO 3 , and SiO 2 ) that showed wide band gaps and low visible-light activation.Pure-Cu 2 O resulted in the highest HCOH production (419 mol g A 1 h A 1 ) with small low amount of CH 3 OH generated (11 mol g A 1 h A 1 ).Nonetheless, after the Cu 2 O incorporation in the dolomite, the selectivity of the reaction changed.CH 3 OH generation (38 mol g A 1 h A 1 ) was favored up to 3.4 times under these conditions.The increase in CH 3 OH selectivity can be related to several factors, such as kinetic requirements and CO 2 adsorption. Regarding CO 2 adsorption, unidentate CO 2 -species were mainly identified in Cu/DA and Cu 2 O samples through FTIR.These species can be converted to the carboxyl radical COOH after the visible-light activation of Cu 2 O.Then, the carboxyl radical reacts with H to form HCOOH, which is dehydrated to HCO .This intermediate is easy to adsorb on the photocatalyst surface, and it could determine the selectivity of the reaction.Then, HCO accepts a couple of electron and H to generate HCOH, which can be reduced into CH 3 OH by further hydrogenation reaction.According to the results, bare-Cu 2 O promoted higher HCOH formation, which could be associated with its lower surface area to adsorb HCO in comparison with Cu/DA sample.In this sense, the surface of Cu/DA sample provides more active sites for HCO adsorption, which is hydrogenated until CH 3 OH formation. Also, the kinetic factor can affect the selectivity of the reaction.The CO 2 reduction mechanism is known as CO 2 HCOOHHCOHCH 3 OH, as it was mentioned 38.Each step is accompanied by the transfer of both electrons (e A ) and protons (H ).HCOH generation requires a less number of protons (4H ) and electrons (4e A ) in comparison with CH 3 OH, which requires 6H and 6e A .Consequently, the production of HCOH is kinetically favored in comparison with CH 3 OH. On the other hand, another factor that influenced the photocatalytic activity for CH 3 OH production is related to the charge transfer.A schematic band diagram was constructed in agreement with the valence (VB), and conduction bands (CB) potentials of Cu 2 O and Mg(OH) 2 previously reported to understand the possible photocatalytic mechanism in Cu/DA sample 6,39,40.Fig. 11 shows that when the composite was irradiated with visible-light, the generation of the electron (e A ) and hole (h ) occurs in Cu 2 O. Since the conduction band potential of Cu 2 O is more negative than Mg(OH) 2 , the electrons from the CB of Cu 2 O are transported to the CB of Mg(OH) 2 to perform the reduction of CO 2 .This coupling between Cu 2 O and Mg(OH) 2 helps to have more available electrons to reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH.According to the results, bare-Cu 2 O favored the formation of HCOH, while the Cu/DA sample exhibited a higher selectivity for CH 3 OH generation.In bare-Cu 2 O, the recombination of the photogenerated charges is faster than in Cu/DA sample, which could promote the formation of HCOH instead of CH 3 OH.To corroborate this, photoluminescence analysis was performed in bare--Cu 2 O and Cu/DA samples to obtain information about their photogenerated charge carrier lifetimes (Fig. 12).The photoluminescence emission spectra of both samples revealed two peaks at 765 and 825 nm, related to the recombination of excitons bound to oxygen vacancies (VO 2 and VO ) and the band gap emission 41,42.The area of the peaks in Cu/DA sample was two times smaller than in bare-Cu 2 O, which confirmed that the Cu/DA sample exhibited a slower radiative recombination rate of the electron-hole pairs (see Fig. 12).A comparison of the efficiency exhibited by the composites synthesized in this work with related photocatalysts for CO 2 conversion is shown in Table 2. Though a direct comparison is difficult due to the use of different irradiation sources and reaction media, the activity of the proposed-materials in this work was high and competitive, considering that the experiments were performed using visible LED light of low power (20 W) and lost-cost materials without no sacrificial agents or noble metal co-catalysts. According to the results, the combination of a Cu 2 O photocatalyst on activated-dolomite resulted in higher selectivity for CH 3 OH generation during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The importance of directing the photocatalytic reaction to CH 3 OH instead of HCOH lies in the heat of combustion provided by each one.Methanol provides more energy (162 kcal mol A 1 ) during its combustion in comparison with formaldehyde (124 kcal mol A 1 ) 44.From this standpoint, the photocatalytic CH 3 OH generated can be used directly as a fuel with minor changes in the existing infrastructure."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The experiments were carried out in a continuous stainless steel photocatalytic reactor in the gas phase at NTP conditions.", "context": "Dolomite-supported Cu 2 O was prepared by microwavehydrothermal method.First, the pristine material (previously grinding) was calcined at 800 C for 5 h to promote its decarbonization.After calcination, the powders were suspended in 50 mL of DI water under vigorous stirring.Then, 0.2 M of Cu(CH 3 CO 2 ) 2 H 2 O was added into the suspension.After the complete salt dissolution, 1 M of NaOH solution was added into the solution dropwise to promote the formation of Cu(OH) 2 .Then, 0.004 mol of glucose was added into the reaction to promote the reduction Cu 2 to Cu 1 .The resulting suspension was exposed to 600 W in a microwave-hydrothermal reactor model Mars 6 at 100 C for 1 h.The suspension obtained was washed with water and methanol to remove the byproducts of the reaction.Finally, the samples were dried at 100 C overnight and labeled as Cu/DA.For comparative purposes, the same procedure was performed without copper, which produced a dolomite-activated sample identified as DA.

The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to determine the optical properties of the as-prepared samples.As shown in Fig. 6, both Cu/DA and bare-Cu 2 O showed an evident absorption in the visible region, with band gap energies of 1.8 and 1.7 eV, respectively (Table 1).Instead, the activation of the dolomite promoted a blue shift of the DRS spectra due to the crystal phases present in the DA sample (Mg(OH) 2 and CaCO 3 ).The visible absorption of the pristine mineral can be associated with carbonates and small impurities present in it. Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra of the as-prepared samples.In the case of the Raman spectra of bare-Cu 2 O, two bands at 218 and 1590 cm A 1 were detected, which are in agreement with previous reports 242526.The signal at 218 cm A 1 is assigned to the second-order overtone of the primary Raman signal of 2 A 12 24.The presence of this band in Cu 2 O has been correlated with high crystallinity in the samples 25.2 A 12 band was lower in Cu/DA sample, which confirms a lower crystallinity in the composite in comparison with bare-Cu 2 O, as it was also seen by X-ray diffraction.Regarding the DA sample, a wide band was observed around 1020 cm A 1 , which can be assigned to Mg(OH) 2 27.This band was also present in the Cu/DA sample, which confirms its presence in the composite. Fig. 8 shows the efficiency of CO 2 capture of the synthesized materials at NTP conditions in the gas phase GC.The dolomite-activated sample (DA) showed the highest capacity to capture CO 2 (180 mg CO2 g A 1 ), which could be related to its highest surface area and its homogeneous spherical morphology.Also, the high efficiency of CO 2 capture of the Cu/DA sample could be attributed to its crystalline phases (Mg (OH) 2 /SiO 2 ).Mainly, the adsorption of CO 2 on Mg(OH) 2 is a thermodynamically spontaneous process (H 14 -26.4 kJ mol A 1 ) 28.The presence of SiO 2 on the composite could affect the kinetics of carbonation of the dolomite, although SiO 2 by itself has not reactive groups to interact with CO 2 29.In the presence of a second phase such as Mg (OH) 2 , SiO 2 can improve the process efficiency through enhancement in the dispersibility of Mg(OH) 2 in the medium promoting higher surface area.This would yield a more significant number of small-reactive Mg (OH) 2 particles directly exposed to CO 2 , which otherwise would be placed in the interior of the agglomerates wherein the diffusive transfer of CO 2 is slow 30.This effect promoted the carbonation in the DA sample. After the impregnation of Cu 2 O in the Cu/DA composite, the CO 2 capture capacity of the material decrease around 20 of its initial efficiency, probably due to the blockage of its active sites.Also, the adsorption of CO 2 on Cu 2 O is not a spontaneous process 31, which also could contribute to decreasing the capture of the gas on the sample.However, the impregnation of Cu 2 O on the activated dolomite sample resulted in an excellent result to capture CO 2 from gas effluents, as can be seen in Fig. 8. FTIR analysis was performed to investigate the type of CO 2 -binding on the synthesized samples.The FTIR spectra of DA and Cu/DA samples exhibited two absorption bands at 1560 and 1350 cm A 1 , as is shown in Fig. 9. Previous works had suggested that the distance (known as 3 splitting) between these bands can provide information about the basic strength of the active sites on IPMs materials 32,33.Also, the splitting is related to the type of CO 2 -species adsorbed on IPMs: unidentate ( 3 14 100 cm A 1 , bidentate ( 3 14 300 cm A 1 , and bridged species ( 3 14 400 cm A 1 32.According to the FTIR shown in Fig. 9, the 3 splittings for DA and Cu/DA samples were 201 and 181 cm A 1 , respectively.These values indicate the presence of unidentate carbonate species, which requires strong basic sites 34.The 3 splitting in DA was higher than in Cu/DA sample, which suggests stronger CO 2 adsorption in this sample.The basic sites in these samples are related to Mg(OH) 2 phase.An additional band at 1022 cm A 1 was observed in the DA sample related to C--O groups 35.On the other hand, the spectra of bare--Cu 2 O showed two different absorption bands.These bands appear at 1450 cm A 1 and are related to the scissoring of C-H, while the asymmetric stretching vibration of C-O appears at 878 cm A 1 36,37. The photocatalytic conversion to CO 2 to solar fuels (CH 3 OH and HCOH) was studying at NTP conditions under visible light.First, control experiments were performed to confirm all the products were obtained from the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.These results confirmed that carbon-containing compounds were not detected in the reaction system without reactants or light irradiations. The photocatalytic yield for solar fuels production using the pristine and the as-prepared samples is shown in Fig. 10.HCOH was detected as the main product of the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion in all the samples.Dolomite-sample exhibited the lowest photocatalytic activity probably due to their crystalline phases (Mg(OH) 2 , CaCO 3 , and SiO 2 ) that showed wide band gaps and low visible-light activation.Pure-Cu 2 O resulted in the highest HCOH production (419 mol g A 1 h A 1 ) with small low amount of CH 3 OH generated (11 mol g A 1 h A 1 ).Nonetheless, after the Cu 2 O incorporation in the dolomite, the selectivity of the reaction changed.CH 3 OH generation (38 mol g A 1 h A 1 ) was favored up to 3.4 times under these conditions.The increase in CH 3 OH selectivity can be related to several factors, such as kinetic requirements and CO 2 adsorption. Regarding CO 2 adsorption, unidentate CO 2 -species were mainly identified in Cu/DA and Cu 2 O samples through FTIR.These species can be converted to the carboxyl radical COOH after the visible-light activation of Cu 2 O.Then, the carboxyl radical reacts with H to form HCOOH, which is dehydrated to HCO .This intermediate is easy to adsorb on the photocatalyst surface, and it could determine the selectivity of the reaction.Then, HCO accepts a couple of electron and H to generate HCOH, which can be reduced into CH 3 OH by further hydrogenation reaction.According to the results, bare-Cu 2 O promoted higher HCOH formation, which could be associated with its lower surface area to adsorb HCO in comparison with Cu/DA sample.In this sense, the surface of Cu/DA sample provides more active sites for HCO adsorption, which is hydrogenated until CH 3 OH formation. Also, the kinetic factor can affect the selectivity of the reaction.The CO 2 reduction mechanism is known as CO 2 HCOOHHCOHCH 3 OH, as it was mentioned 38.Each step is accompanied by the transfer of both electrons (e A ) and protons (H ).HCOH generation requires a less number of protons (4H ) and electrons (4e A ) in comparison with CH 3 OH, which requires 6H and 6e A .Consequently, the production of HCOH is kinetically favored in comparison with CH 3 OH. On the other hand, another factor that influenced the photocatalytic activity for CH 3 OH production is related to the charge transfer.A schematic band diagram was constructed in agreement with the valence (VB), and conduction bands (CB) potentials of Cu 2 O and Mg(OH) 2 previously reported to understand the possible photocatalytic mechanism in Cu/DA sample 6,39,40.Fig. 11 shows that when the composite was irradiated with visible-light, the generation of the electron (e A ) and hole (h ) occurs in Cu 2 O. Since the conduction band potential of Cu 2 O is more negative than Mg(OH) 2 , the electrons from the CB of Cu 2 O are transported to the CB of Mg(OH) 2 to perform the reduction of CO 2 .This coupling between Cu 2 O and Mg(OH) 2 helps to have more available electrons to reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH.According to the results, bare-Cu 2 O favored the formation of HCOH, while the Cu/DA sample exhibited a higher selectivity for CH 3 OH generation.In bare-Cu 2 O, the recombination of the photogenerated charges is faster than in Cu/DA sample, which could promote the formation of HCOH instead of CH 3 OH.To corroborate this, photoluminescence analysis was performed in bare--Cu 2 O and Cu/DA samples to obtain information about their photogenerated charge carrier lifetimes (Fig. 12).The photoluminescence emission spectra of both samples revealed two peaks at 765 and 825 nm, related to the recombination of excitons bound to oxygen vacancies (VO 2 and VO ) and the band gap emission 41,42.The area of the peaks in Cu/DA sample was two times smaller than in bare-Cu 2 O, which confirmed that the Cu/DA sample exhibited a slower radiative recombination rate of the electron-hole pairs (see Fig. 12).A comparison of the efficiency exhibited by the composites synthesized in this work with related photocatalysts for CO 2 conversion is shown in Table 2. Though a direct comparison is difficult due to the use of different irradiation sources and reaction media, the activity of the proposed-materials in this work was high and competitive, considering that the experiments were performed using visible LED light of low power (20 W) and lost-cost materials without no sacrificial agents or noble metal co-catalysts. According to the results, the combination of a Cu 2 O photocatalyst on activated-dolomite resulted in higher selectivity for CH 3 OH generation during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The importance of directing the photocatalytic reaction to CH 3 OH instead of HCOH lies in the heat of combustion provided by each one.Methanol provides more energy (162 kcal mol A 1 ) during its combustion in comparison with formaldehyde (124 kcal mol A 1 ) 44.From this standpoint, the photocatalytic CH 3 OH generated can be used directly as a fuel with minor changes in the existing infrastructure."}, {"llm generation": "gaseous streams", "source": "The activated dolomite exhibited high efficiency (180 mg CO2 g A 1 ) to adsorb CO 2 from diluted gaseous streams.", "context": "Dolomite-supported Cu 2 O particles were prepared, characterized, and evaluated as heterogeneous photocatalysts for the CO 2 conversion to solar fuels under visible light irradiation for the first time.The activated dolomite exhibited high efficiency (180 mg CO2 g A 1 ) to adsorb CO 2 from diluted gaseous streams.This result was attributed to a high surface area (125 m 2 g A 1 ), low particle size (200 nm), small pore diameter (2 nm), and the presence of stronger basic active sites that promote unidentate carbonate species on the surface of the materials.Regarding the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion, the resulting composite (Cu/DA) showed 3.4 times superior photocatalytic performance for solar fuels with higher heat of combustion (CH 3 OH) in comparison with bare-Cu 2 O particles.The selectivity of the reaction was correlated to the capacity to adsorb HCO intermediates and with a more efficient charge transfer between Cu 2 O and Mg(OH) 2 .Thus, the incorporation of the visible-light active photocatalyst Cu 2 O to an activated-inorganic porous material resulted in a good strategy to increase the photocatalytic activity for value-added products, and in the near future to the contribution to mitigating the climate change. There is no potential conflict of interest. CRediT authorship contribution statement E. Lu evano-Hip olito: Writing -original draft, Supervision.Leticia M.
