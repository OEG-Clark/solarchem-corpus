Pure TiO 2 nanoparticles were prepared using the same procedure without metal loading. The crystal structure of the powder samples was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) (Bruker D8 advance diffractometer) using Cu Ka radiation (k 0.154178 nm) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA.The XRD patterns were obtained with a scan rate of 1.2min A1 and scanning range of 10-70of 2h.The morphology of the samples was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi SU8020).The particle size and lattice structure of the individual crystals were visualized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) with FEI-Tecni G2 TEM.The chemical composition was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra DLD Shimadzu).The XPS spectrum was calibrated with respect to the binding energy of the C1s signal at 284.60 eV as the internal standard.The specific surface area of the samples was measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption at 77 K using a surface area and porosity analyzer (Micrometrics ASAP 2020).The infrared spectra were measured at room temperature with a resolution of 4 cm A1 in the IR range 4000-400 cm A1 with Spectrum 2000 Explorer Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectrometer.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra were measured using UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 100) equipped with an integrated sphere in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm.Raman and photoluminescence measurements of the powder samples were acquired at room temperature using Raman Spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution, HORIBA) with a 532 nm emitting laser as an excitation source. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was H 2 O and/H 2 reductant in the gas phase was investigated in a batch photoreactor system of total volume 108 cm 3 as shown in Fig. 1.The light source used to activate photocatalyst was a 500 W Hg lamp located inside the quartz cold trap, having maximum irradiation intensity at 365 nm with light intensity 25 mW/cm 2 .Quartz glass window of 10 mm thickness was fixed at the top of the reactor, enabling efficient transfer of the irradiation form lamp to the catalyst surface.The lamp was ignited using high voltage power supply connected to a lamp through an igniter and a stabilizer.The reactor was covered with aluminum foil to ensure all the lights participated in the reaction came through the quartz window only.0.25 g of powder photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed at the bottom of the reactor to ensure light is powerfully distributed over the entire catalyst surface. The reactor, checked for leakage at 2 bar pressure for several hours, was purged by helium (He) gas.The compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller (MFC) was flowing through the water bubbler at 20 mL/min to carry moisture.The CO 2 saturated with H 2 O was mixed with a He flowing at a rate of 80 mL/min in a gas mixture to dilute CO 2 concentration.The mixture of gases (CO 2 , He, H 2 O) was passed through reactor for 30 min to purge and saturate the catalyst.Thereafter, outlet valve was closed and pressure inside the photoreactor was increased to 0.20 bars above atmospheric pressure, then the inlet valve was closed and batch experiment was started by turning on the lamp.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2 , flow rates of gasses were regulated at a rate of 20, 20 and 60 mL/min for CO 2 , H 2 and He, respectively.Similarly, during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O/H 2 reductant, CO 2 saturated with H 2 O was mixed with H 2 in a gas mixture before feeding to the reactor. The products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890 N, USA) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionized detector (FID).Furthermore, FID detector was connected with a HP-PLOT Q capillary column (Agilent, length 30 m, ID 0.53 mm, film 40 lm) for separation of C 1 -C 6 paraffin and olefins hydrocarbons, alcohols and oxygenated compounds.The TCD detector was connected to UCW982, DC-200, Porapak Q and Mol Sieve 13X columns.C 1 -C 2 , C 3 -C 5 compounds and light gasses (H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO) were separated using Porapak Q, DC-200 and MS-13X column, respectively.The quantification of the products was based on the external standard and the use of a calibration curve."}, {"llm generation": "1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst", "source": "The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 samples with different metal loading levels.The contents of rutile were not detected, suggesting that pure anatase and crystalline phase TiO 2 was produced at 500 C.The XRD patterns of the Ni and In modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of pure TiO 2 .However, the signals corresponding to Ni and In in metal or oxides states were not observed even in the samples with 2 Ni and 5 In contents.This was possibly due to the lower metals amounts, which were below the detection limit of XRD or the species were highly dispersed inside TiO 2 structure.However, the existence of Ni and In was confirmed by FESEM and XPS analysis.Compared to TiO 2 , the peaks of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 became broader suggesting smaller TiO 2 crystal size.The average crystalline sizes of the samples were gradually reduced in Ni and In loaded TiO 2 samples as listed in Table 1. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "2 NiO/TiO 2", "source": "It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 samples with different metal loading levels.The contents of rutile were not detected, suggesting that pure anatase and crystalline phase TiO 2 was produced at 500 C.The XRD patterns of the Ni and In modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of pure TiO 2 .However, the signals corresponding to Ni and In in metal or oxides states were not observed even in the samples with 2 Ni and 5 In contents.This was possibly due to the lower metals amounts, which were below the detection limit of XRD or the species were highly dispersed inside TiO 2 structure.However, the existence of Ni and In was confirmed by FESEM and XPS analysis.Compared to TiO 2 , the peaks of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 became broader suggesting smaller TiO 2 crystal size.The average crystalline sizes of the samples were gradually reduced in Ni and In loaded TiO 2 samples as listed in Table 1.

It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2 based photocatalysts", "source": "Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 samples with different metal loading levels.The contents of rutile were not detected, suggesting that pure anatase and crystalline phase TiO 2 was produced at 500 C.The XRD patterns of the Ni and In modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of pure TiO 2 .However, the signals corresponding to Ni and In in metal or oxides states were not observed even in the samples with 2 Ni and 5 In contents.This was possibly due to the lower metals amounts, which were below the detection limit of XRD or the species were highly dispersed inside TiO 2 structure.However, the existence of Ni and In was confirmed by FESEM and XPS analysis.Compared to TiO 2 , the peaks of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 became broader suggesting smaller TiO 2 crystal size.The average crystalline sizes of the samples were gradually reduced in Ni and In loaded TiO 2 samples as listed in Table 1. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2", "source": "CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 samples with different metal loading levels.The contents of rutile were not detected, suggesting that pure anatase and crystalline phase TiO 2 was produced at 500 C.The XRD patterns of the Ni and In modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of pure TiO 2 .However, the signals corresponding to Ni and In in metal or oxides states were not observed even in the samples with 2 Ni and 5 In contents.This was possibly due to the lower metals amounts, which were below the detection limit of XRD or the species were highly dispersed inside TiO 2 structure.However, the existence of Ni and In was confirmed by FESEM and XPS analysis.Compared to TiO 2 , the peaks of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 became broader suggesting smaller TiO 2 crystal size.The average crystalline sizes of the samples were gradually reduced in Ni and In loaded TiO 2 samples as listed in Table 1. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "I/TiO 2", "source": "Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 samples with different metal loading levels.The contents of rutile were not detected, suggesting that pure anatase and crystalline phase TiO 2 was produced at 500 C.The XRD patterns of the Ni and In modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of pure TiO 2 .However, the signals corresponding to Ni and In in metal or oxides states were not observed even in the samples with 2 Ni and 5 In contents.This was possibly due to the lower metals amounts, which were below the detection limit of XRD or the species were highly dispersed inside TiO 2 structure.However, the existence of Ni and In was confirmed by FESEM and XPS analysis.Compared to TiO 2 , the peaks of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 became broader suggesting smaller TiO 2 crystal size.The average crystalline sizes of the samples were gradually reduced in Ni and In loaded TiO 2 samples as listed in Table 1. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "Cu-I/TiO 2", "source": "Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 samples with different metal loading levels.The contents of rutile were not detected, suggesting that pure anatase and crystalline phase TiO 2 was produced at 500 C.The XRD patterns of the Ni and In modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of pure TiO 2 .However, the signals corresponding to Ni and In in metal or oxides states were not observed even in the samples with 2 Ni and 5 In contents.This was possibly due to the lower metals amounts, which were below the detection limit of XRD or the species were highly dispersed inside TiO 2 structure.However, the existence of Ni and In was confirmed by FESEM and XPS analysis.Compared to TiO 2 , the peaks of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 became broader suggesting smaller TiO 2 crystal size.The average crystalline sizes of the samples were gradually reduced in Ni and In loaded TiO 2 samples as listed in Table 1. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "MgO/TNTs", "source": "Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 samples with different metal loading levels.The contents of rutile were not detected, suggesting that pure anatase and crystalline phase TiO 2 was produced at 500 C.The XRD patterns of the Ni and In modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of pure TiO 2 .However, the signals corresponding to Ni and In in metal or oxides states were not observed even in the samples with 2 Ni and 5 In contents.This was possibly due to the lower metals amounts, which were below the detection limit of XRD or the species were highly dispersed inside TiO 2 structure.However, the existence of Ni and In was confirmed by FESEM and XPS analysis.Compared to TiO 2 , the peaks of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 became broader suggesting smaller TiO 2 crystal size.The average crystalline sizes of the samples were gradually reduced in Ni and In loaded TiO 2 samples as listed in Table 1. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "rGO-Pt/TNTs", "source": "Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 samples with different metal loading levels.The contents of rutile were not detected, suggesting that pure anatase and crystalline phase TiO 2 was produced at 500 C.The XRD patterns of the Ni and In modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of pure TiO 2 .However, the signals corresponding to Ni and In in metal or oxides states were not observed even in the samples with 2 Ni and 5 In contents.This was possibly due to the lower metals amounts, which were below the detection limit of XRD or the species were highly dispersed inside TiO 2 structure.However, the existence of Ni and In was confirmed by FESEM and XPS analysis.Compared to TiO 2 , the peaks of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 became broader suggesting smaller TiO 2 crystal size.The average crystalline sizes of the samples were gradually reduced in Ni and In loaded TiO 2 samples as listed in Table 1. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles", "source": "Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 samples with different metal loading levels.The contents of rutile were not detected, suggesting that pure anatase and crystalline phase TiO 2 was produced at 500 C.The XRD patterns of the Ni and In modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of pure TiO 2 .However, the signals corresponding to Ni and In in metal or oxides states were not observed even in the samples with 2 Ni and 5 In contents.This was possibly due to the lower metals amounts, which were below the detection limit of XRD or the species were highly dispersed inside TiO 2 structure.However, the existence of Ni and In was confirmed by FESEM and XPS analysis.Compared to TiO 2 , the peaks of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 became broader suggesting smaller TiO 2 crystal size.The average crystalline sizes of the samples were gradually reduced in Ni and In loaded TiO 2 samples as listed in Table 1. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2", "source": "Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 samples with different metal loading levels.The contents of rutile were not detected, suggesting that pure anatase and crystalline phase TiO 2 was produced at 500 C.The XRD patterns of the Ni and In modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of pure TiO 2 .However, the signals corresponding to Ni and In in metal or oxides states were not observed even in the samples with 2 Ni and 5 In contents.This was possibly due to the lower metals amounts, which were below the detection limit of XRD or the species were highly dispersed inside TiO 2 structure.However, the existence of Ni and In was confirmed by FESEM and XPS analysis.Compared to TiO 2 , the peaks of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 became broader suggesting smaller TiO 2 crystal size.The average crystalline sizes of the samples were gradually reduced in Ni and In loaded TiO 2 samples as listed in Table 1. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "NiO and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 nanocatalysts", "source": "The NiO and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 nanocatalysts were prepared and tested for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O and/H 2 reductant.", "context": "The NiO and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 nanocatalysts were prepared and tested for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O and/H 2 reductant.The deeper insight on the reactivity and selectivity was obtained using different metals and reductant.The prepared NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 photocatalysts showed enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The formation of the nanostructure was favorable for the separation of the photo-generated charges.The porous structure of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 effectively provides reacting sites for transforming electrons to the reactants and prevents electron-hole recombination.Using H 2 O reductant, the photoactivity of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was the highest for CH 4 production, which exceeded 2 fold than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 6.5 times than the pure TiO 2 .The enhanced photoactivity was evidently due to hindered charges recombination rate and their efficient transfer toward Ni and In metal.On the other hand, with H 2 reductant, CO was detected as the major product with appreciable amount of CH 4 .The total amount of products (CO, CH 4 ) over the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst using H 2 reductant was 1.5 times more than using H 2 O under the same operating conditions.The fundamentals derived from these experiments are useful in the design of co-catalysts and selection of reductant for production of selective fuels.

Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "500 W Hg lamp", "source": "The light source used to activate photocatalyst was a 500 W Hg lamp located inside the quartz cold trap, having maximum irradiation intensity at 365 nm with light intensity 25 mW/cm 2 .", "context": "Modified TiO 2 nanocatalysts were prepared through a sol-gel method according to our previous work 24.All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification.In a typical synthesis, titanium sol was prepared by hydrolyzing aqueous solution of 10 mL tetra-isopropylorthotitanate and 30 mL isopropanol with acetic acid (I M) under vigorous stirring, kept stirring for 12 h at room temperature to get a clear titanium sol.Nickel and indium metals were loaded into the titanium sol using a specified amount of In (NO 3 ) 3 AH 2 O and Ni (NO 3 ) 2 A3H 2 O and aged for another 6 h to get a thick titanium sol.Finally, samples in the oven at 80 C were dried and then calcined in a furnace at a rate of 5 C min A1 up to 500 C for 5 h.TiO 2 with different In and Ni loading levels were prepared by varying the quantity of In (NO 3 ) 3 AH 2 O and Ni (NO 3 ) 2 A3H 2 O. Pure TiO 2 nanoparticles were prepared using the same procedure without metal loading. The crystal structure of the powder samples was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) (Bruker D8 advance diffractometer) using Cu Ka radiation (k 0.154178 nm) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA.The XRD patterns were obtained with a scan rate of 1.2min A1 and scanning range of 10-70of 2h.The morphology of the samples was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi SU8020).The particle size and lattice structure of the individual crystals were visualized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) with FEI-Tecni G2 TEM.The chemical composition was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra DLD Shimadzu).The XPS spectrum was calibrated with respect to the binding energy of the C1s signal at 284.60 eV as the internal standard.The specific surface area of the samples was measured by N 2 adsorption-desorption at 77 K using a surface area and porosity analyzer (Micrometrics ASAP 2020).The infrared spectra were measured at room temperature with a resolution of 4 cm A1 in the IR range 4000-400 cm A1 with Spectrum 2000 Explorer Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectrometer.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra were measured using UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 100) equipped with an integrated sphere in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm.Raman and photoluminescence measurements of the powder samples were acquired at room temperature using Raman Spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution, HORIBA) with a 532 nm emitting laser as an excitation source. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was H 2 O and/H 2 reductant in the gas phase was investigated in a batch photoreactor system of total volume 108 cm 3 as shown in Fig. 1.The light source used to activate photocatalyst was a 500 W Hg lamp located inside the quartz cold trap, having maximum irradiation intensity at 365 nm with light intensity 25 mW/cm 2 .Quartz glass window of 10 mm thickness was fixed at the top of the reactor, enabling efficient transfer of the irradiation form lamp to the catalyst surface.The lamp was ignited using high voltage power supply connected to a lamp through an igniter and a stabilizer.The reactor was covered with aluminum foil to ensure all the lights participated in the reaction came through the quartz window only.0.25 g of powder photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed at the bottom of the reactor to ensure light is powerfully distributed over the entire catalyst surface. The reactor, checked for leakage at 2 bar pressure for several hours, was purged by helium (He) gas.The compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller (MFC) was flowing through the water bubbler at 20 mL/min to carry moisture.The CO 2 saturated with H 2 O was mixed with a He flowing at a rate of 80 mL/min in a gas mixture to dilute CO 2 concentration.The mixture of gases (CO 2 , He, H 2 O) was passed through reactor for 30 min to purge and saturate the catalyst.Thereafter, outlet valve was closed and pressure inside the photoreactor was increased to 0.20 bars above atmospheric pressure, then the inlet valve was closed and batch experiment was started by turning on the lamp.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2 , flow rates of gasses were regulated at a rate of 20, 20 and 60 mL/min for CO 2 , H 2 and He, respectively.Similarly, during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O/H 2 reductant, CO 2 saturated with H 2 O was mixed with H 2 in a gas mixture before feeding to the reactor. The products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890 N, USA) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionized detector (FID).Furthermore, FID detector was connected with a HP-PLOT Q capillary column (Agilent, length 30 m, ID 0.53 mm, film 40 lm) for separation of C 1 -C 6 paraffin and olefins hydrocarbons, alcohols and oxygenated compounds.The TCD detector was connected to UCW982, DC-200, Porapak Q and Mol Sieve 13X columns.C 1 -C 2 , C 3 -C 5 compounds and light gasses (H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO) were separated using Porapak Q, DC-200 and MS-13X column, respectively.The quantification of the products was based on the external standard and the use of a calibration curve."}, {"llm generation": "UV-light", "source": "The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 samples with different metal loading levels.The contents of rutile were not detected, suggesting that pure anatase and crystalline phase TiO 2 was produced at 500 C.The XRD patterns of the Ni and In modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of pure TiO 2 .However, the signals corresponding to Ni and In in metal or oxides states were not observed even in the samples with 2 Ni and 5 In contents.This was possibly due to the lower metals amounts, which were below the detection limit of XRD or the species were highly dispersed inside TiO 2 structure.However, the existence of Ni and In was confirmed by FESEM and XPS analysis.Compared to TiO 2 , the peaks of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 became broader suggesting smaller TiO 2 crystal size.The average crystalline sizes of the samples were gradually reduced in Ni and In loaded TiO 2 samples as listed in Table 1. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "UV-light", "source": "Fig. 10.Effect of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for CH 4 , CO and C 2 H 6 production of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors at various Ni-loading and irradiation times under UV-light irradiations: (a) CH 4 evolution, (b) CO evolution and (c) C 2 H 6 production.", "context": "The NiO and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 nanocatalysts were prepared and tested for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O and/H 2 reductant.The deeper insight on the reactivity and selectivity was obtained using different metals and reductant.The prepared NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 photocatalysts showed enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The formation of the nanostructure was favorable for the separation of the photo-generated charges.The porous structure of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 effectively provides reacting sites for transforming electrons to the reactants and prevents electron-hole recombination.Using H 2 O reductant, the photoactivity of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was the highest for CH 4 production, which exceeded 2 fold than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 6.5 times than the pure TiO 2 .The enhanced photoactivity was evidently due to hindered charges recombination rate and their efficient transfer toward Ni and In metal.On the other hand, with H 2 reductant, CO was detected as the major product with appreciable amount of CH 4 .The total amount of products (CO, CH 4 ) over the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst using H 2 reductant was 1.5 times more than using H 2 O under the same operating conditions.The fundamentals derived from these experiments are useful in the design of co-catalysts and selection of reductant for production of selective fuels.

Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 samples with different metal loading levels.The contents of rutile were not detected, suggesting that pure anatase and crystalline phase TiO 2 was produced at 500 C.The XRD patterns of the Ni and In modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of pure TiO 2 .However, the signals corresponding to Ni and In in metal or oxides states were not observed even in the samples with 2 Ni and 5 In contents.This was possibly due to the lower metals amounts, which were below the detection limit of XRD or the species were highly dispersed inside TiO 2 structure.However, the existence of Ni and In was confirmed by FESEM and XPS analysis.Compared to TiO 2 , the peaks of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 became broader suggesting smaller TiO 2 crystal size.The average crystalline sizes of the samples were gradually reduced in Ni and In loaded TiO 2 samples as listed in Table 1. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Fig. 10.Effect of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for CH 4 , CO and C 2 H 6 production of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors at various Ni-loading and irradiation times under UV-light irradiations: (a) CH 4 evolution, (b) CO evolution and (c) C 2 H 6 production.", "context": "The NiO and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 nanocatalysts were prepared and tested for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O and/H 2 reductant.The deeper insight on the reactivity and selectivity was obtained using different metals and reductant.The prepared NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 photocatalysts showed enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The formation of the nanostructure was favorable for the separation of the photo-generated charges.The porous structure of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 effectively provides reacting sites for transforming electrons to the reactants and prevents electron-hole recombination.Using H 2 O reductant, the photoactivity of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was the highest for CH 4 production, which exceeded 2 fold than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 6.5 times than the pure TiO 2 .The enhanced photoactivity was evidently due to hindered charges recombination rate and their efficient transfer toward Ni and In metal.On the other hand, with H 2 reductant, CO was detected as the major product with appreciable amount of CH 4 .The total amount of products (CO, CH 4 ) over the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst using H 2 reductant was 1.5 times more than using H 2 O under the same operating conditions.The fundamentals derived from these experiments are useful in the design of co-catalysts and selection of reductant for production of selective fuels.

The reactor, checked for leakage at 2 bar pressure for several hours, was purged by helium (He) gas.The compressed CO 2 (99.99) regulated by a mass flow controller (MFC) was flowing through the water bubbler at 20 mL/min to carry moisture.The CO 2 saturated with H 2 O was mixed with a He flowing at a rate of 80 mL/min in a gas mixture to dilute CO 2 concentration.The mixture of gases (CO 2 , He, H 2 O) was passed through reactor for 30 min to purge and saturate the catalyst.Thereafter, outlet valve was closed and pressure inside the photoreactor was increased to 0.20 bars above atmospheric pressure, then the inlet valve was closed and batch experiment was started by turning on the lamp.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2 , flow rates of gasses were regulated at a rate of 20, 20 and 60 mL/min for CO 2 , H 2 and He, respectively.Similarly, during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O/H 2 reductant, CO 2 saturated with H 2 O was mixed with H 2 in a gas mixture before feeding to the reactor.

Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the structural properties of TiO 2 and shifts of Raman bands associated with the particle size.Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of TiO 2 , In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.In the case of pure TiO 2 , several characteristics bands at 142, 197, 394, 513, and 634 cm A1 correspond to the E g( 1) , E g(2) , B 1g , A 1g , and E g(3) modes are attributed to anatase phase of TiO 2 25.From the Raman spectra, it is evident that both pure and metal-loaded TiO 2 are in the anatase phase.There appeared no impurity related modes in the Raman spectra of doped samples, in good agreement with The morphology and structure of 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst was further analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM).Fig. 4(a) revealed that this material consists of spherical a Crystal size calculated using Scherrer equation based on 1 0 1 peak of TiO 2 . b Band gap energy calculated using Tauc equation, from a plot of (ahv) 2 versus photon energy (hv).1.The energy band gap of pure TiO 2 (3.12 eV) shifted toward longer wavelength with In 2 O 3 loading TiO 2 samples.This increase in the energy band gap was attributed to the higher In 2 O 3 band gap energy 11.The band gaps of NiO-In 2 O 3 co-loaded TiO 2 samples were 3.06 and 3.04 for 1 and 2 wt.NiO-contents, respectively.Evidently, there was a gradual decrease in the TiO 2 band gap energy with NiO-loading.Fig. 8(b) shows PL emission spectra of the samples.The spectra of all the samples are similar and show broad peaks in the range of 530-560 nm when excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.When compared with the band gap of TiO 2 , the broad symmetric peaks appeared at around 536 nm confirmed that emission is not rising due to TiO 2 band edge excitation 20.Therefore, PL signals attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.The PL intensity is enfeebled in In 2 O 3 sample and further reduced in NiO/TiO 2 and NiO-and In 2 O 3 promoted TiO 2 samples.The gradual decrease of PL intensity suggests that photo-generated electrons/holes (e A /h ) are separated efficiently 18.This established that Ni and In have improved the mobility of charges with suppressed recombination rates. Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}, {"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 samples with different metal loading levels.The contents of rutile were not detected, suggesting that pure anatase and crystalline phase TiO 2 was produced at 500 C.The XRD patterns of the Ni and In modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of pure TiO 2 .However, the signals corresponding to Ni and In in metal or oxides states were not observed even in the samples with 2 Ni and 5 In contents.This was possibly due to the lower metals amounts, which were below the detection limit of XRD or the species were highly dispersed inside TiO 2 structure.However, the existence of Ni and In was confirmed by FESEM and XPS analysis.Compared to TiO 2 , the peaks of In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 became broader suggesting smaller TiO 2 crystal size.The average crystalline sizes of the samples were gradually reduced in Ni and In loaded TiO 2 samples as listed in Table 1.

Two blank tests were performed; one for irradiation without any catalyst and other in the presence of a catalyst without light irradiation.The carbon containing products was not detected without irradiation or photocatalyst.This confirmed that photocatalysts were cleaned and carbon containing products (CH 4 , CO) were produced during CO 2 reduction only. The effect of In-loading (wt.) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O in CO and CH 4 production is presented in Fig. 9 11.Fig. 9(b) presents the effect of different amounts of NiO-loading (1-3 NiO) on the TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation using H 2 O as a reductant.In all the cases, CH 4 was detected as the main product with a smaller amount of CO.The TiO 2 photoactivity for CO 2 methanation was reached to maximum by loading 2 NiO, then gradually decreased at higher NiO-loading.It is evident that NiO is more efficient than In 2 O 3 for CO 2 reduction and maximum CH 4 production over 2 NiO/TiO 2 observed was 307 lmole gcatal.A1 after 2 h of irradiation time.The yield of CH 4 over NiO/ TiO 2 was 1.23 fold higher than In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and 3.4 fold the amount produced over the pure TiO 2 .The reduced in TiO 2 photoactivity at NiO-loading above 2 was probably due to the recombination centers over the TiO 2 surface.Previously, we have reported the similar observations during CO 2 reduction with H 2 in a monolith photoreactor with CO as the main product 29. It is evident from the above discussion that NiO is the most efficient to enhance TiO 2 photoactivity for selective CO 2 methanation.Efficient adsorption and desorption process over Ni active sites has attributed to the improved photoactivity.This can be explained based on thermodynamics, as the electrons would be trapped efficiently, if the reduction potential of metal is more positive than the semiconductor (e.g.TiO 2 ) conductance band 21.As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Fig. 10 shows the efficiency of NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 O reductant at different irradiation times (0-8 h).Using all types of photocatalysts, CH 4 and CO were detected as the major CO 2 reduction products with smaller amount of ethane (C 2 H 6 ).Fig. 10(a) shows production of CH 4 versus irradiation time over pure TiO 2 and NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.For the pure TiO 2 , lower CH 4 production was detected over the entire irradiation time due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.However, loading In 2 O 3 into TiO 2 effectively promotes CO 2 methanation reaction and continuous CH 4 production detected even after 8 h of irradiation time.However, NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysts found very efficient for CO 2 methanation and rate of CH 4 formation was faster with the increase of NiO-loading. The optimal amount of NiO-loading was determined to be 1 wt.NiO in 3 wt.In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst that exhibited the maximum photocatalytic activity.In NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst, CH 4 production activity was obviously enhanced compared to In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 over the entire irradiation time.This has confirmed higher photoactivity and stability of this catalyst for the selective CO 2 methanation reaction.The excess NiO-loading may develop charge recombination centers and/or shielded TiO 2 surface active sites 17.The highest CH 4 yield rate observed for the NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 sample was 1920 lmole g A1 , 2 folds more than the amount produced over In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and increased 6.5 times more than the pure TiO 2 .This implied that the NiO-promoted In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalysts had a much lower recombination rate of charges (e A /h ), attributed to the excited carriers transfer, resulting in enhanced CH 4 production.Evidently, the photocatalytic behavior of all the catalysts over the irradiation time is similar to CH 4 production.However, CH 4 formation was 4-folds higher than the amount of CO produced over NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 under the same operating conditions.It could be seen that surface area and crystal sizes are almost the same in In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 samples.However, the photoactivity of single ion and co-doped ions are entirely different in both CO and CH 4 production.Therefore, it is postulated that suppressed recombination rate, in the presence of Ni and In co-metal ions, has contributed effectually to the enhancement of CO 2 reduction efficiency.The yield of C 2 H 6 production in gas phase over the irradiation time under UV-light irradiation can be observed in Fig. 10 (c).Over TiO 2 , smaller amount of C 2 H 6 was produced and gradually increased using 3 wt.In 2 O 3 and 0.5 Ni-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 3 catalysts.The amount of C 2 H 6 production was continuous over the entire irradiation time, which confirmed prolonged photoactivity and stability of these catalysts.The other products detected in smaller amounts over Ni-In loaded TiO 2 catalysts were ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), propylene (C 3 H 6 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ).Similar observations were reported previously 11.In addition to NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 catalysts, understanding the effects of reductants (H 2 , H 2 O) on CO 2 reduction efficiency is essential.The effects of H 2 O and H 2 reductants on the amounts of CO and CH 4 formation during CO 2 reduction over 1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 / TiO 2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 11.By replacing reductant H 2 O with H 2 , the selectivity was shifted from CH 4 to CO, where, the production of CO was significantly increased.It is apparent from the results that reducing agent has contributed significantly to enhance CO 2 reduction process and product selectivity.In the case of H 2 , CO production was prominent over the entire irradiation time.Alternatively, by using H 2 /H 2 O reductants simultaneously, performance of NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 catalyst for CH 4 production was entirely different.In the beginning, CH 4 yield rate was noticeable, but gradually deteriorated, whereas, the amount of CO produced was more than the yield of CH 4 after 6 h of reaction time.Firstly, there was more H 2 O adsorbed over the catalyst which has favored larger CH 4 production, but gradually decreased, probably, more H 2 adsorption over the time. The higher CO 2 reduction efficiency in the presence of H 2 could be explained based on the adsorption-desorption competitions between the reactants.Generally, since the interfacial contact rates between water vapors and catalyst surface are less formidable than H 2 and the catalyst surface 22.Therefore, the lower yield rate using H 2 O vapors could be due to less competition between CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 .Besides, H 2 O is not efficient reductant for CO 2 reduction because of their reduction potential difference.Therefore, H 2 is more favorable as a reductant for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO, but a higher CH 4 selectivity could be achieved using H 2 O reductant. Recently, it has been reported that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO and then transformed to CH 4 over TiO 2 based photocatalysts 22,30.Therefore, using H 2 O as a reductant, it can be acted as an electron donor and CO was finally converted to CH 4 .In the presence of H 2 , number of photogenerated electrons used in CO 2 reduction and H were similar to that of photogenerated holes consumed by H 2 oxidation, resulting in selective CO production 31.On the other hand, it was probably due to the reduction potential difference of reductants and products as discussed in Section 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by H 2 to the selective CO formation could be further explained based on reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.Previously, we have investigated photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO over different co-loaded TiO 2 nanocatalysts in a batch and continuous mode of monolith photoreactor 21,32,33.Therefore, it can be established that CO would be a major CO 2 reduction product via RWGS reaction using a cell type or a monolith photoreactor operated in a batch or continuous mode of operation. The yield rates comparison of the products during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using H 2 O, H 2 O H 2 and H 2 reductant over different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 12 and the results are summarized in Table 2.It could be seen that type of reductant exhibits a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of catalyst and selectivity of products.The CH 4 production rate was lower over the pure TiO 2 but significantly increased using NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.In particular, with the same photocatalyst (1 NiO-3 In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ), different amounts of CH 4 yield rate and selectivity were achieved with different reductant.Using H 2 O reductant, maximum CH 4 yield rate achieved was 240 lmole g A1 h A1 and selectivity 80.This amount of CH 4 production was 1.45 fold higher than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.15 folds more than using H 2 reductant.However, CO was the major product using H 2 reductant and maximum yield rate detected was 243 lmole g A1 h A1 with selectivity 53.The total production rate (CO 2 CH 4 ) of 451 lmole g A1 h A1 was achieved using H 2 reductant, a 1.28 fold more than using H 2 H 2 O reductant and 1.5 times larger than using H 2 O reductant.Therefore, H 2 is the more efficient reductant for CO 2 conversion to both CO and CH 4 over NiO and In 2 O 3 based TiO 2 co-catalysts.Yet, the higher selectivity for CH 4 production could be achieved using H 2 O as a reductant. In order to investigate the performance of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O and or H 2 reductants over NiO and In 2 O 3 loaded TiO 2 photocatalysts the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield of 14.73 lmole after 12 h irradiation time 34.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 lmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 35.Similarly, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CH 4 over different photocatalysts such as CH 4 yield of 100.22 ppm cm A2 h A1 over MgO/TNTs 36, rGO-Pt/TNTs with CH 4 yield rate of 10.96 lmole m A2 37, CH 4 yield rate of 23.10 lmole g-catal.A1 after 480 min over 3-D Au/TiO 2 nanoparticles 38 and a CH 4 production of 184 lmole g-catal.A1 after 24 h over Zn-Cu promoted TiO 2 has been reported 30.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed higher performance of TiO 2 catalysts loaded with Ni and In metals for selective CO and CH 4 production using H 2 O and/or H 2 reductants in the same type of photoreactor system. In photocatalysis process, when photons strike over the photocatalyst surface, then the electron (e A )-holes (h ) pairs are produced.Due to the short lifetime, they can recombine immediately or can be trapped by the doped metal to participate in oxidation and reduction process.The reactions in Eqs. ( 1)-( 10) may express the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 . Eqs. ( 1)-(3) reveal photo-excited electron-hole pair production and their trapping by Ni and In-metals, thus increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.The holes are used for oxidation of H 2 O and/H 2 as explained in Eqs. ( 4)-( 6).CO 2 reduction by electrons is illustrated in Eq. (7).Reactions in Eqs. ( 8)-( 10) divulged production of CO and CH 4 through utilization of H ions and electrons (e A ).Therefore, it could be seen, that CO 2 was firstly converted to CO by reduction reaction, whereas CO should pass through various steps to be ultimately converted to CH 4 .The some of the formed CO when desorb from the surface, will no longer be contributing to CH 4 formation. As the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the band structure of photocatalysts as well as the redox potential, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for NiO-In 2 O 3 /TiO 2 can be explained by the scheme presented in Fig. 13.Under the light irradiations, VB electrons of TiO 2 excited to CB creating holes in VB.Without In 2 O 3 or NiO metals, these charges recombine back and only a fraction of electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation process, thus, TiO 2 shows a quite low photocatalytic activity.When In 2 O 3 or NiO metals were loaded on TiO 2 surface, CB electron of TiO 2 can transfer to these metals which cause electron-hole pair separation.Furthermore, more electrons could be trapped if the metal reduction potential is more positive than the CB of TiO 2 .As the redox values of both NiO and In 2 O 3 are lower than the CB of TiO 2 (A0.50 V), thus electron can effectively be transferred toward these metals to prolong their lifetime 17.Moreover, as the potential of Ni 2 /Ni (A0.23 V) is lower than the In 3 /In (A0.33 V), thus more electrons would be transferred toward NiO which could result in higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than In 2 O 3 .The production of CH 4 as the main product over both types of catalysts could be explained based on TiO 2 conductance band potential.Since the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) is less than the conductance band of TiO 2 (A0.5 V), the reaction was more favorable to generate methane efficiently.In the case of CO 2 reduction with H 2, CO was produced in significant amount.As the potential difference of H 2 /H (0 V) and CO (A0.48 V) are more appropriate compared to CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V), resulting CO as the main product.On the other hand, a potential difference of H 2 O/H OH (2.32 V) and CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V) were favorable for CH 4 production.Therefore, both reductant and type of metals are relatively important to in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications."}]}}
