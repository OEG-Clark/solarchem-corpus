Figure S1 (Supplementary material) shows the surface morphology of P25, C-TiO 2 , and 3 Cu/C-TiO 2 photocatalysts.The uniform dispersion of the copper clusters on the surface of 3 Cu/C-TiO 2 is clearly noted.The elemental compositions of the three photocatalysts determined through EDS analysis are presented in Table 1.The EDS analysis confirmed the presence of carbon and copper in Cu/C-TiO 2 nanoparticles (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary material).Notably, neither C nor Cu was observed in P25. The optical bandgap energy (E g ) values for all samples were measured by using the Tauc plot (Kubelka 1948;Tauc et al. 1966), according to the following relationship: where is the material absorptivity coefficient ( (1 -R) 2 ), h is Planck's constant, is the vibration frequency, A is the optical constant, n is 1/2 or 2 for direct or indirect bandgap semiconductor, and R is the diffused reflectance.As shown in Fig. 2, the calculated bandgap energies were found to be 3.09, 1.85, 1.82, 1.89, 1.78, 1.76, and 1.72 eV for P25, C-doped TiO 2 and 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 7 wt Cu-C-co-doped TiO 2 samples, respectively.Obviously, there was a remarkable decrease in the bandgap energy with C doping from 3.09 to 1.85 eV, followed by a further gradual decrease with co-doping by Cu.The sharp decline in the E g values by C doping can be ascribed to the mixing of 2p states of O and C as a result of the lower number of electrons in the valence shell of C than that of O; therefore, 2p of C functioned as an acceptor state (Nakano et al. 2005).Furthermore, as a result of the strong interaction which arises between Cu ions and TiO 2 , the Cu ion implantation into TiO 2 improved its electronic properties (Anpo et al. 1997). In order to investigate the surface properties of the photocatalysts, FTIR analysis was conducted in the range of 400-4000 cm -1 (Fig. 3).As can be seen for both catalysts, the low FT-IR frequencies at 400-900 cm -1 are assigned to Ti-O-Ti bridge stretching modes and Ti-O bond (Zhang et al. 2015;Dolat et al. 2012).The peak observed at 1640 cm -1 corresponds to the vibrations of OH bonds of surface-adsorbed water molecules on the surfaces of the catalyst (Abbasizadeh et al. 2013;Randorn et al. 2004).The broad band at 3000-3500 cm -1 matches the surface hydroxyl stretching (Zhang et al. 2014).The hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst surface can effectively enhance its photocatalytic activity by suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs through the interaction with photo-generated holes (Yu et al. 2007;Du et al. 2008;Ao et al. 2009).Notably, a new carbon band at around 2810 cm -1 was observed for both C-TiO 2 and Cu/C-TiO 2 due to C-H stretching, evidencing the incorporation of carbon into the structural lattice of both catalysts. The chemical states of the component elements of the 3.0 Cu/C-TiO 2 catalyst analyzed by XPS are shown in Fig. 4. The XPS survey spectrum indicates the presence of Ti, O, C, and Cu species (Fig. 4a).The Ti 2p spectrum in Fig. 4b indicates four XPS peaks at about 457.2 eV (2p 3/2 ) and 458.8 eV (2p 3/2 ), which can be attributed to Ti 4 oxidation state, and the other two peaks located at about 462.1 eV (2p 1/2 ) and 464.1 eV (2p 1/2 ) are consistent with the Ti 3 state (Tao et al. 2012), with mass of 8.9 and 14.7 for Ti 3 and Ti 4 , respectively.Figure 4c shows O 1s XPS spectrum, which consists of four peaks 527.8, 530.1, 532.1, and 534.1 eV, corresponding to oxygen in the TiO 2 lattice (Ti-O, Ti-O-Ti) and OH -, resulting mainly from the chemisorbed H 2 O or the free hydroxyl group (O-H) on the surface (Zhang et al. 2014;Trevisan et al. 2014;El-Sheikh et al. 2014).The C 1s XPS spectrum exhibits four peaks at 283.3, 285.2, 286.9, and 288.8 eV (Fig. 4d).These peaks can be assigned to C-Cu, C-C, C-O/CO, and O-CO, respectively (Zhang et al. 2014;Trevisan et al. 2014;Lei et al. 2015;Etacheri et al. 2013).The XPS spectrum of Cu 2p is given in Fig. 4e.The binding energy of the Cu 2p 3/2 peak is 933.1 and 935.9 eV, suggesting that the chemical state of copper is Cu 2 (Guo et al. 2011;Wang et al. 2007).enhance the yield of CH 3 OH due to the elevation of the number of active sites on the catalyst surface (Yamashita et al. 1994;Adachi et al. 1994;Mizuno et al. 1996).However, no further improvement of the CH 3 OH production beyond the 3 wt of Cu loading is due to shielding by it the absorption of light by photocatalyst TiO 2 (Slamet et al. 2009;Nasution et al. 2005;Wu et al. 2009).Consequently, the yield of CH 3 OH decreased with the increase of Cu loading beyond 3 wt. The reduction of CO 2 and the formation of CH 3 OH at various catalyst dosages are shown in Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b, respectively.It has been quite familiar that photocatalytic reactions take place on the TiO 2 surface active site.So, the dosage of TiO 2 plays a key role, which needs to be optimized.As clearly noted, the concentration of CH 3 OH is going up with the increasing dosage of catalyst, then started to decline when the catalyst concentration exceeds the value of 1.0 g l -1 .The high dosage of TiO 2 leads the scattering of light due to the opacity of suspension from the reactor, which in turn reduces the photoactivity (Koci et al. 2009;Sasirekha et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2002).Further, the higher dosage may also facilitate surface agglomeration, which in turn lowers the surface active site and decreases the CH 3 OH yield (Yang et al. 2009).Subsequently, the net CH 3 OH yield goes down with the excess dosage of the catalyst.Therefore, under the current experimental conditions, the optimized concentration of TiO 2 can be revealed to be 1.0 g l -1 . In order to assess the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and the production of CH 3 OH, the conversion process was carried out by using P25-TiO 2 , C-TiO 2 , and the optimum Cu loading of 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 in natural seawater under the UV light (Fig. 7).The observed results clearly show the advantage of Cu doping.The maximum methanol yield rate of 577 mol g-cat -1 h -1 was observed for 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 , which is 5.3-fold higher than the production rate over the C-TiO 2 and 7.4 times the amount produced using Degussa P25 TiO 2 .When C-TiO 2 is modified by using 3 wt Cu, the formation of CH 3 OH under UV light is dramatically upward compared to C-TiO 2 , which is mainly due to the electron-capturing capacity of Cu to resist the recombination of electron and hole pair as well as the ability of Cu to selectively convert CO 2 into CH 3 OH. The advantage of Cu is to trap the electron, which is excited from the valence band to the conduction band after the exposure of TiO 2 with the light source (Tseng et al. 2002).In fact, Cu 2 with lower redox potential is a promising dopant species, because the reduction of Cu 2 is thermodynamically attainable and the presence of unfilled 3d shell will attract electrons and can be caught by Cu-II on the surface of TiO 2 (Hirano et al. 1992;Chiang et al. 2002).The acceptance of electrons from the conduction band will facilitate the reduction of Cu 2 into Cu species.The absorbed electrons could be consumed through the decrease of H and/or O 2 that present in the formation radicals of H and/or O 2 , individually.This will lead the re-oxidation of Cu species back to Cu 2 .Subsequently, the electron-hole rate could be decreased.Furthermore, Cu species act as primary adsorption site of CO 2 for CH 3 OH union (Kakumoto 1995;Chiang et al. 2002). It is quite interesting that the results obtained from the current study for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and the production of CH 3 OH in seawater under illumination of UV light are higher than those we previously reported for pure water (Kavil et al. ).The reason for this is that bicarbonate and carbonate ions are perpetually liquidated into the seawater.The carbonate reacts with CO 2 to form bicarbonate, which leads to a further uptake of CO 2 and a decline of the CO 3 2-concentration in the ocean.In this case, the production of CH 3 OH is from the reduction of not only CO 2 but also all the carbonate species.So, the yield of CH 3 OH from seawater medium is much more than that of freshwater. It is important to investigate the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into CH 3 OH under actual natural sunlight.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and the corresponding CH 3 OH production at a various interval of time using P25-TiO 2 , C-TiO 2 , and 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 in seawater are shown in Fig. 8.The maximum rate of the photocatalytic production of CH 3 OH using 3.0 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 was found to be 188 mol g-cat -1 h -1 , which is 2.24 times higher than that of C-TiO 2 , whereas no CH 3 OH was observed for P25.Similar to UV results, the current CH 3 OH production yield in seawater under real sunlight is higher than that we previously reported for pure water (Kavil et al. 2017)."}, {"llm generation": "Cu/C-TiO 2 nanoparticles", "source": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and CH 3 OH yield were successfully achieved in seawater using Cu/C-TiO 2 nanoparticles under both UV and natural sunlight.", "context": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and CH 3 OH yield were successfully achieved in seawater using Cu/C-TiO 2 nanoparticles under both UV and natural sunlight.Under the current experimental condition, the optimum loading was achieved by the doping of C-TiO 2 by 3 wt of Cu.The highest CH 3 OH yield was obtained over 1 g l -1 of 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 .The experimental results revealed that the production of CH 3 OH using Cu/C-codoped-TiO 2 is much higher than that of P25 and C-TiO 2 , due to the effective trapping of the charge carriers and the inhibition of their recombination rate by Cu doping, as well as the bandgap narrowing, as a result of C doping.

Figure S1 (Supplementary material) shows the surface morphology of P25, C-TiO 2 , and 3 Cu/C-TiO 2 photocatalysts.The uniform dispersion of the copper clusters on the surface of 3 Cu/C-TiO 2 is clearly noted.The elemental compositions of the three photocatalysts determined through EDS analysis are presented in Table 1.The EDS analysis confirmed the presence of carbon and copper in Cu/C-TiO 2 nanoparticles (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary material).Notably, neither C nor Cu was observed in P25. The optical bandgap energy (E g ) values for all samples were measured by using the Tauc plot (Kubelka 1948;Tauc et al. 1966), according to the following relationship: where is the material absorptivity coefficient ( (1 -R) 2 ), h is Planck's constant, is the vibration frequency, A is the optical constant, n is 1/2 or 2 for direct or indirect bandgap semiconductor, and R is the diffused reflectance.As shown in Fig. 2, the calculated bandgap energies were found to be 3.09, 1.85, 1.82, 1.89, 1.78, 1.76, and 1.72 eV for P25, C-doped TiO 2 and 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 7 wt Cu-C-co-doped TiO 2 samples, respectively.Obviously, there was a remarkable decrease in the bandgap energy with C doping from 3.09 to 1.85 eV, followed by a further gradual decrease with co-doping by Cu.The sharp decline in the E g values by C doping can be ascribed to the mixing of 2p states of O and C as a result of the lower number of electrons in the valence shell of C than that of O; therefore, 2p of C functioned as an acceptor state (Nakano et al. 2005).Furthermore, as a result of the strong interaction which arises between Cu ions and TiO 2 , the Cu ion implantation into TiO 2 improved its electronic properties (Anpo et al. 1997). In order to investigate the surface properties of the photocatalysts, FTIR analysis was conducted in the range of 400-4000 cm -1 (Fig. 3).As can be seen for both catalysts, the low FT-IR frequencies at 400-900 cm -1 are assigned to Ti-O-Ti bridge stretching modes and Ti-O bond (Zhang et al. 2015;Dolat et al. 2012).The peak observed at 1640 cm -1 corresponds to the vibrations of OH bonds of surface-adsorbed water molecules on the surfaces of the catalyst (Abbasizadeh et al. 2013;Randorn et al. 2004).The broad band at 3000-3500 cm -1 matches the surface hydroxyl stretching (Zhang et al. 2014).The hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst surface can effectively enhance its photocatalytic activity by suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs through the interaction with photo-generated holes (Yu et al. 2007;Du et al. 2008;Ao et al. 2009).Notably, a new carbon band at around 2810 cm -1 was observed for both C-TiO 2 and Cu/C-TiO 2 due to C-H stretching, evidencing the incorporation of carbon into the structural lattice of both catalysts. The chemical states of the component elements of the 3.0 Cu/C-TiO 2 catalyst analyzed by XPS are shown in Fig. 4. The XPS survey spectrum indicates the presence of Ti, O, C, and Cu species (Fig. 4a).The Ti 2p spectrum in Fig. 4b indicates four XPS peaks at about 457.2 eV (2p 3/2 ) and 458.8 eV (2p 3/2 ), which can be attributed to Ti 4 oxidation state, and the other two peaks located at about 462.1 eV (2p 1/2 ) and 464.1 eV (2p 1/2 ) are consistent with the Ti 3 state (Tao et al. 2012), with mass of 8.9 and 14.7 for Ti 3 and Ti 4 , respectively.Figure 4c shows O 1s XPS spectrum, which consists of four peaks 527.8, 530.1, 532.1, and 534.1 eV, corresponding to oxygen in the TiO 2 lattice (Ti-O, Ti-O-Ti) and OH -, resulting mainly from the chemisorbed H 2 O or the free hydroxyl group (O-H) on the surface (Zhang et al. 2014;Trevisan et al. 2014;El-Sheikh et al. 2014).The C 1s XPS spectrum exhibits four peaks at 283.3, 285.2, 286.9, and 288.8 eV (Fig. 4d).These peaks can be assigned to C-Cu, C-C, C-O/CO, and O-CO, respectively (Zhang et al. 2014;Trevisan et al. 2014;Lei et al. 2015;Etacheri et al. 2013).The XPS spectrum of Cu 2p is given in Fig. 4e.The binding energy of the Cu 2p 3/2 peak is 933.1 and 935.9 eV, suggesting that the chemical state of copper is Cu 2 (Guo et al. 2011;Wang et al. 2007).enhance the yield of CH 3 OH due to the elevation of the number of active sites on the catalyst surface (Yamashita et al. 1994;Adachi et al. 1994;Mizuno et al. 1996).However, no further improvement of the CH 3 OH production beyond the 3 wt of Cu loading is due to shielding by it the absorption of light by photocatalyst TiO 2 (Slamet et al. 2009;Nasution et al. 2005;Wu et al. 2009).Consequently, the yield of CH 3 OH decreased with the increase of Cu loading beyond 3 wt. The reduction of CO 2 and the formation of CH 3 OH at various catalyst dosages are shown in Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b, respectively.It has been quite familiar that photocatalytic reactions take place on the TiO 2 surface active site.So, the dosage of TiO 2 plays a key role, which needs to be optimized.As clearly noted, the concentration of CH 3 OH is going up with the increasing dosage of catalyst, then started to decline when the catalyst concentration exceeds the value of 1.0 g l -1 .The high dosage of TiO 2 leads the scattering of light due to the opacity of suspension from the reactor, which in turn reduces the photoactivity (Koci et al. 2009;Sasirekha et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2002).Further, the higher dosage may also facilitate surface agglomeration, which in turn lowers the surface active site and decreases the CH 3 OH yield (Yang et al. 2009).Subsequently, the net CH 3 OH yield goes down with the excess dosage of the catalyst.Therefore, under the current experimental conditions, the optimized concentration of TiO 2 can be revealed to be 1.0 g l -1 . In order to assess the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and the production of CH 3 OH, the conversion process was carried out by using P25-TiO 2 , C-TiO 2 , and the optimum Cu loading of 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 in natural seawater under the UV light (Fig. 7).The observed results clearly show the advantage of Cu doping.The maximum methanol yield rate of 577 mol g-cat -1 h -1 was observed for 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 , which is 5.3-fold higher than the production rate over the C-TiO 2 and 7.4 times the amount produced using Degussa P25 TiO 2 .When C-TiO 2 is modified by using 3 wt Cu, the formation of CH 3 OH under UV light is dramatically upward compared to C-TiO 2 , which is mainly due to the electron-capturing capacity of Cu to resist the recombination of electron and hole pair as well as the ability of Cu to selectively convert CO 2 into CH 3 OH. The advantage of Cu is to trap the electron, which is excited from the valence band to the conduction band after the exposure of TiO 2 with the light source (Tseng et al. 2002).In fact, Cu 2 with lower redox potential is a promising dopant species, because the reduction of Cu 2 is thermodynamically attainable and the presence of unfilled 3d shell will attract electrons and can be caught by Cu-II on the surface of TiO 2 (Hirano et al. 1992;Chiang et al. 2002).The acceptance of electrons from the conduction band will facilitate the reduction of Cu 2 into Cu species.The absorbed electrons could be consumed through the decrease of H and/or O 2 that present in the formation radicals of H and/or O 2 , individually.This will lead the re-oxidation of Cu species back to Cu 2 .Subsequently, the electron-hole rate could be decreased.Furthermore, Cu species act as primary adsorption site of CO 2 for CH 3 OH union (Kakumoto 1995;Chiang et al. 2002). It is quite interesting that the results obtained from the current study for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and the production of CH 3 OH in seawater under illumination of UV light are higher than those we previously reported for pure water (Kavil et al. ).The reason for this is that bicarbonate and carbonate ions are perpetually liquidated into the seawater.The carbonate reacts with CO 2 to form bicarbonate, which leads to a further uptake of CO 2 and a decline of the CO 3 2-concentration in the ocean.In this case, the production of CH 3 OH is from the reduction of not only CO 2 but also all the carbonate species.So, the yield of CH 3 OH from seawater medium is much more than that of freshwater. It is important to investigate the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into CH 3 OH under actual natural sunlight.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and the corresponding CH 3 OH production at a various interval of time using P25-TiO 2 , C-TiO 2 , and 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 in seawater are shown in Fig. 8.The maximum rate of the photocatalytic production of CH 3 OH using 3.0 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 was found to be 188 mol g-cat -1 h -1 , which is 2.24 times higher than that of C-TiO 2 , whereas no CH 3 OH was observed for P25.Similar to UV results, the current CH 3 OH production yield in seawater under real sunlight is higher than that we previously reported for pure water (Kavil et al. 2017)."}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Efficient Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Present in Seawater into Methanol over Cu/C-Co-Doped TiO2 Nanocatalyst Under UV and Natural Sunlight", "context": "Efficient Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Present in Seawater into Methanol over Cu/C-Co-Doped TiO2 Nanocatalyst Under UV and Natural Sunlight"}, {"llm generation": "Solar", "source": "Efficient Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Present in Seawater into Methanol over Cu/C-Co-Doped TiO2 Nanocatalyst Under UV and Natural Sunlight", "context": "Efficient Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Present in Seawater into Methanol over Cu/C-Co-Doped TiO2 Nanocatalyst Under UV and Natural Sunlight"}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in seawater into chemical fuel, methanol (CH 3 OH), was achieved over Cu/C-co-doped TiO 2 nanoparticles under UV and natural sunlight.", "context": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in seawater into chemical fuel, methanol (CH 3 OH), was achieved over Cu/C-co-doped TiO 2 nanoparticles under UV and natural sunlight.Photocatalysts with different Cu loadings (0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 7 wt) were synthesized by the sol-gel method and were characterized by XRD, SEM, UV-Vis, FTIR, and XPS.Co-doping with C and Cu into TiO 2 remarkably promoted the photocatalytic production of CH 3 OH.This improvement was attributed to lowering of bandgap energy, specific catalytic effect of Cu for CH 3 OH formation, and the minimization of photo-generated carrier recombination.Co-doped TiO 2 with 3.0 wt Cu was found to be the most active catalyst, giving a maximum methanol yield rate of 577 mol g-cat -1 h -1 under illumination of UV light, which is 5.3-fold higher than the production rate over C-TiO 2 and 7.4 times the amount produced using Degussa P25 TiO 2 .Under natural sunlight, the maximum rate of the photocatalytic production of CH 3 OH using 3.0 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 was found to be 188 mol g-cat -1 h -1 , which is 2.24 times higher than that of C-TiO 2 , whereas, no CH 3 OH was observed for P25.Keywords CO 2 photoreduction .Cu/C-co-doped TiO 2 .Methanol .Copper .Seawater"}, {"llm generation": "natural sunlight", "source": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in seawater into chemical fuel, methanol (CH 3 OH), was achieved over Cu/C-co-doped TiO 2 nanoparticles under UV and natural sunlight.", "context": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in seawater into chemical fuel, methanol (CH 3 OH), was achieved over Cu/C-co-doped TiO 2 nanoparticles under UV and natural sunlight.Photocatalysts with different Cu loadings (0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 7 wt) were synthesized by the sol-gel method and were characterized by XRD, SEM, UV-Vis, FTIR, and XPS.Co-doping with C and Cu into TiO 2 remarkably promoted the photocatalytic production of CH 3 OH.This improvement was attributed to lowering of bandgap energy, specific catalytic effect of Cu for CH 3 OH formation, and the minimization of photo-generated carrier recombination.Co-doped TiO 2 with 3.0 wt Cu was found to be the most active catalyst, giving a maximum methanol yield rate of 577 mol g-cat -1 h -1 under illumination of UV light, which is 5.3-fold higher than the production rate over C-TiO 2 and 7.4 times the amount produced using Degussa P25 TiO 2 .Under natural sunlight, the maximum rate of the photocatalytic production of CH 3 OH using 3.0 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 was found to be 188 mol g-cat -1 h -1 , which is 2.24 times higher than that of C-TiO 2 , whereas, no CH 3 OH was observed for P25.Keywords CO 2 photoreduction .Cu/C-co-doped TiO 2 .Methanol .Copper .Seawater"}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "The light source from the combination of 254 and 365 nm UV lamps (Sankyo Denki, Germicidal Lamp, G15 T8, Japan) was irradiated to all the sides of the reactor.", "context": "The synthesis of unmodified titanium dioxide (n-TiO 2 ) was achieved by hydrolysis followed by oxidation of titanium trichloride in an aqueous medium.Titanium trichloride (TiCl 3 12.5 in hydrochloric acid (6-12, Sigma-Aldrich)) was added dropwise with continuous stirring into double distilled water.The strength of titanium was ajusted to 0.15 M. Subsequently, the pH of the resultant violet solution was attuned between 2.5 and 4.0 using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution.The resultant solution was filtered and cleaned several times with deionized water, then heated in an oven at 80 C for 24 h, and finally calcined at 300 C for 2 h. The sol-gel method was selected for the synthesis of Cu/C-TiO 2 , by dropwise addition of 30 ml of titanium (IV) isopropoxide to 30 ml of absolute ethanol with the aid of constant sonication.Then, 15 ml of glucose (0.015 M) and different weight percentages of Cu(II) were added to the prepared mixture.The pH of the resultant gel was adjusted to 3 using 50 HNO 3 , and the sonication was continued for further 2 h.The formed gel was reserved around 1 day at room temperature and then dried at 80 C for 12 h.The synthesized powder was transferred into a crucible and kept it in a muffle furnace at 500 C for 2 h.The Cu/C-TiO 2 was prepared by following the same procedure as C-TiO 2 , except the addition of Cu solution.TiO 2 P25 (Degussa, Japan) was used, without any additional modification, as a standard reference catalyst for comparison.

The photocatalytic reduction experiments were carried out in a homemade batch annular reactor.The reactor was made up of Pyrex glass and was coupled to the CO 2 cylinder with a firmly closed tube.Liquid samples were taken out at regular interval of time using a syringe, which is linked to the reactor through an extra opening.The light source from the combination of 254 and 365 nm UV lamps (Sankyo Denki, Germicidal Lamp, G15 T8, Japan) was irradiated to all the sides of the reactor.Before going to irradiation, a certified highpurity super-critical fluid-grade carbon dioxide was used with a constant flow through the stirred suspension for at least 1 h to purge the air and to saturate the solution.The reactor was designed accordingly to maintain the constant CO 2 pressure.In order to avoid the sedimentation of the catalyst, the photocatalytic reaction was carried out under constant stirring with the aid of a magnetic stirrer.The reaction temperature and pH were monitored throughout the experiment.The desired catalyst loading was suspended in seawater sample, collected from coastal sites in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and then illuminated with UV and natural sunlight.The chemical characteristics and the concentrations of the major ions of the studied seawater samples are listed in Table S1 (Supplementary material).Samples were withdrawn at regular interval of time, and the level of CO 2 was measured by both GC and titrimetric method.The produced CH 3 OH was measured by the spectrophotometric method (Anpo et al. 1997;Zhan et al. 2010).Different blank tests were performed in order to show the products that are formed on the influence of photocatalyst and light energy."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "In order to assess the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and the production of CH 3 OH, the conversion process was carried out by using P25-TiO 2 , C-TiO 2 , and the optimum Cu loading of 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 in natural seawater under the UV light (Fig. 7).", "context": "The crystallinity of the photocatalysts was investigated by X-ray analysis.The X-ray diffraction patterns of P25, C-TiO 2 , and Cu/C-TiO 2 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 1.The major diffraction peaks of C-TiO 2 and all Cu/C-TiO 2 samples are indexed at the crystal planes of (101), ( 004), ( 200), ( 105), ( 211), (204), and (116), indicating a typical pattern of anatase phase, and no other crystalline forms were found.These results reveal that C and Cu doping do not alter the crystalline phase of TiO 2 .The diffraction peaks for Cu were not detected for Cu/C-TiO 2 , probably due to low Cu content or the high dispersion of Cu over the TiO 2 surface.In addition to diffraction peaks for anatase phase, low-intensity diffraction peaks match the ( 110) and (111) planes of rutile, which were observed for P25.The crystallite particle size of the photocatalysts was determined by measuring the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) based on Scherrer's equation.The average crystal sizes were calculated to be 21, 13.6, 14.2, 14.0, 11.4, 15.4, and 8.3 nm for P25, C-doped TiO 2 and 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 7 wt Cu/Cco-doped TiO 2 samples, respectively.The smaller particle sizes for C-doped and Cu/C-co-doped TiO 2 samples is in agreement with the observed decrease in the intensity and sharpness of their diffraction peaks compared with those of P25. Figure S1 (Supplementary material) shows the surface morphology of P25, C-TiO 2 , and 3 Cu/C-TiO 2 photocatalysts.The uniform dispersion of the copper clusters on the surface of 3 Cu/C-TiO 2 is clearly noted.The elemental compositions of the three photocatalysts determined through EDS analysis are presented in Table 1.The EDS analysis confirmed the presence of carbon and copper in Cu/C-TiO 2 nanoparticles (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary material).Notably, neither C nor Cu was observed in P25. The optical bandgap energy (E g ) values for all samples were measured by using the Tauc plot (Kubelka 1948;Tauc et al. 1966), according to the following relationship: where is the material absorptivity coefficient ( (1 -R) 2 ), h is Planck's constant, is the vibration frequency, A is the optical constant, n is 1/2 or 2 for direct or indirect bandgap semiconductor, and R is the diffused reflectance.As shown in Fig. 2, the calculated bandgap energies were found to be 3.09, 1.85, 1.82, 1.89, 1.78, 1.76, and 1.72 eV for P25, C-doped TiO 2 and 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 7 wt Cu-C-co-doped TiO 2 samples, respectively.Obviously, there was a remarkable decrease in the bandgap energy with C doping from 3.09 to 1.85 eV, followed by a further gradual decrease with co-doping by Cu.The sharp decline in the E g values by C doping can be ascribed to the mixing of 2p states of O and C as a result of the lower number of electrons in the valence shell of C than that of O; therefore, 2p of C functioned as an acceptor state (Nakano et al. 2005).Furthermore, as a result of the strong interaction which arises between Cu ions and TiO 2 , the Cu ion implantation into TiO 2 improved its electronic properties (Anpo et al. 1997). In order to investigate the surface properties of the photocatalysts, FTIR analysis was conducted in the range of 400-4000 cm -1 (Fig. 3).As can be seen for both catalysts, the low FT-IR frequencies at 400-900 cm -1 are assigned to Ti-O-Ti bridge stretching modes and Ti-O bond (Zhang et al. 2015;Dolat et al. 2012).The peak observed at 1640 cm -1 corresponds to the vibrations of OH bonds of surface-adsorbed water molecules on the surfaces of the catalyst (Abbasizadeh et al. 2013;Randorn et al. 2004).The broad band at 3000-3500 cm -1 matches the surface hydroxyl stretching (Zhang et al. 2014).The hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst surface can effectively enhance its photocatalytic activity by suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs through the interaction with photo-generated holes (Yu et al. 2007;Du et al. 2008;Ao et al. 2009).Notably, a new carbon band at around 2810 cm -1 was observed for both C-TiO 2 and Cu/C-TiO 2 due to C-H stretching, evidencing the incorporation of carbon into the structural lattice of both catalysts. The chemical states of the component elements of the 3.0 Cu/C-TiO 2 catalyst analyzed by XPS are shown in Fig. 4. The XPS survey spectrum indicates the presence of Ti, O, C, and Cu species (Fig. 4a).The Ti 2p spectrum in Fig. 4b indicates four XPS peaks at about 457.2 eV (2p 3/2 ) and 458.8 eV (2p 3/2 ), which can be attributed to Ti 4 oxidation state, and the other two peaks located at about 462.1 eV (2p 1/2 ) and 464.1 eV (2p 1/2 ) are consistent with the Ti 3 state (Tao et al. 2012), with mass of 8.9 and 14.7 for Ti 3 and Ti 4 , respectively.Figure 4c shows O 1s XPS spectrum, which consists of four peaks 527.8, 530.1, 532.1, and 534.1 eV, corresponding to oxygen in the TiO 2 lattice (Ti-O, Ti-O-Ti) and OH -, resulting mainly from the chemisorbed H 2 O or the free hydroxyl group (O-H) on the surface (Zhang et al. 2014;Trevisan et al. 2014;El-Sheikh et al. 2014).The C 1s XPS spectrum exhibits four peaks at 283.3, 285.2, 286.9, and 288.8 eV (Fig. 4d).These peaks can be assigned to C-Cu, C-C, C-O/CO, and O-CO, respectively (Zhang et al. 2014;Trevisan et al. 2014;Lei et al. 2015;Etacheri et al. 2013).The XPS spectrum of Cu 2p is given in Fig. 4e.The binding energy of the Cu 2p 3/2 peak is 933.1 and 935.9 eV, suggesting that the chemical state of copper is Cu 2 (Guo et al. 2011;Wang et al. 2007).enhance the yield of CH 3 OH due to the elevation of the number of active sites on the catalyst surface (Yamashita et al. 1994;Adachi et al. 1994;Mizuno et al. 1996).However, no further improvement of the CH 3 OH production beyond the 3 wt of Cu loading is due to shielding by it the absorption of light by photocatalyst TiO 2 (Slamet et al. 2009;Nasution et al. 2005;Wu et al. 2009).Consequently, the yield of CH 3 OH decreased with the increase of Cu loading beyond 3 wt. The reduction of CO 2 and the formation of CH 3 OH at various catalyst dosages are shown in Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b, respectively.It has been quite familiar that photocatalytic reactions take place on the TiO 2 surface active site.So, the dosage of TiO 2 plays a key role, which needs to be optimized.As clearly noted, the concentration of CH 3 OH is going up with the increasing dosage of catalyst, then started to decline when the catalyst concentration exceeds the value of 1.0 g l -1 .The high dosage of TiO 2 leads the scattering of light due to the opacity of suspension from the reactor, which in turn reduces the photoactivity (Koci et al. 2009;Sasirekha et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2002).Further, the higher dosage may also facilitate surface agglomeration, which in turn lowers the surface active site and decreases the CH 3 OH yield (Yang et al. 2009).Subsequently, the net CH 3 OH yield goes down with the excess dosage of the catalyst.Therefore, under the current experimental conditions, the optimized concentration of TiO 2 can be revealed to be 1.0 g l -1 . In order to assess the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and the production of CH 3 OH, the conversion process was carried out by using P25-TiO 2 , C-TiO 2 , and the optimum Cu loading of 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 in natural seawater under the UV light (Fig. 7).The observed results clearly show the advantage of Cu doping.The maximum methanol yield rate of 577 mol g-cat -1 h -1 was observed for 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 , which is 5.3-fold higher than the production rate over the C-TiO 2 and 7.4 times the amount produced using Degussa P25 TiO 2 .When C-TiO 2 is modified by using 3 wt Cu, the formation of CH 3 OH under UV light is dramatically upward compared to C-TiO 2 , which is mainly due to the electron-capturing capacity of Cu to resist the recombination of electron and hole pair as well as the ability of Cu to selectively convert CO 2 into CH 3 OH. The advantage of Cu is to trap the electron, which is excited from the valence band to the conduction band after the exposure of TiO 2 with the light source (Tseng et al. 2002).In fact, Cu 2 with lower redox potential is a promising dopant species, because the reduction of Cu 2 is thermodynamically attainable and the presence of unfilled 3d shell will attract electrons and can be caught by Cu-II on the surface of TiO 2 (Hirano et al. 1992;Chiang et al. 2002).The acceptance of electrons from the conduction band will facilitate the reduction of Cu 2 into Cu species.The absorbed electrons could be consumed through the decrease of H and/or O 2 that present in the formation radicals of H and/or O 2 , individually.This will lead the re-oxidation of Cu species back to Cu 2 .Subsequently, the electron-hole rate could be decreased.Furthermore, Cu species act as primary adsorption site of CO 2 for CH 3 OH union (Kakumoto 1995;Chiang et al. 2002). It is quite interesting that the results obtained from the current study for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and the production of CH 3 OH in seawater under illumination of UV light are higher than those we previously reported for pure water (Kavil et al. ).The reason for this is that bicarbonate and carbonate ions are perpetually liquidated into the seawater.The carbonate reacts with CO 2 to form bicarbonate, which leads to a further uptake of CO 2 and a decline of the CO 3 2-concentration in the ocean.In this case, the production of CH 3 OH is from the reduction of not only CO 2 but also all the carbonate species.So, the yield of CH 3 OH from seawater medium is much more than that of freshwater. It is important to investigate the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into CH 3 OH under actual natural sunlight.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and the corresponding CH 3 OH production at a various interval of time using P25-TiO 2 , C-TiO 2 , and 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 in seawater are shown in Fig. 8.The maximum rate of the photocatalytic production of CH 3 OH using 3.0 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 was found to be 188 mol g-cat -1 h -1 , which is 2.24 times higher than that of C-TiO 2 , whereas no CH 3 OH was observed for P25.Similar to UV results, the current CH 3 OH production yield in seawater under real sunlight is higher than that we previously reported for pure water (Kavil et al. 2017)."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and CH 3 OH yield were successfully achieved in seawater using Cu/C-TiO 2 nanoparticles under both UV and natural sunlight.", "context": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and CH 3 OH yield were successfully achieved in seawater using Cu/C-TiO 2 nanoparticles under both UV and natural sunlight.Under the current experimental condition, the optimum loading was achieved by the doping of C-TiO 2 by 3 wt of Cu.The highest CH 3 OH yield was obtained over 1 g l -1 of 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 .The experimental results revealed that the production of CH 3 OH using Cu/C-codoped-TiO 2 is much higher than that of P25 and C-TiO 2 , due to the effective trapping of the charge carriers and the inhibition of their recombination rate by Cu doping, as well as the bandgap narrowing, as a result of C doping.

In order to investigate the surface properties of the photocatalysts, FTIR analysis was conducted in the range of 400-4000 cm -1 (Fig. 3).As can be seen for both catalysts, the low FT-IR frequencies at 400-900 cm -1 are assigned to Ti-O-Ti bridge stretching modes and Ti-O bond (Zhang et al. 2015;Dolat et al. 2012).The peak observed at 1640 cm -1 corresponds to the vibrations of OH bonds of surface-adsorbed water molecules on the surfaces of the catalyst (Abbasizadeh et al. 2013;Randorn et al. 2004).The broad band at 3000-3500 cm -1 matches the surface hydroxyl stretching (Zhang et al. 2014).The hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst surface can effectively enhance its photocatalytic activity by suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs through the interaction with photo-generated holes (Yu et al. 2007;Du et al. 2008;Ao et al. 2009).Notably, a new carbon band at around 2810 cm -1 was observed for both C-TiO 2 and Cu/C-TiO 2 due to C-H stretching, evidencing the incorporation of carbon into the structural lattice of both catalysts. The chemical states of the component elements of the 3.0 Cu/C-TiO 2 catalyst analyzed by XPS are shown in Fig. 4. The XPS survey spectrum indicates the presence of Ti, O, C, and Cu species (Fig. 4a).The Ti 2p spectrum in Fig. 4b indicates four XPS peaks at about 457.2 eV (2p 3/2 ) and 458.8 eV (2p 3/2 ), which can be attributed to Ti 4 oxidation state, and the other two peaks located at about 462.1 eV (2p 1/2 ) and 464.1 eV (2p 1/2 ) are consistent with the Ti 3 state (Tao et al. 2012), with mass of 8.9 and 14.7 for Ti 3 and Ti 4 , respectively.Figure 4c shows O 1s XPS spectrum, which consists of four peaks 527.8, 530.1, 532.1, and 534.1 eV, corresponding to oxygen in the TiO 2 lattice (Ti-O, Ti-O-Ti) and OH -, resulting mainly from the chemisorbed H 2 O or the free hydroxyl group (O-H) on the surface (Zhang et al. 2014;Trevisan et al. 2014;El-Sheikh et al. 2014).The C 1s XPS spectrum exhibits four peaks at 283.3, 285.2, 286.9, and 288.8 eV (Fig. 4d).These peaks can be assigned to C-Cu, C-C, C-O/CO, and O-CO, respectively (Zhang et al. 2014;Trevisan et al. 2014;Lei et al. 2015;Etacheri et al. 2013).The XPS spectrum of Cu 2p is given in Fig. 4e.The binding energy of the Cu 2p 3/2 peak is 933.1 and 935.9 eV, suggesting that the chemical state of copper is Cu 2 (Guo et al. 2011;Wang et al. 2007).enhance the yield of CH 3 OH due to the elevation of the number of active sites on the catalyst surface (Yamashita et al. 1994;Adachi et al. 1994;Mizuno et al. 1996).However, no further improvement of the CH 3 OH production beyond the 3 wt of Cu loading is due to shielding by it the absorption of light by photocatalyst TiO 2 (Slamet et al. 2009;Nasution et al. 2005;Wu et al. 2009).Consequently, the yield of CH 3 OH decreased with the increase of Cu loading beyond 3 wt. The reduction of CO 2 and the formation of CH 3 OH at various catalyst dosages are shown in Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b, respectively.It has been quite familiar that photocatalytic reactions take place on the TiO 2 surface active site.So, the dosage of TiO 2 plays a key role, which needs to be optimized.As clearly noted, the concentration of CH 3 OH is going up with the increasing dosage of catalyst, then started to decline when the catalyst concentration exceeds the value of 1.0 g l -1 .The high dosage of TiO 2 leads the scattering of light due to the opacity of suspension from the reactor, which in turn reduces the photoactivity (Koci et al. 2009;Sasirekha et al. 2006;Tseng et al. 2002).Further, the higher dosage may also facilitate surface agglomeration, which in turn lowers the surface active site and decreases the CH 3 OH yield (Yang et al. 2009).Subsequently, the net CH 3 OH yield goes down with the excess dosage of the catalyst.Therefore, under the current experimental conditions, the optimized concentration of TiO 2 can be revealed to be 1.0 g l -1 . In order to assess the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and the production of CH 3 OH, the conversion process was carried out by using P25-TiO 2 , C-TiO 2 , and the optimum Cu loading of 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 in natural seawater under the UV light (Fig. 7).The observed results clearly show the advantage of Cu doping.The maximum methanol yield rate of 577 mol g-cat -1 h -1 was observed for 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 , which is 5.3-fold higher than the production rate over the C-TiO 2 and 7.4 times the amount produced using Degussa P25 TiO 2 .When C-TiO 2 is modified by using 3 wt Cu, the formation of CH 3 OH under UV light is dramatically upward compared to C-TiO 2 , which is mainly due to the electron-capturing capacity of Cu to resist the recombination of electron and hole pair as well as the ability of Cu to selectively convert CO 2 into CH 3 OH. The advantage of Cu is to trap the electron, which is excited from the valence band to the conduction band after the exposure of TiO 2 with the light source (Tseng et al. 2002).In fact, Cu 2 with lower redox potential is a promising dopant species, because the reduction of Cu 2 is thermodynamically attainable and the presence of unfilled 3d shell will attract electrons and can be caught by Cu-II on the surface of TiO 2 (Hirano et al. 1992;Chiang et al. 2002).The acceptance of electrons from the conduction band will facilitate the reduction of Cu 2 into Cu species.The absorbed electrons could be consumed through the decrease of H and/or O 2 that present in the formation radicals of H and/or O 2 , individually.This will lead the re-oxidation of Cu species back to Cu 2 .Subsequently, the electron-hole rate could be decreased.Furthermore, Cu species act as primary adsorption site of CO 2 for CH 3 OH union (Kakumoto 1995;Chiang et al. 2002). It is quite interesting that the results obtained from the current study for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and the production of CH 3 OH in seawater under illumination of UV light are higher than those we previously reported for pure water (Kavil et al. ).The reason for this is that bicarbonate and carbonate ions are perpetually liquidated into the seawater.The carbonate reacts with CO 2 to form bicarbonate, which leads to a further uptake of CO 2 and a decline of the CO 3 2-concentration in the ocean.In this case, the production of CH 3 OH is from the reduction of not only CO 2 but also all the carbonate species.So, the yield of CH 3 OH from seawater medium is much more than that of freshwater. It is important to investigate the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into CH 3 OH under actual natural sunlight.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and the corresponding CH 3 OH production at a various interval of time using P25-TiO 2 , C-TiO 2 , and 3 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 in seawater are shown in Fig. 8.The maximum rate of the photocatalytic production of CH 3 OH using 3.0 wt Cu/C-TiO 2 was found to be 188 mol g-cat -1 h -1 , which is 2.24 times higher than that of C-TiO 2 , whereas no CH 3 OH was observed for P25.Similar to UV results, the current CH 3 OH production yield in seawater under real sunlight is higher than that we previously reported for pure water (Kavil et al. 2017)."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
