From lattice parameters of the anatase phase, it was revealed the existence of a lattice cell contraction in the bulk of the nanoparticles, mainly in the c-axis, by the incorporation of magnesium 36, while the a and b axes remained nearly constant around 0.378 nm (Table 1).This contraction exhibits a maximum for the lowest doping level and a relaxation of the structure with higher magnesium loading.The magnesium incorporation into the other phases was difficult to discern at these doping levels, since the isomorph MgTi 2 O 5 also exist, with pseudobrookite structure, which can be further decomposed to MgTiO 3 and TiO 2 37, hypothesis that is plausible since at 2.0 wt MgTiO 3 is observed. The surface chemical composition was examined by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).For all degrees of concentration, Mg 1s peak was detected corroborating the presence of Mg atoms at least in the first 3-5 monolayers beneath the surface.The atomic concentrations of Mg, O and Ti at the surface were retrieved from Mg 1s, O 1s and Ti 2p high resolution peaks of the spectra and then the atomic percentage were obtained.According to these results, shown in Fig. 3, there is a higher magnesium concentration at the surface than the nominal added value, suggesting a U-shape profile for magnesium ions inside the nanocrystals.These phenomena of surface segregation on TiO 2 nanoparticles have also been found for other additives 38,39.This larger effective concentration near the surface is supported by the fact that we already found Mg segregation under MgTiO 3 at values as low as 2.0 wt.However, before complete segregation, it has been observed that magnesium incorporation causes a highly distorted surface which is the main origin of the restriction on grain growth.As previously discussed in Section 3.1, magnesium ions, mostly accumulated at the surface, can substitute titanium ions in anatase phase and, consequently, the introduction of impurities to the TiO 2 promotes the formation of defects to compensate the charge.In the case of Mg, according the Kroger-Vink notation, the defective reaction caused by the Ti 4 substitution by Mg 2 can be expressed as follows: where Mg Ti indicates a Mg 2 in a Ti 4 lattice site; O X O represents a O 2-in a normal lattice site and V O an ionized oxygen vacancy. However, these ionized oxygen vacancies are not stable at the surface and they tend to neutralize either by the chemisorption of molecular oxygen, the formation of hydroxyl groups 40 or the reorganization of the crystalline structure by the creation of Ti 3 41, giving the well know n-type behaviour to the defective TiO 2 .Then, the presence of magnesium can cause a reorganization of the surface promoting a variety of chemical surface states which can be elucidated by examining the high resolution XPS spectra in Ti 2p and O 1s zones. The Ti 2p signal was deconvoluted in four different contributions (see Supplementary Data, Fig. S2b) attributed to the Ti 4 doublet (458.7 and 464.4 eV) and a minor doublet for Ti 3 (457.7 and 463.4 eV) 42, while the O 1s peak (see Supplementary Data Fig.S2c) displayed a broader asymmetric spectra due to the contributions corresponding to different chemical states reported in the literature 43,44: oxygen in TiO 2 lattice (O L ) (529.9 eV); chemisorbed oxygen at the surface and hydroxyl groups (O S ) (530.9 eV) likely coming from neutralization of ionized oxygen vacancies; and a small percentage of oxygen in C O bonds (532.4 eV) corresponding to the carbon contamination from the surrounding atmosphere.It should be bear in mind that, obviously, the non-Mg added sample already presents some native defects corresponding to its surface state.Both, titanium and oxygen, are pointing out these features that have strong consequences on the capacity to induce photocatalytic reactions. In fact, it is plausible to assume that the increase of surface states due to disorder and dopant would enhance visible and infrared absorption, with the additional benefit of photogeneration of carriers.However, this absorption enhancement is too narrow to be significant.UV-vis results (see Supplementary Data Fig.S4) shows that apart from a little shift of the band gap energy to higher values (Supplementary Data Table S1) probably due to higher value of the MgO band gap 45, no significant changes can be appreciated.Then, differences in the photoactivity of the materials are not originated by its different optical properties. On the contrary, these extended energy states, in combination with the energy levels produced by dopants, can become recombination centres or, alternatively, effective trapping centres.In the former case, which implies the annihilation of photogenerated carriers, they have as a consequence a diminishing on the photocatalytic productivity.In the second case, surface states can capture one of the carriers preventing its direct and rapid recombination and enhancing the possibility to be transferred to the photocatalytic reactions.It is well known that Ti 3 acts as an electron trap preventing its recombination with the photogenerated holes and increasing the probability of the photoreduction of the CO 2 chemisorbed molecules 46.Additionally, the hydroxyl surface groups can act as hole traps 47 to form a new radical which facilitates the oxygen evolution reaction. The relative abundance of the modified oxygen states (O S ) and reduced titanium (Ti 3 ) for each Mg loading were calculated as the ratio of the deconvoluted area of the O S and Ti 3 contributions over their corresponding peak area (O S /O and Ti 3 /Ti, respectively).From the plot of this relative abundance in front of Mg loading (Fig. 4), it was found that the sample with the highest O S and Ti 3 contributions was 0.2 wt Mg.It is arguably that the maximum substitutional incorporation of magnesium is found for this concentration.At higher loadings a stronger influence on the surface distortion happened and, at the same time, not all the magnesium was incorporated into the lattice, in favour to the nucleation of a new intermetallic phase MgTiO 3 . TiO 2 and Mg-TiO 2 photocatalysts were immobilized over glass substrates and their activity towards carbon dioxide reduction was tested using water as hole scavenger and simulated solar light as energy source.In gas phase reactors, carbon dioxide can be reduced to different products, mainly carbon monoxide and methane, processes that are competitive with the hydrogen formation from water reduction.The following reactions can, in a simple way, describe the mechanisms involved in the photoreduction of carbon dioxide, including the photoactivation of the catalyst, water oxidation to O 2 , reduction of carbon dioxide to CO or CH 4 and water reduction to H 2 : Water photooxidation : CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 : Water photoreduction : In this study, CH 4 , CO and H 2 were found to be the main products from the CO 2 photoreduction, although other minority by-products were also detected, at the level of the GC analyser resolution, such as C 2 H 6 and C 3 H 8 . As shown in Fig. 5a, magnesium modified TiO 2 highly enhanced the conversion rates of the photoreduction process, obtaining up to a 3-fold increase in the total productivity.However, as magnesium concentration increases, the overall productivity decreases.Those doped with 0.2 and 0.5 wt Mg increases the methane yield by 4.5 and 3.5 times with respect to the obtained with pure TiO 2 nanoparticles.Besides, H 2 production was also increased, obtaining approximately twice the amount produced without doping, for 0.5 wt Mg sample, while the production of CO is slightly reduced.Then, magnesium incorporation affects both the productivity as well as the selectivity CH 4 /H 2 ratio as we will discuss later. A remarkable picture of the processes taking place at the surface corresponds to the analysis of the productivity considered as the overall number of transferred electrons used for the formation of the analyzed molecules according to the above indicated reactions (Eqs.( 4)-( 6)), namely weighted productivity (Fig. 5b), as a first approach of quantification of internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the semiconductor, where it can be highlight that the magnesium incorporation induces a 3-fold increase in its IQE. Looking at the dependence of the weighted productivity versus the relative abundance of modified oxygen states (O S ) and reduced titanium (Ti 3 ), shown in Fig. 6, it is clearly seen that the overall productivity shows an excellent correlation with the above mentioned surface states.It is significant that the overall number of available photogenerated carriers to reduce either carbon dioxide or water is not depending of the catalyst additive concentration, but it is rather revealing a strong connection with the chemical structure of the outermost layers through this dependence versus Ti 3 and surface oxygen species.Therefore, it can be stated that the magnesium incorporation on titania, apart from changing the acid base properties, promotes a highly modified surface with a major presence of Ti 3 and hydroxyl groups, which are responsible for the enhancement on the photoactivity.Nevertheless, more detailed analysis about activity of each type of site, for example Mg or Ti 3 , should be done in order to elucidate which is the individual contribution of each site to the productivity of the process. Additionally, it is noticeable that there is a direct competition between the hydrogen and methane formation whereas the formation of CO appears to be residual.Whereas for 0.2 wt Mg sample the CH 4 /H 2 weighted productivity ratio is about 14, it decreases to 7 for 0.5 wt Mg and to around 5 at concentrations of 1.0 wt Mg, which is almost the same value than for pure TiO 2 (see Supplementary Data, Fig. S3).At the same time, global productivity decreases and the hydrogen production becomes more effective likely due to a less favourable chemisorption of CO 2 , which is probably caused for the diminution of Ti 3 .Due to the electronegativity and the Lewis acid strength of Ti 3 , CO 2 is favourably bonded on Ti 3 sites than Ti 4 sites.Additionally, magnesium is known to contribute in a number of CO 2 involving reactions, including carbon dioxide hydrogenation, by stabilization of CO 2 at the surface of the catalyst allowing a later hydrogenation to form methane instead of other byproducts.DFT and TPD studies revealed that the absorption of CO 2 is not favourable over MgO stable facets 48, whereas for less stable facets CO 2 is strongly bonded.Then, the selectivity to methane can be attributed to that either the increased Ti 3 concentration or the substitutional magnesium on titanium lattice, which is less stable than MgTiO 3 phase, promotes the stabilization of CO 2 at the surface allowing its complete reduction, probably via dissociated hydrogen as it was pointed out in literature 35. The highly dependence of the overall productivity on the Ti 3 and O S suggests that the electron and hole transfer is mediated by surface states. On one hand, it is known that, in the water splitting process, the rate limiting step of the overall reaction is the photooxidation of water 49 since it involves 4 holes requiring a longer lifetime of carriers than that of the required for the reduction of water.Similarly, in carbon dioxide photoreduction in presence of water, this reaction is also required (Eq.( 3)), since the introduction of water into the reactor serves as hole scavenger.Thus, it is plausible that, according to the kinetic data obtained, the hydroxyl groups at the surface may play an important role for the transference of the four required holes. On the other hand, photogenerated electrons have been found to present a high competition among three different via: (i) direct recombination with holes, (ii) trapping by the Ti 3 centres and transfers to the CO 2 molecules and (iii) direct transfer from the conduction band for the reduction of the water molecule.Thus, Ti 3 sites play the role of electron trap centres avoiding recombination, enhancing the charge transfer involved in the reduction as well as promoting the CO 2 chemisorption, together with magnesium.This essential role of Ti 3 in the photocatalytic activity of titania has already been reported in the literature 46.Additionally, thermal programmed desorption (TPD) analysis using CO 2 as probe molecule have shown that Ti 3 sites bind CO 2 more strongly than Ti 4 sites.Then, the time of residence of the adsorbed molecules would rise, increasing the probability that the reaction occurs."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2 nanoparticles", "source": "In this work, the role played in the photocatalytic activity towards CO 2 photoreduction by the outermost layers of bare and Mg-loaded TiO 2 nanoparticles has been discussed.", "context": "In this work, the role played in the photocatalytic activity towards CO 2 photoreduction by the outermost layers of bare and Mg-loaded TiO 2 nanoparticles has been discussed.It has been found that small amount of Mg-loading promotes an increase of the Ti 3 (electron trap) and O S (hole trap) concentration, maintaining a low electron-hole recombination rate according to the considerable increase of the productivity (up to 3 times for 0.2 wt loaded additive).However, surface instability rises suddenly as additive concentration increases, resulting in a fast decrease of the productivity as the surface recombination increases and, simultaneously, to a less competitive pathway for the CO 2 reduction as proportionally the production of hydrogen is increased in comparison with that of the methane.In fact, a straightforward correlation between the total productivity obtained from the photocatalytic process and the density of Ti 3 and O S has been stated, revealing and corroborating the outstanding significance of the surface chemical structure.Changing the chemical structure of the outermost layers plays the determinant role of the photocatalytic functional behaviour.
