As reference samples, two rGO/PdPtCu counterparts with thicker PtCu shell were also synthesized for comparison.As revealed by the TEM images in Fig. 2a,b,d ande, with the deposition of more Pt and Cu atoms onto the Pd surface, the cuboid shape of PdPtCu is well maintained except the increased thickness of black PtCu outer layers.According to the results of average edge length measurement, the thickness of PtCu is determined to be around 6 and 30 at.layers, and the corresponding sample is named as rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , respectively (Fig. S2c,d).To further examine the PtCu shell thickness, the molar ratios of Pd to Pt and Cu were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Table S1), which turn out to be consistent with those determined by the size analyses.Moreover, the ICP-MS results indicate the approximate Pt/Cu molar ratio of around 70: 30 in all the rGO/PdPtCu samples (Table S1).Similar to the case of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , both Pd(100) facet of the core and PtCu(100) facet of the shell can be observed in the HRTEM image of rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L (Fig. 2c).In sharp contrast, in the HRTEM image of rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L , due to the coverage of thicker shell, only the lattice of PtCu(100) plane can be detected (Fig. 2f).Furthermore, as the shell thickness increases, the lattice spacing of PtCu experiences a gradual increase from 1.93 A of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to 1.94 A of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and to 1.96 A of rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , which provides evidence that lattice mismatched epitaxy between Pd core and PtCu shell results in compressive strain on the ultrathin PtCu overlayers.When the shell thickness becomes greater, the strain gradually reduces and finally to the level of that of bulk PtCu 353637. The chemical states of the rGO/PdPtCu samples with different PtCu thicknesses were then comparatively analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).All the rGO/PdPtCu samples demonstrate similar C1s and O1s signals, in which the higher peak intensity of sp 2 carbon (284.5 eV) relative to those of C-O (285.9 eV) and C--O (288.3 eV) groups implies the effective removal of oxygencontaining functional groups (Fig. S3) 38,39.The deconvoluted peaks in the high-resolution spectra of Pd3d, Pt4f and Cu2p indicate the dominant metallic state and small amounts of ionic state, which are typical features for solution-synthesized metal nanocrystals (Fig. 2g-i) 4041424344.With the increasing PtCu thickness from rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and to rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , owing to the limited detection depth of XPS, Pt4f and Cu2p signals become stronger while Pd signal gradually weakens.Moreover, as the PtCu shell shrinks in the reverse order, Pd3d peaks shift to higher binding energies while Pt4f and Cu2p peaks to lower ones, suggesting that more significant charge re-distribution occurs between electron-deficient Pd cores and electron-rich PtCu shells. In addition to above samples, other reference samples were also prepared for comparison.Bare rGO was obtained under the same experimental condition as rGO/Pd except the absence of K 2 PdCl 4 (Fig. S4), while rGO/PdPt 6 L exposing with Pt(100) facets was synthesized through the same method as rGO/PdPtCu 6 L except without the addition of CuCl 2 (Fig. S5).Bare Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu core-shell nanocubes without rGO were also synthesized for comparison (Fig. S6).The structural information of the samples was revealed by the combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform Fig. 2. Electronic microscopy characterizations of reference samples and comparative spectroscopic characterizations of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L with reference samples: (a-f) TEM and HRTEM images of (a-c) rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and (d-f) rGO/PdPtCu 30 L ; (g-i) high-resolution XPS spectra of rGO/PdPtCu samples: (g) Pd3d, (h) Pt4f and (i) Cu2p high-resolution spectrum.infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.XRD patterns demonstrate the disappearance of the strong GO peak centered at 2 10.2 in the rGO based samples, further proving the exfoliation and reduction of GO (Fig. S7) 45,46.In addition to the broad peaks of rGO, all other peaks in the pattern of rGO/Pd can be assigned to fcc Pd (JCPDS 87-0639).With the further grown of PtCu on the Pd, no new peak appears, implying the same fcc phase of core and shell.As the PtCu thickness gradually increases from rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , the intensity-enhanced metal peaks gradually shift towards those of standard Pt (JCPDS 65-2868) rather than Cu (JCPDS 01-1241), further indicating the majority of Pt and minority of Cu in the PtCu shell.Additionally, when compared with the XRD pattern of PdPt, there is an obvious peak broadening of PdPtCu towards the direction of standard Cu (JCPDS 01-1241), and the peak broadening effect is more obvious at a higher 2 value, further confirming the presence of Cu in the Pt lattice (Fig. S8) 47.As depicted in the FTIR spectra of the rGO containing samples (Fig. S9), the remarkable decrease in the intensities of GO peaks corresponding to the stretching of oxygen containing functionalities including O-H (3400 cm -1 ), C--O (1734 cm -1 ), carboxy C-O (1400 cm -1 ), epoxy C-O (1228 cm -1 ) and alkoxy C-O (1065 cm -1 ) further evidences the reduction of GO 48,49.Such a phenomenon is further confirmed by the significant increase in the intensity ratio of D band to G band (I D /I G ) in the Raman spectra, which is resulted from the presence of unrepaired defects after the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups (Fig. S10) 50,51. Upon acquiring the structural and composition information, the performances of the rGO based samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were evaluated with photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 as the light absorber and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the hole scavenger, respectively.Fig. 3a summarizes the catalytic performance of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L in reference to control samples under visible light irradiation (420 780 nm) in the first 4 h of reaction.For all the samples, the yields of reduction products gradually increase with the extension of the reaction time (Fig. S11).The corresponding product selectivity in Fig. 3b was calculated based on the average evolution rates of the reduction products as well as the electrons required to generate the products according to Eq. 3.No gas product was detected in the reference experiments including in the dark, without Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 and without TEOA.When the system was operated in absence of catalyst or in presence of rGO without metal anchored, trace amounts of H 2 and CO were detected.With the further combination of rGO with Pd, remarkable enhancements in the H 2 and CO evolution were observed along with the generation of trace amount of CH 4 .After the coating of Pd with ultrathin PtCu shell, the CH 4 production over rGO/PdPtCu 2 L is drastically improved and the rate reaches up to as high as 129.7 mol gcat -1 h -1 , 56.4 times higher than that of rGO/Pd, offering high selectivity of 80.8 towards CH 4 production over competing H 2 and CO generation.Meanwhile, the H 2 and CO evolution rates also experience a considerable decline and rise, respectively, implying that the PtCu coverage facilitates the CO 2 fixation while suppresses the proton reduction.Further increasing the thickness of PtCu shell results in a gradual decrease in the CO and CH 4 production.Especially, the yield rate of CH 4 over rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L drastically decreases to 83.2 and 72.3 mol gcat -1 h -1 , while the corresponding CH 4 selectivity also suffers a slight drop to 72.5 and 67.5, respectively, demonstrating the vital role of the PtCu thickness in the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.In sharp contrast to rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L , with the approximate shell thickness, rGO/PdPt 6 L exhibits extremely higher H 2 generation but drastically lower CH 4 rate and selectivity, providing proof that the incorporation of Cu atoms into Pt surface holds the key to the high activity and selectivity of CH 4 production.It is worth noting that no liquid phase reduction product (e.g., CH 3 OH and HCOOH) was detected for all the samples during the photocatalytic process.When Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu without rGO were used as photocatalyts, no gas product was detected in the absence of Ru (pby) 3 Cl 2 , while trace amounts of H 2 and CO were measured in the presence of Ru complex, highlighting the pivotal role of rGO in the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. S12). For rGO/PdPtCu 2 L with the best photocatalytic performance, the activity and selectivity in CH 4 production are comparable to those of the reported state-of-the-art catalysts with Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 as the light sensitizer and TEOA as the hole scavenger, respectively (Table S2).To gain more information on the photocatalytic system, a series of control experiments with different reaction conditions have been conducted.The wavelength-dependent photocatalytic experiments was further assessed using Xe lamp equipped with different band filters.The trend of H 2 , CO and CH 4 yields of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L at different wavelengths match well with light absorption profile of Ru(bpy)3Cl2, corroborating that the CO 2 reduction is driven by the light excitation of the photosensitizer (Fig. 3c) 52.When using Ar as the gas feedstock instead of CO 2 , no CO and CH 4 is detected, manifesting that the produced CO and CH 4 actually come from the reduction of CO 2 53.To further verify the origin of produced CO and CH 4 , the isotopic 13 CO 2 was used as the reactant to trace the carbon source with rGO/PdPtCu 2 L as a catalyst.As identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the strong signals at m/z 29 and m/z 17 corresponds to the generated 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , respectively, evincing that the CO and CH 4 indeed originate from the photoreduction of CO 2 (Fig. 3d) 54,55.Noting that the m/z 16 in the mass spectra does not correspond to 12 CH 4 , but the fragment ions of 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , respectively.Apart from high activity and selectivity, the rGO/PdPtCu 2 L also delivers high catalytic stability in CH 4 generation.As shown in Fig. 3e, the recycled catalyst retain 95.3 of its original CH 4 evolution rate without obvious decay in the selectivity after five successive 4 h runs.To further prove the repeatability of the catalyst, TEM images, XRD pattern and XPS spectra after the cyclic tests were compared with those of the fresh one (Figs.S13 andS14).The well-maintained morphology, structure and composition validate the excellent reusability of the designed rGO/PdPtCu 2 L catalyst in CO 2 photoreduction.Notably, after the cycles, the new emerging Ru3d peaks provide evidence that Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 is adsorbed on the rGO (Fig. S14b), while the attenuated peak intensities of oxygen-containing function groups in C1s and O1s spectra imply the deeper photoreducion of rGO nanosheets by transferred excited electrons from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 light sensitizer (Fig. S14b,c) 17. Furthermore, in comparison with the FTIR spectra of fresh rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , additional absorption peaks at 775 cm -1 and 730 cm -1 after the photocatalytic cycles originate from the characteristic vibrations of adsorbed Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , confirming the - interaction between rGO and Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (Fig. S15). To further explore the key factors determining the photocatalytic performance, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was firstly employed to examine the light absorption behaviors of the rGO based catalysts.As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples exhibit comparable light absorption without obvious absorption edge, which is a typical feature for zero-bandgap graphene based materials.With the addition of the catalysts into Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution, there is a slight enhancement in the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4b).This enhancement is attributed to the intrinsic light absorption of rGO based catalysts, which can be reflected by the incremental light absorption of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 upon the addition of increasing amounts of rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. S16a).Owing to the comparable optical absorption property of the rGO based samples, almost no difference in the absorption spectra of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 solution is observed in the presence of the same concentration of different samples, excluding the influence of the light absorption on the photocatalytic performance. The charge separation and transfer behaviors in the rGO based samples were then reflected by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.As sketched in Fig. 4c, Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution excited at 400 nm shows a strong emission peak around 610 nm.With the further addition of rGO based samples, the PL of the excited Ru (bpy) 3 2 is obviously quenched, and the quenching degree gradually increases with the increasing amount of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. S16b).The above result suggests the suppression of radiative charge recombination resulted from the transfer of photoexcited electrons from Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 light absorber to rGO based catalysts.With the same dosage of the catalysts, the PL quenching degrees are in the order: rGO rGO/ Pd rGO/PdPtCu 30 L rGO/PdPtCu 6 L rGO/PdPt 6 L rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L , signifying that the metal configuration on the rGO nanosheets is critical to the charge separation efficiency.When bare Pd nanocubes were added into the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 solution in the absence of rGO, no apparent PL quenching occurs (Fig. S17), which highlights the critical role of rGO in promoting the charge transfer and separation, thus providing additional evidence that Ru(bpy) 3 2 is adsorbed on the rGO nanosheets rather than the metal particles.Time-resolved PL decay spectroscopy was then employed to further reveal the charge dynamic behaviors.As depicted in Fig. 4d, all emission patterns of excited Ru (bpy) 3 2 aqueous solution in the absence or presence of catalysts follow one exponential decay 56.Compared to blank Ru(bpy) 3 2 solution (210.1 ns), shortened PL lifetime can be observed in the presence of rGO (202.8 ns), rGO/Pd (196.9 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (182.0 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 6 L (189.1 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 30 L (189.9 ns) and rGO/PdPt 6 L (188.0 ns), respectively (Table S3).The decline of PL lifetime follows the same sequence as the PL quenching degree, further evidencing more efficient suppression of detrimental charge recombination in rGO/PdPtCu 2 L 17,57,58. To gain an in-depth insight into the improved charge separation and transfer kinetics of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been carried out to investigate the interfacial charge transfer resistance.As displayed in Fig. 4e, the Nyquist plot of rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L possesses the smallest arc radius among the different samples, revealing the lowest resistance for electron migration.Especially, the gradually reduced radii of Nyquist plots are observed when the thickness of PtCu shell decreases from 30 to 6 and then to 2 at.layers, disclosing the shell thickness dependent charge transfer kinetics.The above statements are further confirmed by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves examined with Ar-saturated KHCO 3 solution as electrolyte, from which it can be seen that rGO/PdPtCu 2 L exhibits the highest current densities, signifying that the synergism of Pd core and ultrathin PtCu shell efficiently promotes the separation and transfer of charge carriers, thus accelerating the CO 2 -to-CO/CH 4 conversion. It should be noted that the shell thickness is not the only key variable influencing the efficiency of charge separation and migration.Particularly, with the same shell thickness, the larger current density of rGO/ PdPt 6 L over that of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L together with the smaller Nyquist arc and higher PL quenching degree validates that pure Pt shell is more conducive to smooth electron movement relative to PtCu shell.To further decipher the charge migration processes, density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed to evaluate the electron flow behavior in detail.According to the aforementioned HRTEM results, Pd (100), Pt(100) and PtCu(100) facets are the most predominantly exposed crystallographic planes for rGO/Pd, rGO/PdPt and rGO/ PdPtCu samples, respectively, which were selected as the model surfaces to ensure the consistency of the theoretical models and the experimental results.According to the electrostatic potential, the work functions of PtCu 1 L , PtCu 2 L , PtCu 3 L and PtCu 4 L were calculated to be 4.98, 5.37, 5.49 and 5.52 eV, which are basically higher than those of rGO (4.33 eV) and Pd(100) (5.26 eV), but lower than that of Pt(100) (5.63 eV) (Table S4).Wherefore, it can be inferred that the Fermi level is in the order of rGO Pd PtCu Pt.As it is well documented that electrons will flow from the material with higher Fermi level to that with lower one 59, one can rationally deduce that electrons on the Pd core will migrate to the PtCu (or Pt) shell with more than one-layer thickness.This redistribution of charge is further revealed by experimental XPS results, implying the electron movement between the interfacial materials (Fig. 2g-i).Furthermore, valence-band XPS spectra manifest that the energy difference between the valence band (VB) edge and Fermi level is nearly zero for the rGO based samples, evidencing that the introduction of Pd core and PtCu (or Pt) shell does not alter the zero-bandgap feature of rGO (Fig. S18). Considering that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 is at 3.19 eV and its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is at 5.68 eV relative to the vacuum level according to previous works 60,61, the Fermi levels of rGO, Pd, PtCu and Pt are lower than the LUMO of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 so that the photoexcited electrons in the LUMO of the light absorber can be transferred to the Fermi levels of them.The photogenerated electrons are preferentially transferred from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 to rGO through - interfacial interaction between them, which subsequently migrate to Pd cores and then to PtCu (or Pt) shells in larger work functions for CO 2 reduction (Fig. 5a).Owing to the higher work function of Pt compared to that of PtCu, the larger work function difference between Pd and Pt produces an enlarged driving force for promoted interfacial electron transfer from core to shell, well explaining the smoother charge separation and migration in rGO/PdPt 6 L relative to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L . Then the question comes up to reveal the role of PtCu thickness on the charge separation and transfer for the rGO/PdPtCu samples with the same exposed facets of PtCu(100).To investigate this mechanism, the interfacial models of Pd(100)PtCu nL with one to four atomic layers were established and the corresponding charge analyses were performed to track the charge migration behavior.As depicted in Fig. 5b, driving by the work function difference, electrons will flow from Pd to PtCu when two materials are combined together.That is, electrons could be accumulated on the upper PtCu shells.Moreover, according to the Bader charge analysis, this electron accumulation will experience a gradual decline as the PtCu thickness increases from one to four layers (Table S5), which can be clearly visualized from the differential charge density in Fig. 5b.The thickness-dependent charge separation will lead to the variation of the interfacial polarization 62, which could further contribute to the robust electron trapping ability of PdPtCu shells with lower-layer PtCu and thus facilitating the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion efficiency.It is worth noting that the plasmonic absorption band of Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu is located in UV region (Fig. S19), and the contribution of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on the charge transfer/separation can be ruled out 6364656667. In addition to the charge separation and transfer, the ultimate photocatalytic property is also correlated with the surface reactivity of the catalysts.As discussed before, despite the superior electron separation/ transfer behavior, the activity and selectivity of rGO/PdPt 6 L in CH production are much lower as compared with those of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L , implying that the shell thickness dependent charge kinetics is not the only key factor determining the eventual photocatalytic performance.PtCu surface may provide more favorable reaction sites for CO 2 -to-CH Cl 2 to rGO/PdPtCu 2 L catalyst; (b) differential charge density determined by first-principles simulations illustrating the electron distribution between Pd(100) substrate and PtCu(100) shell when the PtCu shell thickness is altered from 1 to 4 layers.The Pd, Pt and Cu atoms are marked in green, gray and blue, respectively.The olive and cyan colors represent an increase and decrease in electron density, respectively.conversion compared to Pt surface.According to the CO 2 temperatureprogrammed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) profiles of rGO/Pd, rGO/PdPt 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 6 L samples, the peak at around 100 C can be assigned to physisorbed CO 2 , while another peak at around 500-600 C originates from the chemisorbed CO 2 (Fig. S20).The desorption peak intensity of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L at high temperature is much higher than those of rGO/Pd and rGO/PdPt 6 L , proving the better CO 2 adsorption on the PtCu(100) surface.Moreover, as demonstrated by the LSV curves conducted in Ar-saturated and CO 2 -saturated 0.5 M KHCO 3 electrolyte, respectively, the higher current densities under CO 2 atmosphere compared to those under Ar bubbling can be assigned to the cathodic current generated by CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 4f, rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L exhibits a larger current density enhancement as compared with rGO/Pd and rGO/PdPt 6 L , confirming that the PtCu(100) surface is more active for CO 2 reduction compared to Pd(100) and Pt(100) surface.Moreover, larger difference in the current density between Ar and CO 2 can be observed for rGO/PdPtCu 2 L compared to those for rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , meaning that the surface reactivity of PtCu(100) is also negatively correlative to the thickness of the shell. To gain a deep insight into the influence of PtCu thickness on the surface reaction, the chemisorption behavior of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on the Pd, Pt and PtCu surfaces was further described by the DFT calculations.As illustrated in Table 1, one can clearly see that PtCu surface exhibits much more negative CO 2 adsorption energies (ranging from -0.27 to -0.92 eV) when compared with those of Pd(100) (-0.02 eV) and Pt(100) (-0.04 eV), implying the substantially enhanced interaction between CO 2 molecules and PtCu surface.Additionally, as the thickness of PtCu increases from 1 to 4 at.layers, the adsorption energy of CO 2 experiences a gradual decline from -0.92 to -0.70 eV, and then to -0.59 and -0.27 eV, which suggests the steadily weakened CO 2 interaction.This shell-thickness dependence of CO 2 adsorption can be rationally ascribed to the synergistic interplay of surface strain and interfacial polarization 68,69.Interestingly, a more favorable CO 2 adsorption can be expected on the surface of PtCu 1 L and PtCu 2 L with higher binding strength relative to H 2 O molecules.In stark contrast, when compared to the CO 2 adsorption energies (E adCO2 ), the corresponding H 2 O adsorption energies (E adH2O ) on the Pd and Pt surface are much more negative, evincing a dominant proton reduction pathway.When the PtCu shell is thin enough, it is also possible that a two-step cascade catalytic process occurs, including the CO 2 -to-CO conversion on Pd core and the further CO-to-CH 4 conversion on PtCu shell 70,71.Taken together, the PtCu shell with lower atomic thickness promotes both the charge separation and the targeted reactant adsorption, thus accelerating the CO 2 reduction reaction and simultaneously restraining the side H 2 evolution reaction. Optimized geometries for the adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on different metal surface and the corresponding lowest adsorption energy. Based on above analyses, a tentative mechanism for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over rGO/PdPtCu 2 L is proposed.As illustrated in Scheme 1, under visible light irradiation, the electrons in the HOMO of the light absorber Ru(bpy) 3 2 are excited to the LUMO, and the Ru (bpy) 3 2 is promoted to the excited state by the photogenerated holes left in the HOMO (Step 1).This excited state is then reductively quenched by rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to form an oxidized photosensitizer Ru (bpy) 3 3 , during which the photoexcited electrons are transferred to rGO nanosheets owing to the - interaction between them (Step 2).The transferred electrons then shift to the active sites on the surface of ultrathin PtCu shell with Pd core as the conducting channel 21.The interfacial charge polarization promotes the electron transfer from Pd core to PtCu shell, causing the higher electron density on the PtCu surface.Moreover, the electron accumulation together with the compressive strain on the ultrathin PtCu surface strengthens the adsorption of CO 2 molecules, selectively promoting the 8-electron reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 when compared with the 2-electron reduction to CO and H 2 (Step 3).The oxidized Ru(bpy) 3 3 is then reduced back to Ru(bpy) 3 2 by the sacrificial electron donor TEOA to form an entire photoredox cycle (Step 4)."}, {"llm generation": "rGO/PdPtCu 6 L", "source": "Especially, the yield rate of CH 4 over rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L drastically decreases to 83.2 and 72.3 mol gcat -1 h -1 , while the corresponding CH 4 selectivity also suffers a slight drop to 72.5 and 67.5, respectively, demonstrating the vital role of the PtCu thickness in the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.", "context": "As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the synthetic process of the stacked catalyst begins with the in situ growth of Pd nanocrystals on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by co-reducing K 2 PdCl 4 and exfoliated graphite oxide (GO) (Fig. S1) with ascorbic acid (AA) as the reductant and KBr as the facetselective capping agent 33.According to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, Pd nanocrystals with well-defined cubic profiles and average edge length of 10.7 nm are uniformly distributed on the surface of rGO nanosheets to fabricate the rGO/Pd precursor (Figs.1b,c andS2a).The continuous lattice fringes with a periodic spacing of 1.93 A in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image agree well with the 200 lattice spacing of face-centered cubic (fcc) Pd.The fringe orientation in the HRTEM image implies that the monocrystalline Pd nanocubes are enclosed by (100) facets (Fig. 1d) 34.Then ultrathin PtCu shells are selectively grown on the surface of Pd by simultaneous reduction of H 2 PtCl 6 and CuCl 2 with DMF (Fig. 1a).As shown in Fig. 1e and f, the cubic profile of Pd nanocrystals is well inherited after the coating of PtCu outer layer.Given that one face of Pd nanocube is in intimate contact with rGO, only five faces are covered by ultrathin PtCu shell to form semi-core-shell PdPtCu nanostructures.No nanoparticle in other morphology was observed in the TEM images.Owing to the higher electron density of PtCu than that of Pd, an image contrast between the inner gray core and exterior black shell can be clearly observed in the TEM and HRTEM images (Fig. 1f,g).As can be seen from the HRTEM image, atomically thin PtCu shell with the same lattice spacing of 1.93 A is also a piece of single crystal exposed with (100) facets, which is epitaxially grown on the surface of Pd via the formation of perfect Pd(100)-PtCu(100) interfaces with a highly ordered atomic arrangement (Fig. 1g).Based on statistical analysis over more than 500 particles, the average edge length of the PdPtCu nanocrystals increases by 0.8 nm in comparison with that of bare Pd (Fig. S2b), corresponding to two atomic layers of PtCu shells.Thus the as-synthesized ternary photocatalyst is denoted as rGO/PdPtCu 2 L .The scanning TEM (STEM) image together with the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping profiles further confirms the cubic semi-core-shell structure consisting of Pd core and PtCu shell as well as the substrate containing C and O in the rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. 1h). As reference samples, two rGO/PdPtCu counterparts with thicker PtCu shell were also synthesized for comparison.As revealed by the TEM images in Fig. 2a,b,d ande, with the deposition of more Pt and Cu atoms onto the Pd surface, the cuboid shape of PdPtCu is well maintained except the increased thickness of black PtCu outer layers.According to the results of average edge length measurement, the thickness of PtCu is determined to be around 6 and 30 at.layers, and the corresponding sample is named as rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , respectively (Fig. S2c,d).To further examine the PtCu shell thickness, the molar ratios of Pd to Pt and Cu were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Table S1), which turn out to be consistent with those determined by the size analyses.Moreover, the ICP-MS results indicate the approximate Pt/Cu molar ratio of around 70: 30 in all the rGO/PdPtCu samples (Table S1).Similar to the case of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , both Pd(100) facet of the core and PtCu(100) facet of the shell can be observed in the HRTEM image of rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L (Fig. 2c).In sharp contrast, in the HRTEM image of rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L , due to the coverage of thicker shell, only the lattice of PtCu(100) plane can be detected (Fig. 2f).Furthermore, as the shell thickness increases, the lattice spacing of PtCu experiences a gradual increase from 1.93 A of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to 1.94 A of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and to 1.96 A of rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , which provides evidence that lattice mismatched epitaxy between Pd core and PtCu shell results in compressive strain on the ultrathin PtCu overlayers.When the shell thickness becomes greater, the strain gradually reduces and finally to the level of that of bulk PtCu 353637. The chemical states of the rGO/PdPtCu samples with different PtCu thicknesses were then comparatively analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).All the rGO/PdPtCu samples demonstrate similar C1s and O1s signals, in which the higher peak intensity of sp 2 carbon (284.5 eV) relative to those of C-O (285.9 eV) and C--O (288.3 eV) groups implies the effective removal of oxygencontaining functional groups (Fig. S3) 38,39.The deconvoluted peaks in the high-resolution spectra of Pd3d, Pt4f and Cu2p indicate the dominant metallic state and small amounts of ionic state, which are typical features for solution-synthesized metal nanocrystals (Fig. 2g-i) 4041424344.With the increasing PtCu thickness from rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and to rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , owing to the limited detection depth of XPS, Pt4f and Cu2p signals become stronger while Pd signal gradually weakens.Moreover, as the PtCu shell shrinks in the reverse order, Pd3d peaks shift to higher binding energies while Pt4f and Cu2p peaks to lower ones, suggesting that more significant charge re-distribution occurs between electron-deficient Pd cores and electron-rich PtCu shells. In addition to above samples, other reference samples were also prepared for comparison.Bare rGO was obtained under the same experimental condition as rGO/Pd except the absence of K 2 PdCl 4 (Fig. S4), while rGO/PdPt 6 L exposing with Pt(100) facets was synthesized through the same method as rGO/PdPtCu 6 L except without the addition of CuCl 2 (Fig. S5).Bare Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu core-shell nanocubes without rGO were also synthesized for comparison (Fig. S6).The structural information of the samples was revealed by the combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform Fig. 2. Electronic microscopy characterizations of reference samples and comparative spectroscopic characterizations of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L with reference samples: (a-f) TEM and HRTEM images of (a-c) rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and (d-f) rGO/PdPtCu 30 L ; (g-i) high-resolution XPS spectra of rGO/PdPtCu samples: (g) Pd3d, (h) Pt4f and (i) Cu2p high-resolution spectrum.infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.XRD patterns demonstrate the disappearance of the strong GO peak centered at 2 10.2 in the rGO based samples, further proving the exfoliation and reduction of GO (Fig. S7) 45,46.In addition to the broad peaks of rGO, all other peaks in the pattern of rGO/Pd can be assigned to fcc Pd (JCPDS 87-0639).With the further grown of PtCu on the Pd, no new peak appears, implying the same fcc phase of core and shell.As the PtCu thickness gradually increases from rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , the intensity-enhanced metal peaks gradually shift towards those of standard Pt (JCPDS 65-2868) rather than Cu (JCPDS 01-1241), further indicating the majority of Pt and minority of Cu in the PtCu shell.Additionally, when compared with the XRD pattern of PdPt, there is an obvious peak broadening of PdPtCu towards the direction of standard Cu (JCPDS 01-1241), and the peak broadening effect is more obvious at a higher 2 value, further confirming the presence of Cu in the Pt lattice (Fig. S8) 47.As depicted in the FTIR spectra of the rGO containing samples (Fig. S9), the remarkable decrease in the intensities of GO peaks corresponding to the stretching of oxygen containing functionalities including O-H (3400 cm -1 ), C--O (1734 cm -1 ), carboxy C-O (1400 cm -1 ), epoxy C-O (1228 cm -1 ) and alkoxy C-O (1065 cm -1 ) further evidences the reduction of GO 48,49.Such a phenomenon is further confirmed by the significant increase in the intensity ratio of D band to G band (I D /I G ) in the Raman spectra, which is resulted from the presence of unrepaired defects after the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups (Fig. S10) 50,51. Upon acquiring the structural and composition information, the performances of the rGO based samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were evaluated with photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 as the light absorber and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the hole scavenger, respectively.Fig. 3a summarizes the catalytic performance of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L in reference to control samples under visible light irradiation (420 780 nm) in the first 4 h of reaction.For all the samples, the yields of reduction products gradually increase with the extension of the reaction time (Fig. S11).The corresponding product selectivity in Fig. 3b was calculated based on the average evolution rates of the reduction products as well as the electrons required to generate the products according to Eq. 3.No gas product was detected in the reference experiments including in the dark, without Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 and without TEOA.When the system was operated in absence of catalyst or in presence of rGO without metal anchored, trace amounts of H 2 and CO were detected.With the further combination of rGO with Pd, remarkable enhancements in the H 2 and CO evolution were observed along with the generation of trace amount of CH 4 .After the coating of Pd with ultrathin PtCu shell, the CH 4 production over rGO/PdPtCu 2 L is drastically improved and the rate reaches up to as high as 129.7 mol gcat -1 h -1 , 56.4 times higher than that of rGO/Pd, offering high selectivity of 80.8 towards CH 4 production over competing H 2 and CO generation.Meanwhile, the H 2 and CO evolution rates also experience a considerable decline and rise, respectively, implying that the PtCu coverage facilitates the CO 2 fixation while suppresses the proton reduction.Further increasing the thickness of PtCu shell results in a gradual decrease in the CO and CH 4 production.Especially, the yield rate of CH 4 over rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L drastically decreases to 83.2 and 72.3 mol gcat -1 h -1 , while the corresponding CH 4 selectivity also suffers a slight drop to 72.5 and 67.5, respectively, demonstrating the vital role of the PtCu thickness in the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.In sharp contrast to rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L , with the approximate shell thickness, rGO/PdPt 6 L exhibits extremely higher H 2 generation but drastically lower CH 4 rate and selectivity, providing proof that the incorporation of Cu atoms into Pt surface holds the key to the high activity and selectivity of CH 4 production.It is worth noting that no liquid phase reduction product (e.g., CH 3 OH and HCOOH) was detected for all the samples during the photocatalytic process.When Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu without rGO were used as photocatalyts, no gas product was detected in the absence of Ru (pby) 3 Cl 2 , while trace amounts of H 2 and CO were measured in the presence of Ru complex, highlighting the pivotal role of rGO in the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. S12). For rGO/PdPtCu 2 L with the best photocatalytic performance, the activity and selectivity in CH 4 production are comparable to those of the reported state-of-the-art catalysts with Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 as the light sensitizer and TEOA as the hole scavenger, respectively (Table S2).To gain more information on the photocatalytic system, a series of control experiments with different reaction conditions have been conducted.The wavelength-dependent photocatalytic experiments was further assessed using Xe lamp equipped with different band filters.The trend of H 2 , CO and CH 4 yields of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L at different wavelengths match well with light absorption profile of Ru(bpy)3Cl2, corroborating that the CO 2 reduction is driven by the light excitation of the photosensitizer (Fig. 3c) 52.When using Ar as the gas feedstock instead of CO 2 , no CO and CH 4 is detected, manifesting that the produced CO and CH 4 actually come from the reduction of CO 2 53.To further verify the origin of produced CO and CH 4 , the isotopic 13 CO 2 was used as the reactant to trace the carbon source with rGO/PdPtCu 2 L as a catalyst.As identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the strong signals at m/z 29 and m/z 17 corresponds to the generated 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , respectively, evincing that the CO and CH 4 indeed originate from the photoreduction of CO 2 (Fig. 3d) 54,55.Noting that the m/z 16 in the mass spectra does not correspond to 12 CH 4 , but the fragment ions of 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , respectively.Apart from high activity and selectivity, the rGO/PdPtCu 2 L also delivers high catalytic stability in CH 4 generation.As shown in Fig. 3e, the recycled catalyst retain 95.3 of its original CH 4 evolution rate without obvious decay in the selectivity after five successive 4 h runs.To further prove the repeatability of the catalyst, TEM images, XRD pattern and XPS spectra after the cyclic tests were compared with those of the fresh one (Figs.S13 andS14).The well-maintained morphology, structure and composition validate the excellent reusability of the designed rGO/PdPtCu 2 L catalyst in CO 2 photoreduction.Notably, after the cycles, the new emerging Ru3d peaks provide evidence that Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 is adsorbed on the rGO (Fig. S14b), while the attenuated peak intensities of oxygen-containing function groups in C1s and O1s spectra imply the deeper photoreducion of rGO nanosheets by transferred excited electrons from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 light sensitizer (Fig. S14b,c) 17. Furthermore, in comparison with the FTIR spectra of fresh rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , additional absorption peaks at 775 cm -1 and 730 cm -1 after the photocatalytic cycles originate from the characteristic vibrations of adsorbed Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , confirming the - interaction between rGO and Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (Fig. S15). To further explore the key factors determining the photocatalytic performance, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was firstly employed to examine the light absorption behaviors of the rGO based catalysts.As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples exhibit comparable light absorption without obvious absorption edge, which is a typical feature for zero-bandgap graphene based materials.With the addition of the catalysts into Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution, there is a slight enhancement in the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4b).This enhancement is attributed to the intrinsic light absorption of rGO based catalysts, which can be reflected by the incremental light absorption of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 upon the addition of increasing amounts of rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. S16a).Owing to the comparable optical absorption property of the rGO based samples, almost no difference in the absorption spectra of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 solution is observed in the presence of the same concentration of different samples, excluding the influence of the light absorption on the photocatalytic performance. The charge separation and transfer behaviors in the rGO based samples were then reflected by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.As sketched in Fig. 4c, Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution excited at 400 nm shows a strong emission peak around 610 nm.With the further addition of rGO based samples, the PL of the excited Ru (bpy) 3 2 is obviously quenched, and the quenching degree gradually increases with the increasing amount of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. S16b).The above result suggests the suppression of radiative charge recombination resulted from the transfer of photoexcited electrons from Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 light absorber to rGO based catalysts.With the same dosage of the catalysts, the PL quenching degrees are in the order: rGO rGO/ Pd rGO/PdPtCu 30 L rGO/PdPtCu 6 L rGO/PdPt 6 L rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L , signifying that the metal configuration on the rGO nanosheets is critical to the charge separation efficiency.When bare Pd nanocubes were added into the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 solution in the absence of rGO, no apparent PL quenching occurs (Fig. S17), which highlights the critical role of rGO in promoting the charge transfer and separation, thus providing additional evidence that Ru(bpy) 3 2 is adsorbed on the rGO nanosheets rather than the metal particles.Time-resolved PL decay spectroscopy was then employed to further reveal the charge dynamic behaviors.As depicted in Fig. 4d, all emission patterns of excited Ru (bpy) 3 2 aqueous solution in the absence or presence of catalysts follow one exponential decay 56.Compared to blank Ru(bpy) 3 2 solution (210.1 ns), shortened PL lifetime can be observed in the presence of rGO (202.8 ns), rGO/Pd (196.9 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (182.0 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 6 L (189.1 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 30 L (189.9 ns) and rGO/PdPt 6 L (188.0 ns), respectively (Table S3).The decline of PL lifetime follows the same sequence as the PL quenching degree, further evidencing more efficient suppression of detrimental charge recombination in rGO/PdPtCu 2 L 17,57,58. To gain an in-depth insight into the improved charge separation and transfer kinetics of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been carried out to investigate the interfacial charge transfer resistance.As displayed in Fig. 4e, the Nyquist plot of rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L possesses the smallest arc radius among the different samples, revealing the lowest resistance for electron migration.Especially, the gradually reduced radii of Nyquist plots are observed when the thickness of PtCu shell decreases from 30 to 6 and then to 2 at.layers, disclosing the shell thickness dependent charge transfer kinetics.The above statements are further confirmed by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves examined with Ar-saturated KHCO 3 solution as electrolyte, from which it can be seen that rGO/PdPtCu 2 L exhibits the highest current densities, signifying that the synergism of Pd core and ultrathin PtCu shell efficiently promotes the separation and transfer of charge carriers, thus accelerating the CO 2 -to-CO/CH 4 conversion. It should be noted that the shell thickness is not the only key variable influencing the efficiency of charge separation and migration.Particularly, with the same shell thickness, the larger current density of rGO/ PdPt 6 L over that of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L together with the smaller Nyquist arc and higher PL quenching degree validates that pure Pt shell is more conducive to smooth electron movement relative to PtCu shell.To further decipher the charge migration processes, density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed to evaluate the electron flow behavior in detail.According to the aforementioned HRTEM results, Pd (100), Pt(100) and PtCu(100) facets are the most predominantly exposed crystallographic planes for rGO/Pd, rGO/PdPt and rGO/ PdPtCu samples, respectively, which were selected as the model surfaces to ensure the consistency of the theoretical models and the experimental results.According to the electrostatic potential, the work functions of PtCu 1 L , PtCu 2 L , PtCu 3 L and PtCu 4 L were calculated to be 4.98, 5.37, 5.49 and 5.52 eV, which are basically higher than those of rGO (4.33 eV) and Pd(100) (5.26 eV), but lower than that of Pt(100) (5.63 eV) (Table S4).Wherefore, it can be inferred that the Fermi level is in the order of rGO Pd PtCu Pt.As it is well documented that electrons will flow from the material with higher Fermi level to that with lower one 59, one can rationally deduce that electrons on the Pd core will migrate to the PtCu (or Pt) shell with more than one-layer thickness.This redistribution of charge is further revealed by experimental XPS results, implying the electron movement between the interfacial materials (Fig. 2g-i).Furthermore, valence-band XPS spectra manifest that the energy difference between the valence band (VB) edge and Fermi level is nearly zero for the rGO based samples, evidencing that the introduction of Pd core and PtCu (or Pt) shell does not alter the zero-bandgap feature of rGO (Fig. S18). Considering that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 is at 3.19 eV and its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is at 5.68 eV relative to the vacuum level according to previous works 60,61, the Fermi levels of rGO, Pd, PtCu and Pt are lower than the LUMO of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 so that the photoexcited electrons in the LUMO of the light absorber can be transferred to the Fermi levels of them.The photogenerated electrons are preferentially transferred from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 to rGO through - interfacial interaction between them, which subsequently migrate to Pd cores and then to PtCu (or Pt) shells in larger work functions for CO 2 reduction (Fig. 5a).Owing to the higher work function of Pt compared to that of PtCu, the larger work function difference between Pd and Pt produces an enlarged driving force for promoted interfacial electron transfer from core to shell, well explaining the smoother charge separation and migration in rGO/PdPt 6 L relative to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L . Then the question comes up to reveal the role of PtCu thickness on the charge separation and transfer for the rGO/PdPtCu samples with the same exposed facets of PtCu(100).To investigate this mechanism, the interfacial models of Pd(100)PtCu nL with one to four atomic layers were established and the corresponding charge analyses were performed to track the charge migration behavior.As depicted in Fig. 5b, driving by the work function difference, electrons will flow from Pd to PtCu when two materials are combined together.That is, electrons could be accumulated on the upper PtCu shells.Moreover, according to the Bader charge analysis, this electron accumulation will experience a gradual decline as the PtCu thickness increases from one to four layers (Table S5), which can be clearly visualized from the differential charge density in Fig. 5b.The thickness-dependent charge separation will lead to the variation of the interfacial polarization 62, which could further contribute to the robust electron trapping ability of PdPtCu shells with lower-layer PtCu and thus facilitating the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion efficiency.It is worth noting that the plasmonic absorption band of Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu is located in UV region (Fig. S19), and the contribution of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on the charge transfer/separation can be ruled out 6364656667. In addition to the charge separation and transfer, the ultimate photocatalytic property is also correlated with the surface reactivity of the catalysts.As discussed before, despite the superior electron separation/ transfer behavior, the activity and selectivity of rGO/PdPt 6 L in CH production are much lower as compared with those of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L , implying that the shell thickness dependent charge kinetics is not the only key factor determining the eventual photocatalytic performance.PtCu surface may provide more favorable reaction sites for CO 2 -to-CH Cl 2 to rGO/PdPtCu 2 L catalyst; (b) differential charge density determined by first-principles simulations illustrating the electron distribution between Pd(100) substrate and PtCu(100) shell when the PtCu shell thickness is altered from 1 to 4 layers.The Pd, Pt and Cu atoms are marked in green, gray and blue, respectively.The olive and cyan colors represent an increase and decrease in electron density, respectively.conversion compared to Pt surface.According to the CO 2 temperatureprogrammed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) profiles of rGO/Pd, rGO/PdPt 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 6 L samples, the peak at around 100 C can be assigned to physisorbed CO 2 , while another peak at around 500-600 C originates from the chemisorbed CO 2 (Fig. S20).The desorption peak intensity of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L at high temperature is much higher than those of rGO/Pd and rGO/PdPt 6 L , proving the better CO 2 adsorption on the PtCu(100) surface.Moreover, as demonstrated by the LSV curves conducted in Ar-saturated and CO 2 -saturated 0.5 M KHCO 3 electrolyte, respectively, the higher current densities under CO 2 atmosphere compared to those under Ar bubbling can be assigned to the cathodic current generated by CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 4f, rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L exhibits a larger current density enhancement as compared with rGO/Pd and rGO/PdPt 6 L , confirming that the PtCu(100) surface is more active for CO 2 reduction compared to Pd(100) and Pt(100) surface.Moreover, larger difference in the current density between Ar and CO 2 can be observed for rGO/PdPtCu 2 L compared to those for rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , meaning that the surface reactivity of PtCu(100) is also negatively correlative to the thickness of the shell. To gain a deep insight into the influence of PtCu thickness on the surface reaction, the chemisorption behavior of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on the Pd, Pt and PtCu surfaces was further described by the DFT calculations.As illustrated in Table 1, one can clearly see that PtCu surface exhibits much more negative CO 2 adsorption energies (ranging from -0.27 to -0.92 eV) when compared with those of Pd(100) (-0.02 eV) and Pt(100) (-0.04 eV), implying the substantially enhanced interaction between CO 2 molecules and PtCu surface.Additionally, as the thickness of PtCu increases from 1 to 4 at.layers, the adsorption energy of CO 2 experiences a gradual decline from -0.92 to -0.70 eV, and then to -0.59 and -0.27 eV, which suggests the steadily weakened CO 2 interaction.This shell-thickness dependence of CO 2 adsorption can be rationally ascribed to the synergistic interplay of surface strain and interfacial polarization 68,69.Interestingly, a more favorable CO 2 adsorption can be expected on the surface of PtCu 1 L and PtCu 2 L with higher binding strength relative to H 2 O molecules.In stark contrast, when compared to the CO 2 adsorption energies (E adCO2 ), the corresponding H 2 O adsorption energies (E adH2O ) on the Pd and Pt surface are much more negative, evincing a dominant proton reduction pathway.When the PtCu shell is thin enough, it is also possible that a two-step cascade catalytic process occurs, including the CO 2 -to-CO conversion on Pd core and the further CO-to-CH 4 conversion on PtCu shell 70,71.Taken together, the PtCu shell with lower atomic thickness promotes both the charge separation and the targeted reactant adsorption, thus accelerating the CO 2 reduction reaction and simultaneously restraining the side H 2 evolution reaction. Optimized geometries for the adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on different metal surface and the corresponding lowest adsorption energy. Based on above analyses, a tentative mechanism for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over rGO/PdPtCu 2 L is proposed.As illustrated in Scheme 1, under visible light irradiation, the electrons in the HOMO of the light absorber Ru(bpy) 3 2 are excited to the LUMO, and the Ru (bpy) 3 2 is promoted to the excited state by the photogenerated holes left in the HOMO (Step 1).This excited state is then reductively quenched by rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to form an oxidized photosensitizer Ru (bpy) 3 3 , during which the photoexcited electrons are transferred to rGO nanosheets owing to the - interaction between them (Step 2).The transferred electrons then shift to the active sites on the surface of ultrathin PtCu shell with Pd core as the conducting channel 21.The interfacial charge polarization promotes the electron transfer from Pd core to PtCu shell, causing the higher electron density on the PtCu surface.Moreover, the electron accumulation together with the compressive strain on the ultrathin PtCu surface strengthens the adsorption of CO 2 molecules, selectively promoting the 8-electron reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 when compared with the 2-electron reduction to CO and H 2 (Step 3).The oxidized Ru(bpy) 3 3 is then reduced back to Ru(bpy) 3 2 by the sacrificial electron donor TEOA to form an entire photoredox cycle (Step 4)."}, {"llm generation": "rGO/PdPtCu 30 L", "source": "Especially, the yield rate of CH 4 over rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L drastically decreases to 83.2 and 72.3 mol gcat -1 h -1 , while the corresponding CH 4 selectivity also suffers a slight drop to 72.5 and 67.5, respectively, demonstrating the vital role of the PtCu thickness in the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.", "context": "As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the synthetic process of the stacked catalyst begins with the in situ growth of Pd nanocrystals on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by co-reducing K 2 PdCl 4 and exfoliated graphite oxide (GO) (Fig. S1) with ascorbic acid (AA) as the reductant and KBr as the facetselective capping agent 33.According to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, Pd nanocrystals with well-defined cubic profiles and average edge length of 10.7 nm are uniformly distributed on the surface of rGO nanosheets to fabricate the rGO/Pd precursor (Figs.1b,c andS2a).The continuous lattice fringes with a periodic spacing of 1.93 A in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image agree well with the 200 lattice spacing of face-centered cubic (fcc) Pd.The fringe orientation in the HRTEM image implies that the monocrystalline Pd nanocubes are enclosed by (100) facets (Fig. 1d) 34.Then ultrathin PtCu shells are selectively grown on the surface of Pd by simultaneous reduction of H 2 PtCl 6 and CuCl 2 with DMF (Fig. 1a).As shown in Fig. 1e and f, the cubic profile of Pd nanocrystals is well inherited after the coating of PtCu outer layer.Given that one face of Pd nanocube is in intimate contact with rGO, only five faces are covered by ultrathin PtCu shell to form semi-core-shell PdPtCu nanostructures.No nanoparticle in other morphology was observed in the TEM images.Owing to the higher electron density of PtCu than that of Pd, an image contrast between the inner gray core and exterior black shell can be clearly observed in the TEM and HRTEM images (Fig. 1f,g).As can be seen from the HRTEM image, atomically thin PtCu shell with the same lattice spacing of 1.93 A is also a piece of single crystal exposed with (100) facets, which is epitaxially grown on the surface of Pd via the formation of perfect Pd(100)-PtCu(100) interfaces with a highly ordered atomic arrangement (Fig. 1g).Based on statistical analysis over more than 500 particles, the average edge length of the PdPtCu nanocrystals increases by 0.8 nm in comparison with that of bare Pd (Fig. S2b), corresponding to two atomic layers of PtCu shells.Thus the as-synthesized ternary photocatalyst is denoted as rGO/PdPtCu 2 L .The scanning TEM (STEM) image together with the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping profiles further confirms the cubic semi-core-shell structure consisting of Pd core and PtCu shell as well as the substrate containing C and O in the rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. 1h). As reference samples, two rGO/PdPtCu counterparts with thicker PtCu shell were also synthesized for comparison.As revealed by the TEM images in Fig. 2a,b,d ande, with the deposition of more Pt and Cu atoms onto the Pd surface, the cuboid shape of PdPtCu is well maintained except the increased thickness of black PtCu outer layers.According to the results of average edge length measurement, the thickness of PtCu is determined to be around 6 and 30 at.layers, and the corresponding sample is named as rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , respectively (Fig. S2c,d).To further examine the PtCu shell thickness, the molar ratios of Pd to Pt and Cu were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Table S1), which turn out to be consistent with those determined by the size analyses.Moreover, the ICP-MS results indicate the approximate Pt/Cu molar ratio of around 70: 30 in all the rGO/PdPtCu samples (Table S1).Similar to the case of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , both Pd(100) facet of the core and PtCu(100) facet of the shell can be observed in the HRTEM image of rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L (Fig. 2c).In sharp contrast, in the HRTEM image of rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L , due to the coverage of thicker shell, only the lattice of PtCu(100) plane can be detected (Fig. 2f).Furthermore, as the shell thickness increases, the lattice spacing of PtCu experiences a gradual increase from 1.93 A of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to 1.94 A of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and to 1.96 A of rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , which provides evidence that lattice mismatched epitaxy between Pd core and PtCu shell results in compressive strain on the ultrathin PtCu overlayers.When the shell thickness becomes greater, the strain gradually reduces and finally to the level of that of bulk PtCu 353637. The chemical states of the rGO/PdPtCu samples with different PtCu thicknesses were then comparatively analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).All the rGO/PdPtCu samples demonstrate similar C1s and O1s signals, in which the higher peak intensity of sp 2 carbon (284.5 eV) relative to those of C-O (285.9 eV) and C--O (288.3 eV) groups implies the effective removal of oxygencontaining functional groups (Fig. S3) 38,39.The deconvoluted peaks in the high-resolution spectra of Pd3d, Pt4f and Cu2p indicate the dominant metallic state and small amounts of ionic state, which are typical features for solution-synthesized metal nanocrystals (Fig. 2g-i) 4041424344.With the increasing PtCu thickness from rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and to rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , owing to the limited detection depth of XPS, Pt4f and Cu2p signals become stronger while Pd signal gradually weakens.Moreover, as the PtCu shell shrinks in the reverse order, Pd3d peaks shift to higher binding energies while Pt4f and Cu2p peaks to lower ones, suggesting that more significant charge re-distribution occurs between electron-deficient Pd cores and electron-rich PtCu shells. In addition to above samples, other reference samples were also prepared for comparison.Bare rGO was obtained under the same experimental condition as rGO/Pd except the absence of K 2 PdCl 4 (Fig. S4), while rGO/PdPt 6 L exposing with Pt(100) facets was synthesized through the same method as rGO/PdPtCu 6 L except without the addition of CuCl 2 (Fig. S5).Bare Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu core-shell nanocubes without rGO were also synthesized for comparison (Fig. S6).The structural information of the samples was revealed by the combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform Fig. 2. Electronic microscopy characterizations of reference samples and comparative spectroscopic characterizations of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L with reference samples: (a-f) TEM and HRTEM images of (a-c) rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and (d-f) rGO/PdPtCu 30 L ; (g-i) high-resolution XPS spectra of rGO/PdPtCu samples: (g) Pd3d, (h) Pt4f and (i) Cu2p high-resolution spectrum.infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.XRD patterns demonstrate the disappearance of the strong GO peak centered at 2 10.2 in the rGO based samples, further proving the exfoliation and reduction of GO (Fig. S7) 45,46.In addition to the broad peaks of rGO, all other peaks in the pattern of rGO/Pd can be assigned to fcc Pd (JCPDS 87-0639).With the further grown of PtCu on the Pd, no new peak appears, implying the same fcc phase of core and shell.As the PtCu thickness gradually increases from rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , the intensity-enhanced metal peaks gradually shift towards those of standard Pt (JCPDS 65-2868) rather than Cu (JCPDS 01-1241), further indicating the majority of Pt and minority of Cu in the PtCu shell.Additionally, when compared with the XRD pattern of PdPt, there is an obvious peak broadening of PdPtCu towards the direction of standard Cu (JCPDS 01-1241), and the peak broadening effect is more obvious at a higher 2 value, further confirming the presence of Cu in the Pt lattice (Fig. S8) 47.As depicted in the FTIR spectra of the rGO containing samples (Fig. S9), the remarkable decrease in the intensities of GO peaks corresponding to the stretching of oxygen containing functionalities including O-H (3400 cm -1 ), C--O (1734 cm -1 ), carboxy C-O (1400 cm -1 ), epoxy C-O (1228 cm -1 ) and alkoxy C-O (1065 cm -1 ) further evidences the reduction of GO 48,49.Such a phenomenon is further confirmed by the significant increase in the intensity ratio of D band to G band (I D /I G ) in the Raman spectra, which is resulted from the presence of unrepaired defects after the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups (Fig. S10) 50,51. Upon acquiring the structural and composition information, the performances of the rGO based samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were evaluated with photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 as the light absorber and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the hole scavenger, respectively.Fig. 3a summarizes the catalytic performance of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L in reference to control samples under visible light irradiation (420 780 nm) in the first 4 h of reaction.For all the samples, the yields of reduction products gradually increase with the extension of the reaction time (Fig. S11).The corresponding product selectivity in Fig. 3b was calculated based on the average evolution rates of the reduction products as well as the electrons required to generate the products according to Eq. 3.No gas product was detected in the reference experiments including in the dark, without Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 and without TEOA.When the system was operated in absence of catalyst or in presence of rGO without metal anchored, trace amounts of H 2 and CO were detected.With the further combination of rGO with Pd, remarkable enhancements in the H 2 and CO evolution were observed along with the generation of trace amount of CH 4 .After the coating of Pd with ultrathin PtCu shell, the CH 4 production over rGO/PdPtCu 2 L is drastically improved and the rate reaches up to as high as 129.7 mol gcat -1 h -1 , 56.4 times higher than that of rGO/Pd, offering high selectivity of 80.8 towards CH 4 production over competing H 2 and CO generation.Meanwhile, the H 2 and CO evolution rates also experience a considerable decline and rise, respectively, implying that the PtCu coverage facilitates the CO 2 fixation while suppresses the proton reduction.Further increasing the thickness of PtCu shell results in a gradual decrease in the CO and CH 4 production.Especially, the yield rate of CH 4 over rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L drastically decreases to 83.2 and 72.3 mol gcat -1 h -1 , while the corresponding CH 4 selectivity also suffers a slight drop to 72.5 and 67.5, respectively, demonstrating the vital role of the PtCu thickness in the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.In sharp contrast to rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L , with the approximate shell thickness, rGO/PdPt 6 L exhibits extremely higher H 2 generation but drastically lower CH 4 rate and selectivity, providing proof that the incorporation of Cu atoms into Pt surface holds the key to the high activity and selectivity of CH 4 production.It is worth noting that no liquid phase reduction product (e.g., CH 3 OH and HCOOH) was detected for all the samples during the photocatalytic process.When Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu without rGO were used as photocatalyts, no gas product was detected in the absence of Ru (pby) 3 Cl 2 , while trace amounts of H 2 and CO were measured in the presence of Ru complex, highlighting the pivotal role of rGO in the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. S12). For rGO/PdPtCu 2 L with the best photocatalytic performance, the activity and selectivity in CH 4 production are comparable to those of the reported state-of-the-art catalysts with Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 as the light sensitizer and TEOA as the hole scavenger, respectively (Table S2).To gain more information on the photocatalytic system, a series of control experiments with different reaction conditions have been conducted.The wavelength-dependent photocatalytic experiments was further assessed using Xe lamp equipped with different band filters.The trend of H 2 , CO and CH 4 yields of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L at different wavelengths match well with light absorption profile of Ru(bpy)3Cl2, corroborating that the CO 2 reduction is driven by the light excitation of the photosensitizer (Fig. 3c) 52.When using Ar as the gas feedstock instead of CO 2 , no CO and CH 4 is detected, manifesting that the produced CO and CH 4 actually come from the reduction of CO 2 53.To further verify the origin of produced CO and CH 4 , the isotopic 13 CO 2 was used as the reactant to trace the carbon source with rGO/PdPtCu 2 L as a catalyst.As identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the strong signals at m/z 29 and m/z 17 corresponds to the generated 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , respectively, evincing that the CO and CH 4 indeed originate from the photoreduction of CO 2 (Fig. 3d) 54,55.Noting that the m/z 16 in the mass spectra does not correspond to 12 CH 4 , but the fragment ions of 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , respectively.Apart from high activity and selectivity, the rGO/PdPtCu 2 L also delivers high catalytic stability in CH 4 generation.As shown in Fig. 3e, the recycled catalyst retain 95.3 of its original CH 4 evolution rate without obvious decay in the selectivity after five successive 4 h runs.To further prove the repeatability of the catalyst, TEM images, XRD pattern and XPS spectra after the cyclic tests were compared with those of the fresh one (Figs.S13 andS14).The well-maintained morphology, structure and composition validate the excellent reusability of the designed rGO/PdPtCu 2 L catalyst in CO 2 photoreduction.Notably, after the cycles, the new emerging Ru3d peaks provide evidence that Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 is adsorbed on the rGO (Fig. S14b), while the attenuated peak intensities of oxygen-containing function groups in C1s and O1s spectra imply the deeper photoreducion of rGO nanosheets by transferred excited electrons from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 light sensitizer (Fig. S14b,c) 17. Furthermore, in comparison with the FTIR spectra of fresh rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , additional absorption peaks at 775 cm -1 and 730 cm -1 after the photocatalytic cycles originate from the characteristic vibrations of adsorbed Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , confirming the - interaction between rGO and Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (Fig. S15). To further explore the key factors determining the photocatalytic performance, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was firstly employed to examine the light absorption behaviors of the rGO based catalysts.As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples exhibit comparable light absorption without obvious absorption edge, which is a typical feature for zero-bandgap graphene based materials.With the addition of the catalysts into Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution, there is a slight enhancement in the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4b).This enhancement is attributed to the intrinsic light absorption of rGO based catalysts, which can be reflected by the incremental light absorption of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 upon the addition of increasing amounts of rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. S16a).Owing to the comparable optical absorption property of the rGO based samples, almost no difference in the absorption spectra of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 solution is observed in the presence of the same concentration of different samples, excluding the influence of the light absorption on the photocatalytic performance. The charge separation and transfer behaviors in the rGO based samples were then reflected by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.As sketched in Fig. 4c, Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution excited at 400 nm shows a strong emission peak around 610 nm.With the further addition of rGO based samples, the PL of the excited Ru (bpy) 3 2 is obviously quenched, and the quenching degree gradually increases with the increasing amount of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. S16b).The above result suggests the suppression of radiative charge recombination resulted from the transfer of photoexcited electrons from Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 light absorber to rGO based catalysts.With the same dosage of the catalysts, the PL quenching degrees are in the order: rGO rGO/ Pd rGO/PdPtCu 30 L rGO/PdPtCu 6 L rGO/PdPt 6 L rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L , signifying that the metal configuration on the rGO nanosheets is critical to the charge separation efficiency.When bare Pd nanocubes were added into the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 solution in the absence of rGO, no apparent PL quenching occurs (Fig. S17), which highlights the critical role of rGO in promoting the charge transfer and separation, thus providing additional evidence that Ru(bpy) 3 2 is adsorbed on the rGO nanosheets rather than the metal particles.Time-resolved PL decay spectroscopy was then employed to further reveal the charge dynamic behaviors.As depicted in Fig. 4d, all emission patterns of excited Ru (bpy) 3 2 aqueous solution in the absence or presence of catalysts follow one exponential decay 56.Compared to blank Ru(bpy) 3 2 solution (210.1 ns), shortened PL lifetime can be observed in the presence of rGO (202.8 ns), rGO/Pd (196.9 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (182.0 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 6 L (189.1 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 30 L (189.9 ns) and rGO/PdPt 6 L (188.0 ns), respectively (Table S3).The decline of PL lifetime follows the same sequence as the PL quenching degree, further evidencing more efficient suppression of detrimental charge recombination in rGO/PdPtCu 2 L 17,57,58. To gain an in-depth insight into the improved charge separation and transfer kinetics of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been carried out to investigate the interfacial charge transfer resistance.As displayed in Fig. 4e, the Nyquist plot of rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L possesses the smallest arc radius among the different samples, revealing the lowest resistance for electron migration.Especially, the gradually reduced radii of Nyquist plots are observed when the thickness of PtCu shell decreases from 30 to 6 and then to 2 at.layers, disclosing the shell thickness dependent charge transfer kinetics.The above statements are further confirmed by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves examined with Ar-saturated KHCO 3 solution as electrolyte, from which it can be seen that rGO/PdPtCu 2 L exhibits the highest current densities, signifying that the synergism of Pd core and ultrathin PtCu shell efficiently promotes the separation and transfer of charge carriers, thus accelerating the CO 2 -to-CO/CH 4 conversion. It should be noted that the shell thickness is not the only key variable influencing the efficiency of charge separation and migration.Particularly, with the same shell thickness, the larger current density of rGO/ PdPt 6 L over that of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L together with the smaller Nyquist arc and higher PL quenching degree validates that pure Pt shell is more conducive to smooth electron movement relative to PtCu shell.To further decipher the charge migration processes, density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed to evaluate the electron flow behavior in detail.According to the aforementioned HRTEM results, Pd (100), Pt(100) and PtCu(100) facets are the most predominantly exposed crystallographic planes for rGO/Pd, rGO/PdPt and rGO/ PdPtCu samples, respectively, which were selected as the model surfaces to ensure the consistency of the theoretical models and the experimental results.According to the electrostatic potential, the work functions of PtCu 1 L , PtCu 2 L , PtCu 3 L and PtCu 4 L were calculated to be 4.98, 5.37, 5.49 and 5.52 eV, which are basically higher than those of rGO (4.33 eV) and Pd(100) (5.26 eV), but lower than that of Pt(100) (5.63 eV) (Table S4).Wherefore, it can be inferred that the Fermi level is in the order of rGO Pd PtCu Pt.As it is well documented that electrons will flow from the material with higher Fermi level to that with lower one 59, one can rationally deduce that electrons on the Pd core will migrate to the PtCu (or Pt) shell with more than one-layer thickness.This redistribution of charge is further revealed by experimental XPS results, implying the electron movement between the interfacial materials (Fig. 2g-i).Furthermore, valence-band XPS spectra manifest that the energy difference between the valence band (VB) edge and Fermi level is nearly zero for the rGO based samples, evidencing that the introduction of Pd core and PtCu (or Pt) shell does not alter the zero-bandgap feature of rGO (Fig. S18). Considering that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 is at 3.19 eV and its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is at 5.68 eV relative to the vacuum level according to previous works 60,61, the Fermi levels of rGO, Pd, PtCu and Pt are lower than the LUMO of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 so that the photoexcited electrons in the LUMO of the light absorber can be transferred to the Fermi levels of them.The photogenerated electrons are preferentially transferred from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 to rGO through - interfacial interaction between them, which subsequently migrate to Pd cores and then to PtCu (or Pt) shells in larger work functions for CO 2 reduction (Fig. 5a).Owing to the higher work function of Pt compared to that of PtCu, the larger work function difference between Pd and Pt produces an enlarged driving force for promoted interfacial electron transfer from core to shell, well explaining the smoother charge separation and migration in rGO/PdPt 6 L relative to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L . Then the question comes up to reveal the role of PtCu thickness on the charge separation and transfer for the rGO/PdPtCu samples with the same exposed facets of PtCu(100).To investigate this mechanism, the interfacial models of Pd(100)PtCu nL with one to four atomic layers were established and the corresponding charge analyses were performed to track the charge migration behavior.As depicted in Fig. 5b, driving by the work function difference, electrons will flow from Pd to PtCu when two materials are combined together.That is, electrons could be accumulated on the upper PtCu shells.Moreover, according to the Bader charge analysis, this electron accumulation will experience a gradual decline as the PtCu thickness increases from one to four layers (Table S5), which can be clearly visualized from the differential charge density in Fig. 5b.The thickness-dependent charge separation will lead to the variation of the interfacial polarization 62, which could further contribute to the robust electron trapping ability of PdPtCu shells with lower-layer PtCu and thus facilitating the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion efficiency.It is worth noting that the plasmonic absorption band of Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu is located in UV region (Fig. S19), and the contribution of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on the charge transfer/separation can be ruled out 6364656667. In addition to the charge separation and transfer, the ultimate photocatalytic property is also correlated with the surface reactivity of the catalysts.As discussed before, despite the superior electron separation/ transfer behavior, the activity and selectivity of rGO/PdPt 6 L in CH production are much lower as compared with those of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L , implying that the shell thickness dependent charge kinetics is not the only key factor determining the eventual photocatalytic performance.PtCu surface may provide more favorable reaction sites for CO 2 -to-CH Cl 2 to rGO/PdPtCu 2 L catalyst; (b) differential charge density determined by first-principles simulations illustrating the electron distribution between Pd(100) substrate and PtCu(100) shell when the PtCu shell thickness is altered from 1 to 4 layers.The Pd, Pt and Cu atoms are marked in green, gray and blue, respectively.The olive and cyan colors represent an increase and decrease in electron density, respectively.conversion compared to Pt surface.According to the CO 2 temperatureprogrammed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) profiles of rGO/Pd, rGO/PdPt 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 6 L samples, the peak at around 100 C can be assigned to physisorbed CO 2 , while another peak at around 500-600 C originates from the chemisorbed CO 2 (Fig. S20).The desorption peak intensity of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L at high temperature is much higher than those of rGO/Pd and rGO/PdPt 6 L , proving the better CO 2 adsorption on the PtCu(100) surface.Moreover, as demonstrated by the LSV curves conducted in Ar-saturated and CO 2 -saturated 0.5 M KHCO 3 electrolyte, respectively, the higher current densities under CO 2 atmosphere compared to those under Ar bubbling can be assigned to the cathodic current generated by CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 4f, rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L exhibits a larger current density enhancement as compared with rGO/Pd and rGO/PdPt 6 L , confirming that the PtCu(100) surface is more active for CO 2 reduction compared to Pd(100) and Pt(100) surface.Moreover, larger difference in the current density between Ar and CO 2 can be observed for rGO/PdPtCu 2 L compared to those for rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , meaning that the surface reactivity of PtCu(100) is also negatively correlative to the thickness of the shell. To gain a deep insight into the influence of PtCu thickness on the surface reaction, the chemisorption behavior of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on the Pd, Pt and PtCu surfaces was further described by the DFT calculations.As illustrated in Table 1, one can clearly see that PtCu surface exhibits much more negative CO 2 adsorption energies (ranging from -0.27 to -0.92 eV) when compared with those of Pd(100) (-0.02 eV) and Pt(100) (-0.04 eV), implying the substantially enhanced interaction between CO 2 molecules and PtCu surface.Additionally, as the thickness of PtCu increases from 1 to 4 at.layers, the adsorption energy of CO 2 experiences a gradual decline from -0.92 to -0.70 eV, and then to -0.59 and -0.27 eV, which suggests the steadily weakened CO 2 interaction.This shell-thickness dependence of CO 2 adsorption can be rationally ascribed to the synergistic interplay of surface strain and interfacial polarization 68,69.Interestingly, a more favorable CO 2 adsorption can be expected on the surface of PtCu 1 L and PtCu 2 L with higher binding strength relative to H 2 O molecules.In stark contrast, when compared to the CO 2 adsorption energies (E adCO2 ), the corresponding H 2 O adsorption energies (E adH2O ) on the Pd and Pt surface are much more negative, evincing a dominant proton reduction pathway.When the PtCu shell is thin enough, it is also possible that a two-step cascade catalytic process occurs, including the CO 2 -to-CO conversion on Pd core and the further CO-to-CH 4 conversion on PtCu shell 70,71.Taken together, the PtCu shell with lower atomic thickness promotes both the charge separation and the targeted reactant adsorption, thus accelerating the CO 2 reduction reaction and simultaneously restraining the side H 2 evolution reaction. Optimized geometries for the adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on different metal surface and the corresponding lowest adsorption energy. Based on above analyses, a tentative mechanism for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over rGO/PdPtCu 2 L is proposed.As illustrated in Scheme 1, under visible light irradiation, the electrons in the HOMO of the light absorber Ru(bpy) 3 2 are excited to the LUMO, and the Ru (bpy) 3 2 is promoted to the excited state by the photogenerated holes left in the HOMO (Step 1).This excited state is then reductively quenched by rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to form an oxidized photosensitizer Ru (bpy) 3 3 , during which the photoexcited electrons are transferred to rGO nanosheets owing to the - interaction between them (Step 2).The transferred electrons then shift to the active sites on the surface of ultrathin PtCu shell with Pd core as the conducting channel 21.The interfacial charge polarization promotes the electron transfer from Pd core to PtCu shell, causing the higher electron density on the PtCu surface.Moreover, the electron accumulation together with the compressive strain on the ultrathin PtCu surface strengthens the adsorption of CO 2 molecules, selectively promoting the 8-electron reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 when compared with the 2-electron reduction to CO and H 2 (Step 3).The oxidized Ru(bpy) 3 3 is then reduced back to Ru(bpy) 3 2 by the sacrificial electron donor TEOA to form an entire photoredox cycle (Step 4)."}, {"llm generation": "Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu (without rGO)", "source": "When Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu without rGO were used as photocatalyts, no gas product was detected in the absence of Ru (pby) 3 Cl 2 , while trace amounts of H 2 and CO were measured in the presence of Ru complex, highlighting the pivotal role of rGO in the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. S12).", "context": "As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the synthetic process of the stacked catalyst begins with the in situ growth of Pd nanocrystals on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by co-reducing K 2 PdCl 4 and exfoliated graphite oxide (GO) (Fig. S1) with ascorbic acid (AA) as the reductant and KBr as the facetselective capping agent 33.According to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, Pd nanocrystals with well-defined cubic profiles and average edge length of 10.7 nm are uniformly distributed on the surface of rGO nanosheets to fabricate the rGO/Pd precursor (Figs.1b,c andS2a).The continuous lattice fringes with a periodic spacing of 1.93 A in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image agree well with the 200 lattice spacing of face-centered cubic (fcc) Pd.The fringe orientation in the HRTEM image implies that the monocrystalline Pd nanocubes are enclosed by (100) facets (Fig. 1d) 34.Then ultrathin PtCu shells are selectively grown on the surface of Pd by simultaneous reduction of H 2 PtCl 6 and CuCl 2 with DMF (Fig. 1a).As shown in Fig. 1e and f, the cubic profile of Pd nanocrystals is well inherited after the coating of PtCu outer layer.Given that one face of Pd nanocube is in intimate contact with rGO, only five faces are covered by ultrathin PtCu shell to form semi-core-shell PdPtCu nanostructures.No nanoparticle in other morphology was observed in the TEM images.Owing to the higher electron density of PtCu than that of Pd, an image contrast between the inner gray core and exterior black shell can be clearly observed in the TEM and HRTEM images (Fig. 1f,g).As can be seen from the HRTEM image, atomically thin PtCu shell with the same lattice spacing of 1.93 A is also a piece of single crystal exposed with (100) facets, which is epitaxially grown on the surface of Pd via the formation of perfect Pd(100)-PtCu(100) interfaces with a highly ordered atomic arrangement (Fig. 1g).Based on statistical analysis over more than 500 particles, the average edge length of the PdPtCu nanocrystals increases by 0.8 nm in comparison with that of bare Pd (Fig. S2b), corresponding to two atomic layers of PtCu shells.Thus the as-synthesized ternary photocatalyst is denoted as rGO/PdPtCu 2 L .The scanning TEM (STEM) image together with the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping profiles further confirms the cubic semi-core-shell structure consisting of Pd core and PtCu shell as well as the substrate containing C and O in the rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. 1h). As reference samples, two rGO/PdPtCu counterparts with thicker PtCu shell were also synthesized for comparison.As revealed by the TEM images in Fig. 2a,b,d ande, with the deposition of more Pt and Cu atoms onto the Pd surface, the cuboid shape of PdPtCu is well maintained except the increased thickness of black PtCu outer layers.According to the results of average edge length measurement, the thickness of PtCu is determined to be around 6 and 30 at.layers, and the corresponding sample is named as rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , respectively (Fig. S2c,d).To further examine the PtCu shell thickness, the molar ratios of Pd to Pt and Cu were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Table S1), which turn out to be consistent with those determined by the size analyses.Moreover, the ICP-MS results indicate the approximate Pt/Cu molar ratio of around 70: 30 in all the rGO/PdPtCu samples (Table S1).Similar to the case of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , both Pd(100) facet of the core and PtCu(100) facet of the shell can be observed in the HRTEM image of rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L (Fig. 2c).In sharp contrast, in the HRTEM image of rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L , due to the coverage of thicker shell, only the lattice of PtCu(100) plane can be detected (Fig. 2f).Furthermore, as the shell thickness increases, the lattice spacing of PtCu experiences a gradual increase from 1.93 A of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to 1.94 A of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and to 1.96 A of rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , which provides evidence that lattice mismatched epitaxy between Pd core and PtCu shell results in compressive strain on the ultrathin PtCu overlayers.When the shell thickness becomes greater, the strain gradually reduces and finally to the level of that of bulk PtCu 353637. The chemical states of the rGO/PdPtCu samples with different PtCu thicknesses were then comparatively analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).All the rGO/PdPtCu samples demonstrate similar C1s and O1s signals, in which the higher peak intensity of sp 2 carbon (284.5 eV) relative to those of C-O (285.9 eV) and C--O (288.3 eV) groups implies the effective removal of oxygencontaining functional groups (Fig. S3) 38,39.The deconvoluted peaks in the high-resolution spectra of Pd3d, Pt4f and Cu2p indicate the dominant metallic state and small amounts of ionic state, which are typical features for solution-synthesized metal nanocrystals (Fig. 2g-i) 4041424344.With the increasing PtCu thickness from rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and to rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , owing to the limited detection depth of XPS, Pt4f and Cu2p signals become stronger while Pd signal gradually weakens.Moreover, as the PtCu shell shrinks in the reverse order, Pd3d peaks shift to higher binding energies while Pt4f and Cu2p peaks to lower ones, suggesting that more significant charge re-distribution occurs between electron-deficient Pd cores and electron-rich PtCu shells. In addition to above samples, other reference samples were also prepared for comparison.Bare rGO was obtained under the same experimental condition as rGO/Pd except the absence of K 2 PdCl 4 (Fig. S4), while rGO/PdPt 6 L exposing with Pt(100) facets was synthesized through the same method as rGO/PdPtCu 6 L except without the addition of CuCl 2 (Fig. S5).Bare Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu core-shell nanocubes without rGO were also synthesized for comparison (Fig. S6).The structural information of the samples was revealed by the combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform Fig. 2. Electronic microscopy characterizations of reference samples and comparative spectroscopic characterizations of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L with reference samples: (a-f) TEM and HRTEM images of (a-c) rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and (d-f) rGO/PdPtCu 30 L ; (g-i) high-resolution XPS spectra of rGO/PdPtCu samples: (g) Pd3d, (h) Pt4f and (i) Cu2p high-resolution spectrum.infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.XRD patterns demonstrate the disappearance of the strong GO peak centered at 2 10.2 in the rGO based samples, further proving the exfoliation and reduction of GO (Fig. S7) 45,46.In addition to the broad peaks of rGO, all other peaks in the pattern of rGO/Pd can be assigned to fcc Pd (JCPDS 87-0639).With the further grown of PtCu on the Pd, no new peak appears, implying the same fcc phase of core and shell.As the PtCu thickness gradually increases from rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , the intensity-enhanced metal peaks gradually shift towards those of standard Pt (JCPDS 65-2868) rather than Cu (JCPDS 01-1241), further indicating the majority of Pt and minority of Cu in the PtCu shell.Additionally, when compared with the XRD pattern of PdPt, there is an obvious peak broadening of PdPtCu towards the direction of standard Cu (JCPDS 01-1241), and the peak broadening effect is more obvious at a higher 2 value, further confirming the presence of Cu in the Pt lattice (Fig. S8) 47.As depicted in the FTIR spectra of the rGO containing samples (Fig. S9), the remarkable decrease in the intensities of GO peaks corresponding to the stretching of oxygen containing functionalities including O-H (3400 cm -1 ), C--O (1734 cm -1 ), carboxy C-O (1400 cm -1 ), epoxy C-O (1228 cm -1 ) and alkoxy C-O (1065 cm -1 ) further evidences the reduction of GO 48,49.Such a phenomenon is further confirmed by the significant increase in the intensity ratio of D band to G band (I D /I G ) in the Raman spectra, which is resulted from the presence of unrepaired defects after the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups (Fig. S10) 50,51. Upon acquiring the structural and composition information, the performances of the rGO based samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were evaluated with photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 as the light absorber and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the hole scavenger, respectively.Fig. 3a summarizes the catalytic performance of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L in reference to control samples under visible light irradiation (420 780 nm) in the first 4 h of reaction.For all the samples, the yields of reduction products gradually increase with the extension of the reaction time (Fig. S11).The corresponding product selectivity in Fig. 3b was calculated based on the average evolution rates of the reduction products as well as the electrons required to generate the products according to Eq. 3.No gas product was detected in the reference experiments including in the dark, without Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 and without TEOA.When the system was operated in absence of catalyst or in presence of rGO without metal anchored, trace amounts of H 2 and CO were detected.With the further combination of rGO with Pd, remarkable enhancements in the H 2 and CO evolution were observed along with the generation of trace amount of CH 4 .After the coating of Pd with ultrathin PtCu shell, the CH 4 production over rGO/PdPtCu 2 L is drastically improved and the rate reaches up to as high as 129.7 mol gcat -1 h -1 , 56.4 times higher than that of rGO/Pd, offering high selectivity of 80.8 towards CH 4 production over competing H 2 and CO generation.Meanwhile, the H 2 and CO evolution rates also experience a considerable decline and rise, respectively, implying that the PtCu coverage facilitates the CO 2 fixation while suppresses the proton reduction.Further increasing the thickness of PtCu shell results in a gradual decrease in the CO and CH 4 production.Especially, the yield rate of CH 4 over rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L drastically decreases to 83.2 and 72.3 mol gcat -1 h -1 , while the corresponding CH 4 selectivity also suffers a slight drop to 72.5 and 67.5, respectively, demonstrating the vital role of the PtCu thickness in the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.In sharp contrast to rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L , with the approximate shell thickness, rGO/PdPt 6 L exhibits extremely higher H 2 generation but drastically lower CH 4 rate and selectivity, providing proof that the incorporation of Cu atoms into Pt surface holds the key to the high activity and selectivity of CH 4 production.It is worth noting that no liquid phase reduction product (e.g., CH 3 OH and HCOOH) was detected for all the samples during the photocatalytic process.When Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu without rGO were used as photocatalyts, no gas product was detected in the absence of Ru (pby) 3 Cl 2 , while trace amounts of H 2 and CO were measured in the presence of Ru complex, highlighting the pivotal role of rGO in the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. S12). For rGO/PdPtCu 2 L with the best photocatalytic performance, the activity and selectivity in CH 4 production are comparable to those of the reported state-of-the-art catalysts with Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 as the light sensitizer and TEOA as the hole scavenger, respectively (Table S2).To gain more information on the photocatalytic system, a series of control experiments with different reaction conditions have been conducted.The wavelength-dependent photocatalytic experiments was further assessed using Xe lamp equipped with different band filters.The trend of H 2 , CO and CH 4 yields of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L at different wavelengths match well with light absorption profile of Ru(bpy)3Cl2, corroborating that the CO 2 reduction is driven by the light excitation of the photosensitizer (Fig. 3c) 52.When using Ar as the gas feedstock instead of CO 2 , no CO and CH 4 is detected, manifesting that the produced CO and CH 4 actually come from the reduction of CO 2 53.To further verify the origin of produced CO and CH 4 , the isotopic 13 CO 2 was used as the reactant to trace the carbon source with rGO/PdPtCu 2 L as a catalyst.As identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the strong signals at m/z 29 and m/z 17 corresponds to the generated 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , respectively, evincing that the CO and CH 4 indeed originate from the photoreduction of CO 2 (Fig. 3d) 54,55.Noting that the m/z 16 in the mass spectra does not correspond to 12 CH 4 , but the fragment ions of 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , respectively.Apart from high activity and selectivity, the rGO/PdPtCu 2 L also delivers high catalytic stability in CH 4 generation.As shown in Fig. 3e, the recycled catalyst retain 95.3 of its original CH 4 evolution rate without obvious decay in the selectivity after five successive 4 h runs.To further prove the repeatability of the catalyst, TEM images, XRD pattern and XPS spectra after the cyclic tests were compared with those of the fresh one (Figs.S13 andS14).The well-maintained morphology, structure and composition validate the excellent reusability of the designed rGO/PdPtCu 2 L catalyst in CO 2 photoreduction.Notably, after the cycles, the new emerging Ru3d peaks provide evidence that Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 is adsorbed on the rGO (Fig. S14b), while the attenuated peak intensities of oxygen-containing function groups in C1s and O1s spectra imply the deeper photoreducion of rGO nanosheets by transferred excited electrons from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 light sensitizer (Fig. S14b,c) 17. Furthermore, in comparison with the FTIR spectra of fresh rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , additional absorption peaks at 775 cm -1 and 730 cm -1 after the photocatalytic cycles originate from the characteristic vibrations of adsorbed Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , confirming the - interaction between rGO and Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (Fig. S15). To further explore the key factors determining the photocatalytic performance, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was firstly employed to examine the light absorption behaviors of the rGO based catalysts.As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples exhibit comparable light absorption without obvious absorption edge, which is a typical feature for zero-bandgap graphene based materials.With the addition of the catalysts into Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution, there is a slight enhancement in the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4b).This enhancement is attributed to the intrinsic light absorption of rGO based catalysts, which can be reflected by the incremental light absorption of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 upon the addition of increasing amounts of rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. S16a).Owing to the comparable optical absorption property of the rGO based samples, almost no difference in the absorption spectra of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 solution is observed in the presence of the same concentration of different samples, excluding the influence of the light absorption on the photocatalytic performance. The charge separation and transfer behaviors in the rGO based samples were then reflected by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.As sketched in Fig. 4c, Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution excited at 400 nm shows a strong emission peak around 610 nm.With the further addition of rGO based samples, the PL of the excited Ru (bpy) 3 2 is obviously quenched, and the quenching degree gradually increases with the increasing amount of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. S16b).The above result suggests the suppression of radiative charge recombination resulted from the transfer of photoexcited electrons from Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 light absorber to rGO based catalysts.With the same dosage of the catalysts, the PL quenching degrees are in the order: rGO rGO/ Pd rGO/PdPtCu 30 L rGO/PdPtCu 6 L rGO/PdPt 6 L rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L , signifying that the metal configuration on the rGO nanosheets is critical to the charge separation efficiency.When bare Pd nanocubes were added into the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 solution in the absence of rGO, no apparent PL quenching occurs (Fig. S17), which highlights the critical role of rGO in promoting the charge transfer and separation, thus providing additional evidence that Ru(bpy) 3 2 is adsorbed on the rGO nanosheets rather than the metal particles.Time-resolved PL decay spectroscopy was then employed to further reveal the charge dynamic behaviors.As depicted in Fig. 4d, all emission patterns of excited Ru (bpy) 3 2 aqueous solution in the absence or presence of catalysts follow one exponential decay 56.Compared to blank Ru(bpy) 3 2 solution (210.1 ns), shortened PL lifetime can be observed in the presence of rGO (202.8 ns), rGO/Pd (196.9 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (182.0 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 6 L (189.1 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 30 L (189.9 ns) and rGO/PdPt 6 L (188.0 ns), respectively (Table S3).The decline of PL lifetime follows the same sequence as the PL quenching degree, further evidencing more efficient suppression of detrimental charge recombination in rGO/PdPtCu 2 L 17,57,58. To gain an in-depth insight into the improved charge separation and transfer kinetics of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been carried out to investigate the interfacial charge transfer resistance.As displayed in Fig. 4e, the Nyquist plot of rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L possesses the smallest arc radius among the different samples, revealing the lowest resistance for electron migration.Especially, the gradually reduced radii of Nyquist plots are observed when the thickness of PtCu shell decreases from 30 to 6 and then to 2 at.layers, disclosing the shell thickness dependent charge transfer kinetics.The above statements are further confirmed by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves examined with Ar-saturated KHCO 3 solution as electrolyte, from which it can be seen that rGO/PdPtCu 2 L exhibits the highest current densities, signifying that the synergism of Pd core and ultrathin PtCu shell efficiently promotes the separation and transfer of charge carriers, thus accelerating the CO 2 -to-CO/CH 4 conversion. It should be noted that the shell thickness is not the only key variable influencing the efficiency of charge separation and migration.Particularly, with the same shell thickness, the larger current density of rGO/ PdPt 6 L over that of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L together with the smaller Nyquist arc and higher PL quenching degree validates that pure Pt shell is more conducive to smooth electron movement relative to PtCu shell.To further decipher the charge migration processes, density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed to evaluate the electron flow behavior in detail.According to the aforementioned HRTEM results, Pd (100), Pt(100) and PtCu(100) facets are the most predominantly exposed crystallographic planes for rGO/Pd, rGO/PdPt and rGO/ PdPtCu samples, respectively, which were selected as the model surfaces to ensure the consistency of the theoretical models and the experimental results.According to the electrostatic potential, the work functions of PtCu 1 L , PtCu 2 L , PtCu 3 L and PtCu 4 L were calculated to be 4.98, 5.37, 5.49 and 5.52 eV, which are basically higher than those of rGO (4.33 eV) and Pd(100) (5.26 eV), but lower than that of Pt(100) (5.63 eV) (Table S4).Wherefore, it can be inferred that the Fermi level is in the order of rGO Pd PtCu Pt.As it is well documented that electrons will flow from the material with higher Fermi level to that with lower one 59, one can rationally deduce that electrons on the Pd core will migrate to the PtCu (or Pt) shell with more than one-layer thickness.This redistribution of charge is further revealed by experimental XPS results, implying the electron movement between the interfacial materials (Fig. 2g-i).Furthermore, valence-band XPS spectra manifest that the energy difference between the valence band (VB) edge and Fermi level is nearly zero for the rGO based samples, evidencing that the introduction of Pd core and PtCu (or Pt) shell does not alter the zero-bandgap feature of rGO (Fig. S18). Considering that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 is at 3.19 eV and its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is at 5.68 eV relative to the vacuum level according to previous works 60,61, the Fermi levels of rGO, Pd, PtCu and Pt are lower than the LUMO of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 so that the photoexcited electrons in the LUMO of the light absorber can be transferred to the Fermi levels of them.The photogenerated electrons are preferentially transferred from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 to rGO through - interfacial interaction between them, which subsequently migrate to Pd cores and then to PtCu (or Pt) shells in larger work functions for CO 2 reduction (Fig. 5a).Owing to the higher work function of Pt compared to that of PtCu, the larger work function difference between Pd and Pt produces an enlarged driving force for promoted interfacial electron transfer from core to shell, well explaining the smoother charge separation and migration in rGO/PdPt 6 L relative to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L . Then the question comes up to reveal the role of PtCu thickness on the charge separation and transfer for the rGO/PdPtCu samples with the same exposed facets of PtCu(100).To investigate this mechanism, the interfacial models of Pd(100)PtCu nL with one to four atomic layers were established and the corresponding charge analyses were performed to track the charge migration behavior.As depicted in Fig. 5b, driving by the work function difference, electrons will flow from Pd to PtCu when two materials are combined together.That is, electrons could be accumulated on the upper PtCu shells.Moreover, according to the Bader charge analysis, this electron accumulation will experience a gradual decline as the PtCu thickness increases from one to four layers (Table S5), which can be clearly visualized from the differential charge density in Fig. 5b.The thickness-dependent charge separation will lead to the variation of the interfacial polarization 62, which could further contribute to the robust electron trapping ability of PdPtCu shells with lower-layer PtCu and thus facilitating the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion efficiency.It is worth noting that the plasmonic absorption band of Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu is located in UV region (Fig. S19), and the contribution of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on the charge transfer/separation can be ruled out 6364656667. In addition to the charge separation and transfer, the ultimate photocatalytic property is also correlated with the surface reactivity of the catalysts.As discussed before, despite the superior electron separation/ transfer behavior, the activity and selectivity of rGO/PdPt 6 L in CH production are much lower as compared with those of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L , implying that the shell thickness dependent charge kinetics is not the only key factor determining the eventual photocatalytic performance.PtCu surface may provide more favorable reaction sites for CO 2 -to-CH Cl 2 to rGO/PdPtCu 2 L catalyst; (b) differential charge density determined by first-principles simulations illustrating the electron distribution between Pd(100) substrate and PtCu(100) shell when the PtCu shell thickness is altered from 1 to 4 layers.The Pd, Pt and Cu atoms are marked in green, gray and blue, respectively.The olive and cyan colors represent an increase and decrease in electron density, respectively.conversion compared to Pt surface.According to the CO 2 temperatureprogrammed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) profiles of rGO/Pd, rGO/PdPt 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 6 L samples, the peak at around 100 C can be assigned to physisorbed CO 2 , while another peak at around 500-600 C originates from the chemisorbed CO 2 (Fig. S20).The desorption peak intensity of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L at high temperature is much higher than those of rGO/Pd and rGO/PdPt 6 L , proving the better CO 2 adsorption on the PtCu(100) surface.Moreover, as demonstrated by the LSV curves conducted in Ar-saturated and CO 2 -saturated 0.5 M KHCO 3 electrolyte, respectively, the higher current densities under CO 2 atmosphere compared to those under Ar bubbling can be assigned to the cathodic current generated by CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 4f, rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L exhibits a larger current density enhancement as compared with rGO/Pd and rGO/PdPt 6 L , confirming that the PtCu(100) surface is more active for CO 2 reduction compared to Pd(100) and Pt(100) surface.Moreover, larger difference in the current density between Ar and CO 2 can be observed for rGO/PdPtCu 2 L compared to those for rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , meaning that the surface reactivity of PtCu(100) is also negatively correlative to the thickness of the shell. To gain a deep insight into the influence of PtCu thickness on the surface reaction, the chemisorption behavior of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on the Pd, Pt and PtCu surfaces was further described by the DFT calculations.As illustrated in Table 1, one can clearly see that PtCu surface exhibits much more negative CO 2 adsorption energies (ranging from -0.27 to -0.92 eV) when compared with those of Pd(100) (-0.02 eV) and Pt(100) (-0.04 eV), implying the substantially enhanced interaction between CO 2 molecules and PtCu surface.Additionally, as the thickness of PtCu increases from 1 to 4 at.layers, the adsorption energy of CO 2 experiences a gradual decline from -0.92 to -0.70 eV, and then to -0.59 and -0.27 eV, which suggests the steadily weakened CO 2 interaction.This shell-thickness dependence of CO 2 adsorption can be rationally ascribed to the synergistic interplay of surface strain and interfacial polarization 68,69.Interestingly, a more favorable CO 2 adsorption can be expected on the surface of PtCu 1 L and PtCu 2 L with higher binding strength relative to H 2 O molecules.In stark contrast, when compared to the CO 2 adsorption energies (E adCO2 ), the corresponding H 2 O adsorption energies (E adH2O ) on the Pd and Pt surface are much more negative, evincing a dominant proton reduction pathway.When the PtCu shell is thin enough, it is also possible that a two-step cascade catalytic process occurs, including the CO 2 -to-CO conversion on Pd core and the further CO-to-CH 4 conversion on PtCu shell 70,71.Taken together, the PtCu shell with lower atomic thickness promotes both the charge separation and the targeted reactant adsorption, thus accelerating the CO 2 reduction reaction and simultaneously restraining the side H 2 evolution reaction. Optimized geometries for the adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on different metal surface and the corresponding lowest adsorption energy. Based on above analyses, a tentative mechanism for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over rGO/PdPtCu 2 L is proposed.As illustrated in Scheme 1, under visible light irradiation, the electrons in the HOMO of the light absorber Ru(bpy) 3 2 are excited to the LUMO, and the Ru (bpy) 3 2 is promoted to the excited state by the photogenerated holes left in the HOMO (Step 1).This excited state is then reductively quenched by rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to form an oxidized photosensitizer Ru (bpy) 3 3 , during which the photoexcited electrons are transferred to rGO nanosheets owing to the - interaction between them (Step 2).The transferred electrons then shift to the active sites on the surface of ultrathin PtCu shell with Pd core as the conducting channel 21.The interfacial charge polarization promotes the electron transfer from Pd core to PtCu shell, causing the higher electron density on the PtCu surface.Moreover, the electron accumulation together with the compressive strain on the ultrathin PtCu surface strengthens the adsorption of CO 2 molecules, selectively promoting the 8-electron reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 when compared with the 2-electron reduction to CO and H 2 (Step 3).The oxidized Ru(bpy) 3 3 is then reduced back to Ru(bpy) 3 2 by the sacrificial electron donor TEOA to form an entire photoredox cycle (Step 4)."}, {"llm generation": "rGO/PdPtCu", "source": "In summary, a stacking design of rGO/PdPtCu with atomically thin PtCu shell have been developed for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 with remarkable activity, selectivity, and stability.", "context": "In summary, a stacking design of rGO/PdPtCu with atomically thin PtCu shell have been developed for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 with remarkable activity, selectivity, and stability.In the smart design, rGO supporter and Pd core facilitate the separation and transfer of photo-created charge carriers from excited Ru(bpy) 3 2 , while ultrathin PtCu shell provides highly active and selective sites for the CO 2to-CH 4 conversion.The combination of experimental analyses and theoretical simulations discloses that both the charge kinetics and surface reactivity of the ternary photocatalyst are dependent on the PtCu shell thickness, and the highest activity and selectivity in CH 4 production are achieved by shrinking the shell to two-atomic-layer thickness.On one hand, the strengthened Pd-PtCu interfacial charge polarization promotes the flow of photoelectrons from Pd core to PtCu shell, giving rise to more efficient charge separation and transfer.On the other hand, the increased electron density and compressive strain ameliorate the CO 2 adsorption on the PtCu surface, endowing the catalyst with enhanced activity and selectivity.We anticipate that this work would offer a \"one stone two birds\" design to simultaneously manipulate the interfacial charge transfer and surface catalytic reactivity for significantly enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by regulating the shell thickness of the well-designed catalyst.

Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted in a sealed photocatalytic reactor (Beijing Perfectlight, China).In detail, 10 mg of photocatalysts and 15 mg of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O were suspended in an acetonitrile/triethanolamine/H 2 O solution (6 mL, 4:1:1, volume ratio), and dispersed on a flat glass plate at the bottom of the 100 mL photocatalytic reactor.The reactor was purged with high purity CO 2 for min, and then irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300D/300DUV, Beijing Perfectlight, China) with visible light (420 780 nm) as the illumination source, which was realized using a long-wave-pass cutoff filter with a cutoff wavelength of 420 nm and a short-wave-pass cutoff filter with a cutoff wavelength of 780 nm.The power density of the incident visible light reaching reaction solution was 100 mW cm -2 .The photocatalytic reaction was conducted for 4 h under stirring at 600 rpm.The evolved gaseous mixture was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu) with Ar as the carrier gas.The amount of H 2 was determined using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).CH 4 was measured by a flame ionization detector (FID).CO was converted to CH by using a methanation reactor and then analyzed by the FID.To detect the possible liquid reduction products such as CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH, the liquid supernatant was collected after the photocatalytic reaction and analyzed using a FID of gas chromatography (Agilent 8860).HCOOH is an exception, which was analyzed using a 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) spectrometer (Bruker Avance 600WB).The wavelength dependent photocatalytic performance was evaluated with the assistance of 365, 400, 450, 500 and 550 nm band-pass filters, respectively.During the cyclic tests, the catalyst was collected after each run and then reused for the next round of photocatalytic reaction.Isotope-labeling experiments were performed using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 and the products were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (7890B/5977A, Agilent).The product selectivities were calculated according to the average evolution rates of the reduction products as well as the electrons required to generate products using the following equation: where v(H 2 ), v(CO) and v(CH 4 ) stand for the formation rates of H 2 , CO and CH 4 , respectively, and 2, 2 and 8 electrons are required for H 2 , CO and CH 4 production according to the above reaction equations. All the geometric optimization and electronic simulation have been carried out by using the Vienna abinitio simulation package (VASP) 30.The projector augmented-wave (PAW) method was chosen for the description of the core electrons 31.The generalized gradient approximation-Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) exchange correlation functional was employed to perform the density functional theory computations 32.An energy cutoff of 450 eV was adopted for the plane-wave expansion of the electronic wave function.The force and energy convergence criterion was set to be -0.02eV/A and 10 -5 eV, respectively.A system of 2 2 slab with 1-4 layers was employed to model the PtCu surfaces while a system of 3 3 slab with 4 layers was employed to model the Pd surfaces.One bottom layer was fixed to the bulk positions with a vacuum space of 15 A.The gamma-centered k-point mesh of 3 3 1 was used for the k-points sampling of the periodic geometries.

As reference samples, two rGO/PdPtCu counterparts with thicker PtCu shell were also synthesized for comparison.As revealed by the TEM images in Fig. 2a,b,d ande, with the deposition of more Pt and Cu atoms onto the Pd surface, the cuboid shape of PdPtCu is well maintained except the increased thickness of black PtCu outer layers.According to the results of average edge length measurement, the thickness of PtCu is determined to be around 6 and 30 at.layers, and the corresponding sample is named as rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , respectively (Fig. S2c,d).To further examine the PtCu shell thickness, the molar ratios of Pd to Pt and Cu were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Table S1), which turn out to be consistent with those determined by the size analyses.Moreover, the ICP-MS results indicate the approximate Pt/Cu molar ratio of around 70: 30 in all the rGO/PdPtCu samples (Table S1).Similar to the case of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , both Pd(100) facet of the core and PtCu(100) facet of the shell can be observed in the HRTEM image of rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L (Fig. 2c).In sharp contrast, in the HRTEM image of rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L , due to the coverage of thicker shell, only the lattice of PtCu(100) plane can be detected (Fig. 2f).Furthermore, as the shell thickness increases, the lattice spacing of PtCu experiences a gradual increase from 1.93 A of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to 1.94 A of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and to 1.96 A of rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , which provides evidence that lattice mismatched epitaxy between Pd core and PtCu shell results in compressive strain on the ultrathin PtCu overlayers.When the shell thickness becomes greater, the strain gradually reduces and finally to the level of that of bulk PtCu 353637. The chemical states of the rGO/PdPtCu samples with different PtCu thicknesses were then comparatively analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).All the rGO/PdPtCu samples demonstrate similar C1s and O1s signals, in which the higher peak intensity of sp 2 carbon (284.5 eV) relative to those of C-O (285.9 eV) and C--O (288.3 eV) groups implies the effective removal of oxygencontaining functional groups (Fig. S3) 38,39.The deconvoluted peaks in the high-resolution spectra of Pd3d, Pt4f and Cu2p indicate the dominant metallic state and small amounts of ionic state, which are typical features for solution-synthesized metal nanocrystals (Fig. 2g-i) 4041424344.With the increasing PtCu thickness from rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and to rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , owing to the limited detection depth of XPS, Pt4f and Cu2p signals become stronger while Pd signal gradually weakens.Moreover, as the PtCu shell shrinks in the reverse order, Pd3d peaks shift to higher binding energies while Pt4f and Cu2p peaks to lower ones, suggesting that more significant charge re-distribution occurs between electron-deficient Pd cores and electron-rich PtCu shells. In addition to above samples, other reference samples were also prepared for comparison.Bare rGO was obtained under the same experimental condition as rGO/Pd except the absence of K 2 PdCl 4 (Fig. S4), while rGO/PdPt 6 L exposing with Pt(100) facets was synthesized through the same method as rGO/PdPtCu 6 L except without the addition of CuCl 2 (Fig. S5).Bare Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu core-shell nanocubes without rGO were also synthesized for comparison (Fig. S6).The structural information of the samples was revealed by the combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform Fig. 2. Electronic microscopy characterizations of reference samples and comparative spectroscopic characterizations of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L with reference samples: (a-f) TEM and HRTEM images of (a-c) rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and (d-f) rGO/PdPtCu 30 L ; (g-i) high-resolution XPS spectra of rGO/PdPtCu samples: (g) Pd3d, (h) Pt4f and (i) Cu2p high-resolution spectrum.infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.XRD patterns demonstrate the disappearance of the strong GO peak centered at 2 10.2 in the rGO based samples, further proving the exfoliation and reduction of GO (Fig. S7) 45,46.In addition to the broad peaks of rGO, all other peaks in the pattern of rGO/Pd can be assigned to fcc Pd (JCPDS 87-0639).With the further grown of PtCu on the Pd, no new peak appears, implying the same fcc phase of core and shell.As the PtCu thickness gradually increases from rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , the intensity-enhanced metal peaks gradually shift towards those of standard Pt (JCPDS 65-2868) rather than Cu (JCPDS 01-1241), further indicating the majority of Pt and minority of Cu in the PtCu shell.Additionally, when compared with the XRD pattern of PdPt, there is an obvious peak broadening of PdPtCu towards the direction of standard Cu (JCPDS 01-1241), and the peak broadening effect is more obvious at a higher 2 value, further confirming the presence of Cu in the Pt lattice (Fig. S8) 47.As depicted in the FTIR spectra of the rGO containing samples (Fig. S9), the remarkable decrease in the intensities of GO peaks corresponding to the stretching of oxygen containing functionalities including O-H (3400 cm -1 ), C--O (1734 cm -1 ), carboxy C-O (1400 cm -1 ), epoxy C-O (1228 cm -1 ) and alkoxy C-O (1065 cm -1 ) further evidences the reduction of GO 48,49.Such a phenomenon is further confirmed by the significant increase in the intensity ratio of D band to G band (I D /I G ) in the Raman spectra, which is resulted from the presence of unrepaired defects after the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups (Fig. S10) 50,51. Upon acquiring the structural and composition information, the performances of the rGO based samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were evaluated with photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 as the light absorber and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the hole scavenger, respectively.Fig. 3a summarizes the catalytic performance of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L in reference to control samples under visible light irradiation (420 780 nm) in the first 4 h of reaction.For all the samples, the yields of reduction products gradually increase with the extension of the reaction time (Fig. S11).The corresponding product selectivity in Fig. 3b was calculated based on the average evolution rates of the reduction products as well as the electrons required to generate the products according to Eq. 3.No gas product was detected in the reference experiments including in the dark, without Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 and without TEOA.When the system was operated in absence of catalyst or in presence of rGO without metal anchored, trace amounts of H 2 and CO were detected.With the further combination of rGO with Pd, remarkable enhancements in the H 2 and CO evolution were observed along with the generation of trace amount of CH 4 .After the coating of Pd with ultrathin PtCu shell, the CH 4 production over rGO/PdPtCu 2 L is drastically improved and the rate reaches up to as high as 129.7 mol gcat -1 h -1 , 56.4 times higher than that of rGO/Pd, offering high selectivity of 80.8 towards CH 4 production over competing H 2 and CO generation.Meanwhile, the H 2 and CO evolution rates also experience a considerable decline and rise, respectively, implying that the PtCu coverage facilitates the CO 2 fixation while suppresses the proton reduction.Further increasing the thickness of PtCu shell results in a gradual decrease in the CO and CH 4 production.Especially, the yield rate of CH 4 over rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L drastically decreases to 83.2 and 72.3 mol gcat -1 h -1 , while the corresponding CH 4 selectivity also suffers a slight drop to 72.5 and 67.5, respectively, demonstrating the vital role of the PtCu thickness in the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.In sharp contrast to rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L , with the approximate shell thickness, rGO/PdPt 6 L exhibits extremely higher H 2 generation but drastically lower CH 4 rate and selectivity, providing proof that the incorporation of Cu atoms into Pt surface holds the key to the high activity and selectivity of CH 4 production.It is worth noting that no liquid phase reduction product (e.g., CH 3 OH and HCOOH) was detected for all the samples during the photocatalytic process.When Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu without rGO were used as photocatalyts, no gas product was detected in the absence of Ru (pby) 3 Cl 2 , while trace amounts of H 2 and CO were measured in the presence of Ru complex, highlighting the pivotal role of rGO in the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. S12). For rGO/PdPtCu 2 L with the best photocatalytic performance, the activity and selectivity in CH 4 production are comparable to those of the reported state-of-the-art catalysts with Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 as the light sensitizer and TEOA as the hole scavenger, respectively (Table S2).To gain more information on the photocatalytic system, a series of control experiments with different reaction conditions have been conducted.The wavelength-dependent photocatalytic experiments was further assessed using Xe lamp equipped with different band filters.The trend of H 2 , CO and CH 4 yields of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L at different wavelengths match well with light absorption profile of Ru(bpy)3Cl2, corroborating that the CO 2 reduction is driven by the light excitation of the photosensitizer (Fig. 3c) 52.When using Ar as the gas feedstock instead of CO 2 , no CO and CH 4 is detected, manifesting that the produced CO and CH 4 actually come from the reduction of CO 2 53.To further verify the origin of produced CO and CH 4 , the isotopic 13 CO 2 was used as the reactant to trace the carbon source with rGO/PdPtCu 2 L as a catalyst.As identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the strong signals at m/z 29 and m/z 17 corresponds to the generated 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , respectively, evincing that the CO and CH 4 indeed originate from the photoreduction of CO 2 (Fig. 3d) 54,55.Noting that the m/z 16 in the mass spectra does not correspond to 12 CH 4 , but the fragment ions of 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , respectively.Apart from high activity and selectivity, the rGO/PdPtCu 2 L also delivers high catalytic stability in CH 4 generation.As shown in Fig. 3e, the recycled catalyst retain 95.3 of its original CH 4 evolution rate without obvious decay in the selectivity after five successive 4 h runs.To further prove the repeatability of the catalyst, TEM images, XRD pattern and XPS spectra after the cyclic tests were compared with those of the fresh one (Figs.S13 andS14).The well-maintained morphology, structure and composition validate the excellent reusability of the designed rGO/PdPtCu 2 L catalyst in CO 2 photoreduction.Notably, after the cycles, the new emerging Ru3d peaks provide evidence that Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 is adsorbed on the rGO (Fig. S14b), while the attenuated peak intensities of oxygen-containing function groups in C1s and O1s spectra imply the deeper photoreducion of rGO nanosheets by transferred excited electrons from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 light sensitizer (Fig. S14b,c) 17. Furthermore, in comparison with the FTIR spectra of fresh rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , additional absorption peaks at 775 cm -1 and 730 cm -1 after the photocatalytic cycles originate from the characteristic vibrations of adsorbed Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , confirming the - interaction between rGO and Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (Fig. S15). To further explore the key factors determining the photocatalytic performance, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was firstly employed to examine the light absorption behaviors of the rGO based catalysts.As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples exhibit comparable light absorption without obvious absorption edge, which is a typical feature for zero-bandgap graphene based materials.With the addition of the catalysts into Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution, there is a slight enhancement in the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4b).This enhancement is attributed to the intrinsic light absorption of rGO based catalysts, which can be reflected by the incremental light absorption of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 upon the addition of increasing amounts of rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. S16a).Owing to the comparable optical absorption property of the rGO based samples, almost no difference in the absorption spectra of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 solution is observed in the presence of the same concentration of different samples, excluding the influence of the light absorption on the photocatalytic performance. The charge separation and transfer behaviors in the rGO based samples were then reflected by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.As sketched in Fig. 4c, Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution excited at 400 nm shows a strong emission peak around 610 nm.With the further addition of rGO based samples, the PL of the excited Ru (bpy) 3 2 is obviously quenched, and the quenching degree gradually increases with the increasing amount of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. S16b).The above result suggests the suppression of radiative charge recombination resulted from the transfer of photoexcited electrons from Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 light absorber to rGO based catalysts.With the same dosage of the catalysts, the PL quenching degrees are in the order: rGO rGO/ Pd rGO/PdPtCu 30 L rGO/PdPtCu 6 L rGO/PdPt 6 L rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L , signifying that the metal configuration on the rGO nanosheets is critical to the charge separation efficiency.When bare Pd nanocubes were added into the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 solution in the absence of rGO, no apparent PL quenching occurs (Fig. S17), which highlights the critical role of rGO in promoting the charge transfer and separation, thus providing additional evidence that Ru(bpy) 3 2 is adsorbed on the rGO nanosheets rather than the metal particles.Time-resolved PL decay spectroscopy was then employed to further reveal the charge dynamic behaviors.As depicted in Fig. 4d, all emission patterns of excited Ru (bpy) 3 2 aqueous solution in the absence or presence of catalysts follow one exponential decay 56.Compared to blank Ru(bpy) 3 2 solution (210.1 ns), shortened PL lifetime can be observed in the presence of rGO (202.8 ns), rGO/Pd (196.9 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (182.0 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 6 L (189.1 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 30 L (189.9 ns) and rGO/PdPt 6 L (188.0 ns), respectively (Table S3).The decline of PL lifetime follows the same sequence as the PL quenching degree, further evidencing more efficient suppression of detrimental charge recombination in rGO/PdPtCu 2 L 17,57,58. To gain an in-depth insight into the improved charge separation and transfer kinetics of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been carried out to investigate the interfacial charge transfer resistance.As displayed in Fig. 4e, the Nyquist plot of rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L possesses the smallest arc radius among the different samples, revealing the lowest resistance for electron migration.Especially, the gradually reduced radii of Nyquist plots are observed when the thickness of PtCu shell decreases from 30 to 6 and then to 2 at.layers, disclosing the shell thickness dependent charge transfer kinetics.The above statements are further confirmed by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves examined with Ar-saturated KHCO 3 solution as electrolyte, from which it can be seen that rGO/PdPtCu 2 L exhibits the highest current densities, signifying that the synergism of Pd core and ultrathin PtCu shell efficiently promotes the separation and transfer of charge carriers, thus accelerating the CO 2 -to-CO/CH 4 conversion. It should be noted that the shell thickness is not the only key variable influencing the efficiency of charge separation and migration.Particularly, with the same shell thickness, the larger current density of rGO/ PdPt 6 L over that of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L together with the smaller Nyquist arc and higher PL quenching degree validates that pure Pt shell is more conducive to smooth electron movement relative to PtCu shell.To further decipher the charge migration processes, density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed to evaluate the electron flow behavior in detail.According to the aforementioned HRTEM results, Pd (100), Pt(100) and PtCu(100) facets are the most predominantly exposed crystallographic planes for rGO/Pd, rGO/PdPt and rGO/ PdPtCu samples, respectively, which were selected as the model surfaces to ensure the consistency of the theoretical models and the experimental results.According to the electrostatic potential, the work functions of PtCu 1 L , PtCu 2 L , PtCu 3 L and PtCu 4 L were calculated to be 4.98, 5.37, 5.49 and 5.52 eV, which are basically higher than those of rGO (4.33 eV) and Pd(100) (5.26 eV), but lower than that of Pt(100) (5.63 eV) (Table S4).Wherefore, it can be inferred that the Fermi level is in the order of rGO Pd PtCu Pt.As it is well documented that electrons will flow from the material with higher Fermi level to that with lower one 59, one can rationally deduce that electrons on the Pd core will migrate to the PtCu (or Pt) shell with more than one-layer thickness.This redistribution of charge is further revealed by experimental XPS results, implying the electron movement between the interfacial materials (Fig. 2g-i).Furthermore, valence-band XPS spectra manifest that the energy difference between the valence band (VB) edge and Fermi level is nearly zero for the rGO based samples, evidencing that the introduction of Pd core and PtCu (or Pt) shell does not alter the zero-bandgap feature of rGO (Fig. S18). Considering that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 is at 3.19 eV and its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is at 5.68 eV relative to the vacuum level according to previous works 60,61, the Fermi levels of rGO, Pd, PtCu and Pt are lower than the LUMO of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 so that the photoexcited electrons in the LUMO of the light absorber can be transferred to the Fermi levels of them.The photogenerated electrons are preferentially transferred from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 to rGO through - interfacial interaction between them, which subsequently migrate to Pd cores and then to PtCu (or Pt) shells in larger work functions for CO 2 reduction (Fig. 5a).Owing to the higher work function of Pt compared to that of PtCu, the larger work function difference between Pd and Pt produces an enlarged driving force for promoted interfacial electron transfer from core to shell, well explaining the smoother charge separation and migration in rGO/PdPt 6 L relative to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L . Then the question comes up to reveal the role of PtCu thickness on the charge separation and transfer for the rGO/PdPtCu samples with the same exposed facets of PtCu(100).To investigate this mechanism, the interfacial models of Pd(100)PtCu nL with one to four atomic layers were established and the corresponding charge analyses were performed to track the charge migration behavior.As depicted in Fig. 5b, driving by the work function difference, electrons will flow from Pd to PtCu when two materials are combined together.That is, electrons could be accumulated on the upper PtCu shells.Moreover, according to the Bader charge analysis, this electron accumulation will experience a gradual decline as the PtCu thickness increases from one to four layers (Table S5), which can be clearly visualized from the differential charge density in Fig. 5b.The thickness-dependent charge separation will lead to the variation of the interfacial polarization 62, which could further contribute to the robust electron trapping ability of PdPtCu shells with lower-layer PtCu and thus facilitating the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion efficiency.It is worth noting that the plasmonic absorption band of Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu is located in UV region (Fig. S19), and the contribution of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on the charge transfer/separation can be ruled out 6364656667. In addition to the charge separation and transfer, the ultimate photocatalytic property is also correlated with the surface reactivity of the catalysts.As discussed before, despite the superior electron separation/ transfer behavior, the activity and selectivity of rGO/PdPt 6 L in CH production are much lower as compared with those of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L , implying that the shell thickness dependent charge kinetics is not the only key factor determining the eventual photocatalytic performance.PtCu surface may provide more favorable reaction sites for CO 2 -to-CH Cl 2 to rGO/PdPtCu 2 L catalyst; (b) differential charge density determined by first-principles simulations illustrating the electron distribution between Pd(100) substrate and PtCu(100) shell when the PtCu shell thickness is altered from 1 to 4 layers.The Pd, Pt and Cu atoms are marked in green, gray and blue, respectively.The olive and cyan colors represent an increase and decrease in electron density, respectively.conversion compared to Pt surface.According to the CO 2 temperatureprogrammed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) profiles of rGO/Pd, rGO/PdPt 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 6 L samples, the peak at around 100 C can be assigned to physisorbed CO 2 , while another peak at around 500-600 C originates from the chemisorbed CO 2 (Fig. S20).The desorption peak intensity of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L at high temperature is much higher than those of rGO/Pd and rGO/PdPt 6 L , proving the better CO 2 adsorption on the PtCu(100) surface.Moreover, as demonstrated by the LSV curves conducted in Ar-saturated and CO 2 -saturated 0.5 M KHCO 3 electrolyte, respectively, the higher current densities under CO 2 atmosphere compared to those under Ar bubbling can be assigned to the cathodic current generated by CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 4f, rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L exhibits a larger current density enhancement as compared with rGO/Pd and rGO/PdPt 6 L , confirming that the PtCu(100) surface is more active for CO 2 reduction compared to Pd(100) and Pt(100) surface.Moreover, larger difference in the current density between Ar and CO 2 can be observed for rGO/PdPtCu 2 L compared to those for rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , meaning that the surface reactivity of PtCu(100) is also negatively correlative to the thickness of the shell. To gain a deep insight into the influence of PtCu thickness on the surface reaction, the chemisorption behavior of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on the Pd, Pt and PtCu surfaces was further described by the DFT calculations.As illustrated in Table 1, one can clearly see that PtCu surface exhibits much more negative CO 2 adsorption energies (ranging from -0.27 to -0.92 eV) when compared with those of Pd(100) (-0.02 eV) and Pt(100) (-0.04 eV), implying the substantially enhanced interaction between CO 2 molecules and PtCu surface.Additionally, as the thickness of PtCu increases from 1 to 4 at.layers, the adsorption energy of CO 2 experiences a gradual decline from -0.92 to -0.70 eV, and then to -0.59 and -0.27 eV, which suggests the steadily weakened CO 2 interaction.This shell-thickness dependence of CO 2 adsorption can be rationally ascribed to the synergistic interplay of surface strain and interfacial polarization 68,69.Interestingly, a more favorable CO 2 adsorption can be expected on the surface of PtCu 1 L and PtCu 2 L with higher binding strength relative to H 2 O molecules.In stark contrast, when compared to the CO 2 adsorption energies (E adCO2 ), the corresponding H 2 O adsorption energies (E adH2O ) on the Pd and Pt surface are much more negative, evincing a dominant proton reduction pathway.When the PtCu shell is thin enough, it is also possible that a two-step cascade catalytic process occurs, including the CO 2 -to-CO conversion on Pd core and the further CO-to-CH 4 conversion on PtCu shell 70,71.Taken together, the PtCu shell with lower atomic thickness promotes both the charge separation and the targeted reactant adsorption, thus accelerating the CO 2 reduction reaction and simultaneously restraining the side H 2 evolution reaction. Optimized geometries for the adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on different metal surface and the corresponding lowest adsorption energy. Based on above analyses, a tentative mechanism for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over rGO/PdPtCu 2 L is proposed.As illustrated in Scheme 1, under visible light irradiation, the electrons in the HOMO of the light absorber Ru(bpy) 3 2 are excited to the LUMO, and the Ru (bpy) 3 2 is promoted to the excited state by the photogenerated holes left in the HOMO (Step 1).This excited state is then reductively quenched by rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to form an oxidized photosensitizer Ru (bpy) 3 3 , during which the photoexcited electrons are transferred to rGO nanosheets owing to the - interaction between them (Step 2).The transferred electrons then shift to the active sites on the surface of ultrathin PtCu shell with Pd core as the conducting channel 21.The interfacial charge polarization promotes the electron transfer from Pd core to PtCu shell, causing the higher electron density on the PtCu surface.Moreover, the electron accumulation together with the compressive strain on the ultrathin PtCu surface strengthens the adsorption of CO 2 molecules, selectively promoting the 8-electron reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 when compared with the 2-electron reduction to CO and H 2 (Step 3).The oxidized Ru(bpy) 3 3 is then reduced back to Ru(bpy) 3 2 by the sacrificial electron donor TEOA to form an entire photoredox cycle (Step 4)."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "Fig. 3.

Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were conducted in a sealed photocatalytic reactor (Beijing Perfectlight, China).In detail, 10 mg of photocatalysts and 15 mg of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O were suspended in an acetonitrile/triethanolamine/H 2 O solution (6 mL, 4:1:1, volume ratio), and dispersed on a flat glass plate at the bottom of the 100 mL photocatalytic reactor.The reactor was purged with high purity CO 2 for min, and then irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300D/300DUV, Beijing Perfectlight, China) with visible light (420 780 nm) as the illumination source, which was realized using a long-wave-pass cutoff filter with a cutoff wavelength of 420 nm and a short-wave-pass cutoff filter with a cutoff wavelength of 780 nm.The power density of the incident visible light reaching reaction solution was 100 mW cm -2 .The photocatalytic reaction was conducted for 4 h under stirring at 600 rpm.The evolved gaseous mixture was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu) with Ar as the carrier gas.The amount of H 2 was determined using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).CH 4 was measured by a flame ionization detector (FID).CO was converted to CH by using a methanation reactor and then analyzed by the FID.To detect the possible liquid reduction products such as CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH, the liquid supernatant was collected after the photocatalytic reaction and analyzed using a FID of gas chromatography (Agilent 8860).HCOOH is an exception, which was analyzed using a 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) spectrometer (Bruker Avance 600WB).The wavelength dependent photocatalytic performance was evaluated with the assistance of 365, 400, 450, 500 and 550 nm band-pass filters, respectively.During the cyclic tests, the catalyst was collected after each run and then reused for the next round of photocatalytic reaction.Isotope-labeling experiments were performed using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 and the products were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (7890B/5977A, Agilent).The product selectivities were calculated according to the average evolution rates of the reduction products as well as the electrons required to generate products using the following equation: where v(H 2 ), v(CO) and v(CH 4 ) stand for the formation rates of H 2 , CO and CH 4 , respectively, and 2, 2 and 8 electrons are required for H 2 , CO and CH 4 production according to the above reaction equations.

As reference samples, two rGO/PdPtCu counterparts with thicker PtCu shell were also synthesized for comparison.As revealed by the TEM images in Fig. 2a,b,d ande, with the deposition of more Pt and Cu atoms onto the Pd surface, the cuboid shape of PdPtCu is well maintained except the increased thickness of black PtCu outer layers.According to the results of average edge length measurement, the thickness of PtCu is determined to be around 6 and 30 at.layers, and the corresponding sample is named as rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , respectively (Fig. S2c,d).To further examine the PtCu shell thickness, the molar ratios of Pd to Pt and Cu were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Table S1), which turn out to be consistent with those determined by the size analyses.Moreover, the ICP-MS results indicate the approximate Pt/Cu molar ratio of around 70: 30 in all the rGO/PdPtCu samples (Table S1).Similar to the case of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , both Pd(100) facet of the core and PtCu(100) facet of the shell can be observed in the HRTEM image of rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L (Fig. 2c).In sharp contrast, in the HRTEM image of rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L , due to the coverage of thicker shell, only the lattice of PtCu(100) plane can be detected (Fig. 2f).Furthermore, as the shell thickness increases, the lattice spacing of PtCu experiences a gradual increase from 1.93 A of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to 1.94 A of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and to 1.96 A of rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , which provides evidence that lattice mismatched epitaxy between Pd core and PtCu shell results in compressive strain on the ultrathin PtCu overlayers.When the shell thickness becomes greater, the strain gradually reduces and finally to the level of that of bulk PtCu 353637. The chemical states of the rGO/PdPtCu samples with different PtCu thicknesses were then comparatively analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).All the rGO/PdPtCu samples demonstrate similar C1s and O1s signals, in which the higher peak intensity of sp 2 carbon (284.5 eV) relative to those of C-O (285.9 eV) and C--O (288.3 eV) groups implies the effective removal of oxygencontaining functional groups (Fig. S3) 38,39.The deconvoluted peaks in the high-resolution spectra of Pd3d, Pt4f and Cu2p indicate the dominant metallic state and small amounts of ionic state, which are typical features for solution-synthesized metal nanocrystals (Fig. 2g-i) 4041424344.With the increasing PtCu thickness from rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and to rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , owing to the limited detection depth of XPS, Pt4f and Cu2p signals become stronger while Pd signal gradually weakens.Moreover, as the PtCu shell shrinks in the reverse order, Pd3d peaks shift to higher binding energies while Pt4f and Cu2p peaks to lower ones, suggesting that more significant charge re-distribution occurs between electron-deficient Pd cores and electron-rich PtCu shells. In addition to above samples, other reference samples were also prepared for comparison.Bare rGO was obtained under the same experimental condition as rGO/Pd except the absence of K 2 PdCl 4 (Fig. S4), while rGO/PdPt 6 L exposing with Pt(100) facets was synthesized through the same method as rGO/PdPtCu 6 L except without the addition of CuCl 2 (Fig. S5).Bare Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu core-shell nanocubes without rGO were also synthesized for comparison (Fig. S6).The structural information of the samples was revealed by the combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform Fig. 2. Electronic microscopy characterizations of reference samples and comparative spectroscopic characterizations of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L with reference samples: (a-f) TEM and HRTEM images of (a-c) rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and (d-f) rGO/PdPtCu 30 L ; (g-i) high-resolution XPS spectra of rGO/PdPtCu samples: (g) Pd3d, (h) Pt4f and (i) Cu2p high-resolution spectrum.infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.XRD patterns demonstrate the disappearance of the strong GO peak centered at 2 10.2 in the rGO based samples, further proving the exfoliation and reduction of GO (Fig. S7) 45,46.In addition to the broad peaks of rGO, all other peaks in the pattern of rGO/Pd can be assigned to fcc Pd (JCPDS 87-0639).With the further grown of PtCu on the Pd, no new peak appears, implying the same fcc phase of core and shell.As the PtCu thickness gradually increases from rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , the intensity-enhanced metal peaks gradually shift towards those of standard Pt (JCPDS 65-2868) rather than Cu (JCPDS 01-1241), further indicating the majority of Pt and minority of Cu in the PtCu shell.Additionally, when compared with the XRD pattern of PdPt, there is an obvious peak broadening of PdPtCu towards the direction of standard Cu (JCPDS 01-1241), and the peak broadening effect is more obvious at a higher 2 value, further confirming the presence of Cu in the Pt lattice (Fig. S8) 47.As depicted in the FTIR spectra of the rGO containing samples (Fig. S9), the remarkable decrease in the intensities of GO peaks corresponding to the stretching of oxygen containing functionalities including O-H (3400 cm -1 ), C--O (1734 cm -1 ), carboxy C-O (1400 cm -1 ), epoxy C-O (1228 cm -1 ) and alkoxy C-O (1065 cm -1 ) further evidences the reduction of GO 48,49.Such a phenomenon is further confirmed by the significant increase in the intensity ratio of D band to G band (I D /I G ) in the Raman spectra, which is resulted from the presence of unrepaired defects after the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups (Fig. S10) 50,51. Upon acquiring the structural and composition information, the performances of the rGO based samples in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were evaluated with photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 as the light absorber and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the hole scavenger, respectively.Fig. 3a summarizes the catalytic performance of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L in reference to control samples under visible light irradiation (420 780 nm) in the first 4 h of reaction.For all the samples, the yields of reduction products gradually increase with the extension of the reaction time (Fig. S11).The corresponding product selectivity in Fig. 3b was calculated based on the average evolution rates of the reduction products as well as the electrons required to generate the products according to Eq. 3.No gas product was detected in the reference experiments including in the dark, without Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 and without TEOA.When the system was operated in absence of catalyst or in presence of rGO without metal anchored, trace amounts of H 2 and CO were detected.With the further combination of rGO with Pd, remarkable enhancements in the H 2 and CO evolution were observed along with the generation of trace amount of CH 4 .After the coating of Pd with ultrathin PtCu shell, the CH 4 production over rGO/PdPtCu 2 L is drastically improved and the rate reaches up to as high as 129.7 mol gcat -1 h -1 , 56.4 times higher than that of rGO/Pd, offering high selectivity of 80.8 towards CH 4 production over competing H 2 and CO generation.Meanwhile, the H 2 and CO evolution rates also experience a considerable decline and rise, respectively, implying that the PtCu coverage facilitates the CO 2 fixation while suppresses the proton reduction.Further increasing the thickness of PtCu shell results in a gradual decrease in the CO and CH 4 production.Especially, the yield rate of CH 4 over rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/ PdPtCu 30 L drastically decreases to 83.2 and 72.3 mol gcat -1 h -1 , while the corresponding CH 4 selectivity also suffers a slight drop to 72.5 and 67.5, respectively, demonstrating the vital role of the PtCu thickness in the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion.In sharp contrast to rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L , with the approximate shell thickness, rGO/PdPt 6 L exhibits extremely higher H 2 generation but drastically lower CH 4 rate and selectivity, providing proof that the incorporation of Cu atoms into Pt surface holds the key to the high activity and selectivity of CH 4 production.It is worth noting that no liquid phase reduction product (e.g., CH 3 OH and HCOOH) was detected for all the samples during the photocatalytic process.When Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu without rGO were used as photocatalyts, no gas product was detected in the absence of Ru (pby) 3 Cl 2 , while trace amounts of H 2 and CO were measured in the presence of Ru complex, highlighting the pivotal role of rGO in the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. S12). For rGO/PdPtCu 2 L with the best photocatalytic performance, the activity and selectivity in CH 4 production are comparable to those of the reported state-of-the-art catalysts with Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 as the light sensitizer and TEOA as the hole scavenger, respectively (Table S2).To gain more information on the photocatalytic system, a series of control experiments with different reaction conditions have been conducted.The wavelength-dependent photocatalytic experiments was further assessed using Xe lamp equipped with different band filters.The trend of H 2 , CO and CH 4 yields of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L at different wavelengths match well with light absorption profile of Ru(bpy)3Cl2, corroborating that the CO 2 reduction is driven by the light excitation of the photosensitizer (Fig. 3c) 52.When using Ar as the gas feedstock instead of CO 2 , no CO and CH 4 is detected, manifesting that the produced CO and CH 4 actually come from the reduction of CO 2 53.To further verify the origin of produced CO and CH 4 , the isotopic 13 CO 2 was used as the reactant to trace the carbon source with rGO/PdPtCu 2 L as a catalyst.As identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the strong signals at m/z 29 and m/z 17 corresponds to the generated 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , respectively, evincing that the CO and CH 4 indeed originate from the photoreduction of CO 2 (Fig. 3d) 54,55.Noting that the m/z 16 in the mass spectra does not correspond to 12 CH 4 , but the fragment ions of 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , respectively.Apart from high activity and selectivity, the rGO/PdPtCu 2 L also delivers high catalytic stability in CH 4 generation.As shown in Fig. 3e, the recycled catalyst retain 95.3 of its original CH 4 evolution rate without obvious decay in the selectivity after five successive 4 h runs.To further prove the repeatability of the catalyst, TEM images, XRD pattern and XPS spectra after the cyclic tests were compared with those of the fresh one (Figs.S13 andS14).The well-maintained morphology, structure and composition validate the excellent reusability of the designed rGO/PdPtCu 2 L catalyst in CO 2 photoreduction.Notably, after the cycles, the new emerging Ru3d peaks provide evidence that Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 is adsorbed on the rGO (Fig. S14b), while the attenuated peak intensities of oxygen-containing function groups in C1s and O1s spectra imply the deeper photoreducion of rGO nanosheets by transferred excited electrons from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 light sensitizer (Fig. S14b,c) 17. Furthermore, in comparison with the FTIR spectra of fresh rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , additional absorption peaks at 775 cm -1 and 730 cm -1 after the photocatalytic cycles originate from the characteristic vibrations of adsorbed Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , confirming the - interaction between rGO and Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (Fig. S15). To further explore the key factors determining the photocatalytic performance, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was firstly employed to examine the light absorption behaviors of the rGO based catalysts.As shown in Fig. 4a, all the samples exhibit comparable light absorption without obvious absorption edge, which is a typical feature for zero-bandgap graphene based materials.With the addition of the catalysts into Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution, there is a slight enhancement in the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4b).This enhancement is attributed to the intrinsic light absorption of rGO based catalysts, which can be reflected by the incremental light absorption of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 upon the addition of increasing amounts of rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. S16a).Owing to the comparable optical absorption property of the rGO based samples, almost no difference in the absorption spectra of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 solution is observed in the presence of the same concentration of different samples, excluding the influence of the light absorption on the photocatalytic performance. The charge separation and transfer behaviors in the rGO based samples were then reflected by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.As sketched in Fig. 4c, Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution excited at 400 nm shows a strong emission peak around 610 nm.With the further addition of rGO based samples, the PL of the excited Ru (bpy) 3 2 is obviously quenched, and the quenching degree gradually increases with the increasing amount of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (Fig. S16b).The above result suggests the suppression of radiative charge recombination resulted from the transfer of photoexcited electrons from Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 light absorber to rGO based catalysts.With the same dosage of the catalysts, the PL quenching degrees are in the order: rGO rGO/ Pd rGO/PdPtCu 30 L rGO/PdPtCu 6 L rGO/PdPt 6 L rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L , signifying that the metal configuration on the rGO nanosheets is critical to the charge separation efficiency.When bare Pd nanocubes were added into the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 solution in the absence of rGO, no apparent PL quenching occurs (Fig. S17), which highlights the critical role of rGO in promoting the charge transfer and separation, thus providing additional evidence that Ru(bpy) 3 2 is adsorbed on the rGO nanosheets rather than the metal particles.Time-resolved PL decay spectroscopy was then employed to further reveal the charge dynamic behaviors.As depicted in Fig. 4d, all emission patterns of excited Ru (bpy) 3 2 aqueous solution in the absence or presence of catalysts follow one exponential decay 56.Compared to blank Ru(bpy) 3 2 solution (210.1 ns), shortened PL lifetime can be observed in the presence of rGO (202.8 ns), rGO/Pd (196.9 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 2 L (182.0 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 6 L (189.1 ns), rGO/PdPtCu 30 L (189.9 ns) and rGO/PdPt 6 L (188.0 ns), respectively (Table S3).The decline of PL lifetime follows the same sequence as the PL quenching degree, further evidencing more efficient suppression of detrimental charge recombination in rGO/PdPtCu 2 L 17,57,58. To gain an in-depth insight into the improved charge separation and transfer kinetics of rGO/PdPtCu 2 L , electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been carried out to investigate the interfacial charge transfer resistance.As displayed in Fig. 4e, the Nyquist plot of rGO/ PdPtCu 2 L possesses the smallest arc radius among the different samples, revealing the lowest resistance for electron migration.Especially, the gradually reduced radii of Nyquist plots are observed when the thickness of PtCu shell decreases from 30 to 6 and then to 2 at.layers, disclosing the shell thickness dependent charge transfer kinetics.The above statements are further confirmed by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves examined with Ar-saturated KHCO 3 solution as electrolyte, from which it can be seen that rGO/PdPtCu 2 L exhibits the highest current densities, signifying that the synergism of Pd core and ultrathin PtCu shell efficiently promotes the separation and transfer of charge carriers, thus accelerating the CO 2 -to-CO/CH 4 conversion. It should be noted that the shell thickness is not the only key variable influencing the efficiency of charge separation and migration.Particularly, with the same shell thickness, the larger current density of rGO/ PdPt 6 L over that of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L together with the smaller Nyquist arc and higher PL quenching degree validates that pure Pt shell is more conducive to smooth electron movement relative to PtCu shell.To further decipher the charge migration processes, density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed to evaluate the electron flow behavior in detail.According to the aforementioned HRTEM results, Pd (100), Pt(100) and PtCu(100) facets are the most predominantly exposed crystallographic planes for rGO/Pd, rGO/PdPt and rGO/ PdPtCu samples, respectively, which were selected as the model surfaces to ensure the consistency of the theoretical models and the experimental results.According to the electrostatic potential, the work functions of PtCu 1 L , PtCu 2 L , PtCu 3 L and PtCu 4 L were calculated to be 4.98, 5.37, 5.49 and 5.52 eV, which are basically higher than those of rGO (4.33 eV) and Pd(100) (5.26 eV), but lower than that of Pt(100) (5.63 eV) (Table S4).Wherefore, it can be inferred that the Fermi level is in the order of rGO Pd PtCu Pt.As it is well documented that electrons will flow from the material with higher Fermi level to that with lower one 59, one can rationally deduce that electrons on the Pd core will migrate to the PtCu (or Pt) shell with more than one-layer thickness.This redistribution of charge is further revealed by experimental XPS results, implying the electron movement between the interfacial materials (Fig. 2g-i).Furthermore, valence-band XPS spectra manifest that the energy difference between the valence band (VB) edge and Fermi level is nearly zero for the rGO based samples, evidencing that the introduction of Pd core and PtCu (or Pt) shell does not alter the zero-bandgap feature of rGO (Fig. S18). Considering that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 is at 3.19 eV and its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is at 5.68 eV relative to the vacuum level according to previous works 60,61, the Fermi levels of rGO, Pd, PtCu and Pt are lower than the LUMO of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 so that the photoexcited electrons in the LUMO of the light absorber can be transferred to the Fermi levels of them.The photogenerated electrons are preferentially transferred from Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 to rGO through - interfacial interaction between them, which subsequently migrate to Pd cores and then to PtCu (or Pt) shells in larger work functions for CO 2 reduction (Fig. 5a).Owing to the higher work function of Pt compared to that of PtCu, the larger work function difference between Pd and Pt produces an enlarged driving force for promoted interfacial electron transfer from core to shell, well explaining the smoother charge separation and migration in rGO/PdPt 6 L relative to rGO/PdPtCu 6 L . Then the question comes up to reveal the role of PtCu thickness on the charge separation and transfer for the rGO/PdPtCu samples with the same exposed facets of PtCu(100).To investigate this mechanism, the interfacial models of Pd(100)PtCu nL with one to four atomic layers were established and the corresponding charge analyses were performed to track the charge migration behavior.As depicted in Fig. 5b, driving by the work function difference, electrons will flow from Pd to PtCu when two materials are combined together.That is, electrons could be accumulated on the upper PtCu shells.Moreover, according to the Bader charge analysis, this electron accumulation will experience a gradual decline as the PtCu thickness increases from one to four layers (Table S5), which can be clearly visualized from the differential charge density in Fig. 5b.The thickness-dependent charge separation will lead to the variation of the interfacial polarization 62, which could further contribute to the robust electron trapping ability of PdPtCu shells with lower-layer PtCu and thus facilitating the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion efficiency.It is worth noting that the plasmonic absorption band of Pd, PdPt and PdPtCu is located in UV region (Fig. S19), and the contribution of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on the charge transfer/separation can be ruled out 6364656667. In addition to the charge separation and transfer, the ultimate photocatalytic property is also correlated with the surface reactivity of the catalysts.As discussed before, despite the superior electron separation/ transfer behavior, the activity and selectivity of rGO/PdPt 6 L in CH production are much lower as compared with those of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L , implying that the shell thickness dependent charge kinetics is not the only key factor determining the eventual photocatalytic performance.PtCu surface may provide more favorable reaction sites for CO 2 -to-CH Cl 2 to rGO/PdPtCu 2 L catalyst; (b) differential charge density determined by first-principles simulations illustrating the electron distribution between Pd(100) substrate and PtCu(100) shell when the PtCu shell thickness is altered from 1 to 4 layers.The Pd, Pt and Cu atoms are marked in green, gray and blue, respectively.The olive and cyan colors represent an increase and decrease in electron density, respectively.conversion compared to Pt surface.According to the CO 2 temperatureprogrammed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) profiles of rGO/Pd, rGO/PdPt 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 6 L samples, the peak at around 100 C can be assigned to physisorbed CO 2 , while another peak at around 500-600 C originates from the chemisorbed CO 2 (Fig. S20).The desorption peak intensity of rGO/PdPtCu 6 L at high temperature is much higher than those of rGO/Pd and rGO/PdPt 6 L , proving the better CO 2 adsorption on the PtCu(100) surface.Moreover, as demonstrated by the LSV curves conducted in Ar-saturated and CO 2 -saturated 0.5 M KHCO 3 electrolyte, respectively, the higher current densities under CO 2 atmosphere compared to those under Ar bubbling can be assigned to the cathodic current generated by CO 2 reduction.As shown in Fig. 4f, rGO/ PdPtCu 6 L exhibits a larger current density enhancement as compared with rGO/Pd and rGO/PdPt 6 L , confirming that the PtCu(100) surface is more active for CO 2 reduction compared to Pd(100) and Pt(100) surface.Moreover, larger difference in the current density between Ar and CO 2 can be observed for rGO/PdPtCu 2 L compared to those for rGO/PdPtCu 6 L and rGO/PdPtCu 30 L , meaning that the surface reactivity of PtCu(100) is also negatively correlative to the thickness of the shell. To gain a deep insight into the influence of PtCu thickness on the surface reaction, the chemisorption behavior of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on the Pd, Pt and PtCu surfaces was further described by the DFT calculations.As illustrated in Table 1, one can clearly see that PtCu surface exhibits much more negative CO 2 adsorption energies (ranging from -0.27 to -0.92 eV) when compared with those of Pd(100) (-0.02 eV) and Pt(100) (-0.04 eV), implying the substantially enhanced interaction between CO 2 molecules and PtCu surface.Additionally, as the thickness of PtCu increases from 1 to 4 at.layers, the adsorption energy of CO 2 experiences a gradual decline from -0.92 to -0.70 eV, and then to -0.59 and -0.27 eV, which suggests the steadily weakened CO 2 interaction.This shell-thickness dependence of CO 2 adsorption can be rationally ascribed to the synergistic interplay of surface strain and interfacial polarization 68,69.Interestingly, a more favorable CO 2 adsorption can be expected on the surface of PtCu 1 L and PtCu 2 L with higher binding strength relative to H 2 O molecules.In stark contrast, when compared to the CO 2 adsorption energies (E adCO2 ), the corresponding H 2 O adsorption energies (E adH2O ) on the Pd and Pt surface are much more negative, evincing a dominant proton reduction pathway.When the PtCu shell is thin enough, it is also possible that a two-step cascade catalytic process occurs, including the CO 2 -to-CO conversion on Pd core and the further CO-to-CH 4 conversion on PtCu shell 70,71.Taken together, the PtCu shell with lower atomic thickness promotes both the charge separation and the targeted reactant adsorption, thus accelerating the CO 2 reduction reaction and simultaneously restraining the side H 2 evolution reaction. Optimized geometries for the adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on different metal surface and the corresponding lowest adsorption energy. Based on above analyses, a tentative mechanism for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over rGO/PdPtCu 2 L is proposed.As illustrated in Scheme 1, under visible light irradiation, the electrons in the HOMO of the light absorber Ru(bpy) 3 2 are excited to the LUMO, and the Ru (bpy) 3 2 is promoted to the excited state by the photogenerated holes left in the HOMO (Step 1).This excited state is then reductively quenched by rGO/PdPtCu 2 L to form an oxidized photosensitizer Ru (bpy) 3 3 , during which the photoexcited electrons are transferred to rGO nanosheets owing to the - interaction between them (Step 2).The transferred electrons then shift to the active sites on the surface of ultrathin PtCu shell with Pd core as the conducting channel 21.The interfacial charge polarization promotes the electron transfer from Pd core to PtCu shell, causing the higher electron density on the PtCu surface.Moreover, the electron accumulation together with the compressive strain on the ultrathin PtCu surface strengthens the adsorption of CO 2 molecules, selectively promoting the 8-electron reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 when compared with the 2-electron reduction to CO and H 2 (Step 3).The oxidized Ru(bpy) 3 3 is then reduced back to Ru(bpy) 3 2 by the sacrificial electron donor TEOA to form an entire photoredox cycle (Step 4)."}]}}
