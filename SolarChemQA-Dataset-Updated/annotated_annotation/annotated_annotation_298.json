Direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres were fabricated via a facile hydrothermal reaction with tetrabutyl titanate and Si nanospheres.In a typical process, 25 mL of Ti(OBu) 4 and 1.5 g Si nanospheres were added in a 100 mL Teon pot and 3 mL of hydrouoric acid was added dropwise with stirring.Aer stirring for 15 min at room temperature, the Teon pot was sealed and kept at 200 C for 24 h.Finally, the as-prepared Si/TiO 2 nanospheres were obtained aer the resulting precipitate was centrifuged three times, washed with ethanol to remove the hydrouoric acid and organics, and then dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h.Pure TiO 2 sample was prepared using the same hydrothermal reaction without Si nanospheres. The crystal structure of all the samples was examined by means of X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE with Cu-Ka radiation, l 14 1.5418 A).The morphology and particle size were determined by eld emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JSM-2010) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-3600).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained with an Edinburgh Instrument FLS 920 spectrometer.The excitation wavelength, l ex , was 360 nm, and both the bandwidths of excitation and emission were 5 nm.The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) specic surface area of the samples were determined by a high speed automated area and pore size analyzer (ASAP 2010). The photocatalytic reaction cell and its setup have been described in our earlier publication. 37The photocatalytic reactor is a cylindrical stainless steel cell with quartz windows on the top to enable the transmission of 355 nm pulse laser radiations.At the bottom of the cell there is a gas inlet with a needle valve which lets the CO 2 gas pass through the distilled water in the cell and there is an outlet xed with the rubber septum in order to dispense the sample through the syringe almost at the same level at the opposite side.The whole cell is kept on a magnetic stirrer that constantly replenishes the photocatalyst in the path of laser radiations.Care has to be taken not to let the water level go much higher than the level of the catalyst platform in order to have better interaction of radiation with the photocatalyst.Since the quantity of sample taken for gas chromatographic analysis at each time was around 4.0 mL, the water level did not decrease due to sample withdrawing from the reaction cell.The reaction cell was cleaned, dried, then was tightly closed and checked for leaks up to 50 psi pressure aer 1.0 g catalyst was loaded along with 100 mL distilled water.High purity CO 2 gas (99.99) was introduced through reactor inlets and the reactor pressure was maintained at 50 psi.Prior to turning on the pulsed laser, CO 2 gas was purged into 100 mL water containing 1.0 g of catalyst for 30 min in order to saturate the contents of the reactor with CO 2 .Aer a predetermined irradiation time, water samples were withdrawn from the reactor using a syringe without opening the reactor and subjected to GC analysis. The laser (wavelength 14 355 nm) used for this study was the third harmonic of the pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Model Spectra Physics GCR 250-10) operated at 10 Hz and the pulse width of 8 ns.Throughout this study, a laser pulse energy of 40 mJ was used.The laser beam was routed with high power UV reecting mirrors/dichroic mirrors so that the beam enters from the top of the cell and an appropriate lens was also used to slightly expand the beam to the same diameter of the catalyst platform.Although the laser pulse energy was quite stable it was monitored throughout the experiment with the 50-50 beam splitter and the laser energy meter supplied by Coherent USA. The water samples were analyzed for methanol and other hydrocarbons using a gas chromatograph equipped with ame ionization detector (FID).The separation was carried out on Rtx-Wax column (dimensions: 30 m A 0.32 mm A 0.32 mm) obtained from Restek, using temperature programmed conditions.For the analysis of end products, 4.0 mL of the laser irradiated sample was injected into the gas chromatograph and the operating conditions were as follows: oven temperature was set at 40 C and was then increased to 90 C at 5 C min A1 heating rate and increased to 180 C at the rate of 50 C min A1 to elute all the components from the column before injecting another sample.The injector and detectors were both set at 200 C and helium was used as the carrier gas.The total analysis run time was 11.8 min.A calibration plot was established for methanol standard solution in distilled water for calculating the amount of methanol produced as a function of irradiation time. In a typical process, 0.1 g of the sample was uniformly dispersed on the glass reactor (4.2 cm 2 ).A 300 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the light source.The reaction system (230 mL in volume) was vacuum-treated several times, and then the high purity of CO 2 gas was followed into the reaction setup to reach ambient pressure.0.4 mL of deionized water was injected into the reaction system as reducer.The as-prepared photocatalysts were allowed to equilibrate in the CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere for several hours to ensure that the adsorption of gas molecules was complete.During the irradiation, about 1 mL of gas was continually taken from the reaction cell at given time intervals for subsequent CH 4 concentration analysis by using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu Corp., Japan).All samples were treated at 300 C in nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h for removal of organic adsorbates before the photocatalysis reaction. The photocatalytic activity was measured as follows: 0.100 g of asprepared TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 samples were added to a 250 mL Pyrex glass vessel which contained 200 mL RhB solution (7.5 mg L A1 ).The light source was a 300 W Xe arc lamp (CHF-XM500W, Beijing TrustTech Co. Ltd.) with an illumination intensity of 400 mW cm A2 .Prior to irradiation, RhB solution suspended with photocatalysts was stirred in the dark for 30 min to ensure that the surface of photocatalysts reaches the adsorption-desorption equilibrium.3 mL of the suspension was withdrawn throughout the experiment aer every 10 min.The samples were analyzed by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer aer removing the catalyst powders by centrifugation.215) and (303) planes of TiO 2 (JCPDS Card 21-1272), respectively.From the diffraction peaks in the XRD curve of direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres marked in blue, which contain both the Si and TiO 2 diffraction peaks, it can be seen obviously that the Si/TiO 2 product obtained via a hydrothermal method is composed of Si and TiO 2 .The diffraction peaks of Si in the XRD curve of direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres are very low, which may result from its low content."}, {"llm generation": "Si nanospheres, TiO2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO2 nanospheres", "source": "To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres, the conversion of CO 2 into hydrocarbon fuels in distilled water was investigated using a high power pulsed laser as light source at 355 nm wavelength.", "context": "As depicted in Fig. 2(a), the SiO 2 nanospheres prepared via the Stober method are monodisperse and uniform with a smooth surface and an average diameter of about 300 nm.Aer the magnesiothermic reduction process, Si nanospheres were obtained with a porous structure and rough surface, resulting from the loss of O atoms from SiO 2 nanospheres captured by Mg under high temperature.The diameter of Si nanospheres remained mainly unchanged (as shown in Fig. 2(b)).The SEM images of the contrast TiO 2 samples prepared by a hydrothermal method without adding Si nanospheres are depicted in Fig. 2(c In order to obtain further information on the structure of the samples, TEM observation of the TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres was carried out.It can be clearly noticed from Fig. 3(a) that the as-prepared TiO 2 samples are composed of a large quantity of square nanosheets with an average edge length of about 100 nm and a thickness of about 10 nm, which is in good agreement with the result obtained from the SEM images.The TEM image of Si/TiO 2 direct Zscheme nanocomposites in Fig. 3(b) clearly shows that the Si nanospheres were coated by TiO 2 nanosheets.Moreover, it can be observed that the Si nanospheres appear with a porous morphology resulting from the O element captured by Mg in the magnesiothermic reduction process.The magnied TEM image of the nanostructure of the Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites in Fig. 3(c) presents the TiO 2 nanosheets aggregation morphology on the Si porous nanospheres, revealing the formation of the Si/TiO 2 Zscheme system.The high-magnication TEM in Fig. 3(d Fig. 4(a) shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres.It can be noticed from the spectra that the as-prepared TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibit similar absorption behaviour in the ultraviolet region.However, Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme nanospheres show an enhanced absorbance throughout the visible light region due to the existence of Si which is a visible light responsive material with a band gap of 1.12 eV.The improved visible light absorption explains the enhanced photocatalytic properties of the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres, as described later. To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres, the conversion of CO 2 into hydrocarbon fuels in distilled water was investigated using a high power pulsed laser as light source at 355 nm wavelength.As we know, a number of reaction products (such as HCHO, CH 3 OH, HCOOH, CO, CH 4 , etc.) can be obtained during the CO 2 photoreduction process.The following reactions may be the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction into value added hydrocarbons. In this study, we were selective to obtain CH 3 OH as the main product of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction over Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites.Our comparative tests demonstrated that nearly no product was found by using Si nanospheres or TiO 2 nanosheets as photocatalysts.This may be due to the low conductive band potential of TiO 2 and low valance band potential of Si, respectively.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of Si and TiO 2 semiconductors were calculated by the equation as follows 38 and are presented in Table 1. where X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor; E C is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV); and E g is the band gap of the semiconductor. It can be inferred from the table that, although the calculated VB band edge electrochemical potential of TiO 2 (2.91 V vs. NHE) is high enough to initiate the reaction of H 2 O and h to form O 2 and H (0.82 V vs. NHE), the calculated CB band edge electrochemical potential (A0.29 V vs. NHE) is lower than the reaction potential needed for CO 2 transformation to CH 3 OH with H and photogenerated e A (A0.38 V vs. NHE), resulting in the thermodynamic impossibility of CO 2 photoreduction into CH 3 OH over TiO 2 catalyst under 355 nm laser irradiation.In the same way, pure Si catalyst has an appropriate CB band edge electrochemical potential to reduce CO 2 into CH 3 OH with H and e A , but its low VB band edge electrochemical potential (0.72 V vs. NHE) cannot transform any H from the reaction of H 2 O oxidation, which enables the photoreduction of CO 2 into CH 3 OH. Gas chromatography (GC) was employed to verify and quantify the methanol products from the CO 2 reduction over direct Z-scheme nanospheres.It is depicted in Fig. 5(a) that the retention time for methanol standard is 2.46 min for the selected GC parameters and the used column.The relationship between GC peak area and methanol concentration was conrmed by using known methanol concentrations in a standard sample for calibration as depicted in Fig. 5(b), which exhibits a linear trend. Fig. 6(a) depicts the GC peaks of products for samples from CO 2 photoreduction, which are taken in 30 min intervals of irradiation with 355 nm laser by using Si/TiO 2 as the photocatalyst.It can be seen clearly that all the GC peaks in Fig. 6(a) appear at exactly 2.46 min of the retention time and no other GC peaks were detected, which suggests that the methanol is the only product obtained through the laser induced photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , possibly because of the sharp line width of the laser beam centred around 355 nm (highly monochromatic) of the pulsed laser radiation.Furthermore, it was shown that the GC peak areas of methanol from CO 2 photoreduction increase with the irradiation time (30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min) and reach the maximum in 150 min of irradiation aer which they start to fall.Fig. 6(b) shows the concentration variation of the photocatalytic process of converting CO 2 into methanol with laser irradiation.It can be observed that the produced methanol concentration increases with laser irradiation time and reaches its maximum (197 mM/100 mL) at 150 min, but aerwards it declines.The decrease of the methanol concentration may be caused by the existence of photocatalytic oxidation effect of Si/TiO 2 composed semiconductor with positive VB position.When the methanol was produced in a substantial amount, it will be adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalysts and oxidized to inorganic matter, which is in agreement with the results obtained by, and explanation of, other groups. 37,40,41n order to estimate the efficiency of CO 2 conversion into methanol using direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres as the photocatalyst with 355 nm laser irradiation, the process of the CO 2 conversion efficiency was estimated.The amount of CO 2 dissolved in distilled water under our experimental conditions can be calculated from Henry's law and the amount of CO 2 dissolved in 1 L water at atmospheric pressure is 34 mmol (Henry constant).As the pressure in the photocatalytic measurement is 50 psi (3.4 atm), the total CO 2 dissolved in 100 mL of water is 11.56 mmol.Once we know the methanol concentration at different irradiation times of the photocatalytic process, the CO 2 conversion efficiency can be calculated from the quotient of actual concentrations of methanol and CO 2 concentration (as shown in Fig. 6(b)).For that the maximum concentration of methanol is 197 mM/100 mL aer 150 minutes of laser irradiation, the maximum CO 2 conversion efficiency is calculated (197/11 560) to be about 1.71.However, according to Schuler's experimental result, 42 the CO 2 solubility in binary mixtures of water and methanol increases with increasing methanol content, resulting in the actual CO 2 conversion efficiency being slightly lower than the calculated efficiency (1.71). Moreover, we can calculate the photonic efficiency of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 from the number of methanol molecules produced for certain irradiation time and the number of consumed photons in the reaction.The number of methanol molecules can be estimated from the molar concentrations and Avogadro's number.In the case of laser, the number of photons at 355 nm wavelength with the laser pulse energy of 40 mJ per pulse and repetition rate of 10 Hz can be calculated to be 4.286 A 10 19 photons per min.The maximum rate of methanol is 1.294 A 10 18 molecules per min at the irradiation time interval from 60 min to 90 min.As a single methanol molecule needs 6 photogenerated electrons, the maximum photonic efficiency (P.E.) of photoreduction of CO 2 can be calculated (6 A 1.294 A 10 18 /4.286A 10 19 ) to be about 18.1.The achievement of high photonic efficiency of direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres may be due to the construction nature of Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system. As shown in Fig. 7, photoluminescence spectroscopy was employed for further investigation of the photocatalytic activities of TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres.Two major components of the spectrum of direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres consisted of a strong peak at 540 nm and a weak, broad peak from 400 to 520 nm, which are attributed to Si and TiO 2 , respectively.Moreover, it can be seen clearly that the peak intensities in photoluminescence intensity of Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme nanospheres are much lower in contrast to that of Si nanospheres and TiO 2 nanosheets.As the PL emission resulted from the recombination of photo-induced charge carriers and information regarding the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, and their recombination kinetics can be drawn from the PL spectra, 43 it can be inferred that direct Z-scheme Si/ TiO 2 nanospheres have a higher efficient separation rate of photogenerated charge carriers than that of TiO 2 nanosheets, which can be attributed to the formation of the Si/TiO 2 direct Zscheme system. In order to conrm the effect of the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system on improving the charge separation efficiency, RhB was selected to be the target pollutant for degradation by Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres under 300 W Xe arc lamp irradiation with an illumination intensity of 400 mW cm A2 .As shown in Fig. 8(a), it can be clearly seen that RhB molecules were completely decomposed by Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme nanospheres aer 1 h Xe arc lamp irradiation, while only 88.5 were decomposed by TiO 2 nanosheets and 6.6 by Si nanospheres, indicating the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme compared with the TiO 2 nanosheets and Si nanospheres.Fig. 8(b) depicts the kinetic study of photocatalytic degradation of RhB solution over the three photocatalytic materials.The linear relationship of ln(C 0 /C) vs. irradiation time suggests that degradation of RhB is a rst order reaction.The calculated rate constants for Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and Si/TiO 2 Zscheme nanospheres are 0.000772, 0.0354 and 0.074 min A1 , respectively, from which it can be seen that the Si/TiO 2 Zscheme has the best photocatalytic activity, which is 2.09 times that of the TiO 2 nanosheets and 95.8 times the Si nanospheres.Therefore, construction of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme is benecial to improve the photocatalytic activity of Si and TiO 2 extensively. Furthermore, the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under Xe arc lamp irradiation was carried out to investigate the inuence of light source and experimental conditions on the product.Fig. 9(a) shows that CO 2 can be photoreduced to CH 4 by using all the prepared samples as photocatalysts.It is obvious that the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibit much higher activity than pure TiO 2 nanosheets and Si nanospheres.The higher conversion is attributed to the improved photogenerated carriers separation efficiency of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme system.To further investigate whether CH 4 is a product of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, we carried out a series comparative experiments to investigate the source of C and H in the produced CH 4 under Xe arc lamp irradiation.As shown in Fig. 9(b), the CH 4 detected in normal conditions is much higher than that in other experiments.It should be noted that the extremely low CH 4 concentrations in non-normal conditions are from the naturally occurring CH 4 in air (1-2 ppm).In other words, CH 4 can be produced only in the case of possessing all the conditions including catalyst, CO 2 , H 2 O and light.It can be inferred from the contrast experiment that C in the photoreduction product CH 4 is from CO 2 , while H is from H 2 O. Therefore, it can be conrmed that the detected CH 4 is from the photoreduction of CO 2 , but not a product of organic oxidation at the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme or release of surface bound organics. Because the photocatalytic process is surface orientated, the specic surface areas of the prepared TiO 2 nanosheets and Si/ TiO 2 nanocomposites were also measured by BET to study the actual exposed surface area in the photocatalytic reaction.As shown in Fig. 10, the Si/TiO 2 sample possesses a slightly higher specic surface area (165.4 m 2 g A1 ) than TiO 2 nanosheets (154.3 m 2 g A1 ) due to the surface structuring effect by the formation of spherical heterostructures with TiO 2 nanosheets well dispersed.In the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments, our results show that only the Si/TiO 2 sample is capable of producing methanol under laser irradiation due to thermodynamics, indicating that the exposed surface area of the catalyst has no effect on its photocatalytic reduction activity.In the photocatalytic degradation experiment, 0.1 g of the asprepared Si, TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 catalysts was adopted, respectively.The slight difference of the catalysts in specic surface area is as small as 6.6, which is suggested to not be the main reason for the great improvement of photodegradation efficiency (more than twice).Hence, it can be concluded that the excellent performance of the Si/TiO 2 catalyst does not result from a surface structuring effect, but from the improved photogenerated carriers' concentration and separation efficiency from the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system construction. Fig. 11 illustrates the schematic charge ow in the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system under illumination.355 nm lasers can be harvested by both Si and TiO 2 to generate e A -h pairs.As reported in Yang's previous research, 32 the photogenerated hole in TiO 2 (TiO 2 h ) moves toward the TiO 2 /electrolyte interface and oxidizes OH A to oxygen, while photogenerated electrons in the TiO 2 (TiO 2 e A ) move away from the interface between TiO 2 and the electrolyte due to the schottky barrier.The potential barrier at the Si/TiO 2 interface reects holes back into the TiO 2 layers.To complete the circuit, the photogenerated electrons in Si ( Si e A ) move to the surface where the CO 2 reduction reaction takes place.The photogenerated hole in Si ( Si h ) moves towards the Si/TiO 2 interface and recombines with the TiO 2 e A .Therefore, the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres show high activity towards CO 2 reduction into methanol since its band alignment at the junction helps reduce recombination under illumination.However, for individual Si photocatalysts, its VB potential (0.721 V vs. NHE) is not high enough to achieve the oxidation reaction potential (O 2 /H 2 O 0.82 V vs. NHE).Similarly, the CB potential of TiO 2 (A0.29 V vs. NHE) is too low to initiate the CO 2 reduction reaction into methanol (CH 3 OH/CO 2 A0.38 V vs. NHE).In other words, the individual Si nanospheres or TiO 2 nanosheets lack suitable VB or CB potential to photoreduce CO 2 into methanol."}, {"llm generation": "Si/TiO2 as the photocatalyst", "source": "Fig. 6(a) depicts the GC peaks of products for samples from CO 2 photoreduction, which are taken in 30 min intervals of irradiation with 355 nm laser by using Si/TiO 2 as the photocatalyst.", "context": "As depicted in Fig. 2(a), the SiO 2 nanospheres prepared via the Stober method are monodisperse and uniform with a smooth surface and an average diameter of about 300 nm.Aer the magnesiothermic reduction process, Si nanospheres were obtained with a porous structure and rough surface, resulting from the loss of O atoms from SiO 2 nanospheres captured by Mg under high temperature.The diameter of Si nanospheres remained mainly unchanged (as shown in Fig. 2(b)).The SEM images of the contrast TiO 2 samples prepared by a hydrothermal method without adding Si nanospheres are depicted in Fig. 2(c In order to obtain further information on the structure of the samples, TEM observation of the TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres was carried out.It can be clearly noticed from Fig. 3(a) that the as-prepared TiO 2 samples are composed of a large quantity of square nanosheets with an average edge length of about 100 nm and a thickness of about 10 nm, which is in good agreement with the result obtained from the SEM images.The TEM image of Si/TiO 2 direct Zscheme nanocomposites in Fig. 3(b) clearly shows that the Si nanospheres were coated by TiO 2 nanosheets.Moreover, it can be observed that the Si nanospheres appear with a porous morphology resulting from the O element captured by Mg in the magnesiothermic reduction process.The magnied TEM image of the nanostructure of the Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites in Fig. 3(c) presents the TiO 2 nanosheets aggregation morphology on the Si porous nanospheres, revealing the formation of the Si/TiO 2 Zscheme system.The high-magnication TEM in Fig. 3(d Fig. 4(a) shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres.It can be noticed from the spectra that the as-prepared TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibit similar absorption behaviour in the ultraviolet region.However, Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme nanospheres show an enhanced absorbance throughout the visible light region due to the existence of Si which is a visible light responsive material with a band gap of 1.12 eV.The improved visible light absorption explains the enhanced photocatalytic properties of the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres, as described later.

Moreover, we can calculate the photonic efficiency of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 from the number of methanol molecules produced for certain irradiation time and the number of consumed photons in the reaction.The number of methanol molecules can be estimated from the molar concentrations and Avogadro's number.In the case of laser, the number of photons at 355 nm wavelength with the laser pulse energy of 40 mJ per pulse and repetition rate of 10 Hz can be calculated to be 4.286 A 10 19 photons per min.The maximum rate of methanol is 1.294 A 10 18 molecules per min at the irradiation time interval from 60 min to 90 min.As a single methanol molecule needs 6 photogenerated electrons, the maximum photonic efficiency (P.E.) of photoreduction of CO 2 can be calculated (6 A 1.294 A 10 18 /4.286A 10 19 ) to be about 18.1.The achievement of high photonic efficiency of direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres may be due to the construction nature of Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system. As shown in Fig. 7, photoluminescence spectroscopy was employed for further investigation of the photocatalytic activities of TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres.Two major components of the spectrum of direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres consisted of a strong peak at 540 nm and a weak, broad peak from 400 to 520 nm, which are attributed to Si and TiO 2 , respectively.Moreover, it can be seen clearly that the peak intensities in photoluminescence intensity of Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme nanospheres are much lower in contrast to that of Si nanospheres and TiO 2 nanosheets.As the PL emission resulted from the recombination of photo-induced charge carriers and information regarding the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, and their recombination kinetics can be drawn from the PL spectra, 43 it can be inferred that direct Z-scheme Si/ TiO 2 nanospheres have a higher efficient separation rate of photogenerated charge carriers than that of TiO 2 nanosheets, which can be attributed to the formation of the Si/TiO 2 direct Zscheme system. In order to conrm the effect of the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system on improving the charge separation efficiency, RhB was selected to be the target pollutant for degradation by Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres under 300 W Xe arc lamp irradiation with an illumination intensity of 400 mW cm A2 .As shown in Fig. 8(a), it can be clearly seen that RhB molecules were completely decomposed by Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme nanospheres aer 1 h Xe arc lamp irradiation, while only 88.5 were decomposed by TiO 2 nanosheets and 6.6 by Si nanospheres, indicating the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme compared with the TiO 2 nanosheets and Si nanospheres.Fig. 8(b) depicts the kinetic study of photocatalytic degradation of RhB solution over the three photocatalytic materials.The linear relationship of ln(C 0 /C) vs. irradiation time suggests that degradation of RhB is a rst order reaction.The calculated rate constants for Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and Si/TiO 2 Zscheme nanospheres are 0.000772, 0.0354 and 0.074 min A1 , respectively, from which it can be seen that the Si/TiO 2 Zscheme has the best photocatalytic activity, which is 2.09 times that of the TiO 2 nanosheets and 95.8 times the Si nanospheres.Therefore, construction of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme is benecial to improve the photocatalytic activity of Si and TiO 2 extensively. Furthermore, the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under Xe arc lamp irradiation was carried out to investigate the inuence of light source and experimental conditions on the product.Fig. 9(a) shows that CO 2 can be photoreduced to CH 4 by using all the prepared samples as photocatalysts.It is obvious that the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibit much higher activity than pure TiO 2 nanosheets and Si nanospheres.The higher conversion is attributed to the improved photogenerated carriers separation efficiency of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme system.To further investigate whether CH 4 is a product of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, we carried out a series comparative experiments to investigate the source of C and H in the produced CH 4 under Xe arc lamp irradiation.As shown in Fig. 9(b), the CH 4 detected in normal conditions is much higher than that in other experiments.It should be noted that the extremely low CH 4 concentrations in non-normal conditions are from the naturally occurring CH 4 in air (1-2 ppm).In other words, CH 4 can be produced only in the case of possessing all the conditions including catalyst, CO 2 , H 2 O and light.It can be inferred from the contrast experiment that C in the photoreduction product CH 4 is from CO 2 , while H is from H 2 O. Therefore, it can be conrmed that the detected CH 4 is from the photoreduction of CO 2 , but not a product of organic oxidation at the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme or release of surface bound organics. Because the photocatalytic process is surface orientated, the specic surface areas of the prepared TiO 2 nanosheets and Si/ TiO 2 nanocomposites were also measured by BET to study the actual exposed surface area in the photocatalytic reaction.As shown in Fig. 10, the Si/TiO 2 sample possesses a slightly higher specic surface area (165.4 m 2 g A1 ) than TiO 2 nanosheets (154.3 m 2 g A1 ) due to the surface structuring effect by the formation of spherical heterostructures with TiO 2 nanosheets well dispersed.In the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments, our results show that only the Si/TiO 2 sample is capable of producing methanol under laser irradiation due to thermodynamics, indicating that the exposed surface area of the catalyst has no effect on its photocatalytic reduction activity.In the photocatalytic degradation experiment, 0.1 g of the asprepared Si, TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 catalysts was adopted, respectively.The slight difference of the catalysts in specic surface area is as small as 6.6, which is suggested to not be the main reason for the great improvement of photodegradation efficiency (more than twice).Hence, it can be concluded that the excellent performance of the Si/TiO 2 catalyst does not result from a surface structuring effect, but from the improved photogenerated carriers' concentration and separation efficiency from the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system construction. Fig. 11 illustrates the schematic charge ow in the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system under illumination.355 nm lasers can be harvested by both Si and TiO 2 to generate e A -h pairs.As reported in Yang's previous research, 32 the photogenerated hole in TiO 2 (TiO 2 h ) moves toward the TiO 2 /electrolyte interface and oxidizes OH A to oxygen, while photogenerated electrons in the TiO 2 (TiO 2 e A ) move away from the interface between TiO 2 and the electrolyte due to the schottky barrier.The potential barrier at the Si/TiO 2 interface reects holes back into the TiO 2 layers.To complete the circuit, the photogenerated electrons in Si ( Si e A ) move to the surface where the CO 2 reduction reaction takes place.The photogenerated hole in Si ( Si h ) moves towards the Si/TiO 2 interface and recombines with the TiO 2 e A .Therefore, the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres show high activity towards CO 2 reduction into methanol since its band alignment at the junction helps reduce recombination under illumination.However, for individual Si photocatalysts, its VB potential (0.721 V vs. NHE) is not high enough to achieve the oxidation reaction potential (O 2 /H 2 O 0.82 V vs. NHE).Similarly, the CB potential of TiO 2 (A0.29 V vs. NHE) is too low to initiate the CO 2 reduction reaction into methanol (CH 3 OH/CO 2 A0.38 V vs. NHE).In other words, the individual Si nanospheres or TiO 2 nanosheets lack suitable VB or CB potential to photoreduce CO 2 into methanol."}, {"llm generation": "Si nanospheres, TiO2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO2 nanospheres", "source": "In order to conrm the effect of the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system on improving the charge separation efficiency, RhB was selected to be the target pollutant for degradation by Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres under 300 W Xe arc lamp irradiation with an illumination intensity of 400 mW cm A2 .", "context": "As depicted in Fig. 2(a), the SiO 2 nanospheres prepared via the Stober method are monodisperse and uniform with a smooth surface and an average diameter of about 300 nm.Aer the magnesiothermic reduction process, Si nanospheres were obtained with a porous structure and rough surface, resulting from the loss of O atoms from SiO 2 nanospheres captured by Mg under high temperature.The diameter of Si nanospheres remained mainly unchanged (as shown in Fig. 2(b)).The SEM images of the contrast TiO 2 samples prepared by a hydrothermal method without adding Si nanospheres are depicted in Fig. 2(c In order to obtain further information on the structure of the samples, TEM observation of the TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres was carried out.It can be clearly noticed from Fig. 3(a) that the as-prepared TiO 2 samples are composed of a large quantity of square nanosheets with an average edge length of about 100 nm and a thickness of about 10 nm, which is in good agreement with the result obtained from the SEM images.The TEM image of Si/TiO 2 direct Zscheme nanocomposites in Fig. 3(b) clearly shows that the Si nanospheres were coated by TiO 2 nanosheets.Moreover, it can be observed that the Si nanospheres appear with a porous morphology resulting from the O element captured by Mg in the magnesiothermic reduction process.The magnied TEM image of the nanostructure of the Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites in Fig. 3(c) presents the TiO 2 nanosheets aggregation morphology on the Si porous nanospheres, revealing the formation of the Si/TiO 2 Zscheme system.The high-magnication TEM in Fig. 3(d Fig. 4(a) shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres.It can be noticed from the spectra that the as-prepared TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibit similar absorption behaviour in the ultraviolet region.However, Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme nanospheres show an enhanced absorbance throughout the visible light region due to the existence of Si which is a visible light responsive material with a band gap of 1.12 eV.The improved visible light absorption explains the enhanced photocatalytic properties of the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres, as described later. To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres, the conversion of CO 2 into hydrocarbon fuels in distilled water was investigated using a high power pulsed laser as light source at 355 nm wavelength.As we know, a number of reaction products (such as HCHO, CH 3 OH, HCOOH, CO, CH 4 , etc.) can be obtained during the CO 2 photoreduction process.The following reactions may be the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction into value added hydrocarbons. In this study, we were selective to obtain CH 3 OH as the main product of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction over Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites.Our comparative tests demonstrated that nearly no product was found by using Si nanospheres or TiO 2 nanosheets as photocatalysts.This may be due to the low conductive band potential of TiO 2 and low valance band potential of Si, respectively.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of Si and TiO 2 semiconductors were calculated by the equation as follows 38 and are presented in Table 1. where X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor; E C is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV); and E g is the band gap of the semiconductor. It can be inferred from the table that, although the calculated VB band edge electrochemical potential of TiO 2 (2.91 V vs. NHE) is high enough to initiate the reaction of H 2 O and h to form O 2 and H (0.82 V vs. NHE), the calculated CB band edge electrochemical potential (A0.29 V vs. NHE) is lower than the reaction potential needed for CO 2 transformation to CH 3 OH with H and photogenerated e A (A0.38 V vs. NHE), resulting in the thermodynamic impossibility of CO 2 photoreduction into CH 3 OH over TiO 2 catalyst under 355 nm laser irradiation.In the same way, pure Si catalyst has an appropriate CB band edge electrochemical potential to reduce CO 2 into CH 3 OH with H and e A , but its low VB band edge electrochemical potential (0.72 V vs. NHE) cannot transform any H from the reaction of H 2 O oxidation, which enables the photoreduction of CO 2 into CH 3 OH. Gas chromatography (GC) was employed to verify and quantify the methanol products from the CO 2 reduction over direct Z-scheme nanospheres.It is depicted in Fig. 5(a) that the retention time for methanol standard is 2.46 min for the selected GC parameters and the used column.The relationship between GC peak area and methanol concentration was conrmed by using known methanol concentrations in a standard sample for calibration as depicted in Fig. 5(b), which exhibits a linear trend. Fig. 6(a) depicts the GC peaks of products for samples from CO 2 photoreduction, which are taken in 30 min intervals of irradiation with 355 nm laser by using Si/TiO 2 as the photocatalyst.It can be seen clearly that all the GC peaks in Fig. 6(a) appear at exactly 2.46 min of the retention time and no other GC peaks were detected, which suggests that the methanol is the only product obtained through the laser induced photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , possibly because of the sharp line width of the laser beam centred around 355 nm (highly monochromatic) of the pulsed laser radiation.Furthermore, it was shown that the GC peak areas of methanol from CO 2 photoreduction increase with the irradiation time (30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min) and reach the maximum in 150 min of irradiation aer which they start to fall.Fig. 6(b) shows the concentration variation of the photocatalytic process of converting CO 2 into methanol with laser irradiation.It can be observed that the produced methanol concentration increases with laser irradiation time and reaches its maximum (197 mM/100 mL) at 150 min, but aerwards it declines.The decrease of the methanol concentration may be caused by the existence of photocatalytic oxidation effect of Si/TiO 2 composed semiconductor with positive VB position.When the methanol was produced in a substantial amount, it will be adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalysts and oxidized to inorganic matter, which is in agreement with the results obtained by, and explanation of, other groups. 37,40,41n order to estimate the efficiency of CO 2 conversion into methanol using direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres as the photocatalyst with 355 nm laser irradiation, the process of the CO 2 conversion efficiency was estimated.The amount of CO 2 dissolved in distilled water under our experimental conditions can be calculated from Henry's law and the amount of CO 2 dissolved in 1 L water at atmospheric pressure is 34 mmol (Henry constant).As the pressure in the photocatalytic measurement is 50 psi (3.4 atm), the total CO 2 dissolved in 100 mL of water is 11.56 mmol.Once we know the methanol concentration at different irradiation times of the photocatalytic process, the CO 2 conversion efficiency can be calculated from the quotient of actual concentrations of methanol and CO 2 concentration (as shown in Fig. 6(b)).For that the maximum concentration of methanol is 197 mM/100 mL aer 150 minutes of laser irradiation, the maximum CO 2 conversion efficiency is calculated (197/11 560) to be about 1.71.However, according to Schuler's experimental result, 42 the CO 2 solubility in binary mixtures of water and methanol increases with increasing methanol content, resulting in the actual CO 2 conversion efficiency being slightly lower than the calculated efficiency (1.71). Moreover, we can calculate the photonic efficiency of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 from the number of methanol molecules produced for certain irradiation time and the number of consumed photons in the reaction.The number of methanol molecules can be estimated from the molar concentrations and Avogadro's number.In the case of laser, the number of photons at 355 nm wavelength with the laser pulse energy of 40 mJ per pulse and repetition rate of 10 Hz can be calculated to be 4.286 A 10 19 photons per min.The maximum rate of methanol is 1.294 A 10 18 molecules per min at the irradiation time interval from 60 min to 90 min.As a single methanol molecule needs 6 photogenerated electrons, the maximum photonic efficiency (P.E.) of photoreduction of CO 2 can be calculated (6 A 1.294 A 10 18 /4.286A 10 19 ) to be about 18.1.The achievement of high photonic efficiency of direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres may be due to the construction nature of Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system. As shown in Fig. 7, photoluminescence spectroscopy was employed for further investigation of the photocatalytic activities of TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres.Two major components of the spectrum of direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres consisted of a strong peak at 540 nm and a weak, broad peak from 400 to 520 nm, which are attributed to Si and TiO 2 , respectively.Moreover, it can be seen clearly that the peak intensities in photoluminescence intensity of Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme nanospheres are much lower in contrast to that of Si nanospheres and TiO 2 nanosheets.As the PL emission resulted from the recombination of photo-induced charge carriers and information regarding the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, and their recombination kinetics can be drawn from the PL spectra, 43 it can be inferred that direct Z-scheme Si/ TiO 2 nanospheres have a higher efficient separation rate of photogenerated charge carriers than that of TiO 2 nanosheets, which can be attributed to the formation of the Si/TiO 2 direct Zscheme system. In order to conrm the effect of the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system on improving the charge separation efficiency, RhB was selected to be the target pollutant for degradation by Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres under 300 W Xe arc lamp irradiation with an illumination intensity of 400 mW cm A2 .As shown in Fig. 8(a), it can be clearly seen that RhB molecules were completely decomposed by Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme nanospheres aer 1 h Xe arc lamp irradiation, while only 88.5 were decomposed by TiO 2 nanosheets and 6.6 by Si nanospheres, indicating the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme compared with the TiO 2 nanosheets and Si nanospheres.Fig. 8(b) depicts the kinetic study of photocatalytic degradation of RhB solution over the three photocatalytic materials.The linear relationship of ln(C 0 /C) vs. irradiation time suggests that degradation of RhB is a rst order reaction.The calculated rate constants for Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and Si/TiO 2 Zscheme nanospheres are 0.000772, 0.0354 and 0.074 min A1 , respectively, from which it can be seen that the Si/TiO 2 Zscheme has the best photocatalytic activity, which is 2.09 times that of the TiO 2 nanosheets and 95.8 times the Si nanospheres.Therefore, construction of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme is benecial to improve the photocatalytic activity of Si and TiO 2 extensively. Furthermore, the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under Xe arc lamp irradiation was carried out to investigate the inuence of light source and experimental conditions on the product.Fig. 9(a) shows that CO 2 can be photoreduced to CH 4 by using all the prepared samples as photocatalysts.It is obvious that the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibit much higher activity than pure TiO 2 nanosheets and Si nanospheres.The higher conversion is attributed to the improved photogenerated carriers separation efficiency of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme system.To further investigate whether CH 4 is a product of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, we carried out a series comparative experiments to investigate the source of C and H in the produced CH 4 under Xe arc lamp irradiation.As shown in Fig. 9(b), the CH 4 detected in normal conditions is much higher than that in other experiments.It should be noted that the extremely low CH 4 concentrations in non-normal conditions are from the naturally occurring CH 4 in air (1-2 ppm).In other words, CH 4 can be produced only in the case of possessing all the conditions including catalyst, CO 2 , H 2 O and light.It can be inferred from the contrast experiment that C in the photoreduction product CH 4 is from CO 2 , while H is from H 2 O. Therefore, it can be conrmed that the detected CH 4 is from the photoreduction of CO 2 , but not a product of organic oxidation at the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme or release of surface bound organics. Because the photocatalytic process is surface orientated, the specic surface areas of the prepared TiO 2 nanosheets and Si/ TiO 2 nanocomposites were also measured by BET to study the actual exposed surface area in the photocatalytic reaction.As shown in Fig. 10, the Si/TiO 2 sample possesses a slightly higher specic surface area (165.4 m 2 g A1 ) than TiO 2 nanosheets (154.3 m 2 g A1 ) due to the surface structuring effect by the formation of spherical heterostructures with TiO 2 nanosheets well dispersed.In the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments, our results show that only the Si/TiO 2 sample is capable of producing methanol under laser irradiation due to thermodynamics, indicating that the exposed surface area of the catalyst has no effect on its photocatalytic reduction activity.In the photocatalytic degradation experiment, 0.1 g of the asprepared Si, TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 catalysts was adopted, respectively.The slight difference of the catalysts in specic surface area is as small as 6.6, which is suggested to not be the main reason for the great improvement of photodegradation efficiency (more than twice).Hence, it can be concluded that the excellent performance of the Si/TiO 2 catalyst does not result from a surface structuring effect, but from the improved photogenerated carriers' concentration and separation efficiency from the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system construction. Fig. 11 illustrates the schematic charge ow in the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system under illumination.355 nm lasers can be harvested by both Si and TiO 2 to generate e A -h pairs.As reported in Yang's previous research, 32 the photogenerated hole in TiO 2 (TiO 2 h ) moves toward the TiO 2 /electrolyte interface and oxidizes OH A to oxygen, while photogenerated electrons in the TiO 2 (TiO 2 e A ) move away from the interface between TiO 2 and the electrolyte due to the schottky barrier.The potential barrier at the Si/TiO 2 interface reects holes back into the TiO 2 layers.To complete the circuit, the photogenerated electrons in Si ( Si e A ) move to the surface where the CO 2 reduction reaction takes place.The photogenerated hole in Si ( Si h ) moves towards the Si/TiO 2 interface and recombines with the TiO 2 e A .Therefore, the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres show high activity towards CO 2 reduction into methanol since its band alignment at the junction helps reduce recombination under illumination.However, for individual Si photocatalysts, its VB potential (0.721 V vs. NHE) is not high enough to achieve the oxidation reaction potential (O 2 /H 2 O 0.82 V vs. NHE).Similarly, the CB potential of TiO 2 (A0.29 V vs. NHE) is too low to initiate the CO 2 reduction reaction into methanol (CH 3 OH/CO 2 A0.38 V vs. NHE).In other words, the individual Si nanospheres or TiO 2 nanosheets lack suitable VB or CB potential to photoreduce CO 2 into methanol."}, {"llm generation": "Si, TiO2 and Si/TiO2 catalysts", "source": "In the photocatalytic degradation experiment, 0.1 g of the asprepared Si, TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 catalysts was adopted, respectively.", "context": "As depicted in Fig. 2(a), the SiO 2 nanospheres prepared via the Stober method are monodisperse and uniform with a smooth surface and an average diameter of about 300 nm.Aer the magnesiothermic reduction process, Si nanospheres were obtained with a porous structure and rough surface, resulting from the loss of O atoms from SiO 2 nanospheres captured by Mg under high temperature.The diameter of Si nanospheres remained mainly unchanged (as shown in Fig. 2(b)).The SEM images of the contrast TiO 2 samples prepared by a hydrothermal method without adding Si nanospheres are depicted in Fig. 2(c In order to obtain further information on the structure of the samples, TEM observation of the TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres was carried out.It can be clearly noticed from Fig. 3(a) that the as-prepared TiO 2 samples are composed of a large quantity of square nanosheets with an average edge length of about 100 nm and a thickness of about 10 nm, which is in good agreement with the result obtained from the SEM images.The TEM image of Si/TiO 2 direct Zscheme nanocomposites in Fig. 3(b) clearly shows that the Si nanospheres were coated by TiO 2 nanosheets.Moreover, it can be observed that the Si nanospheres appear with a porous morphology resulting from the O element captured by Mg in the magnesiothermic reduction process.The magnied TEM image of the nanostructure of the Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites in Fig. 3(c) presents the TiO 2 nanosheets aggregation morphology on the Si porous nanospheres, revealing the formation of the Si/TiO 2 Zscheme system.The high-magnication TEM in Fig. 3(d Fig. 4(a) shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres.It can be noticed from the spectra that the as-prepared TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibit similar absorption behaviour in the ultraviolet region.However, Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme nanospheres show an enhanced absorbance throughout the visible light region due to the existence of Si which is a visible light responsive material with a band gap of 1.12 eV.The improved visible light absorption explains the enhanced photocatalytic properties of the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres, as described later.

Fig. 6(a) depicts the GC peaks of products for samples from CO 2 photoreduction, which are taken in 30 min intervals of irradiation with 355 nm laser by using Si/TiO 2 as the photocatalyst.It can be seen clearly that all the GC peaks in Fig. 6(a) appear at exactly 2.46 min of the retention time and no other GC peaks were detected, which suggests that the methanol is the only product obtained through the laser induced photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , possibly because of the sharp line width of the laser beam centred around 355 nm (highly monochromatic) of the pulsed laser radiation.Furthermore, it was shown that the GC peak areas of methanol from CO 2 photoreduction increase with the irradiation time (30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min) and reach the maximum in 150 min of irradiation aer which they start to fall.Fig. 6(b) shows the concentration variation of the photocatalytic process of converting CO 2 into methanol with laser irradiation.It can be observed that the produced methanol concentration increases with laser irradiation time and reaches its maximum (197 mM/100 mL) at 150 min, but aerwards it declines.The decrease of the methanol concentration may be caused by the existence of photocatalytic oxidation effect of Si/TiO 2 composed semiconductor with positive VB position.When the methanol was produced in a substantial amount, it will be adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalysts and oxidized to inorganic matter, which is in agreement with the results obtained by, and explanation of, other groups. 37,40,41n order to estimate the efficiency of CO 2 conversion into methanol using direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres as the photocatalyst with 355 nm laser irradiation, the process of the CO 2 conversion efficiency was estimated.The amount of CO 2 dissolved in distilled water under our experimental conditions can be calculated from Henry's law and the amount of CO 2 dissolved in 1 L water at atmospheric pressure is 34 mmol (Henry constant).As the pressure in the photocatalytic measurement is 50 psi (3.4 atm), the total CO 2 dissolved in 100 mL of water is 11.56 mmol.Once we know the methanol concentration at different irradiation times of the photocatalytic process, the CO 2 conversion efficiency can be calculated from the quotient of actual concentrations of methanol and CO 2 concentration (as shown in Fig. 6(b)).For that the maximum concentration of methanol is 197 mM/100 mL aer 150 minutes of laser irradiation, the maximum CO 2 conversion efficiency is calculated (197/11 560) to be about 1.71.However, according to Schuler's experimental result, 42 the CO 2 solubility in binary mixtures of water and methanol increases with increasing methanol content, resulting in the actual CO 2 conversion efficiency being slightly lower than the calculated efficiency (1.71). Moreover, we can calculate the photonic efficiency of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 from the number of methanol molecules produced for certain irradiation time and the number of consumed photons in the reaction.The number of methanol molecules can be estimated from the molar concentrations and Avogadro's number.In the case of laser, the number of photons at 355 nm wavelength with the laser pulse energy of 40 mJ per pulse and repetition rate of 10 Hz can be calculated to be 4.286 A 10 19 photons per min.The maximum rate of methanol is 1.294 A 10 18 molecules per min at the irradiation time interval from 60 min to 90 min.As a single methanol molecule needs 6 photogenerated electrons, the maximum photonic efficiency (P.E.) of photoreduction of CO 2 can be calculated (6 A 1.294 A 10 18 /4.286A 10 19 ) to be about 18.1.The achievement of high photonic efficiency of direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres may be due to the construction nature of Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system. As shown in Fig. 7, photoluminescence spectroscopy was employed for further investigation of the photocatalytic activities of TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres.Two major components of the spectrum of direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres consisted of a strong peak at 540 nm and a weak, broad peak from 400 to 520 nm, which are attributed to Si and TiO 2 , respectively.Moreover, it can be seen clearly that the peak intensities in photoluminescence intensity of Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme nanospheres are much lower in contrast to that of Si nanospheres and TiO 2 nanosheets.As the PL emission resulted from the recombination of photo-induced charge carriers and information regarding the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, and their recombination kinetics can be drawn from the PL spectra, 43 it can be inferred that direct Z-scheme Si/ TiO 2 nanospheres have a higher efficient separation rate of photogenerated charge carriers than that of TiO 2 nanosheets, which can be attributed to the formation of the Si/TiO 2 direct Zscheme system. In order to conrm the effect of the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system on improving the charge separation efficiency, RhB was selected to be the target pollutant for degradation by Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres under 300 W Xe arc lamp irradiation with an illumination intensity of 400 mW cm A2 .As shown in Fig. 8(a), it can be clearly seen that RhB molecules were completely decomposed by Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme nanospheres aer 1 h Xe arc lamp irradiation, while only 88.5 were decomposed by TiO 2 nanosheets and 6.6 by Si nanospheres, indicating the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme compared with the TiO 2 nanosheets and Si nanospheres.Fig. 8(b) depicts the kinetic study of photocatalytic degradation of RhB solution over the three photocatalytic materials.The linear relationship of ln(C 0 /C) vs. irradiation time suggests that degradation of RhB is a rst order reaction.The calculated rate constants for Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and Si/TiO 2 Zscheme nanospheres are 0.000772, 0.0354 and 0.074 min A1 , respectively, from which it can be seen that the Si/TiO 2 Zscheme has the best photocatalytic activity, which is 2.09 times that of the TiO 2 nanosheets and 95.8 times the Si nanospheres.Therefore, construction of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme is benecial to improve the photocatalytic activity of Si and TiO 2 extensively. Furthermore, the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under Xe arc lamp irradiation was carried out to investigate the inuence of light source and experimental conditions on the product.Fig. 9(a) shows that CO 2 can be photoreduced to CH 4 by using all the prepared samples as photocatalysts.It is obvious that the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibit much higher activity than pure TiO 2 nanosheets and Si nanospheres.The higher conversion is attributed to the improved photogenerated carriers separation efficiency of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme system.To further investigate whether CH 4 is a product of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, we carried out a series comparative experiments to investigate the source of C and H in the produced CH 4 under Xe arc lamp irradiation.As shown in Fig. 9(b), the CH 4 detected in normal conditions is much higher than that in other experiments.It should be noted that the extremely low CH 4 concentrations in non-normal conditions are from the naturally occurring CH 4 in air (1-2 ppm).In other words, CH 4 can be produced only in the case of possessing all the conditions including catalyst, CO 2 , H 2 O and light.It can be inferred from the contrast experiment that C in the photoreduction product CH 4 is from CO 2 , while H is from H 2 O. Therefore, it can be conrmed that the detected CH 4 is from the photoreduction of CO 2 , but not a product of organic oxidation at the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme or release of surface bound organics. Because the photocatalytic process is surface orientated, the specic surface areas of the prepared TiO 2 nanosheets and Si/ TiO 2 nanocomposites were also measured by BET to study the actual exposed surface area in the photocatalytic reaction.As shown in Fig. 10, the Si/TiO 2 sample possesses a slightly higher specic surface area (165.4 m 2 g A1 ) than TiO 2 nanosheets (154.3 m 2 g A1 ) due to the surface structuring effect by the formation of spherical heterostructures with TiO 2 nanosheets well dispersed.In the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments, our results show that only the Si/TiO 2 sample is capable of producing methanol under laser irradiation due to thermodynamics, indicating that the exposed surface area of the catalyst has no effect on its photocatalytic reduction activity.In the photocatalytic degradation experiment, 0.1 g of the asprepared Si, TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 catalysts was adopted, respectively.The slight difference of the catalysts in specic surface area is as small as 6.6, which is suggested to not be the main reason for the great improvement of photodegradation efficiency (more than twice).Hence, it can be concluded that the excellent performance of the Si/TiO 2 catalyst does not result from a surface structuring effect, but from the improved photogenerated carriers' concentration and separation efficiency from the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system construction. Fig. 11 illustrates the schematic charge ow in the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system under illumination.355 nm lasers can be harvested by both Si and TiO 2 to generate e A -h pairs.As reported in Yang's previous research, 32 the photogenerated hole in TiO 2 (TiO 2 h ) moves toward the TiO 2 /electrolyte interface and oxidizes OH A to oxygen, while photogenerated electrons in the TiO 2 (TiO 2 e A ) move away from the interface between TiO 2 and the electrolyte due to the schottky barrier.The potential barrier at the Si/TiO 2 interface reects holes back into the TiO 2 layers.To complete the circuit, the photogenerated electrons in Si ( Si e A ) move to the surface where the CO 2 reduction reaction takes place.The photogenerated hole in Si ( Si h ) moves towards the Si/TiO 2 interface and recombines with the TiO 2 e A .Therefore, the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres show high activity towards CO 2 reduction into methanol since its band alignment at the junction helps reduce recombination under illumination.However, for individual Si photocatalysts, its VB potential (0.721 V vs. NHE) is not high enough to achieve the oxidation reaction potential (O 2 /H 2 O 0.82 V vs. NHE).Similarly, the CB potential of TiO 2 (A0.29 V vs. NHE) is too low to initiate the CO 2 reduction reaction into methanol (CH 3 OH/CO 2 A0.38 V vs. NHE).In other words, the individual Si nanospheres or TiO 2 nanosheets lack suitable VB or CB potential to photoreduce CO 2 into methanol."}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [{"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The Si/TiO 2 nanospheres were composed of porous Si nanospheres with a diameter of 300 nm and TiO 2 nanosheets with a diameter of 50 nm and thickness of 10 nm, and demonstrated superior visible light harvesting ability to either Si nanospheres or TiO 2 nanosheets.", "context": "In the present study, direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 photocatalyst was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction using tetrabutyl titanate and Si powder prepared from magnesiothermic reduction of SiO 2 nanospheres.The Si/TiO 2 nanospheres were composed of porous Si nanospheres with a diameter of 300 nm and TiO 2 nanosheets with a diameter of 50 nm and thickness of 10 nm, and demonstrated superior visible light harvesting ability to either Si nanospheres or TiO 2 nanosheets.CO 2 photocatalytic reduction proved that Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibit high activity in conversion of CO 2 to methanol with the maximum photonic efficiency of 18.1, while pure Si and TiO 2 catalyst are almost inactive, which can be ascribed to the integrated suitable band composition in the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme system for CO 2 reduction.The enhanced photocatalytic property of Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres was ascribed to the formation of Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme system, which improved the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers, prolonged their longevity, and therefore boosted their photocatalytic activity."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon arc lamp", "source": "A 300 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the light source.", "context": "The monodisperse silica spheres were prepared by hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) in a mixture of water, ammonia, and ethanol.In a typical synthesis process, 9 mL 28 wt ammonia water was mixed with 16.25 mL ethanol and 24.75 mL deionized water under a stirring condition (solution A). 4.5 mL TEOS was added to 45.5 mL ethanol under stirring (solution B).Here, we added B to A drop by drop and strewed for another 2 h at room temperature.SiO 2 nanospheres were centrifuged from the mixture, alternately washed with deionized water and ethanol 3 times and then dried at 100 C for 12 h. 0.5 g SiO 2 nanospheres and 0.42 g Mg powder were ground for 5 minutes and then transferred into a crucible to calcine at 750 C for 5 h under N 2 atmosphere.Aer cooling to room temperature, the powder was then added to 50 mL 32 wt HCl solution with stirring for 24 h.Si nanospheres were then cleaned several times by centrifugation and water dispersion and nally dried into powders at 60 C in a vacuum oven for 12 h.

The photocatalytic reaction cell and its setup have been described in our earlier publication. 37The photocatalytic reactor is a cylindrical stainless steel cell with quartz windows on the top to enable the transmission of 355 nm pulse laser radiations.At the bottom of the cell there is a gas inlet with a needle valve which lets the CO 2 gas pass through the distilled water in the cell and there is an outlet xed with the rubber septum in order to dispense the sample through the syringe almost at the same level at the opposite side.The whole cell is kept on a magnetic stirrer that constantly replenishes the photocatalyst in the path of laser radiations.Care has to be taken not to let the water level go much higher than the level of the catalyst platform in order to have better interaction of radiation with the photocatalyst.Since the quantity of sample taken for gas chromatographic analysis at each time was around 4.0 mL, the water level did not decrease due to sample withdrawing from the reaction cell.The reaction cell was cleaned, dried, then was tightly closed and checked for leaks up to 50 psi pressure aer 1.0 g catalyst was loaded along with 100 mL distilled water.High purity CO 2 gas (99.99) was introduced through reactor inlets and the reactor pressure was maintained at 50 psi.Prior to turning on the pulsed laser, CO 2 gas was purged into 100 mL water containing 1.0 g of catalyst for 30 min in order to saturate the contents of the reactor with CO 2 .Aer a predetermined irradiation time, water samples were withdrawn from the reactor using a syringe without opening the reactor and subjected to GC analysis. The laser (wavelength 14 355 nm) used for this study was the third harmonic of the pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Model Spectra Physics GCR 250-10) operated at 10 Hz and the pulse width of 8 ns.Throughout this study, a laser pulse energy of 40 mJ was used.The laser beam was routed with high power UV reecting mirrors/dichroic mirrors so that the beam enters from the top of the cell and an appropriate lens was also used to slightly expand the beam to the same diameter of the catalyst platform.Although the laser pulse energy was quite stable it was monitored throughout the experiment with the 50-50 beam splitter and the laser energy meter supplied by Coherent USA. The water samples were analyzed for methanol and other hydrocarbons using a gas chromatograph equipped with ame ionization detector (FID).The separation was carried out on Rtx-Wax column (dimensions: 30 m A 0.32 mm A 0.32 mm) obtained from Restek, using temperature programmed conditions.For the analysis of end products, 4.0 mL of the laser irradiated sample was injected into the gas chromatograph and the operating conditions were as follows: oven temperature was set at 40 C and was then increased to 90 C at 5 C min A1 heating rate and increased to 180 C at the rate of 50 C min A1 to elute all the components from the column before injecting another sample.The injector and detectors were both set at 200 C and helium was used as the carrier gas.The total analysis run time was 11.8 min.A calibration plot was established for methanol standard solution in distilled water for calculating the amount of methanol produced as a function of irradiation time. In a typical process, 0.1 g of the sample was uniformly dispersed on the glass reactor (4.2 cm 2 ).A 300 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the light source.The reaction system (230 mL in volume) was vacuum-treated several times, and then the high purity of CO 2 gas was followed into the reaction setup to reach ambient pressure.0.4 mL of deionized water was injected into the reaction system as reducer.The as-prepared photocatalysts were allowed to equilibrate in the CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere for several hours to ensure that the adsorption of gas molecules was complete.During the irradiation, about 1 mL of gas was continually taken from the reaction cell at given time intervals for subsequent CH 4 concentration analysis by using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu Corp., Japan).All samples were treated at 300 C in nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h for removal of organic adsorbates before the photocatalysis reaction. The photocatalytic activity was measured as follows: 0.100 g of asprepared TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 samples were added to a 250 mL Pyrex glass vessel which contained 200 mL RhB solution (7.5 mg L A1 ).The light source was a 300 W Xe arc lamp (CHF-XM500W, Beijing TrustTech Co. Ltd.) with an illumination intensity of 400 mW cm A2 .Prior to irradiation, RhB solution suspended with photocatalysts was stirred in the dark for 30 min to ensure that the surface of photocatalysts reaches the adsorption-desorption equilibrium.3 mL of the suspension was withdrawn throughout the experiment aer every 10 min.The samples were analyzed by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer aer removing the catalyst powders by centrifugation.215) and (303) planes of TiO 2 (JCPDS Card 21-1272), respectively.From the diffraction peaks in the XRD curve of direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres marked in blue, which contain both the Si and TiO 2 diffraction peaks, it can be seen obviously that the Si/TiO 2 product obtained via a hydrothermal method is composed of Si and TiO 2 .The diffraction peaks of Si in the XRD curve of direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres are very low, which may result from its low content."}, {"llm generation": "300 W Xe arc lamp", "source": "In order to conrm the effect of the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system on improving the charge separation efficiency, RhB was selected to be the target pollutant for degradation by Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres under 300 W Xe arc lamp irradiation with an illumination intensity of 400 mW cm A2 .", "context": "As depicted in Fig. 2(a), the SiO 2 nanospheres prepared via the Stober method are monodisperse and uniform with a smooth surface and an average diameter of about 300 nm.Aer the magnesiothermic reduction process, Si nanospheres were obtained with a porous structure and rough surface, resulting from the loss of O atoms from SiO 2 nanospheres captured by Mg under high temperature.The diameter of Si nanospheres remained mainly unchanged (as shown in Fig. 2(b)).The SEM images of the contrast TiO 2 samples prepared by a hydrothermal method without adding Si nanospheres are depicted in Fig. 2(c In order to obtain further information on the structure of the samples, TEM observation of the TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres was carried out.It can be clearly noticed from Fig. 3(a) that the as-prepared TiO 2 samples are composed of a large quantity of square nanosheets with an average edge length of about 100 nm and a thickness of about 10 nm, which is in good agreement with the result obtained from the SEM images.The TEM image of Si/TiO 2 direct Zscheme nanocomposites in Fig. 3(b) clearly shows that the Si nanospheres were coated by TiO 2 nanosheets.Moreover, it can be observed that the Si nanospheres appear with a porous morphology resulting from the O element captured by Mg in the magnesiothermic reduction process.The magnied TEM image of the nanostructure of the Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites in Fig. 3(c) presents the TiO 2 nanosheets aggregation morphology on the Si porous nanospheres, revealing the formation of the Si/TiO 2 Zscheme system.The high-magnication TEM in Fig. 3(d Fig. 4(a) shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres.It can be noticed from the spectra that the as-prepared TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibit similar absorption behaviour in the ultraviolet region.However, Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme nanospheres show an enhanced absorbance throughout the visible light region due to the existence of Si which is a visible light responsive material with a band gap of 1.12 eV.The improved visible light absorption explains the enhanced photocatalytic properties of the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres, as described later. To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres, the conversion of CO 2 into hydrocarbon fuels in distilled water was investigated using a high power pulsed laser as light source at 355 nm wavelength.As we know, a number of reaction products (such as HCHO, CH 3 OH, HCOOH, CO, CH 4 , etc.) can be obtained during the CO 2 photoreduction process.The following reactions may be the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction into value added hydrocarbons. In this study, we were selective to obtain CH 3 OH as the main product of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction over Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites.Our comparative tests demonstrated that nearly no product was found by using Si nanospheres or TiO 2 nanosheets as photocatalysts.This may be due to the low conductive band potential of TiO 2 and low valance band potential of Si, respectively.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of Si and TiO 2 semiconductors were calculated by the equation as follows 38 and are presented in Table 1. where X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor; E C is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV); and E g is the band gap of the semiconductor. It can be inferred from the table that, although the calculated VB band edge electrochemical potential of TiO 2 (2.91 V vs. NHE) is high enough to initiate the reaction of H 2 O and h to form O 2 and H (0.82 V vs. NHE), the calculated CB band edge electrochemical potential (A0.29 V vs. NHE) is lower than the reaction potential needed for CO 2 transformation to CH 3 OH with H and photogenerated e A (A0.38 V vs. NHE), resulting in the thermodynamic impossibility of CO 2 photoreduction into CH 3 OH over TiO 2 catalyst under 355 nm laser irradiation.In the same way, pure Si catalyst has an appropriate CB band edge electrochemical potential to reduce CO 2 into CH 3 OH with H and e A , but its low VB band edge electrochemical potential (0.72 V vs. NHE) cannot transform any H from the reaction of H 2 O oxidation, which enables the photoreduction of CO 2 into CH 3 OH. Gas chromatography (GC) was employed to verify and quantify the methanol products from the CO 2 reduction over direct Z-scheme nanospheres.It is depicted in Fig. 5(a) that the retention time for methanol standard is 2.46 min for the selected GC parameters and the used column.The relationship between GC peak area and methanol concentration was conrmed by using known methanol concentrations in a standard sample for calibration as depicted in Fig. 5(b), which exhibits a linear trend. Fig. 6(a) depicts the GC peaks of products for samples from CO 2 photoreduction, which are taken in 30 min intervals of irradiation with 355 nm laser by using Si/TiO 2 as the photocatalyst.It can be seen clearly that all the GC peaks in Fig. 6(a) appear at exactly 2.46 min of the retention time and no other GC peaks were detected, which suggests that the methanol is the only product obtained through the laser induced photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , possibly because of the sharp line width of the laser beam centred around 355 nm (highly monochromatic) of the pulsed laser radiation.Furthermore, it was shown that the GC peak areas of methanol from CO 2 photoreduction increase with the irradiation time (30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min) and reach the maximum in 150 min of irradiation aer which they start to fall.Fig. 6(b) shows the concentration variation of the photocatalytic process of converting CO 2 into methanol with laser irradiation.It can be observed that the produced methanol concentration increases with laser irradiation time and reaches its maximum (197 mM/100 mL) at 150 min, but aerwards it declines.The decrease of the methanol concentration may be caused by the existence of photocatalytic oxidation effect of Si/TiO 2 composed semiconductor with positive VB position.When the methanol was produced in a substantial amount, it will be adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalysts and oxidized to inorganic matter, which is in agreement with the results obtained by, and explanation of, other groups. 37,40,41n order to estimate the efficiency of CO 2 conversion into methanol using direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres as the photocatalyst with 355 nm laser irradiation, the process of the CO 2 conversion efficiency was estimated.The amount of CO 2 dissolved in distilled water under our experimental conditions can be calculated from Henry's law and the amount of CO 2 dissolved in 1 L water at atmospheric pressure is 34 mmol (Henry constant).As the pressure in the photocatalytic measurement is 50 psi (3.4 atm), the total CO 2 dissolved in 100 mL of water is 11.56 mmol.Once we know the methanol concentration at different irradiation times of the photocatalytic process, the CO 2 conversion efficiency can be calculated from the quotient of actual concentrations of methanol and CO 2 concentration (as shown in Fig. 6(b)).For that the maximum concentration of methanol is 197 mM/100 mL aer 150 minutes of laser irradiation, the maximum CO 2 conversion efficiency is calculated (197/11 560) to be about 1.71.However, according to Schuler's experimental result, 42 the CO 2 solubility in binary mixtures of water and methanol increases with increasing methanol content, resulting in the actual CO 2 conversion efficiency being slightly lower than the calculated efficiency (1.71). Moreover, we can calculate the photonic efficiency of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 from the number of methanol molecules produced for certain irradiation time and the number of consumed photons in the reaction.The number of methanol molecules can be estimated from the molar concentrations and Avogadro's number.In the case of laser, the number of photons at 355 nm wavelength with the laser pulse energy of 40 mJ per pulse and repetition rate of 10 Hz can be calculated to be 4.286 A 10 19 photons per min.The maximum rate of methanol is 1.294 A 10 18 molecules per min at the irradiation time interval from 60 min to 90 min.As a single methanol molecule needs 6 photogenerated electrons, the maximum photonic efficiency (P.E.) of photoreduction of CO 2 can be calculated (6 A 1.294 A 10 18 /4.286A 10 19 ) to be about 18.1.The achievement of high photonic efficiency of direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres may be due to the construction nature of Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system. As shown in Fig. 7, photoluminescence spectroscopy was employed for further investigation of the photocatalytic activities of TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres.Two major components of the spectrum of direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres consisted of a strong peak at 540 nm and a weak, broad peak from 400 to 520 nm, which are attributed to Si and TiO 2 , respectively.Moreover, it can be seen clearly that the peak intensities in photoluminescence intensity of Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme nanospheres are much lower in contrast to that of Si nanospheres and TiO 2 nanosheets.As the PL emission resulted from the recombination of photo-induced charge carriers and information regarding the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, and their recombination kinetics can be drawn from the PL spectra, 43 it can be inferred that direct Z-scheme Si/ TiO 2 nanospheres have a higher efficient separation rate of photogenerated charge carriers than that of TiO 2 nanosheets, which can be attributed to the formation of the Si/TiO 2 direct Zscheme system. In order to conrm the effect of the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system on improving the charge separation efficiency, RhB was selected to be the target pollutant for degradation by Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres under 300 W Xe arc lamp irradiation with an illumination intensity of 400 mW cm A2 .As shown in Fig. 8(a), it can be clearly seen that RhB molecules were completely decomposed by Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme nanospheres aer 1 h Xe arc lamp irradiation, while only 88.5 were decomposed by TiO 2 nanosheets and 6.6 by Si nanospheres, indicating the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme compared with the TiO 2 nanosheets and Si nanospheres.Fig. 8(b) depicts the kinetic study of photocatalytic degradation of RhB solution over the three photocatalytic materials.The linear relationship of ln(C 0 /C) vs. irradiation time suggests that degradation of RhB is a rst order reaction.The calculated rate constants for Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and Si/TiO 2 Zscheme nanospheres are 0.000772, 0.0354 and 0.074 min A1 , respectively, from which it can be seen that the Si/TiO 2 Zscheme has the best photocatalytic activity, which is 2.09 times that of the TiO 2 nanosheets and 95.8 times the Si nanospheres.Therefore, construction of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme is benecial to improve the photocatalytic activity of Si and TiO 2 extensively. Furthermore, the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under Xe arc lamp irradiation was carried out to investigate the inuence of light source and experimental conditions on the product.Fig. 9(a) shows that CO 2 can be photoreduced to CH 4 by using all the prepared samples as photocatalysts.It is obvious that the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibit much higher activity than pure TiO 2 nanosheets and Si nanospheres.The higher conversion is attributed to the improved photogenerated carriers separation efficiency of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme system.To further investigate whether CH 4 is a product of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, we carried out a series comparative experiments to investigate the source of C and H in the produced CH 4 under Xe arc lamp irradiation.As shown in Fig. 9(b), the CH 4 detected in normal conditions is much higher than that in other experiments.It should be noted that the extremely low CH 4 concentrations in non-normal conditions are from the naturally occurring CH 4 in air (1-2 ppm).In other words, CH 4 can be produced only in the case of possessing all the conditions including catalyst, CO 2 , H 2 O and light.It can be inferred from the contrast experiment that C in the photoreduction product CH 4 is from CO 2 , while H is from H 2 O. Therefore, it can be conrmed that the detected CH 4 is from the photoreduction of CO 2 , but not a product of organic oxidation at the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme or release of surface bound organics. Because the photocatalytic process is surface orientated, the specic surface areas of the prepared TiO 2 nanosheets and Si/ TiO 2 nanocomposites were also measured by BET to study the actual exposed surface area in the photocatalytic reaction.As shown in Fig. 10, the Si/TiO 2 sample possesses a slightly higher specic surface area (165.4 m 2 g A1 ) than TiO 2 nanosheets (154.3 m 2 g A1 ) due to the surface structuring effect by the formation of spherical heterostructures with TiO 2 nanosheets well dispersed.In the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments, our results show that only the Si/TiO 2 sample is capable of producing methanol under laser irradiation due to thermodynamics, indicating that the exposed surface area of the catalyst has no effect on its photocatalytic reduction activity.In the photocatalytic degradation experiment, 0.1 g of the asprepared Si, TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 catalysts was adopted, respectively.The slight difference of the catalysts in specic surface area is as small as 6.6, which is suggested to not be the main reason for the great improvement of photodegradation efficiency (more than twice).Hence, it can be concluded that the excellent performance of the Si/TiO 2 catalyst does not result from a surface structuring effect, but from the improved photogenerated carriers' concentration and separation efficiency from the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system construction. Fig. 11 illustrates the schematic charge ow in the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system under illumination.355 nm lasers can be harvested by both Si and TiO 2 to generate e A -h pairs.As reported in Yang's previous research, 32 the photogenerated hole in TiO 2 (TiO 2 h ) moves toward the TiO 2 /electrolyte interface and oxidizes OH A to oxygen, while photogenerated electrons in the TiO 2 (TiO 2 e A ) move away from the interface between TiO 2 and the electrolyte due to the schottky barrier.The potential barrier at the Si/TiO 2 interface reects holes back into the TiO 2 layers.To complete the circuit, the photogenerated electrons in Si ( Si e A ) move to the surface where the CO 2 reduction reaction takes place.The photogenerated hole in Si ( Si h ) moves towards the Si/TiO 2 interface and recombines with the TiO 2 e A .Therefore, the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres show high activity towards CO 2 reduction into methanol since its band alignment at the junction helps reduce recombination under illumination.However, for individual Si photocatalysts, its VB potential (0.721 V vs. NHE) is not high enough to achieve the oxidation reaction potential (O 2 /H 2 O 0.82 V vs. NHE).Similarly, the CB potential of TiO 2 (A0.29 V vs. NHE) is too low to initiate the CO 2 reduction reaction into methanol (CH 3 OH/CO 2 A0.38 V vs. NHE).In other words, the individual Si nanospheres or TiO 2 nanosheets lack suitable VB or CB potential to photoreduce CO 2 into methanol."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "At the bottom of the cell there is a gas inlet with a needle valve which lets the CO 2 gas pass through the distilled water in the cell and there is an outlet xed with the rubber septum in order to dispense the sample through the syringe almost at the same level at the opposite side.", "context": "The monodisperse silica spheres were prepared by hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) in a mixture of water, ammonia, and ethanol.In a typical synthesis process, 9 mL 28 wt ammonia water was mixed with 16.25 mL ethanol and 24.75 mL deionized water under a stirring condition (solution A). 4.5 mL TEOS was added to 45.5 mL ethanol under stirring (solution B).Here, we added B to A drop by drop and strewed for another 2 h at room temperature.SiO 2 nanospheres were centrifuged from the mixture, alternately washed with deionized water and ethanol 3 times and then dried at 100 C for 12 h. 0.5 g SiO 2 nanospheres and 0.42 g Mg powder were ground for 5 minutes and then transferred into a crucible to calcine at 750 C for 5 h under N 2 atmosphere.Aer cooling to room temperature, the powder was then added to 50 mL 32 wt HCl solution with stirring for 24 h.Si nanospheres were then cleaned several times by centrifugation and water dispersion and nally dried into powders at 60 C in a vacuum oven for 12 h.

The crystal structure of all the samples was examined by means of X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE with Cu-Ka radiation, l 14 1.5418 A).The morphology and particle size were determined by eld emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JSM-2010) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-3600).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained with an Edinburgh Instrument FLS 920 spectrometer.The excitation wavelength, l ex , was 360 nm, and both the bandwidths of excitation and emission were 5 nm.The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) specic surface area of the samples were determined by a high speed automated area and pore size analyzer (ASAP 2010). The photocatalytic reaction cell and its setup have been described in our earlier publication. 37The photocatalytic reactor is a cylindrical stainless steel cell with quartz windows on the top to enable the transmission of 355 nm pulse laser radiations.At the bottom of the cell there is a gas inlet with a needle valve which lets the CO 2 gas pass through the distilled water in the cell and there is an outlet xed with the rubber septum in order to dispense the sample through the syringe almost at the same level at the opposite side.The whole cell is kept on a magnetic stirrer that constantly replenishes the photocatalyst in the path of laser radiations.Care has to be taken not to let the water level go much higher than the level of the catalyst platform in order to have better interaction of radiation with the photocatalyst.Since the quantity of sample taken for gas chromatographic analysis at each time was around 4.0 mL, the water level did not decrease due to sample withdrawing from the reaction cell.The reaction cell was cleaned, dried, then was tightly closed and checked for leaks up to 50 psi pressure aer 1.0 g catalyst was loaded along with 100 mL distilled water.High purity CO 2 gas (99.99) was introduced through reactor inlets and the reactor pressure was maintained at 50 psi.Prior to turning on the pulsed laser, CO 2 gas was purged into 100 mL water containing 1.0 g of catalyst for 30 min in order to saturate the contents of the reactor with CO 2 .Aer a predetermined irradiation time, water samples were withdrawn from the reactor using a syringe without opening the reactor and subjected to GC analysis. The laser (wavelength 14 355 nm) used for this study was the third harmonic of the pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Model Spectra Physics GCR 250-10) operated at 10 Hz and the pulse width of 8 ns.Throughout this study, a laser pulse energy of 40 mJ was used.The laser beam was routed with high power UV reecting mirrors/dichroic mirrors so that the beam enters from the top of the cell and an appropriate lens was also used to slightly expand the beam to the same diameter of the catalyst platform.Although the laser pulse energy was quite stable it was monitored throughout the experiment with the 50-50 beam splitter and the laser energy meter supplied by Coherent USA. The water samples were analyzed for methanol and other hydrocarbons using a gas chromatograph equipped with ame ionization detector (FID).The separation was carried out on Rtx-Wax column (dimensions: 30 m A 0.32 mm A 0.32 mm) obtained from Restek, using temperature programmed conditions.For the analysis of end products, 4.0 mL of the laser irradiated sample was injected into the gas chromatograph and the operating conditions were as follows: oven temperature was set at 40 C and was then increased to 90 C at 5 C min A1 heating rate and increased to 180 C at the rate of 50 C min A1 to elute all the components from the column before injecting another sample.The injector and detectors were both set at 200 C and helium was used as the carrier gas.The total analysis run time was 11.8 min.A calibration plot was established for methanol standard solution in distilled water for calculating the amount of methanol produced as a function of irradiation time. In a typical process, 0.1 g of the sample was uniformly dispersed on the glass reactor (4.2 cm 2 ).A 300 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the light source.The reaction system (230 mL in volume) was vacuum-treated several times, and then the high purity of CO 2 gas was followed into the reaction setup to reach ambient pressure.0.4 mL of deionized water was injected into the reaction system as reducer.The as-prepared photocatalysts were allowed to equilibrate in the CO 2 /H 2 O atmosphere for several hours to ensure that the adsorption of gas molecules was complete.During the irradiation, about 1 mL of gas was continually taken from the reaction cell at given time intervals for subsequent CH 4 concentration analysis by using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu Corp., Japan).All samples were treated at 300 C in nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h for removal of organic adsorbates before the photocatalysis reaction. The photocatalytic activity was measured as follows: 0.100 g of asprepared TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 samples were added to a 250 mL Pyrex glass vessel which contained 200 mL RhB solution (7.5 mg L A1 ).The light source was a 300 W Xe arc lamp (CHF-XM500W, Beijing TrustTech Co. Ltd.) with an illumination intensity of 400 mW cm A2 .Prior to irradiation, RhB solution suspended with photocatalysts was stirred in the dark for 30 min to ensure that the surface of photocatalysts reaches the adsorption-desorption equilibrium.3 mL of the suspension was withdrawn throughout the experiment aer every 10 min.The samples were analyzed by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer aer removing the catalyst powders by centrifugation.215) and (303) planes of TiO 2 (JCPDS Card 21-1272), respectively.From the diffraction peaks in the XRD curve of direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres marked in blue, which contain both the Si and TiO 2 diffraction peaks, it can be seen obviously that the Si/TiO 2 product obtained via a hydrothermal method is composed of Si and TiO 2 .The diffraction peaks of Si in the XRD curve of direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres are very low, which may result from its low content."}, {"llm generation": "distilled water", "source": "To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres, the conversion of CO 2 into hydrocarbon fuels in distilled water was investigated using a high power pulsed laser as light source at 355 nm wavelength.", "context": "As depicted in Fig. 2(a), the SiO 2 nanospheres prepared via the Stober method are monodisperse and uniform with a smooth surface and an average diameter of about 300 nm.Aer the magnesiothermic reduction process, Si nanospheres were obtained with a porous structure and rough surface, resulting from the loss of O atoms from SiO 2 nanospheres captured by Mg under high temperature.The diameter of Si nanospheres remained mainly unchanged (as shown in Fig. 2(b)).The SEM images of the contrast TiO 2 samples prepared by a hydrothermal method without adding Si nanospheres are depicted in Fig. 2(c In order to obtain further information on the structure of the samples, TEM observation of the TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres was carried out.It can be clearly noticed from Fig. 3(a) that the as-prepared TiO 2 samples are composed of a large quantity of square nanosheets with an average edge length of about 100 nm and a thickness of about 10 nm, which is in good agreement with the result obtained from the SEM images.The TEM image of Si/TiO 2 direct Zscheme nanocomposites in Fig. 3(b) clearly shows that the Si nanospheres were coated by TiO 2 nanosheets.Moreover, it can be observed that the Si nanospheres appear with a porous morphology resulting from the O element captured by Mg in the magnesiothermic reduction process.The magnied TEM image of the nanostructure of the Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites in Fig. 3(c) presents the TiO 2 nanosheets aggregation morphology on the Si porous nanospheres, revealing the formation of the Si/TiO 2 Zscheme system.The high-magnication TEM in Fig. 3(d Fig. 4(a) shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres.It can be noticed from the spectra that the as-prepared TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibit similar absorption behaviour in the ultraviolet region.However, Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme nanospheres show an enhanced absorbance throughout the visible light region due to the existence of Si which is a visible light responsive material with a band gap of 1.12 eV.The improved visible light absorption explains the enhanced photocatalytic properties of the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres, as described later. To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres, the conversion of CO 2 into hydrocarbon fuels in distilled water was investigated using a high power pulsed laser as light source at 355 nm wavelength.As we know, a number of reaction products (such as HCHO, CH 3 OH, HCOOH, CO, CH 4 , etc.) can be obtained during the CO 2 photoreduction process.The following reactions may be the pathways of CO 2 photoreduction into value added hydrocarbons. In this study, we were selective to obtain CH 3 OH as the main product of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction over Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites.Our comparative tests demonstrated that nearly no product was found by using Si nanospheres or TiO 2 nanosheets as photocatalysts.This may be due to the low conductive band potential of TiO 2 and low valance band potential of Si, respectively.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of Si and TiO 2 semiconductors were calculated by the equation as follows 38 and are presented in Table 1. where X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor; E C is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV); and E g is the band gap of the semiconductor. It can be inferred from the table that, although the calculated VB band edge electrochemical potential of TiO 2 (2.91 V vs. NHE) is high enough to initiate the reaction of H 2 O and h to form O 2 and H (0.82 V vs. NHE), the calculated CB band edge electrochemical potential (A0.29 V vs. NHE) is lower than the reaction potential needed for CO 2 transformation to CH 3 OH with H and photogenerated e A (A0.38 V vs. NHE), resulting in the thermodynamic impossibility of CO 2 photoreduction into CH 3 OH over TiO 2 catalyst under 355 nm laser irradiation.In the same way, pure Si catalyst has an appropriate CB band edge electrochemical potential to reduce CO 2 into CH 3 OH with H and e A , but its low VB band edge electrochemical potential (0.72 V vs. NHE) cannot transform any H from the reaction of H 2 O oxidation, which enables the photoreduction of CO 2 into CH 3 OH. Gas chromatography (GC) was employed to verify and quantify the methanol products from the CO 2 reduction over direct Z-scheme nanospheres.It is depicted in Fig. 5(a) that the retention time for methanol standard is 2.46 min for the selected GC parameters and the used column.The relationship between GC peak area and methanol concentration was conrmed by using known methanol concentrations in a standard sample for calibration as depicted in Fig. 5(b), which exhibits a linear trend. Fig. 6(a) depicts the GC peaks of products for samples from CO 2 photoreduction, which are taken in 30 min intervals of irradiation with 355 nm laser by using Si/TiO 2 as the photocatalyst.It can be seen clearly that all the GC peaks in Fig. 6(a) appear at exactly 2.46 min of the retention time and no other GC peaks were detected, which suggests that the methanol is the only product obtained through the laser induced photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , possibly because of the sharp line width of the laser beam centred around 355 nm (highly monochromatic) of the pulsed laser radiation.Furthermore, it was shown that the GC peak areas of methanol from CO 2 photoreduction increase with the irradiation time (30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min) and reach the maximum in 150 min of irradiation aer which they start to fall.Fig. 6(b) shows the concentration variation of the photocatalytic process of converting CO 2 into methanol with laser irradiation.It can be observed that the produced methanol concentration increases with laser irradiation time and reaches its maximum (197 mM/100 mL) at 150 min, but aerwards it declines.The decrease of the methanol concentration may be caused by the existence of photocatalytic oxidation effect of Si/TiO 2 composed semiconductor with positive VB position.When the methanol was produced in a substantial amount, it will be adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalysts and oxidized to inorganic matter, which is in agreement with the results obtained by, and explanation of, other groups. 37,40,41n order to estimate the efficiency of CO 2 conversion into methanol using direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres as the photocatalyst with 355 nm laser irradiation, the process of the CO 2 conversion efficiency was estimated.The amount of CO 2 dissolved in distilled water under our experimental conditions can be calculated from Henry's law and the amount of CO 2 dissolved in 1 L water at atmospheric pressure is 34 mmol (Henry constant).As the pressure in the photocatalytic measurement is 50 psi (3.4 atm), the total CO 2 dissolved in 100 mL of water is 11.56 mmol.Once we know the methanol concentration at different irradiation times of the photocatalytic process, the CO 2 conversion efficiency can be calculated from the quotient of actual concentrations of methanol and CO 2 concentration (as shown in Fig. 6(b)).For that the maximum concentration of methanol is 197 mM/100 mL aer 150 minutes of laser irradiation, the maximum CO 2 conversion efficiency is calculated (197/11 560) to be about 1.71.However, according to Schuler's experimental result, 42 the CO 2 solubility in binary mixtures of water and methanol increases with increasing methanol content, resulting in the actual CO 2 conversion efficiency being slightly lower than the calculated efficiency (1.71). Moreover, we can calculate the photonic efficiency of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 from the number of methanol molecules produced for certain irradiation time and the number of consumed photons in the reaction.The number of methanol molecules can be estimated from the molar concentrations and Avogadro's number.In the case of laser, the number of photons at 355 nm wavelength with the laser pulse energy of 40 mJ per pulse and repetition rate of 10 Hz can be calculated to be 4.286 A 10 19 photons per min.The maximum rate of methanol is 1.294 A 10 18 molecules per min at the irradiation time interval from 60 min to 90 min.As a single methanol molecule needs 6 photogenerated electrons, the maximum photonic efficiency (P.E.) of photoreduction of CO 2 can be calculated (6 A 1.294 A 10 18 /4.286A 10 19 ) to be about 18.1.The achievement of high photonic efficiency of direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres may be due to the construction nature of Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system. As shown in Fig. 7, photoluminescence spectroscopy was employed for further investigation of the photocatalytic activities of TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres.Two major components of the spectrum of direct Zscheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres consisted of a strong peak at 540 nm and a weak, broad peak from 400 to 520 nm, which are attributed to Si and TiO 2 , respectively.Moreover, it can be seen clearly that the peak intensities in photoluminescence intensity of Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme nanospheres are much lower in contrast to that of Si nanospheres and TiO 2 nanosheets.As the PL emission resulted from the recombination of photo-induced charge carriers and information regarding the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, and their recombination kinetics can be drawn from the PL spectra, 43 it can be inferred that direct Z-scheme Si/ TiO 2 nanospheres have a higher efficient separation rate of photogenerated charge carriers than that of TiO 2 nanosheets, which can be attributed to the formation of the Si/TiO 2 direct Zscheme system. In order to conrm the effect of the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system on improving the charge separation efficiency, RhB was selected to be the target pollutant for degradation by Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres under 300 W Xe arc lamp irradiation with an illumination intensity of 400 mW cm A2 .As shown in Fig. 8(a), it can be clearly seen that RhB molecules were completely decomposed by Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme nanospheres aer 1 h Xe arc lamp irradiation, while only 88.5 were decomposed by TiO 2 nanosheets and 6.6 by Si nanospheres, indicating the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme compared with the TiO 2 nanosheets and Si nanospheres.Fig. 8(b) depicts the kinetic study of photocatalytic degradation of RhB solution over the three photocatalytic materials.The linear relationship of ln(C 0 /C) vs. irradiation time suggests that degradation of RhB is a rst order reaction.The calculated rate constants for Si nanospheres, TiO 2 nanosheets and Si/TiO 2 Zscheme nanospheres are 0.000772, 0.0354 and 0.074 min A1 , respectively, from which it can be seen that the Si/TiO 2 Zscheme has the best photocatalytic activity, which is 2.09 times that of the TiO 2 nanosheets and 95.8 times the Si nanospheres.Therefore, construction of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme is benecial to improve the photocatalytic activity of Si and TiO 2 extensively. Furthermore, the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under Xe arc lamp irradiation was carried out to investigate the inuence of light source and experimental conditions on the product.Fig. 9(a) shows that CO 2 can be photoreduced to CH 4 by using all the prepared samples as photocatalysts.It is obvious that the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites exhibit much higher activity than pure TiO 2 nanosheets and Si nanospheres.The higher conversion is attributed to the improved photogenerated carriers separation efficiency of the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme system.To further investigate whether CH 4 is a product of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, we carried out a series comparative experiments to investigate the source of C and H in the produced CH 4 under Xe arc lamp irradiation.As shown in Fig. 9(b), the CH 4 detected in normal conditions is much higher than that in other experiments.It should be noted that the extremely low CH 4 concentrations in non-normal conditions are from the naturally occurring CH 4 in air (1-2 ppm).In other words, CH 4 can be produced only in the case of possessing all the conditions including catalyst, CO 2 , H 2 O and light.It can be inferred from the contrast experiment that C in the photoreduction product CH 4 is from CO 2 , while H is from H 2 O. Therefore, it can be conrmed that the detected CH 4 is from the photoreduction of CO 2 , but not a product of organic oxidation at the Si/TiO 2 Z-scheme or release of surface bound organics. Because the photocatalytic process is surface orientated, the specic surface areas of the prepared TiO 2 nanosheets and Si/ TiO 2 nanocomposites were also measured by BET to study the actual exposed surface area in the photocatalytic reaction.As shown in Fig. 10, the Si/TiO 2 sample possesses a slightly higher specic surface area (165.4 m 2 g A1 ) than TiO 2 nanosheets (154.3 m 2 g A1 ) due to the surface structuring effect by the formation of spherical heterostructures with TiO 2 nanosheets well dispersed.In the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments, our results show that only the Si/TiO 2 sample is capable of producing methanol under laser irradiation due to thermodynamics, indicating that the exposed surface area of the catalyst has no effect on its photocatalytic reduction activity.In the photocatalytic degradation experiment, 0.1 g of the asprepared Si, TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 catalysts was adopted, respectively.The slight difference of the catalysts in specic surface area is as small as 6.6, which is suggested to not be the main reason for the great improvement of photodegradation efficiency (more than twice).Hence, it can be concluded that the excellent performance of the Si/TiO 2 catalyst does not result from a surface structuring effect, but from the improved photogenerated carriers' concentration and separation efficiency from the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system construction. Fig. 11 illustrates the schematic charge ow in the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system under illumination.355 nm lasers can be harvested by both Si and TiO 2 to generate e A -h pairs.As reported in Yang's previous research, 32 the photogenerated hole in TiO 2 (TiO 2 h ) moves toward the TiO 2 /electrolyte interface and oxidizes OH A to oxygen, while photogenerated electrons in the TiO 2 (TiO 2 e A ) move away from the interface between TiO 2 and the electrolyte due to the schottky barrier.The potential barrier at the Si/TiO 2 interface reects holes back into the TiO 2 layers.To complete the circuit, the photogenerated electrons in Si ( Si e A ) move to the surface where the CO 2 reduction reaction takes place.The photogenerated hole in Si ( Si h ) moves towards the Si/TiO 2 interface and recombines with the TiO 2 e A .Therefore, the direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanospheres show high activity towards CO 2 reduction into methanol since its band alignment at the junction helps reduce recombination under illumination.However, for individual Si photocatalysts, its VB potential (0.721 V vs. NHE) is not high enough to achieve the oxidation reaction potential (O 2 /H 2 O 0.82 V vs. NHE).Similarly, the CB potential of TiO 2 (A0.29 V vs. NHE) is too low to initiate the CO 2 reduction reaction into methanol (CH 3 OH/CO 2 A0.38 V vs. NHE).In other words, the individual Si nanospheres or TiO 2 nanosheets lack suitable VB or CB potential to photoreduce CO 2 into methanol."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid (distilled water)", "source": "Fig. 6 (a) GC peaks of methanol for sample taken every 30 min of irradiation with a laser pulse energy of 40 mJ per pulse at 355 nm radiation with 600 mg catalyst in 100 mL distilled water, 50 psi CO 2 pressure.", "context": "In summary, we have presented a facile and low cost method to prepare a direct Z-scheme Si/TiO 2 nanostructure via hydrothermal reaction with tetrabutyl titanate and Si powder which was prepared from the magnesiothermic reduction of SiO 2 Stober nanospheres.All the results indicate that Si/TiO 2 nanocomposites possess much higher photocatalytic activity than individual Si and TiO 2 samples for the CO 2 conversion and degradation of RhB.This excellent performance could be attributed to the integrated suitable conductive band of Si and valence band of TiO 2 for CO 2 reduction and improved light absorption ability, enhanced concentration of photogenerated carriers, and higher separation efficiency due to the elaborate construction of the Si/TiO 2 direct Z-scheme system.
