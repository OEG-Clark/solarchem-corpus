The products were analysed and measured using a Perkin Elmer GC Auto system XL Gas Chromatograph equipped with a Flame Ionization detector (FID) and a DB-WAX Column.Helium was used as the carrier gas for GC.The initial temperature of the oven was 40 C for 5 min, ramped from 20 C to 180 C and the held-up for 5 min.The sample ran for 17 min in the GC with FID injector temperature at 250 C while maximum FID detector temperature was 350 C. The quantification of obtained products was conducted by the use of an external standard (99 purity absolute methanol, 85 purity formic acid, Merck) using a calibration curve."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2, g-C3N4, 3 Cu/TiO2, 3 Cu/g-C3N4, and g-C3N4/(3 Cu/TiO2) (30:70) composite", "source": "Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to identify the catalysts (TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3 Cu/TiO 2 , 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 and the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite) based on their characteristic bands as illustrated in Fig. 5.", "context": "Fig. 2 exhibits the XRD pattern of the pure and Cu-modified TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 as well as that of the nanocomposites.The presence of the anatase form of TiO 2 can be confirmed by the peaks at 25.1 , 37.6 , 48 , 55 , 62.6 , 68.7 and 70.3 which corresponds to planes (101), ( 004), ( 200), ( 105), ( 204), (220), and (215) typical of anatase TiO 2 .The peaks at 37.5 , 38 and 53.8 are characteristic of the rutile phase of TiO 2 .These peaks are traceable to the TiO 2 nanopowder used in the preparation of the composites and is reflected in the size of these peaks in the diffractograms of each composite ratio.For example, these peaks are smaller in ratio 90:10 (i.e. 90 wt. g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt. CuTiO 2 ) compared to 30:70 because the amount of Cu/TiO 2 doped is lesser.This is also the case for g-C 3 N 4 in the different composites as the peak becomes more significant as the wt. of g-C 3 N 4 increased in the composite.None of the peaks associated with TiO 2 could be found in the diffractograms of g-C 3 N 4 and Cu/g-C 3 N 4 .g-C 3 N 4 is known for possessing two distinctive XRD peaks usually at 13 and 27 .Graphitic carbon nitride can be identified and confirmed by the presence of these two peaks which are identified in Fig. 2. The peak at 27.3 listed at plane (002) is representative of the interlayer stacked conjugated aromatic system while the peak at 13 listed at plane (100) represents the intra-planar structural packing of the aromatic system.Presence of these two typical peaks of g-C 3 N 4 confirms its identity 8.The characteristic peaks of g-C 3 N 4 (13 and 27.3 ) can also be seen in the composites indicating it was successfully doped on the Cu/TiO 2 .In all the copper modified samples and the composites, a peak characteristic of copper can be seen at 75.2 19.This confirms the presence of copper in these copper modified samples and composites.All the peaks observed conformed to previous results obtained 15,19 and to data from JCPDS card no: 86-1156. Fig. 3 depicts the morphology of the as-prepared catalysts.From Fig. 3(a) it can be seen that g-C 3 N 4 possess a layered, flat, sheet-like structure having hollows and a lamellar structure.3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 in Fig. 3(b) demonstrates a very porous, feather-like material having several internal layers just like the g-C 3 N 4 having a lamellar structure.This disparity is possibly a consequence of effective stirring and heating from calcination during the metal impregnation of g-C 3 N 4 to 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 .3 Cu/TiO 2 displayed the typical, spherical, nanosized particle of TiO 2 as depicted in Fig. 3c.From Fig. 3d a distinct combination of theg-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 features can be observed.From the image, a mass of g-C 3 N 4 can be seen upon an agglomeration of 3 Cu/TiO 2 confirming the ratio to which the constituents of the composite were added.The image depicts a large mass of aggregated 3 CuTiO 2 with just a handful of g-C 3 N 4 on the surface.This suggests g-C 3 N 4 is located on the surface of 3 Cu/TiO 2 which means upon irradiation of light, g-C 3 N 4 attracts the photons of light more effectively since it is on the surface.It transfers this energy to the 3 Cu/TiO 2 which has the exceptional selectivity for CO 2 conversion to CH 3 OH due to the presence of copper. The micro-structure of the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite was characterized using the Transmission Electron Microscope.Fig. 4 displays the TEM images obtained for the composite catalyst.From this image, by considering Fig. 4a, a representation of the ratio of each component is visible, i.e. 30:70 for g-C 3 N 4 and Cu/TiO 2 .It is certain that the composite is a combination of both constituents in the desired ratio.The agglomerated TiO 2 crystals 20, the fibrous, lamella and mesoporous layer of g-C 3 N 4 8 can be seen from Fig. 4a.The heterojunction between the crystalline copper modified TiO 2 and amorphous g-C 3 N 4 is evident in Fig. 4b.The 0.352 nm interplanar spacing of TiO 2 and 0.361 nm spacing of crystalline copper 21 was also measured. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to identify the catalysts (TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3 Cu/TiO 2 , 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 and the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite) based on their characteristic bands as illustrated in Fig. 5.The existence of TiO 2 can be verified by considering the steep band at 550-900 cm A1 in the spectra.This band which occurs only in TiO 2 , 3 Cu/TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite is peculiar to TiO 2 .The presence of this band guarantees that one of the constituents of the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite is TiO 2 .A broad band of 3162 cm A1 exists between 3000 and 3500 cm A1 and this is characteristic of the stretching vibration of hydroxyl functional group HA AOH in TiO 2 and that of the amine or amide group from g-C 3 N 4 8,22.The following spectra bands which are often attributed to the samples containing g-C 3 N 4 are also present in Fig. 5.An absorption band at 805 cm A1 associated with the bending modes of the parent triazine structure of g-C 3 N 4 is present in all three carbon nitride containing catalysts.The NA AH stretch of the heterocyclic amines present in the g-C 3 N 4 structure are identified by the bands at 1248 cm A1 , 1326 cm A1 , 1410 cm A1 and 1571 cm A1 .The band located at 1640 cm A1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration band of the CA AN of amines in g-C 3 N 4 .These band frequencies confirm g-C 3 N 4 was indeed the synthesized catalyst and it is observed in 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite 23.The peak observed between 2300-2400 cm A1 present in TiO 2 and the nanocomposite is as a result of CO 2 in the atmosphere 24. Measurement of the specific surface area and pore size of the as-prepared catalyst samples were performed by BET analysis with nitrogen adsorption at A196.15 C and degassing at 250 C for 4 h.The adsorption-desorption isotherm of TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 and the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite are presented in Fig. 6a.The calculated specific surface area of TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 and the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite were 11.0, 10.5 and 12.3 m 2 /g, respectively.It is noticeable that the surface area of composites catalyst is much closer to that of the pure TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 samples.This reveals that surface area has no significant effect on the photoactivity of CO 2 reduction to methanol.Therefore, rapid separation of photogenerated carriers might have contributed to the improved photoactivity 25.The existence of mesopores in the catalyst sample was verified by observing the curves exhibited in Fig. 6a.The curve depicts the fourth type (H 4 ) of adsorption isotherm which typifies mesoporous structures 26.Considering the hysteresis loops, their shapes are similar to that of the type (H 3 ) which is characteristic of slit-shaped pores formed as a result of plate/panel-shaped particles as observed in the FESEM and TEM images.For pore size analysis, the BJH pore size distribution in Fig. 6b, agrees well with the isotherm in Fig. 6a 27.From the plot it is evident that the composite is mesoporous in nature and this characteristic is in good agreement with the TEM and FESEM images.The properties including the BET/BJH data of the catalysts are listed in Table 1.From Fig. 6(a), the hysteresis loop (H4 type) of TiO 2 nanoparticle, g-C 3 N 4 and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 CuTiO 2 ) composite confirms large amount of mesopores resident in the matrix.As seen from Fig. 6(b), the pore diameter distributions confirm the presence of mesopores in each sample. XPS analysis was performed to determine the chemistry of the atoms in the composite catalyst of g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 sample and exhibited in Fig. 7.All elemental constituents of the composite (C, N, Ti, O and Cu) were found in the XPS spectra shown in Fig. 7a.The peaks of C1 s as seen in Fig. 7(b) are observed in three categories: those in the range of 281-283 eV, the other in the range of 284.5-287.5 eV and the peak between 288 and 290 eV.The peak centered at 282.6 eV indicates the dehydrogenated carbon species attached to a metal ion while the peak at 286.1 eV is attributed to the CA ANA AC functional group present in graphitic carbon nitride 28,29.The peak at 282.6 eV can be associated to the bond between the carbon in g-C 3 N 4 and a metal contaminant 30 confirming copper was indeed present in the nanocomposite.The modification with copper is responsible for the reduction in the binding energy of the graphitic CA AC bond that is expected to exist in the composite resulting in a C-Metal bond.The peak at 288.59 eV corresponds to the metal carbonate from the CA AO bond formed in the composite 31.The XPS result also sheds more light on the reaction mechanism of the composite.From Fig. 7 (c) the peaks of N1s can be spotted at 396.3 eV and 398.7 eV.The latter peak is assigned to the CA ANH 2 from the precursor of g-C 3 N 4 (melamine) while the former peak is assigned to the CA ANA AC while 32.The peak at 408 eV is also characteristic of the CA ANH 2 bond present in metal nitrides.As seen from Fig. 7(d were determined using the Kubelka-Munk transformed reflectance spectra.It is obvious that the band gap of TiO 2 reduced upon doping it with 3 Cu.This explains the improved photoactivity of the Cu-modified catalyst.In the case of g-C 3 N 4 , the band gap did not reduce but rather slightly increased and this is so for a number of reasons.Firstly, g-C 3 N 4 exists mainly as a metal-free photocatalyst.This implies that its effect with different metals will vary and the shift in band gap may not be the same as others.Also the band gap depends on the geometrical orientation and the electronic configuration of the atoms constituting the material.Hence, modifications could alter the atomic order which could lead to alter the band structure.A similar result was obtained from past research on transition metal doped g-C 3 N 4 19.The difference in the structure of g-C 3 N 4 and 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 was observed from FESEM as there was a change in the morphology upon doping g-C 3 N 4 with 3 Cu.The band gap energy of the photocatalysts are as follows: TiO 2 -3.1 eV, g-C 3 N 4 -2.74 eV, 3 Cu/TiO 2 -2.9 eV, 3 Cu/ g-C 3 N 4 -2.84 eV and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) -2.38 eV.The results obtained agree well with the theoretical band gap of the catalysts.The calculated band gaps indicate that the composite has the lowest band gap of all the catalysts prepared.This confirms that the heterojunction formed by combining g-C 3 N 4 and 3 Cu/TiO 2 reduced the band gap of the individual constituents.This reduced the recombination rate, improved the efficiency of the photocatalyst and increased the yield of product formed under visible light irradiations.Fig. 9 displays the result of photoluminescence analysis for TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3 Cu/TiO 2 , 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite.This was to determine the rate of recombination and separation of photogenerated electron-pairs in the catalysts.From the understanding that the recombination rate of an electron/hole in a material relates directly to the intensity of the PL spectra, certain inferences can be drawn from the result 33.From Fig. 9, TiO 2 possess a higher intensity compared to 3 Cu/TiO 2 indicating modification with copper improved charge separation and lowered the recombination rate i.Likewise, g-C 3 N 4 possess a higher emission intensity compared to the 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite as corroborated with the results in Fig. 8.This confirms the formation of a heterostructure comprising of g-C 3 N 4 and 3 Cu/TiO 2 in the 30:70 ratio produces a suitable composite photocatalyst with increased charge separation and lower recombination rate. For quality assurance and to ascertain correct results, blank tests were performed in the dark with the catalyst and CO 2 and in the light and catalyst without CO 2 under the same experimental conditions.The carbon based products were not detected in either case.Therefore, any carbon based product e.g., methanol and formic acid was produced only during CO 2 reduction in the presence of catalyst and light irradiations.Recently similar method has been reported for blank test to confirm source of carbon in products 34.All experiments were repeated at least three times consecutively to check the reliability of the obtained results. The effect of Cu loading on the activity of TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction to methanol and formic acid under both visible and UV light are presented in Fig. 10.The effectiveness of the catalyst samples were analysed based on the yield of CH 3 OH and HCOOH which were the two main products from the process.As seen in Fig. 10(a) and (b), the yield of CH 3 OH increases with increasing Cu loading till it attained an optimum yield when doped with 3 Cu beyond which the yield starts to decline.This trend is the same for both UV and visible light, although the yield of CH 3 OH for 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of 3 Cu/TiO 2 and visible light gives a higher yield of CH 3 OH.The result indicates that doping the pure catalysts with Cu metal is capable of reducing the band gap, reducing recombination rate of electron and hole pairs and increasing product yield.Copper has proven to be the preferred metal in the photoreduction of CO 2 to methanol as it demonstrates some level of selectivity for MeOH 35.This is due to the possibility of electron trapping by copper ions as the difference in reduction potential of Cu 2 (0.34) is more positive than the conduction band edge of the catalysts (TiO 2 A0.5 g-C 3 N 4 A1.23 eV vs. NHE).The trapped electrons by Cu 2 contained in the TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 can then contribute their electrons in the reaction of CO 2 with the reductant to aid the formation of methanol.The reduction in product yield after 3 wt.Cu is loaded is as a result of active site inhibition due to excess metal dopants 36.The CH 3 OH yield for Cu/g-C 3 N 4 is slightly higher than that of Cu/TiO 2 mainly because of the suitable band gap.The results confirm that the re- engineering of band gap of a catalyst by metal-doping increases the effectiveness of the photocatalyst.Considering Fig. 10(c) and(d), the trend in the HCOOH yield is similar as that of CH 3 OH.Also, the yield of HCOOH over g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of TiO 2 due to the suitable band gap of g-C 3 N 4 . The yield of CH 3 OH and HCOOH for each of the synthesized catalyst composites for both UV and visible light is exhibited in Considering the result in Fig. 11(a), when copper is doped on g-C 3 N 4 (Cu/g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 ), the yield of CH 3 OH is low for both visible and UV light, but when it is doped on TiO 2 (g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 ) the yield of the products increase.It can be seen that doping Cu on TiO 2 could improve the efficiency and selectivity for CH 3 OH synthesis from CO 2 photoreduction 37 as similarly reported elsewhere 37.Another reason is that in the case of g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 , the loading of Cu on TiO 2 forms a Schottky barrier which inhibits electron-hole recombination 36,38.Effective transfer of electrons and separation of charges is pertinent since recombination has been inhibited and is reflected in the performance of the catalyst as observed in Fig. 11(a) and(b).Of all the composite ratios, 30:70 gives the optimal yield of CH 3 OH for both UV and visible light as a consequence of the interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 .This interaction improves charge carrier separation and prevents recombination.Considering Fig. 11(b), the highest yield of HCOOH is from 3 Cu/TiO 2 (S2) consistent with that obtained from previous research on CO 2 reduction 36. The effect of time on the yield of the products for the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite while using both UV and visible light is represented in Fig. 12.It is observed that the yield of CH 3 OH after 8 h for visible light is higher than that of UV light at the same time.As seen from Fig. 12(a), the yield of CH 3 OH under visible light increases but decreases under UV light.Meanwhile, contrary to what is observed in Fig. 12a, the yield of HCOOH increases under UV light in Fig. 11(b). The decreasing yield of CH 3 OH and increasing yield of HCOOH for UV light can be traced to three different possibilities.The first is photo-oxidation of methanol under UV light.When the composite photocatalyst is irradiated with UV light both TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 experience photoexcitation 39.Since the CB of g-C 3 N 4 is more negative than that of TiO 2 , photoinduced electrons from g-C 3 N 4 can easily migrate to TiO 2 40.Similarly, since the VB value of TiO 2 is more positive than that of g-C 3 N 4 , it is easier for photoinduced holes from TiO 2 to migrate to g-C 3 N 4 through the layer where the heterojunction was formed 39.However, the transfer of extra photoinduced holes from the TiO 2 to g-C 3 N 4 will cause a pile-up and this leads to a series of photo-oxidation reactions in g-C 3 N 4 41,42.The second possibility is for photoinduced electrons to reduce dissolved oxygen in the photoreaction to superoxide radical ( O 2 A).This photoreduction of dissolved O 2 to O 2 -initiates a chain of reactions-one of them being the combination of the produced superoxide radical with H to give HOO 39,43.Lastly, g-C 3 N 4 has a VB more negative than the electrode potential of H 2 O/ OH (2.7 eV) which means that it is very unlikely for photogenerated holes on its VB to react with absorbed water molecules to form hydroxyl radicals 44,45.This means that in the case of UV light the migration of photogenerated holes to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 from VB of TiO 2 could have resulted in low yield of methanol under UV light. The performance of g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 ) composite was further compared with the results reported by previous researchers.The superior yield of CH 3 OH obtained in the present study using g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 ) composite can be attributed to the visible light absorption property of g-C 3 N 4 as a result of its suitable band gap, the ability of Cu to act as an electron trapping agent whilst maintaining mobility of photo-generated electrons and the synergistic interaction between the constituents of the composite. In order to check the recyclability of the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite, a photostability test was performed in 3 cycles with a cumulative of 18 h.After each cycle, the catalyst was filtered, dried and reused with fresh reductant.The result from Fig. 13 illustrates two different trends, for the visible light reaction shown in Fig. 13(a) and (b).The g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite do not deactivate throughout the three cyclic runs for both products, implying it is a very stable composite under visible light regardless of the product.Conversely, the photostability test for the g-C 3 N 4 / (3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite using UV light represented in Fig. 13(c) and (d) is poor.This is because the yield of the products continued to decrease with increase in time due to photooxidation of the photogenerated methanol to formic acid while irradiating with UV light.This is confirmed by Fig. 13(d) since the yield of HCOOH increases with increasing irradiation time though it is not perfectly stable as in the case of visible light.The production of HCOOH from the photo-oxidation of CH 3 OH is obviously responsible for the low yield of CH 3 OH in the case of UV light reaction.It has been reported that with respect to photooxidation of CH 3 OH, UV light induces oxidation to methoxy (the first step in oxidation of CH 3 OH to methyl formate which later hydrolyses to formic acid) 50,51.Several reports on photooxidation of CH 3 OH to HCOOH all confirm this claim as they all report the photo-oxidation process with UV light 525354.Yang et al., 2014 researched on photo-oxidation of CH 3 OH using TiO 2 and SiO 2 modified by silver with both UV and visible light.It was reported that for both catalysts, the UV light was more active for the photo-oxidation process compared to visible light 55.This and other previous research support our claim that the photooxidation of CH 3 OH to HCOOH is active under UV light and could be responsible for the drop in yield of CH 3 OH while using UV light. The photoreduction process involves the adsorption of CO 2 by the reductant and on the surface of the photocatalyst, irradiation of the solution which leads to photoexcitation of electrons as a result of light absorption 56.The multi-step reaction pathway of the process splits into four parts: water splitting, formation of CO 2 radical, formation of CH 3 OH and HCOOH 57 and the photooxidation of methanol to methyl formate and its hydrolysis to formic acid 50.The photo-oxidation of methanol involves: CO 2 2H 2e A !HCOOH (6) The electron trapping capacity of copper doped on the photocatalyst and the production of photo-excited electron-hole pairs are listed in Eqs. ( 1)-( 3).This leads to an increase in lifetime of charges and fosters redox reaction at the surfaces.Reduction of CO 2 occurs at the CB by the activity of electrons and H 2 is oxidized by holes at the VB and this is kinetically explained in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Production of HCOOH and CH 3 OH through the photoreduction of CO 2 is shown in Eqs. ( 6) and (7).The Eqs. ( 8)-( 12) lists the reactions for photo-oxidation of CH 3 OH to HCOOH under UV light.Based on the photoactivity and reaction pathway, insights for the reaction mechanism were obtained.Upon effective light absorption, electrons from g-C 3 N 4 and Cu/TiO 2 are photoexcited.The photogenerated electrons followed a unique sequence for both UV and visible light.In the case of visible light, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 migrated to the CB of TiO 2 and from TiO 2 to Cu.For UV light, since the CB of g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of TiO 2 , migration from g-C 3 N 4 to TiO 2 will be impossible.However g-C 3 N 4 is also photoexcited by UV light irradiation as well.For both lights there was migration of holes from the VB of g-C 3 N 4 to that of TiO 2 .This is depicted by the direction of the arrows in Fig. 14(a) and (b).The movement of electrons to one catalyst (TiO 2 ) and holes to the other (g-C 3 N 4 ) fostered charge separation in the composite and reduced the rate of recombination.However, the transfer of extra photoinduced holes to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 caused an accumulation of photoinduced holes in g-C 3 N 4 since there was no migration of photoinduced electrons to CB of TiO 2 under UV light.This leads to a series of photo-oxidation reactions in g-C 3 N 4 under UV light.This photo-oxidation affected the yield of methanol from the process while using UV light.It is also possible that photoinduced electrons could photoreduce dissolved oxygen in the photoreaction to superoxide radical ( O 2 ) and this photoreduction of dissolved O 2 to O 2 A initiated the combination of the produced superoxide radical with H to give HOO .It is very unlikely for the photogenerated holes on its VB to react with absorbed water molecules to form hydroxyl radicals.The OH aids formation of CH 3 OH from the process, but in the case of UV light the migration of photogenerated holes to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 from the VB of TiO 2 could have resulted in low yield of methanol under UV light."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 composite", "source": "The g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 composite is an effective catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction and higher yield and selectivity of hydrocarbon products can be obtained from using it given the right conditions and set-up.", "context": "The g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 composite is an effective catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction and higher yield and selectivity of hydrocarbon products can be obtained from using it given the right conditions and set-up.The enhanced photoactivity and performance of the nanocomposite can be traced to the arrangement of the constituents of the composite which affected the mechanism of the photoreaction.The interaction between TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 combined in the appropriate ratio is another reason for the effectiveness of the composite.The combined efforts of both constituents helped to overcome limitations of the other hence deploying their fortes.The maximum yield of both products were 2574 mmol/g.cat of CH 3 OH, 5069 mmol/g.cat of HCOOH under visible light and 614 mmol/g.cat of CH 3 OH and 6709 mmol/g.cat of HCOOH under UV light irradiations.The role of the copper doped on TiO 2 could be deduced as follows: (1) created more active sites for adsorption of CO 2 , (2) increased photoactivity of TiO 2 to absorb and utilize visible light and (3) developed Schottky barrier to promote separation of electron and hole pairs hence inhibiting recombination.Although yield of the product was initially higher using UV light, the reaction was affected by photo-oxidation.Thus, visible light can be considered more effective and efficient for photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH using g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 ) composite as it gave the highest yield of both products and demonstrated better stability.The g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 ) composite combined the strengths of g-C 3 N 4 , CuO and TiO 2 .This interaction in the heterostructure generally improved its photocatalytic activity making it a suitable visible light photocatalyst for effective CO 2 photoreduction.

Fig. 10.Effect of copper loading on photoactivity of TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 UV and visible: (a) Yield of CH 3 OH for CuTiO 2 (b) Yield of CH 3 OH for Cu/g-C 3 N 4 (c) Yield of HCOOH for CuTiO 2 (d) Yield of HCOOH for Cu/g-C 3 N 4. Fig.11.It is obvious that modification of the catalysts with Cu metal confers a positive influence on the yield of the products.Considering the result in Fig.11(a), when copper is doped on g-C 3 N 4 (Cu/g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 ), the yield of CH 3 OH is low for both visible and UV light, but when it is doped on TiO 2 (g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 ) the yield of the products increase.It can be seen that doping Cu on TiO 2 could improve the efficiency and selectivity for CH 3 OH synthesis from CO 2 photoreduction37 as similarly reported elsewhere37.Another reason is that in the case of g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 , the loading of Cu on TiO 2 forms a Schottky barrier which inhibits electron-hole recombination36,38. Effective transfer of electrons and separation of charges is pertinent since recombination has been inhibited and is reflected in the performance of the catalyst as observed in Fig.11(a) and (b).Of all the composite ratios, 30:70 gives the optimal yield of CH 3 OH for both UV and visible light as a consequence of the interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 .This interaction improves charge carrier separation and prevents recombination.Considering Fig.11(b), the highest yield of HCOOH is from 3 Cu/TiO 2 (S2) consistent with that obtained from previous research on CO 2 reduction36.The effect of time on the yield of the products for the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite while using both UV and visible light is represented in Fig.12.It is observed that the yield of CH 3 OH after 8 h for visible light is higher than that of UV light at the same time.As seen from Fig.12(a), the yield of CH 3 OH under visible light increases but decreases under UV light.Meanwhile, contrary to what is observed in Fig.12a, the yield of HCOOH increases under UV light in Fig.11(b).The decreasing yield of CH 3 OH and increasing yield of HCOOH for UV light can be traced to three different possibilities.The first is photo-oxidation of methanol under UV light.When the composite photocatalyst is irradiated with UV light both TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 experience photoexcitation39.Since the CB of g-C 3 N 4 is more negative than that of TiO 2 , photoinduced electrons from g-C 3 N 4 can easily migrate to TiO 240.Similarly, since the VB value of TiO 2 is more positive than that of g-C 3 N 4 , it is easier for photoinduced holes from TiO 2 to migrate to g-C 3 N 4 through the layer where the heterojunction was formed39.However, the transfer of extra photoinduced holes from the TiO 2 to g-C 3 N 4 will cause a pile-up and this leads to a series of photo-oxidation reactions in g-C 3 N 441,42.The second possibility is for photoinduced electrons to reduce dissolved oxygen in the photoreaction to superoxide radical ( O 2 A).This photoreduction of dissolved O 2 to O 2 -initiates a chain of reactions-one of them being the combination of the produced superoxide radical with H to give HOO39,43.Lastly, g-C 3 N 4 has a VB more negative than the electrode potential of H 2 O/ OH (2.7 eV) which means that it is very unlikely for photogenerated Fig. 12.Effect of irradiation time against product yield over g-C 3 N 4 /(3Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite (a) Yield of CH 3 OH for UV and visible light against irradiation time (b) Yield of HCOOH for UV and visible light against irradiation time.

Fig.11.It is obvious that modification of the catalysts with Cu metal confers a positive influence on the yield of the products.Considering the result in Fig.11(a), when copper is doped on g-C 3 N 4 (Cu/g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 ), the yield of CH 3 OH is low for both visible and UV light, but when it is doped on TiO 2 (g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 ) the yield of the products increase.It can be seen that doping Cu on TiO 2 could improve the efficiency and selectivity for CH 3 OH synthesis from CO 2 photoreduction37 as similarly reported elsewhere37.Another reason is that in the case of g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 , the loading of Cu on TiO 2 forms a Schottky barrier which inhibits electron-hole recombination36,38. Effective transfer of electrons and separation of charges is pertinent since recombination has been inhibited and is reflected in the performance of the catalyst as observed in Fig.11(a) and (b).Of all the composite ratios, 30:70 gives the optimal yield of CH 3 OH for both UV and visible light as a consequence of the interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 .This interaction improves charge carrier separation and prevents recombination.Considering Fig.11(b), the highest yield of HCOOH is from 3 Cu/TiO 2 (S2) consistent with that obtained from previous research on CO 2 reduction36.The effect of time on the yield of the products for the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite while using both UV and visible light is represented in Fig.12.It is observed that the yield of CH 3 OH after 8 h for visible light is higher than that of UV light at the same time.As seen from Fig.12(a), the yield of CH 3 OH under visible light increases but decreases under UV light.Meanwhile, contrary to what is observed in Fig.12a, the yield of HCOOH increases under UV light in Fig.11(b).The decreasing yield of CH 3 OH and increasing yield of HCOOH for UV light can be traced to three different possibilities.The first is photo-oxidation of methanol under UV light.When the composite photocatalyst is irradiated with UV light both TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 experience photoexcitation39.Since the CB of g-C 3 N 4 is more negative than that of TiO 2 , photoinduced electrons from g-C 3 N 4 can easily migrate to TiO 240.Similarly, since the VB value of TiO 2 is more positive than that of g-C 3 N 4 , it is easier for photoinduced holes from TiO 2 to migrate to g-C 3 N 4 through the layer where the heterojunction was formed39.However, the transfer of extra photoinduced holes from the TiO 2 to g-C 3 N 4 will cause a pile-up and this leads to a series of photo-oxidation reactions in g-C 3 N 441,42.The second possibility is for photoinduced electrons to reduce dissolved oxygen in the photoreaction to superoxide radical ( O 2 A).This photoreduction of dissolved O 2 to O 2 -initiates a chain of reactions-one of them being the combination of the produced superoxide radical with H to give HOO39,43.Lastly, g-C 3 N 4 has a VB more negative than the electrode potential of H 2 O/ OH (2.7 eV) which means that it is very unlikely for photogenerated Fig. 12.Effect of irradiation time against product yield over g-C 3 N 4 /(3Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite (a) Yield of CH 3 OH for UV and visible light against irradiation time (b) Yield of HCOOH for UV and visible light against irradiation time.

CuTiO 2 ) compared to 30:70 because the amount of Cu/TiO 2 doped is lesser.This is also the case for g-C 3 N 4 in the different composites as the peak becomes more significant as the wt. of g-C 3 N 4 increased in the composite.None of the peaks associated with TiO 2 could be found in the diffractograms of g-C 3 N 4 and Cu/g-C 3 N 4 .g-C 3 N 4 is known for possessing two distinctive XRD peaks usually at 13 and 27 .Graphitic carbon nitride can be identified and confirmed by the presence of these two peaks which are identified in Fig. 2. The peak at 27.3 listed at plane (002) is representative of the interlayer stacked conjugated aromatic system while the peak at 13 listed at plane (100) represents the intra-planar structural packing of the aromatic system.Presence of these two typical peaks of g-C 3 N 4 confirms its identity 8.The characteristic peaks of g-C 3 N 4 (13 and 27.3 ) can also be seen in the composites indicating it was successfully doped on the Cu/TiO 2 .In all the copper modified samples and the composites, a peak characteristic of copper can be seen at 75.2 19.This confirms the presence of copper in these copper modified samples and composites.All the peaks observed conformed to previous results obtained 15,19 and to data from JCPDS card no: 86-1156. Fig. 3 depicts the morphology of the as-prepared catalysts.From Fig. 3(a) it can be seen that g-C 3 N 4 possess a layered, flat, sheet-like structure having hollows and a lamellar structure.3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 in Fig. 3(b) demonstrates a very porous, feather-like material having several internal layers just like the g-C 3 N 4 having a lamellar structure.This disparity is possibly a consequence of effective stirring and heating from calcination during the metal impregnation of g-C 3 N 4 to 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 .3 Cu/TiO 2 displayed the typical, spherical, nanosized particle of TiO 2 as depicted in Fig. 3c.From Fig. 3d a distinct combination of theg-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 features can be observed.From the image, a mass of g-C 3 N 4 can be seen upon an agglomeration of 3 Cu/TiO 2 confirming the ratio to which the constituents of the composite were added.The image depicts a large mass of aggregated 3 CuTiO 2 with just a handful of g-C 3 N 4 on the surface.This suggests g-C 3 N 4 is located on the surface of 3 Cu/TiO 2 which means upon irradiation of light, g-C 3 N 4 attracts the photons of light more effectively since it is on the surface.It transfers this energy to the 3 Cu/TiO 2 which has the exceptional selectivity for CO 2 conversion to CH 3 OH due to the presence of copper. The micro-structure of the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite was characterized using the Transmission Electron Microscope.Fig. 4 displays the TEM images obtained for the composite catalyst.From this image, by considering Fig. 4a, a representation of the ratio of each component is visible, i.e. 30:70 for g-C 3 N 4 and Cu/TiO 2 .It is certain that the composite is a combination of both constituents in the desired ratio.The agglomerated TiO 2 crystals 20, the fibrous, lamella and mesoporous layer of g-C 3 N 4 8 can be seen from Fig. 4a.The heterojunction between the crystalline copper modified TiO 2 and amorphous g-C 3 N 4 is evident in Fig. 4b.The 0.352 nm interplanar spacing of TiO 2 and 0.361 nm spacing of crystalline copper 21 was also measured. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to identify the catalysts (TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3 Cu/TiO 2 , 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 and the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite) based on their characteristic bands as illustrated in Fig. 5.The existence of TiO 2 can be verified by considering the steep band at 550-900 cm A1 in the spectra.This band which occurs only in TiO 2 , 3 Cu/TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite is peculiar to TiO 2 .The presence of this band guarantees that one of the constituents of the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite is TiO 2 .A broad band of 3162 cm A1 exists between 3000 and 3500 cm A1 and this is characteristic of the stretching vibration of hydroxyl functional group HA AOH in TiO 2 and that of the amine or amide group from g-C 3 N 4 8,22.The following spectra bands which are often attributed to the samples containing g-C 3 N 4 are also present in Fig. 5.An absorption band at 805 cm A1 associated with the bending modes of the parent triazine structure of g-C 3 N 4 is present in all three carbon nitride containing catalysts.The NA AH stretch of the heterocyclic amines present in the g-C 3 N 4 structure are identified by the bands at 1248 cm A1 , 1326 cm A1 , 1410 cm A1 and 1571 cm A1 .The band located at 1640 cm A1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration band of the CA AN of amines in g-C 3 N 4 .These band frequencies confirm g-C 3 N 4 was indeed the synthesized catalyst and it is observed in 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite 23.The peak observed between 2300-2400 cm A1 present in TiO 2 and the nanocomposite is as a result of CO 2 in the atmosphere 24. Measurement of the specific surface area and pore size of the as-prepared catalyst samples were performed by BET analysis with nitrogen adsorption at A196.15 C and degassing at 250 C for 4 h.The adsorption-desorption isotherm of TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 and the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite are presented in Fig. 6a.The calculated specific surface area of TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 and the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite were 11.0, 10.5 and 12.3 m 2 /g, respectively.It is noticeable that the surface area of composites catalyst is much closer to that of the pure TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 samples.This reveals that surface area has no significant effect on the photoactivity of CO 2 reduction to methanol.Therefore, rapid separation of photogenerated carriers might have contributed to the improved photoactivity 25.The existence of mesopores in the catalyst sample was verified by observing the curves exhibited in Fig. 6a.The curve depicts the fourth type (H 4 ) of adsorption isotherm which typifies mesoporous structures 26.Considering the hysteresis loops, their shapes are similar to that of the type (H 3 ) which is characteristic of slit-shaped pores formed as a result of plate/panel-shaped particles as observed in the FESEM and TEM images.For pore size analysis, the BJH pore size distribution in Fig. 6b, agrees well with the isotherm in Fig. 6a 27.From the plot it is evident that the composite is mesoporous in nature and this characteristic is in good agreement with the TEM and FESEM images.The properties including the BET/BJH data of the catalysts are listed in Table 1.From Fig. 6(a), the hysteresis loop (H4 type) of TiO 2 nanoparticle, g-C 3 N 4 and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 CuTiO 2 ) composite confirms large amount of mesopores resident in the matrix.As seen from Fig. 6(b), the pore diameter distributions confirm the presence of mesopores in each sample. XPS analysis was performed to determine the chemistry of the atoms in the composite catalyst of g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 sample and exhibited in Fig. 7.All elemental constituents of the composite (C, N, Ti, O and Cu) were found in the XPS spectra shown in Fig. 7a.The peaks of C1 s as seen in Fig. 7(b) are observed in three categories: those in the range of 281-283 eV, the other in the range of 284.5-287.5 eV and the peak between 288 and 290 eV.The peak centered at 282.6 eV indicates the dehydrogenated carbon species attached to a metal ion while the peak at 286.1 eV is attributed to the CA ANA AC functional group present in graphitic carbon nitride 28,29.The peak at 282.6 eV can be associated to the bond between the carbon in g-C 3 N 4 and a metal contaminant 30 confirming copper was indeed present in the nanocomposite.The modification with copper is responsible for the reduction in the binding energy of the graphitic CA AC bond that is expected to exist in the composite resulting in a C-Metal bond.The peak at 288.59 eV corresponds to the metal carbonate from the CA AO bond formed in the composite 31.The XPS result also sheds more light on the reaction mechanism of the composite.From Fig. 7 (c) the peaks of N1s can be spotted at 396.3 eV and 398.7 eV.The latter peak is assigned to the CA ANH 2 from the precursor of g-C 3 N 4 (melamine) while the former peak is assigned to the CA ANA AC while 32.The peak at 408 eV is also characteristic of the CA ANH 2 bond present in metal nitrides.As seen from Fig. 7(d were determined using the Kubelka-Munk transformed reflectance spectra.It is obvious that the band gap of TiO 2 reduced upon doping it with 3 Cu.This explains the improved photoactivity of the Cu-modified catalyst.In the case of g-C 3 N 4 , the band gap did not reduce but rather slightly increased and this is so for a number of reasons.Firstly, g-C 3 N 4 exists mainly as a metal-free photocatalyst.This implies that its effect with different metals will vary and the shift in band gap may not be the same as others.Also the band gap depends on the geometrical orientation and the electronic configuration of the atoms constituting the material.Hence, modifications could alter the atomic order which could lead to alter the band structure.A similar result was obtained from past research on transition metal doped g-C 3 N 4 19.The difference in the structure of g-C 3 N 4 and 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 was observed from FESEM as there was a change in the morphology upon doping g-C 3 N 4 with 3 Cu.The band gap energy of the photocatalysts are as follows: TiO 2 -3.1 eV, g-C 3 N 4 -2.74 eV, 3 Cu/TiO 2 -2.9 eV, 3 Cu/ g-C 3 N 4 -2.84 eV and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) -2.38 eV.The results obtained agree well with the theoretical band gap of the catalysts.The calculated band gaps indicate that the composite has the lowest band gap of all the catalysts prepared.This confirms that the heterojunction formed by combining g-C 3 N 4 and 3 Cu/TiO 2 reduced the band gap of the individual constituents.This reduced the recombination rate, improved the efficiency of the photocatalyst and increased the yield of product formed under visible light irradiations.Fig. 9 displays the result of photoluminescence analysis for TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3 Cu/TiO 2 , 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite.This was to determine the rate of recombination and separation of photogenerated electron-pairs in the catalysts.From the understanding that the recombination rate of an electron/hole in a material relates directly to the intensity of the PL spectra, certain inferences can be drawn from the result 33.From Fig. 9, TiO 2 possess a higher intensity compared to 3 Cu/TiO 2 indicating modification with copper improved charge separation and lowered the recombination rate i.Likewise, g-C 3 N 4 possess a higher emission intensity compared to the 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite as corroborated with the results in Fig. 8.This confirms the formation of a heterostructure comprising of g-C 3 N 4 and 3 Cu/TiO 2 in the 30:70 ratio produces a suitable composite photocatalyst with increased charge separation and lower recombination rate. For quality assurance and to ascertain correct results, blank tests were performed in the dark with the catalyst and CO 2 and in the light and catalyst without CO 2 under the same experimental conditions.The carbon based products were not detected in either case.Therefore, any carbon based product e.g., methanol and formic acid was produced only during CO 2 reduction in the presence of catalyst and light irradiations.Recently similar method has been reported for blank test to confirm source of carbon in products 34.All experiments were repeated at least three times consecutively to check the reliability of the obtained results. The effect of Cu loading on the activity of TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction to methanol and formic acid under both visible and UV light are presented in Fig. 10.The effectiveness of the catalyst samples were analysed based on the yield of CH 3 OH and HCOOH which were the two main products from the process.As seen in Fig. 10(a) and (b), the yield of CH 3 OH increases with increasing Cu loading till it attained an optimum yield when doped with 3 Cu beyond which the yield starts to decline.This trend is the same for both UV and visible light, although the yield of CH 3 OH for 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of 3 Cu/TiO 2 and visible light gives a higher yield of CH 3 OH.The result indicates that doping the pure catalysts with Cu metal is capable of reducing the band gap, reducing recombination rate of electron and hole pairs and increasing product yield.Copper has proven to be the preferred metal in the photoreduction of CO 2 to methanol as it demonstrates some level of selectivity for MeOH 35.This is due to the possibility of electron trapping by copper ions as the difference in reduction potential of Cu 2 (0.34) is more positive than the conduction band edge of the catalysts (TiO 2 A0.5 g-C 3 N 4 A1.23 eV vs. NHE).The trapped electrons by Cu 2 contained in the TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 can then contribute their electrons in the reaction of CO 2 with the reductant to aid the formation of methanol.The reduction in product yield after 3 wt.Cu is loaded is as a result of active site inhibition due to excess metal dopants 36.The CH 3 OH yield for Cu/g-C 3 N 4 is slightly higher than that of Cu/TiO 2 mainly because of the suitable band gap.The results confirm that the re- engineering of band gap of a catalyst by metal-doping increases the effectiveness of the photocatalyst.Considering Fig. 10(c) and(d), the trend in the HCOOH yield is similar as that of CH 3 OH.Also, the yield of HCOOH over g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of TiO 2 due to the suitable band gap of g-C 3 N 4 . The yield of CH 3 OH and HCOOH for each of the synthesized catalyst composites for both UV and visible light is exhibited in Considering the result in Fig. 11(a), when copper is doped on g-C 3 N 4 (Cu/g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 ), the yield of CH 3 OH is low for both visible and UV light, but when it is doped on TiO 2 (g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 ) the yield of the products increase.It can be seen that doping Cu on TiO 2 could improve the efficiency and selectivity for CH 3 OH synthesis from CO 2 photoreduction 37 as similarly reported elsewhere 37.Another reason is that in the case of g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 , the loading of Cu on TiO 2 forms a Schottky barrier which inhibits electron-hole recombination 36,38.Effective transfer of electrons and separation of charges is pertinent since recombination has been inhibited and is reflected in the performance of the catalyst as observed in Fig. 11(a) and(b).Of all the composite ratios, 30:70 gives the optimal yield of CH 3 OH for both UV and visible light as a consequence of the interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 .This interaction improves charge carrier separation and prevents recombination.Considering Fig. 11(b), the highest yield of HCOOH is from 3 Cu/TiO 2 (S2) consistent with that obtained from previous research on CO 2 reduction 36. The effect of time on the yield of the products for the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite while using both UV and visible light is represented in Fig. 12.It is observed that the yield of CH 3 OH after 8 h for visible light is higher than that of UV light at the same time.As seen from Fig. 12(a), the yield of CH 3 OH under visible light increases but decreases under UV light.Meanwhile, contrary to what is observed in Fig. 12a, the yield of HCOOH increases under UV light in Fig. 11(b). The decreasing yield of CH 3 OH and increasing yield of HCOOH for UV light can be traced to three different possibilities.The first is photo-oxidation of methanol under UV light.When the composite photocatalyst is irradiated with UV light both TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 experience photoexcitation 39.Since the CB of g-C 3 N 4 is more negative than that of TiO 2 , photoinduced electrons from g-C 3 N 4 can easily migrate to TiO 2 40.Similarly, since the VB value of TiO 2 is more positive than that of g-C 3 N 4 , it is easier for photoinduced holes from TiO 2 to migrate to g-C 3 N 4 through the layer where the heterojunction was formed 39.However, the transfer of extra photoinduced holes from the TiO 2 to g-C 3 N 4 will cause a pile-up and this leads to a series of photo-oxidation reactions in g-C 3 N 4 41,42.The second possibility is for photoinduced electrons to reduce dissolved oxygen in the photoreaction to superoxide radical ( O 2 A).This photoreduction of dissolved O 2 to O 2 -initiates a chain of reactions-one of them being the combination of the produced superoxide radical with H to give HOO 39,43.Lastly, g-C 3 N 4 has a VB more negative than the electrode potential of H 2 O/ OH (2.7 eV) which means that it is very unlikely for photogenerated holes on its VB to react with absorbed water molecules to form hydroxyl radicals 44,45.This means that in the case of UV light the migration of photogenerated holes to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 from VB of TiO 2 could have resulted in low yield of methanol under UV light. The performance of g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 ) composite was further compared with the results reported by previous researchers.The superior yield of CH 3 OH obtained in the present study using g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 ) composite can be attributed to the visible light absorption property of g-C 3 N 4 as a result of its suitable band gap, the ability of Cu to act as an electron trapping agent whilst maintaining mobility of photo-generated electrons and the synergistic interaction between the constituents of the composite. In order to check the recyclability of the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite, a photostability test was performed in 3 cycles with a cumulative of 18 h.After each cycle, the catalyst was filtered, dried and reused with fresh reductant.The result from Fig. 13 illustrates two different trends, for the visible light reaction shown in Fig. 13(a) and (b).The g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite do not deactivate throughout the three cyclic runs for both products, implying it is a very stable composite under visible light regardless of the product.Conversely, the photostability test for the g-C 3 N 4 / (3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite using UV light represented in Fig. 13(c) and (d) is poor.This is because the yield of the products continued to decrease with increase in time due to photooxidation of the photogenerated methanol to formic acid while irradiating with UV light.This is confirmed by Fig. 13(d) since the yield of HCOOH increases with increasing irradiation time though it is not perfectly stable as in the case of visible light.The production of HCOOH from the photo-oxidation of CH 3 OH is obviously responsible for the low yield of CH 3 OH in the case of UV light reaction.It has been reported that with respect to photooxidation of CH 3 OH, UV light induces oxidation to methoxy (the first step in oxidation of CH 3 OH to methyl formate which later hydrolyses to formic acid) 50,51.Several reports on photooxidation of CH 3 OH to HCOOH all confirm this claim as they all report the photo-oxidation process with UV light 525354.Yang et al., 2014 researched on photo-oxidation of CH 3 OH using TiO 2 and SiO 2 modified by silver with both UV and visible light.It was reported that for both catalysts, the UV light was more active for the photo-oxidation process compared to visible light 55.This and other previous research support our claim that the photooxidation of CH 3 OH to HCOOH is active under UV light and could be responsible for the drop in yield of CH 3 OH while using UV light. The photoreduction process involves the adsorption of CO 2 by the reductant and on the surface of the photocatalyst, irradiation of the solution which leads to photoexcitation of electrons as a result of light absorption 56.The multi-step reaction pathway of the process splits into four parts: water splitting, formation of CO 2 radical, formation of CH 3 OH and HCOOH 57 and the photooxidation of methanol to methyl formate and its hydrolysis to formic acid 50.The photo-oxidation of methanol involves: CO 2 2H 2e A !HCOOH (6) The electron trapping capacity of copper doped on the photocatalyst and the production of photo-excited electron-hole pairs are listed in Eqs. ( 1)-( 3).This leads to an increase in lifetime of charges and fosters redox reaction at the surfaces.Reduction of CO 2 occurs at the CB by the activity of electrons and H 2 is oxidized by holes at the VB and this is kinetically explained in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Production of HCOOH and CH 3 OH through the photoreduction of CO 2 is shown in Eqs. ( 6) and (7).The Eqs. ( 8)-( 12) lists the reactions for photo-oxidation of CH 3 OH to HCOOH under UV light.Based on the photoactivity and reaction pathway, insights for the reaction mechanism were obtained.Upon effective light absorption, electrons from g-C 3 N 4 and Cu/TiO 2 are photoexcited.The photogenerated electrons followed a unique sequence for both UV and visible light.In the case of visible light, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 migrated to the CB of TiO 2 and from TiO 2 to Cu.For UV light, since the CB of g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of TiO 2 , migration from g-C 3 N 4 to TiO 2 will be impossible.However g-C 3 N 4 is also photoexcited by UV light irradiation as well.For both lights there was migration of holes from the VB of g-C 3 N 4 to that of TiO 2 .This is depicted by the direction of the arrows in Fig. 14(a) and (b).The movement of electrons to one catalyst (TiO 2 ) and holes to the other (g-C 3 N 4 ) fostered charge separation in the composite and reduced the rate of recombination.However, the transfer of extra photoinduced holes to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 caused an accumulation of photoinduced holes in g-C 3 N 4 since there was no migration of photoinduced electrons to CB of TiO 2 under UV light.This leads to a series of photo-oxidation reactions in g-C 3 N 4 under UV light.This photo-oxidation affected the yield of methanol from the process while using UV light.It is also possible that photoinduced electrons could photoreduce dissolved oxygen in the photoreaction to superoxide radical ( O 2 ) and this photoreduction of dissolved O 2 to O 2 A initiated the combination of the produced superoxide radical with H to give HOO .It is very unlikely for the photogenerated holes on its VB to react with absorbed water molecules to form hydroxyl radicals.The OH aids formation of CH 3 OH from the process, but in the case of UV light the migration of photogenerated holes to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 from the VB of TiO 2 could have resulted in low yield of methanol under UV light."}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV/visible", "source": "g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 ) nanocomposite for enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH and HCOOH under

for the UV-light photoreaction and the other for visible light reaction as depicted in Fig. 1.", "context": "The chemicals used for synthesis of the photocatalysts include melamine (Sigma Aldrich AR

!95).The g-C 3 N 4 was synthesized by thermal treatment of melamine.In a typical process, 5 g of melamine was put in a crucible, covered, calcined in a muffle furnace and heated to 550 C for 3 h.The sample was then washed with 0.1 mol/L nitric acid and distilled water to remove any residual alkaline (e.g.ammonia) adsorbed on the sample surface.The washed sample was dried at 70 C for 12 h in the oven 17.Meanwhile, the copper doped carbon nitride and titanium dioxide (Cu/g-C 3 N 4 and Cu/TiO 2 ) composites were prepared by wetimpregnation method.4 g of g-C 3 N 4 was measured into a beaker while 0.46 g (3 wt.) of Cu (NO 3 ) 2 A3H 2 O was added to it and the mixture dissolved with 20 mL of distilled water.The mixture was stirred for 1 h using a magnetic stirrer after which it was put in a water bath to evaporate the solvent at 80 C for 3 h.The sample was oven dried at 120 C for 12 h.(to remove any remaining water molecules), calcined for 30 min at 450 C, removed and grinded into powder to produce 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 .The Cu modified TiO 2 (Cu/ TiO 2 ) was synthesized by a similar method as that used for Cu/g-C 3 N 4 but in this case TiO 2 was used instead of g-C 3 N 4 18,19. The composite g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 ) was prepared accordingly: 0.2 g of g-C 3 N 4 and 2 g of Cu/TiO 2 were dispersed in 70 mL methanol at room temperature under stirring for 24 h and it was centrifuged.The mixtures were then dried at 80 C for 12 h, and calcined at 400 C for 1 h at a heating rate of 5 C min A1 to obtain a g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 ) heterostructure of ratio (10:90).(Cu/g-C 3 N 4 )/ TiO 2 was similarly synthesized except Cu/g-C 3 N 4 was used together with pure TiO 2 15.Different ratios of the nanocomposite catalyst with superior photoactivity (g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 )) were prepared in ratios of 10:90, 30:70, 50:50, 70:30 and 90:10.The photocatalytic activity of the reference catalysts (g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 ) were compared with that of the prepared catalysts. The crystalline structure of the catalysts were ascertained by Xray diffraction (XRD) recorded on a powder diffractometer (Bruker Advance D8, 40 kV, 40 mA) using a Cu Ka radiation source in 2u range 5-80 with a step size of 0.05 and counting time of 5 s.The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of the sample was recorded on a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 FTIR spectrometer.The surface morphology was examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM JEOL model JSM-6700F, Japan).The specific surface area and pore diameters were measured by a Thermo scientific Surfer analyzer with nitrogen sorption at 77 K, degassing at 250 C for 4 h and analyzed by the Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method.The Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflection spectra of the samples were determined using a Shimadzu UV 3101PC UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer.The band gap energies of the photocatalysts were determined by using the Kubelka-Munk theory of reflectance and extrapolating from its plot.The charge recombination rate was measured using a Perkin Elmer LS 55 Luminescence Spectrophotometer.In order to determine the chemical composition of the catalyst a Shimadzu Axis Ultra DLD X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy was used.The photocatalyst was fixed to the sample holder using a carbon tape.The pass energy used for the survey spectra was 160 eV while that of the high resolution was 20 eV.The survey spectra were recorded in the range of 0-1200 eV.The structure of the samples were analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL), operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The photocatalytic reaction was conducted in two different setups; one for the UV-light photoreaction and the other for visible light reaction as depicted in Fig. 1.The UV light photoreaction process was carried out in a jacketed Pyrex glass slurry photoreactor with a total volume of 500 mL.Cooling water from a chiller was passed through the jacketed wall of the reactor to control the temperature.CO 2 is fed into the slurry photoreactor through a gas inlet pipe at the top and gas products flowed out through an outlet pipe drawn into the reactor from the top.The light source radiated into the slurry photoreactor through a lamp compartment which extended into the reactor from the top.A 254 nm UV lamp (UVP 90-0004-01 3SC9 Pen-Ray Mercury gas Lamp) with an intensity of 5.4 mW/cm 2 was used as the light source.The temperature of the reactor was maintained at 25 C by circulating cold water from a chiller.0.2 g of the as-prepared photocatalyst was dissolved in 400 mL of 1 M NaOH inside the slurry type photoreactor using a magnetic stirrer.The gas inlet port is connected to the reactor while the gas outlet port comes from the reactor for gas samples to be collected.The compressed gas (CO 2 purity 99.99) was regulated using a mass flow controller. The visible light photoreaction consisted of a reactor made from Pyrex glass of total volume of 250 mL.The quartz cold trap (QW220, China) was a double-jacketed Pyrex glass vessel having a hollow and two angled joints for cooling water inlet and outlet.A 500 W, 22 cm long arc Xe-lamp tube (PLS-LAX500ADJ, Perfect light Technology Co., Ltd.) was employed as the visible light source.The xenon lamp was placed inside the hollow of the cold trap for cooling the heat generated from the lamp and to filter infrared heat.0.1 g of the catalyst and 200 mL of 1.0 M NaOH solution was fed into the reactor.In order to purge the reactors and for saturation of CO 2 in the reaction medium, pure CO 2 gas was injected into the solution in each set-up for 30 min at a flow rate of 20 mL/min with the UV or visible light switched off.The solution was then irradiated using the light source for each set-up and samples were withdrawn every 2 h interval using a syringe.The drawn samples were filtered using a 0.45 mm filter in order to remove particles of the catalyst. The products were analysed and measured using a Perkin Elmer GC Auto system XL Gas Chromatograph equipped with a Flame Ionization detector (FID) and a DB-WAX Column.Helium was used as the carrier gas for GC.The initial temperature of the oven was 40 C for 5 min, ramped from 20 C to 180 C and the held-up for 5 min.The sample ran for 17 min in the GC with FID injector temperature at 250 C while maximum FID detector temperature was 350 C. The quantification of obtained products was conducted by the use of an external standard (99 purity absolute methanol, 85 purity formic acid, Merck) using a calibration curve."}, {"llm generation": "UV, Visible", "source": "The effect of Cu loading on the activity of TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction to methanol and formic acid under both visible and UV light are presented in Fig. 10.", "context": "Fig. 2 exhibits the XRD pattern of the pure and Cu-modified TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 as well as that of the nanocomposites.The presence of the anatase form of TiO 2 can be confirmed by the peaks at 25.1 , 37.6 , 48 , 55 , 62.6 , 68.7 and 70.3 which corresponds to planes (101), ( 004), ( 200), ( 105), ( 204), (220), and (215) typical of anatase TiO 2 .The peaks at 37.5 , 38 and 53.8 are characteristic of the rutile phase of TiO 2 .These peaks are traceable to the TiO 2 nanopowder used in the preparation of the composites and is reflected in the size of these peaks in the diffractograms of each composite ratio.For example, these peaks are smaller in ratio 90:10 (i.e. 90 wt. g-C 3 N 4 and 10 wt. CuTiO 2 ) compared to 30:70 because the amount of Cu/TiO 2 doped is lesser.This is also the case for g-C 3 N 4 in the different composites as the peak becomes more significant as the wt. of g-C 3 N 4 increased in the composite.None of the peaks associated with TiO 2 could be found in the diffractograms of g-C 3 N 4 and Cu/g-C 3 N 4 .g-C 3 N 4 is known for possessing two distinctive XRD peaks usually at 13 and 27 .Graphitic carbon nitride can be identified and confirmed by the presence of these two peaks which are identified in Fig. 2. The peak at 27.3 listed at plane (002) is representative of the interlayer stacked conjugated aromatic system while the peak at 13 listed at plane (100) represents the intra-planar structural packing of the aromatic system.Presence of these two typical peaks of g-C 3 N 4 confirms its identity 8.The characteristic peaks of g-C 3 N 4 (13 and 27.3 ) can also be seen in the composites indicating it was successfully doped on the Cu/TiO 2 .In all the copper modified samples and the composites, a peak characteristic of copper can be seen at 75.2 19.This confirms the presence of copper in these copper modified samples and composites.All the peaks observed conformed to previous results obtained 15,19 and to data from JCPDS card no: 86-1156. Fig. 3 depicts the morphology of the as-prepared catalysts.From Fig. 3(a) it can be seen that g-C 3 N 4 possess a layered, flat, sheet-like structure having hollows and a lamellar structure.3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 in Fig. 3(b) demonstrates a very porous, feather-like material having several internal layers just like the g-C 3 N 4 having a lamellar structure.This disparity is possibly a consequence of effective stirring and heating from calcination during the metal impregnation of g-C 3 N 4 to 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 .3 Cu/TiO 2 displayed the typical, spherical, nanosized particle of TiO 2 as depicted in Fig. 3c.From Fig. 3d a distinct combination of theg-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 features can be observed.From the image, a mass of g-C 3 N 4 can be seen upon an agglomeration of 3 Cu/TiO 2 confirming the ratio to which the constituents of the composite were added.The image depicts a large mass of aggregated 3 CuTiO 2 with just a handful of g-C 3 N 4 on the surface.This suggests g-C 3 N 4 is located on the surface of 3 Cu/TiO 2 which means upon irradiation of light, g-C 3 N 4 attracts the photons of light more effectively since it is on the surface.It transfers this energy to the 3 Cu/TiO 2 which has the exceptional selectivity for CO 2 conversion to CH 3 OH due to the presence of copper. The micro-structure of the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite was characterized using the Transmission Electron Microscope.Fig. 4 displays the TEM images obtained for the composite catalyst.From this image, by considering Fig. 4a, a representation of the ratio of each component is visible, i.e. 30:70 for g-C 3 N 4 and Cu/TiO 2 .It is certain that the composite is a combination of both constituents in the desired ratio.The agglomerated TiO 2 crystals 20, the fibrous, lamella and mesoporous layer of g-C 3 N 4 8 can be seen from Fig. 4a.The heterojunction between the crystalline copper modified TiO 2 and amorphous g-C 3 N 4 is evident in Fig. 4b.The 0.352 nm interplanar spacing of TiO 2 and 0.361 nm spacing of crystalline copper 21 was also measured. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to identify the catalysts (TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3 Cu/TiO 2 , 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 and the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite) based on their characteristic bands as illustrated in Fig. 5.The existence of TiO 2 can be verified by considering the steep band at 550-900 cm A1 in the spectra.This band which occurs only in TiO 2 , 3 Cu/TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite is peculiar to TiO 2 .The presence of this band guarantees that one of the constituents of the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite is TiO 2 .A broad band of 3162 cm A1 exists between 3000 and 3500 cm A1 and this is characteristic of the stretching vibration of hydroxyl functional group HA AOH in TiO 2 and that of the amine or amide group from g-C 3 N 4 8,22.The following spectra bands which are often attributed to the samples containing g-C 3 N 4 are also present in Fig. 5.An absorption band at 805 cm A1 associated with the bending modes of the parent triazine structure of g-C 3 N 4 is present in all three carbon nitride containing catalysts.The NA AH stretch of the heterocyclic amines present in the g-C 3 N 4 structure are identified by the bands at 1248 cm A1 , 1326 cm A1 , 1410 cm A1 and 1571 cm A1 .The band located at 1640 cm A1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration band of the CA AN of amines in g-C 3 N 4 .These band frequencies confirm g-C 3 N 4 was indeed the synthesized catalyst and it is observed in 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite 23.The peak observed between 2300-2400 cm A1 present in TiO 2 and the nanocomposite is as a result of CO 2 in the atmosphere 24. Measurement of the specific surface area and pore size of the as-prepared catalyst samples were performed by BET analysis with nitrogen adsorption at A196.15 C and degassing at 250 C for 4 h.The adsorption-desorption isotherm of TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 and the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite are presented in Fig. 6a.The calculated specific surface area of TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 and the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite were 11.0, 10.5 and 12.3 m 2 /g, respectively.It is noticeable that the surface area of composites catalyst is much closer to that of the pure TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 samples.This reveals that surface area has no significant effect on the photoactivity of CO 2 reduction to methanol.Therefore, rapid separation of photogenerated carriers might have contributed to the improved photoactivity 25.The existence of mesopores in the catalyst sample was verified by observing the curves exhibited in Fig. 6a.The curve depicts the fourth type (H 4 ) of adsorption isotherm which typifies mesoporous structures 26.Considering the hysteresis loops, their shapes are similar to that of the type (H 3 ) which is characteristic of slit-shaped pores formed as a result of plate/panel-shaped particles as observed in the FESEM and TEM images.For pore size analysis, the BJH pore size distribution in Fig. 6b, agrees well with the isotherm in Fig. 6a 27.From the plot it is evident that the composite is mesoporous in nature and this characteristic is in good agreement with the TEM and FESEM images.The properties including the BET/BJH data of the catalysts are listed in Table 1.From Fig. 6(a), the hysteresis loop (H4 type) of TiO 2 nanoparticle, g-C 3 N 4 and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 CuTiO 2 ) composite confirms large amount of mesopores resident in the matrix.As seen from Fig. 6(b), the pore diameter distributions confirm the presence of mesopores in each sample. XPS analysis was performed to determine the chemistry of the atoms in the composite catalyst of g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 sample and exhibited in Fig. 7.All elemental constituents of the composite (C, N, Ti, O and Cu) were found in the XPS spectra shown in Fig. 7a.The peaks of C1 s as seen in Fig. 7(b) are observed in three categories: those in the range of 281-283 eV, the other in the range of 284.5-287.5 eV and the peak between 288 and 290 eV.The peak centered at 282.6 eV indicates the dehydrogenated carbon species attached to a metal ion while the peak at 286.1 eV is attributed to the CA ANA AC functional group present in graphitic carbon nitride 28,29.The peak at 282.6 eV can be associated to the bond between the carbon in g-C 3 N 4 and a metal contaminant 30 confirming copper was indeed present in the nanocomposite.The modification with copper is responsible for the reduction in the binding energy of the graphitic CA AC bond that is expected to exist in the composite resulting in a C-Metal bond.The peak at 288.59 eV corresponds to the metal carbonate from the CA AO bond formed in the composite 31.The XPS result also sheds more light on the reaction mechanism of the composite.From Fig. 7 (c) the peaks of N1s can be spotted at 396.3 eV and 398.7 eV.The latter peak is assigned to the CA ANH 2 from the precursor of g-C 3 N 4 (melamine) while the former peak is assigned to the CA ANA AC while 32.The peak at 408 eV is also characteristic of the CA ANH 2 bond present in metal nitrides.As seen from Fig. 7(d were determined using the Kubelka-Munk transformed reflectance spectra.It is obvious that the band gap of TiO 2 reduced upon doping it with 3 Cu.This explains the improved photoactivity of the Cu-modified catalyst.In the case of g-C 3 N 4 , the band gap did not reduce but rather slightly increased and this is so for a number of reasons.Firstly, g-C 3 N 4 exists mainly as a metal-free photocatalyst.This implies that its effect with different metals will vary and the shift in band gap may not be the same as others.Also the band gap depends on the geometrical orientation and the electronic configuration of the atoms constituting the material.Hence, modifications could alter the atomic order which could lead to alter the band structure.A similar result was obtained from past research on transition metal doped g-C 3 N 4 19.The difference in the structure of g-C 3 N 4 and 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 was observed from FESEM as there was a change in the morphology upon doping g-C 3 N 4 with 3 Cu.The band gap energy of the photocatalysts are as follows: TiO 2 -3.1 eV, g-C 3 N 4 -2.74 eV, 3 Cu/TiO 2 -2.9 eV, 3 Cu/ g-C 3 N 4 -2.84 eV and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) -2.38 eV.The results obtained agree well with the theoretical band gap of the catalysts.The calculated band gaps indicate that the composite has the lowest band gap of all the catalysts prepared.This confirms that the heterojunction formed by combining g-C 3 N 4 and 3 Cu/TiO 2 reduced the band gap of the individual constituents.This reduced the recombination rate, improved the efficiency of the photocatalyst and increased the yield of product formed under visible light irradiations.Fig. 9 displays the result of photoluminescence analysis for TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3 Cu/TiO 2 , 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 , and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite.This was to determine the rate of recombination and separation of photogenerated electron-pairs in the catalysts.From the understanding that the recombination rate of an electron/hole in a material relates directly to the intensity of the PL spectra, certain inferences can be drawn from the result 33.From Fig. 9, TiO 2 possess a higher intensity compared to 3 Cu/TiO 2 indicating modification with copper improved charge separation and lowered the recombination rate i.Likewise, g-C 3 N 4 possess a higher emission intensity compared to the 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 and g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite as corroborated with the results in Fig. 8.This confirms the formation of a heterostructure comprising of g-C 3 N 4 and 3 Cu/TiO 2 in the 30:70 ratio produces a suitable composite photocatalyst with increased charge separation and lower recombination rate. For quality assurance and to ascertain correct results, blank tests were performed in the dark with the catalyst and CO 2 and in the light and catalyst without CO 2 under the same experimental conditions.The carbon based products were not detected in either case.Therefore, any carbon based product e.g., methanol and formic acid was produced only during CO 2 reduction in the presence of catalyst and light irradiations.Recently similar method has been reported for blank test to confirm source of carbon in products 34.All experiments were repeated at least three times consecutively to check the reliability of the obtained results. The effect of Cu loading on the activity of TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reduction to methanol and formic acid under both visible and UV light are presented in Fig. 10.The effectiveness of the catalyst samples were analysed based on the yield of CH 3 OH and HCOOH which were the two main products from the process.As seen in Fig. 10(a) and (b), the yield of CH 3 OH increases with increasing Cu loading till it attained an optimum yield when doped with 3 Cu beyond which the yield starts to decline.This trend is the same for both UV and visible light, although the yield of CH 3 OH for 3 Cu/g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of 3 Cu/TiO 2 and visible light gives a higher yield of CH 3 OH.The result indicates that doping the pure catalysts with Cu metal is capable of reducing the band gap, reducing recombination rate of electron and hole pairs and increasing product yield.Copper has proven to be the preferred metal in the photoreduction of CO 2 to methanol as it demonstrates some level of selectivity for MeOH 35.This is due to the possibility of electron trapping by copper ions as the difference in reduction potential of Cu 2 (0.34) is more positive than the conduction band edge of the catalysts (TiO 2 A0.5 g-C 3 N 4 A1.23 eV vs. NHE).The trapped electrons by Cu 2 contained in the TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 can then contribute their electrons in the reaction of CO 2 with the reductant to aid the formation of methanol.The reduction in product yield after 3 wt.Cu is loaded is as a result of active site inhibition due to excess metal dopants 36.The CH 3 OH yield for Cu/g-C 3 N 4 is slightly higher than that of Cu/TiO 2 mainly because of the suitable band gap.The results confirm that the re- engineering of band gap of a catalyst by metal-doping increases the effectiveness of the photocatalyst.Considering Fig. 10(c) and(d), the trend in the HCOOH yield is similar as that of CH 3 OH.Also, the yield of HCOOH over g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of TiO 2 due to the suitable band gap of g-C 3 N 4 . The yield of CH 3 OH and HCOOH for each of the synthesized catalyst composites for both UV and visible light is exhibited in Considering the result in Fig. 11(a), when copper is doped on g-C 3 N 4 (Cu/g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 ), the yield of CH 3 OH is low for both visible and UV light, but when it is doped on TiO 2 (g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 ) the yield of the products increase.It can be seen that doping Cu on TiO 2 could improve the efficiency and selectivity for CH 3 OH synthesis from CO 2 photoreduction 37 as similarly reported elsewhere 37.Another reason is that in the case of g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 , the loading of Cu on TiO 2 forms a Schottky barrier which inhibits electron-hole recombination 36,38.Effective transfer of electrons and separation of charges is pertinent since recombination has been inhibited and is reflected in the performance of the catalyst as observed in Fig. 11(a) and(b).Of all the composite ratios, 30:70 gives the optimal yield of CH 3 OH for both UV and visible light as a consequence of the interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 .This interaction improves charge carrier separation and prevents recombination.Considering Fig. 11(b), the highest yield of HCOOH is from 3 Cu/TiO 2 (S2) consistent with that obtained from previous research on CO 2 reduction 36. The effect of time on the yield of the products for the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite while using both UV and visible light is represented in Fig. 12.It is observed that the yield of CH 3 OH after 8 h for visible light is higher than that of UV light at the same time.As seen from Fig. 12(a), the yield of CH 3 OH under visible light increases but decreases under UV light.Meanwhile, contrary to what is observed in Fig. 12a, the yield of HCOOH increases under UV light in Fig. 11(b). The decreasing yield of CH 3 OH and increasing yield of HCOOH for UV light can be traced to three different possibilities.The first is photo-oxidation of methanol under UV light.When the composite photocatalyst is irradiated with UV light both TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 experience photoexcitation 39.Since the CB of g-C 3 N 4 is more negative than that of TiO 2 , photoinduced electrons from g-C 3 N 4 can easily migrate to TiO 2 40.Similarly, since the VB value of TiO 2 is more positive than that of g-C 3 N 4 , it is easier for photoinduced holes from TiO 2 to migrate to g-C 3 N 4 through the layer where the heterojunction was formed 39.However, the transfer of extra photoinduced holes from the TiO 2 to g-C 3 N 4 will cause a pile-up and this leads to a series of photo-oxidation reactions in g-C 3 N 4 41,42.The second possibility is for photoinduced electrons to reduce dissolved oxygen in the photoreaction to superoxide radical ( O 2 A).This photoreduction of dissolved O 2 to O 2 -initiates a chain of reactions-one of them being the combination of the produced superoxide radical with H to give HOO 39,43.Lastly, g-C 3 N 4 has a VB more negative than the electrode potential of H 2 O/ OH (2.7 eV) which means that it is very unlikely for photogenerated holes on its VB to react with absorbed water molecules to form hydroxyl radicals 44,45.This means that in the case of UV light the migration of photogenerated holes to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 from VB of TiO 2 could have resulted in low yield of methanol under UV light. The performance of g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 ) composite was further compared with the results reported by previous researchers.The superior yield of CH 3 OH obtained in the present study using g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 ) composite can be attributed to the visible light absorption property of g-C 3 N 4 as a result of its suitable band gap, the ability of Cu to act as an electron trapping agent whilst maintaining mobility of photo-generated electrons and the synergistic interaction between the constituents of the composite. In order to check the recyclability of the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite, a photostability test was performed in 3 cycles with a cumulative of 18 h.After each cycle, the catalyst was filtered, dried and reused with fresh reductant.The result from Fig. 13 illustrates two different trends, for the visible light reaction shown in Fig. 13(a) and (b).The g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite do not deactivate throughout the three cyclic runs for both products, implying it is a very stable composite under visible light regardless of the product.Conversely, the photostability test for the g-C 3 N 4 / (3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite using UV light represented in Fig. 13(c) and (d) is poor.This is because the yield of the products continued to decrease with increase in time due to photooxidation of the photogenerated methanol to formic acid while irradiating with UV light.This is confirmed by Fig. 13(d) since the yield of HCOOH increases with increasing irradiation time though it is not perfectly stable as in the case of visible light.The production of HCOOH from the photo-oxidation of CH 3 OH is obviously responsible for the low yield of CH 3 OH in the case of UV light reaction.It has been reported that with respect to photooxidation of CH 3 OH, UV light induces oxidation to methoxy (the first step in oxidation of CH 3 OH to methyl formate which later hydrolyses to formic acid) 50,51.Several reports on photooxidation of CH 3 OH to HCOOH all confirm this claim as they all report the photo-oxidation process with UV light 525354.Yang et al., 2014 researched on photo-oxidation of CH 3 OH using TiO 2 and SiO 2 modified by silver with both UV and visible light.It was reported that for both catalysts, the UV light was more active for the photo-oxidation process compared to visible light 55.This and other previous research support our claim that the photooxidation of CH 3 OH to HCOOH is active under UV light and could be responsible for the drop in yield of CH 3 OH while using UV light. The photoreduction process involves the adsorption of CO 2 by the reductant and on the surface of the photocatalyst, irradiation of the solution which leads to photoexcitation of electrons as a result of light absorption 56.The multi-step reaction pathway of the process splits into four parts: water splitting, formation of CO 2 radical, formation of CH 3 OH and HCOOH 57 and the photooxidation of methanol to methyl formate and its hydrolysis to formic acid 50.The photo-oxidation of methanol involves: CO 2 2H 2e A !HCOOH (6) The electron trapping capacity of copper doped on the photocatalyst and the production of photo-excited electron-hole pairs are listed in Eqs. ( 1)-( 3).This leads to an increase in lifetime of charges and fosters redox reaction at the surfaces.Reduction of CO 2 occurs at the CB by the activity of electrons and H 2 is oxidized by holes at the VB and this is kinetically explained in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Production of HCOOH and CH 3 OH through the photoreduction of CO 2 is shown in Eqs. ( 6) and (7).The Eqs. ( 8)-( 12) lists the reactions for photo-oxidation of CH 3 OH to HCOOH under UV light.Based on the photoactivity and reaction pathway, insights for the reaction mechanism were obtained.Upon effective light absorption, electrons from g-C 3 N 4 and Cu/TiO 2 are photoexcited.The photogenerated electrons followed a unique sequence for both UV and visible light.In the case of visible light, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 migrated to the CB of TiO 2 and from TiO 2 to Cu.For UV light, since the CB of g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of TiO 2 , migration from g-C 3 N 4 to TiO 2 will be impossible.However g-C 3 N 4 is also photoexcited by UV light irradiation as well.For both lights there was migration of holes from the VB of g-C 3 N 4 to that of TiO 2 .This is depicted by the direction of the arrows in Fig. 14(a) and (b).The movement of electrons to one catalyst (TiO 2 ) and holes to the other (g-C 3 N 4 ) fostered charge separation in the composite and reduced the rate of recombination.However, the transfer of extra photoinduced holes to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 caused an accumulation of photoinduced holes in g-C 3 N 4 since there was no migration of photoinduced electrons to CB of TiO 2 under UV light.This leads to a series of photo-oxidation reactions in g-C 3 N 4 under UV light.This photo-oxidation affected the yield of methanol from the process while using UV light.It is also possible that photoinduced electrons could photoreduce dissolved oxygen in the photoreaction to superoxide radical ( O 2 ) and this photoreduction of dissolved O 2 to O 2 A initiated the combination of the produced superoxide radical with H to give HOO .It is very unlikely for the photogenerated holes on its VB to react with absorbed water molecules to form hydroxyl radicals.The OH aids formation of CH 3 OH from the process, but in the case of UV light the migration of photogenerated holes to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 from the VB of TiO 2 could have resulted in low yield of methanol under UV light."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The maximum yield of both products were 2574 mmol/g.cat of CH 3 OH, 5069 mmol/g.cat of HCOOH under visible light and 614 mmol/g.cat of CH 3 OH and 6709 mmol/g.cat of HCOOH under UV light irradiations.", "context": "The g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 composite is an effective catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction and higher yield and selectivity of hydrocarbon products can be obtained from using it given the right conditions and set-up.The enhanced photoactivity and performance of the nanocomposite can be traced to the arrangement of the constituents of the composite which affected the mechanism of the photoreaction.The interaction between TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 combined in the appropriate ratio is another reason for the effectiveness of the composite.The combined efforts of both constituents helped to overcome limitations of the other hence deploying their fortes.The maximum yield of both products were 2574 mmol/g.cat of CH 3 OH, 5069 mmol/g.cat of HCOOH under visible light and 614 mmol/g.cat of CH 3 OH and 6709 mmol/g.cat of HCOOH under UV light irradiations.The role of the copper doped on TiO 2 could be deduced as follows: (1) created more active sites for adsorption of CO 2 , (2) increased photoactivity of TiO 2 to absorb and utilize visible light and (3) developed Schottky barrier to promote separation of electron and hole pairs hence inhibiting recombination.Although yield of the product was initially higher using UV light, the reaction was affected by photo-oxidation.Thus, visible light can be considered more effective and efficient for photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH using g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 ) composite as it gave the highest yield of both products and demonstrated better stability.The g-C 3 N 4 /(Cu/TiO 2 ) composite combined the strengths of g-C 3 N 4 , CuO and TiO 2 .This interaction in the heterostructure generally improved its photocatalytic activity making it a suitable visible light photocatalyst for effective CO 2 photoreduction.

Fig.11.It is obvious that modification of the catalysts with Cu metal confers a positive influence on the yield of the products.Considering the result in Fig.11(a), when copper is doped on g-C 3 N 4 (Cu/g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 ), the yield of CH 3 OH is low for both visible and UV light, but when it is doped on TiO 2 (g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 ) the yield of the products increase.It can be seen that doping Cu on TiO 2 could improve the efficiency and selectivity for CH 3 OH synthesis from CO 2 photoreduction37 as similarly reported elsewhere37.Another reason is that in the case of g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 , the loading of Cu on TiO 2 forms a Schottky barrier which inhibits electron-hole recombination36,38. Effective transfer of electrons and separation of charges is pertinent since recombination has been inhibited and is reflected in the performance of the catalyst as observed in Fig.11(a) and (b).Of all the composite ratios, 30:70 gives the optimal yield of CH 3 OH for both UV and visible light as a consequence of the interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 .This interaction improves charge carrier separation and prevents recombination.Considering Fig.11(b), the highest yield of HCOOH is from 3 Cu/TiO 2 (S2) consistent with that obtained from previous research on CO 2 reduction36.The effect of time on the yield of the products for the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite while using both UV and visible light is represented in Fig.12.It is observed that the yield of CH 3 OH after 8 h for visible light is higher than that of UV light at the same time.As seen from Fig.12(a), the yield of CH 3 OH under visible light increases but decreases under UV light.Meanwhile, contrary to what is observed in Fig.12a, the yield of HCOOH increases under UV light in Fig.11(b).The decreasing yield of CH 3 OH and increasing yield of HCOOH for UV light can be traced to three different possibilities.The first is photo-oxidation of methanol under UV light.When the composite photocatalyst is irradiated with UV light both TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 experience photoexcitation39.Since the CB of g-C 3 N 4 is more negative than that of TiO 2 , photoinduced electrons from g-C 3 N 4 can easily migrate to TiO 240.Similarly, since the VB value of TiO 2 is more positive than that of g-C 3 N 4 , it is easier for photoinduced holes from TiO 2 to migrate to g-C 3 N 4 through the layer where the heterojunction was formed39.However, the transfer of extra photoinduced holes from the TiO 2 to g-C 3 N 4 will cause a pile-up and this leads to a series of photo-oxidation reactions in g-C 3 N 441,42.The second possibility is for photoinduced electrons to reduce dissolved oxygen in the photoreaction to superoxide radical ( O 2 A).This photoreduction of dissolved O 2 to O 2 -initiates a chain of reactions-one of them being the combination of the produced superoxide radical with H to give HOO39,43.Lastly, g-C 3 N 4 has a VB more negative than the electrode potential of H 2 O/ OH (2.7 eV) which means that it is very unlikely for photogenerated Fig. 12.Effect of irradiation time against product yield over g-C 3 N 4 /(3Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite (a) Yield of CH 3 OH for UV and visible light against irradiation time (b) Yield of HCOOH for UV and visible light against irradiation time.

Fig.11.It is obvious that modification of the catalysts with Cu metal confers a positive influence on the yield of the products.Considering the result in Fig.11(a), when copper is doped on g-C 3 N 4 (Cu/g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 ), the yield of CH 3 OH is low for both visible and UV light, but when it is doped on TiO 2 (g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 ) the yield of the products increase.It can be seen that doping Cu on TiO 2 could improve the efficiency and selectivity for CH 3 OH synthesis from CO 2 photoreduction37 as similarly reported elsewhere37.Another reason is that in the case of g-C 3 N 4 /Cu/TiO 2 , the loading of Cu on TiO 2 forms a Schottky barrier which inhibits electron-hole recombination36,38. Effective transfer of electrons and separation of charges is pertinent since recombination has been inhibited and is reflected in the performance of the catalyst as observed in Fig.11(a) and (b).Of all the composite ratios, 30:70 gives the optimal yield of CH 3 OH for both UV and visible light as a consequence of the interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 .This interaction improves charge carrier separation and prevents recombination.Considering Fig.11(b), the highest yield of HCOOH is from 3 Cu/TiO 2 (S2) consistent with that obtained from previous research on CO 2 reduction36.The effect of time on the yield of the products for the g-C 3 N 4 /(3 Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite while using both UV and visible light is represented in Fig.12.It is observed that the yield of CH 3 OH after 8 h for visible light is higher than that of UV light at the same time.As seen from Fig.12(a), the yield of CH 3 OH under visible light increases but decreases under UV light.Meanwhile, contrary to what is observed in Fig.12a, the yield of HCOOH increases under UV light in Fig.11(b).The decreasing yield of CH 3 OH and increasing yield of HCOOH for UV light can be traced to three different possibilities.The first is photo-oxidation of methanol under UV light.When the composite photocatalyst is irradiated with UV light both TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 experience photoexcitation39.Since the CB of g-C 3 N 4 is more negative than that of TiO 2 , photoinduced electrons from g-C 3 N 4 can easily migrate to TiO 240.Similarly, since the VB value of TiO 2 is more positive than that of g-C 3 N 4 , it is easier for photoinduced holes from TiO 2 to migrate to g-C 3 N 4 through the layer where the heterojunction was formed39.However, the transfer of extra photoinduced holes from the TiO 2 to g-C 3 N 4 will cause a pile-up and this leads to a series of photo-oxidation reactions in g-C 3 N 441,42.The second possibility is for photoinduced electrons to reduce dissolved oxygen in the photoreaction to superoxide radical ( O 2 A).This photoreduction of dissolved O 2 to O 2 -initiates a chain of reactions-one of them being the combination of the produced superoxide radical with H to give HOO39,43.Lastly, g-C 3 N 4 has a VB more negative than the electrode potential of H 2 O/ OH (2.7 eV) which means that it is very unlikely for photogenerated Fig. 12.Effect of irradiation time against product yield over g-C 3 N 4 /(3Cu/TiO 2 ) (30:70) composite (a) Yield of CH 3 OH for UV and visible light against irradiation time (b) Yield of HCOOH for UV and visible light against irradiation time.

The crystalline structure of the catalysts were ascertained by Xray diffraction (XRD) recorded on a powder diffractometer (Bruker Advance D8, 40 kV, 40 mA) using a Cu Ka radiation source in 2u range 5-80 with a step size of 0.05 and counting time of 5 s.The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of the sample was recorded on a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 FTIR spectrometer.The surface morphology was examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM JEOL model JSM-6700F, Japan).The specific surface area and pore diameters were measured by a Thermo scientific Surfer analyzer with nitrogen sorption at 77 K, degassing at 250 C for 4 h and analyzed by the Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method.The Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflection spectra of the samples were determined using a Shimadzu UV 3101PC UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer.The band gap energies of the photocatalysts were determined by using the Kubelka-Munk theory of reflectance and extrapolating from its plot.The charge recombination rate was measured using a Perkin Elmer LS 55 Luminescence Spectrophotometer.In order to determine the chemical composition of the catalyst a Shimadzu Axis Ultra DLD X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy was used.The photocatalyst was fixed to the sample holder using a carbon tape.The pass energy used for the survey spectra was 160 eV while that of the high resolution was 20 eV.The survey spectra were recorded in the range of 0-1200 eV.The structure of the samples were analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL), operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The photocatalytic reaction was conducted in two different setups; one for the UV-light photoreaction and the other for visible light reaction as depicted in Fig. 1.The UV light photoreaction process was carried out in a jacketed Pyrex glass slurry photoreactor with a total volume of 500 mL.Cooling water from a chiller was passed through the jacketed wall of the reactor to control the temperature.CO 2 is fed into the slurry photoreactor through a gas inlet pipe at the top and gas products flowed out through an outlet pipe drawn into the reactor from the top.The light source radiated into the slurry photoreactor through a lamp compartment which extended into the reactor from the top.A 254 nm UV lamp (UVP 90-0004-01 3SC9 Pen-Ray Mercury gas Lamp) with an intensity of 5.4 mW/cm 2 was used as the light source.The temperature of the reactor was maintained at 25 C by circulating cold water from a chiller.0.2 g of the as-prepared photocatalyst was dissolved in 400 mL of 1 M NaOH inside the slurry type photoreactor using a magnetic stirrer.The gas inlet port is connected to the reactor while the gas outlet port comes from the reactor for gas samples to be collected.The compressed gas (CO 2 purity 99.99) was regulated using a mass flow controller. The visible light photoreaction consisted of a reactor made from Pyrex glass of total volume of 250 mL.The quartz cold trap (QW220, China) was a double-jacketed Pyrex glass vessel having a hollow and two angled joints for cooling water inlet and outlet.A 500 W, 22 cm long arc Xe-lamp tube (PLS-LAX500ADJ, Perfect light Technology Co., Ltd.) was employed as the visible light source.The xenon lamp was placed inside the hollow of the cold trap for cooling the heat generated from the lamp and to filter infrared heat.0.1 g of the catalyst and 200 mL of 1.0 M NaOH solution was fed into the reactor.In order to purge the reactors and for saturation of CO 2 in the reaction medium, pure CO 2 gas was injected into the solution in each set-up for 30 min at a flow rate of 20 mL/min with the UV or visible light switched off.The solution was then irradiated using the light source for each set-up and samples were withdrawn every 2 h interval using a syringe.The drawn samples were filtered using a 0.45 mm filter in order to remove particles of the catalyst. The products were analysed and measured using a Perkin Elmer GC Auto system XL Gas Chromatograph equipped with a Flame Ionization detector (FID) and a DB-WAX Column.Helium was used as the carrier gas for GC.The initial temperature of the oven was 40 C for 5 min, ramped from 20 C to 180 C and the held-up for 5 min.The sample ran for 17 min in the GC with FID injector temperature at 250 C while maximum FID detector temperature was 350 C. The quantification of obtained products was conducted by the use of an external standard (99 purity absolute methanol, 85 purity formic acid, Merck) using a calibration curve."}], "operation mode": []}}
