The FE-SEM images regarding ZnO samples are illustrated in Fig. 3a-c.The surface scanning of Zn300 appeared as a flower-like shape as seen in Fig. 3a.In the meantime, further investigations of the FE-SEM images revealed that by increasing the calcination temperature of ZnO preparation to 350 and 400 C, ZnO loses its flower-like morphological structure as clearly observed in Fig. 3b,3c.In that case, Zn350 has shown a pyramidal-like structure while Zn400 presented as irregular shapes. Moreover, ZnO fine details were inspected by HR-TEM as shown in Fig. 4a-f.The investigation evidently confirmed the fabrication of monodispersed hexagonal phases of ZnO nanoparticles in all samples, which is well consistent with XRD examination.Moreover, the particles' agglomeration of ZnO sample was furtherly decreased by increasing the synthesis temperature, which increasing the monodispersity of ZnO nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 4a,c,e. According to SAED analysis, Zn350 showed the best polycrystalline nature among all other samples as seen in Fig. 4d.The SAED pattern in Zn400 revealed a medium polycrystalline nature compared to other prepared ZnO samples as seen in Fig. 4f, which agrees with XRD diffraction. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of ZnO samples are illustrated in Fig. 5. ZnO nanoparticles reveals a characteristic absorption peak at max 357, 355, 355, and 352 nm for Zn300, Zn350, Zn400, and C, respectively as seen in Fig. 5a 18.The red shift of the prepared ZnO samples, in addition to higher absorption, revealing a better light harvesting ability than commercial ZnO.Besides, the calculated bandgap of ZnO samples was 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, and 3.21 eV for Zn300, Zn350, Zn400, and C, respectively as illustrated in Fig. 5b.Fig. 6 illustrates the photoluminescence spectrum (PL) of ZnO samples.ZnO exhibited emission bands in various portions in the visible light region.This emission behavior, termed as defect level bands, represents multiple defects stats in ZnO surface 19.The blue emission is linked to the presence of zinc interstitial (Zni) that acts as shallow donor trap sites that positioned beneath the CB of ZnO 20.The green emission was associated with oxygen-deficient sites (VO) in ZnO lattice.Vo create a deep level trap sites above the VB that capture hole carriers and/or as an electrons generation site 21.Accordingly, the cut off in the maximum PL intensity for commercial ZnO (C) indicates a very poor photocatalytic behavior via rapid recombination between photogenerated charges (not shown here).In contrast, the low emission peaks of the asprepared ZnO samples indicates a much better photocatalytic response through electron and hole J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f separation.Apparently, Zn300 supposed to be the best catalyst towards the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 followed by Zn350 then Zn400. The elemental composition of ZnO catalysts was verified and approved by XPS.As illustrated in Fig. 7a-c eV that corresponds to Zn species 22.Moreover, the O 1s spectra for all ZnO samples revealed the observation of two signals.The O 1s signals at 530.21, 530.9, and 530.36 eV according Zn300, Zn350, and Zn400 respectively were ascribed to lattice oxygen in ZnO as seen in Fig. 7d-f 23.Further, the O 1s signals at 531.15 and 531.79 eV for Zn300 and Zn400 respectively (Fig. 7d,f) were assigned to Vo in the samples 24, however the O 1s signal at 532.5 eV for Zn350 was due to the presence of hydroxide ion OH -on its surface Fig.7e 25,26.The general shift of Vo signal in Zn400 to higher binding energy indicates the state of highly defected-ZnO lattice, which is well consistence with FE-SEM analysis.Oxygen vacancies improve the inhibition of charge carriers recombination, narrowing the bandgap, and promoting the catalyst to reap more of the incident photons, which could be a good parameter for higher photocatalytic activity towards CO2 photoreduction 27. Raman and FTIR analysis were performed to furtherly investigate the existence of oxygen vacancies.Fig. 8a displays the Raman spectra of ZnO samples.The strong signal, which is clearly spotted at 435.85 cm -1 for all samples, was referred to E2H active mode, demonstrating the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO structure and affirms previous characterization results 19.Besides, the spotted peaks at 329.84 and 380.35 cm -1 were attributed to the E2H-E2L and A1(TO) multiphonon modes, respectively.However, the characteristic emerged signal at 574.58 cm -1 is standing for the A1(LO) vibration, which reveals the presence of oxygen vacancies in ZnO lattice and strongly confirms the data acquired from the PL and XPS description 28.However, it was noted that the oxygen vacancy signal of Zn350 was much weaker than that of the other ZnO samples.Furthermore, FTIR detected oxygen vacancy defects in ZnO lattice as seen in Fig. 8b. An oxygen vacancy related signal was emerged at 500 cm -1 in ZnO lattice, which was stronger in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f both Zn300 and Zn400 than in Zn350 29.These inferences approve the formation of a well crystalline Zn350, which agreed with XRD and XPS characterization. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over commercial ZnO sample shows no detection of liquid products in all aqueous solutions, which discloses a negative photocatalytic activity towards CO2 reduction. Fig. 9a-c illustrates the hydrocarbon compounds that generated over ZnO samples using NaHCO3 aqueous solution.Zn300 showed the formation of 52 mol g -1 of CH3OH, besides the generation of CH3CHO with a production yield of 12.2 mol g -1 as shown in fig.9a.However, as depicted in Fig. 9b, greater production of CH3OH of 113 mol g -1 along with a slightly lower amount of CH3CHO 11 mol g -1 was attained over Zn350 (Figure S2).On the other hand, Zn400 demonstrated the lowest performance in NaHCO3 solution with the formation of 5.3 mol g -1 of CH3OH and 8 mol g -1 of CH3CHO as illustrated in Fig. 9c.However, in NaOH, as illustrated in Fig. 10a, the performance of Zn300 declared a higher production of CH3OH 63.7 mol g -1 and a lower generation of CH3CHO of 10.7 mol g -1 . Nevertheless, upon using Zn350, CH3OH was produced after 1 h of irradiation with a maximum production yield of 22 mol g -1 then it was diminished, however, the generation of CH3CHO was slightly increased to 11.7 mol g -1 as shown in Fig. 10b.On the other hand, Zn400 showed a production yield of CH3OH and CH3CHO of 50.9 mol g -1 and 11.6 mol g -1 , respectively as shown in Fig. 10c. CO2 photoreduction was furtherly investigated in NaCl aqueous solution.Apparently, CH3CHO production has been improved over ZnO surfaces in 0.5 M NaCl, implying the role of Cl -to facilitate the C-C coupling reaction.As indicated in Fig. 11a, Zn300 exhibited greater photocatalytic performance for CH3OH and CH3CHO formation in NaCl (Figure S3).The production yield of CH3OH and CH3CHO over Zn300 was 95.4 mol g -1 and 19.5 mol g -1 , respectively.Although the generation of methanol was clearly observed after 2 h of irradiation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f via using Zn350, the formation of CH3CHO was considerably enhanced (Figure S2).Thus, the production yield of CH3OH and CH3CHO over Zn350 were 10.9 and 16 mol g -1 , respectively (Fig. 11b).Surprisingly, CO2 photoreduction over Zn400 revealed no significant activity in NaCl solution (Figure S4). According to our previous study 30, the existence of HCO3 -ions in the reaction medium ought to increase the selectivity towards CH3OH production than OH -or Cl -ions, in addition to the high charge/carriers separation.The highest methanol yield which was obtained by using Zn350 might be explained by the inclusion of adsorbed OH -species on ZnO surface, which was approved by XPS data.The adsorbed OH -may transfer its electron into a hole carrier in an oxygen vacant site forming OH radical that facilitate CH3OH formation 31.However, this predicted mechanism is not significant with both NaOH and NaCl.The high amounts and agglomeration of OH -ions in NaOH solution on the surface of Zn350 may reduce CO2 adsorption which may lead to a lower photocatalytic performance.In addition, the same trend has been noticed in NaCl, where Cl -ions obstruct the transfer of electrons from OH -by scavenging hole carriers.On the other hand, CO2 photoreduction over Zn300 and Zn400 showed a dissimilar reaction route, in which the selectivity of CH3OH production increases in Cl -OH - HCO3 -order.This deduction could be attributed to the multiple oxygen vacant sites in Zn300 and Zn400.In addition to the anions' role to trap the photogenerated hole carriers 32,33, oxygen vacancies play either as electron trap sites or as recombination centers 34.In that case, the separation between photogenerated charge carriers would be enhanced, which makes it easier for the oxygen vacancies in the lattice to facilitate the electrons transfer to the adsorbed HCO3 - and CO3 2-intermediates on ZnO surface to initiate its reduction process.Unfortunately, no liquid products have been detected over Zn400 surface in NaCl solution.Hence, the excessive oxygen vacancies in Zn400 may become recombination centers that played a critical part in suppressing the photocatalytic behavior as previously confirmed by PL analysis 34.In general, the production rate of C2 product (acetaldehyde) is increasing in Cl -OH -HCO3 -order, which confirms the scavenging effect of OH -and Cl -ions to provide more electrons for the generation of acetaldehyde through C-C coupling reaction.and Zn350 get energized and bounce from the edge of VB to that of the CB, which then are captured through oxygen vacant site causing an increase in the photocatalytic activity as shown in Fig. 12a.In the case of Zn400, the excess oxygen vacancies regions performed as recombination centers, which triggered a great decrease in the photocatalytic activity (Fig. 12b). Fig. 13 shows the maximum photocatalytic yield of all samples using different anions.In addition, a comparison of recent CO2 photoreduction over ZnO was provided in Table 1."}, {"llm generation": "ZnO catalysts", "source": "The elemental composition of ZnO catalysts was verified and approved by XPS.", "context": "Fig. 2 shows the XRD of ZnO samples.ZnO samples calcined at 300, 350, and 400 C and are denoted as Zn300, Zn350, and Zn400, respectively.The XRD analysis evidently revealed the fabrication of a well crystalline wurtzite hexagonal configurations of ZnO.The diffracted signals that were observed at 2 31.8(100), 34.4 (002), 36.2(101), 47.5 (102), 56.6 (110), 62.9 (103), 66.4 (200), 67.9 (112), and 69.1 (201) are well matched with JCPDS card no.89-0510 16,17.In addition, no impurities have been detected in any of the samples. .

A homemade Pyrex glass photoreactor was designed to be used as the reactor chamber for CO2 photoreduction experiment as displayed in (Fig. 1).A 0.1 g of catalyst was dispersed into 50 ml of 0.5 M aqueous solution of (NaHCO3, NaOH, or NaCl) to conduct the photoreduction J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f experiments.Prior to the photoreduction experiment, the solution was continuously purged with CO2 (99.99) for 1 h in dark, followed by switching on the 150-Watt Hg lamp at a fixed intensity of 254 nm to initiate the photoreduction of CO2.The as-produced liquid hydrocarbon products from CO2 photoreduction process were detected by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry instrument (GC-MS, Thermoscientific, GC TRACE 1300 attached with TSQ 8000 model) and incorporated with a headspace unit.The separation of products was achieved using Trace TR-WaxMS GC column.GC oven was hold at 40 C for 5 min, and then it was raised at 10 C/min to 180 C for another 5 min.The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the produced hydrocarbons were measured by means of standard calibration curves of known concentrations of standard solutions (Figure S1)."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of ZnO samples are illustrated in Fig. 5.", "context": "Fig. 2 shows the XRD of ZnO samples.ZnO samples calcined at 300, 350, and 400 C and are denoted as Zn300, Zn350, and Zn400, respectively.The XRD analysis evidently revealed the fabrication of a well crystalline wurtzite hexagonal configurations of ZnO.The diffracted signals that were observed at 2 31.8(100), 34.4 (002), 36.2(101), 47.5 (102), 56.6 (110), 62.9 (103), 66.4 (200), 67.9 (112), and 69.1 (201) are well matched with JCPDS card no.89-0510 16,17.In addition, no impurities have been detected in any of the samples. . The FE-SEM images regarding ZnO samples are illustrated in Fig. 3a-c.The surface scanning of Zn300 appeared as a flower-like shape as seen in Fig. 3a.In the meantime, further investigations of the FE-SEM images revealed that by increasing the calcination temperature of ZnO preparation to 350 and 400 C, ZnO loses its flower-like morphological structure as clearly observed in Fig. 3b,3c.In that case, Zn350 has shown a pyramidal-like structure while Zn400 presented as irregular shapes. Moreover, ZnO fine details were inspected by HR-TEM as shown in Fig. 4a-f.The investigation evidently confirmed the fabrication of monodispersed hexagonal phases of ZnO nanoparticles in all samples, which is well consistent with XRD examination.Moreover, the particles' agglomeration of ZnO sample was furtherly decreased by increasing the synthesis temperature, which increasing the monodispersity of ZnO nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 4a,c,e. According to SAED analysis, Zn350 showed the best polycrystalline nature among all other samples as seen in Fig. 4d.The SAED pattern in Zn400 revealed a medium polycrystalline nature compared to other prepared ZnO samples as seen in Fig. 4f, which agrees with XRD diffraction. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of ZnO samples are illustrated in Fig. 5. ZnO nanoparticles reveals a characteristic absorption peak at max 357, 355, 355, and 352 nm for Zn300, Zn350, Zn400, and C, respectively as seen in Fig. 5a 18.The red shift of the prepared ZnO samples, in addition to higher absorption, revealing a better light harvesting ability than commercial ZnO.Besides, the calculated bandgap of ZnO samples was 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, and 3.21 eV for Zn300, Zn350, Zn400, and C, respectively as illustrated in Fig. 5b.Fig. 6 illustrates the photoluminescence spectrum (PL) of ZnO samples.ZnO exhibited emission bands in various portions in the visible light region.This emission behavior, termed as defect level bands, represents multiple defects stats in ZnO surface 19.The blue emission is linked to the presence of zinc interstitial (Zni) that acts as shallow donor trap sites that positioned beneath the CB of ZnO 20.The green emission was associated with oxygen-deficient sites (VO) in ZnO lattice.Vo create a deep level trap sites above the VB that capture hole carriers and/or as an electrons generation site 21.Accordingly, the cut off in the maximum PL intensity for commercial ZnO (C) indicates a very poor photocatalytic behavior via rapid recombination between photogenerated charges (not shown here).In contrast, the low emission peaks of the asprepared ZnO samples indicates a much better photocatalytic response through electron and hole J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f separation.Apparently, Zn300 supposed to be the best catalyst towards the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 followed by Zn350 then Zn400. The elemental composition of ZnO catalysts was verified and approved by XPS.As illustrated in Fig. 7a-c eV that corresponds to Zn species 22.Moreover, the O 1s spectra for all ZnO samples revealed the observation of two signals.The O 1s signals at 530.21, 530.9, and 530.36 eV according Zn300, Zn350, and Zn400 respectively were ascribed to lattice oxygen in ZnO as seen in Fig. 7d-f 23.Further, the O 1s signals at 531.15 and 531.79 eV for Zn300 and Zn400 respectively (Fig. 7d,f) were assigned to Vo in the samples 24, however the O 1s signal at 532.5 eV for Zn350 was due to the presence of hydroxide ion OH -on its surface Fig.7e 25,26.The general shift of Vo signal in Zn400 to higher binding energy indicates the state of highly defected-ZnO lattice, which is well consistence with FE-SEM analysis.Oxygen vacancies improve the inhibition of charge carriers recombination, narrowing the bandgap, and promoting the catalyst to reap more of the incident photons, which could be a good parameter for higher photocatalytic activity towards CO2 photoreduction 27. Raman and FTIR analysis were performed to furtherly investigate the existence of oxygen vacancies.Fig. 8a displays the Raman spectra of ZnO samples.The strong signal, which is clearly spotted at 435.85 cm -1 for all samples, was referred to E2H active mode, demonstrating the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO structure and affirms previous characterization results 19.Besides, the spotted peaks at 329.84 and 380.35 cm -1 were attributed to the E2H-E2L and A1(TO) multiphonon modes, respectively.However, the characteristic emerged signal at 574.58 cm -1 is standing for the A1(LO) vibration, which reveals the presence of oxygen vacancies in ZnO lattice and strongly confirms the data acquired from the PL and XPS description 28.However, it was noted that the oxygen vacancy signal of Zn350 was much weaker than that of the other ZnO samples.Furthermore, FTIR detected oxygen vacancy defects in ZnO lattice as seen in Fig. 8b. An oxygen vacancy related signal was emerged at 500 cm -1 in ZnO lattice, which was stronger in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f both Zn300 and Zn400 than in Zn350 29.These inferences approve the formation of a well crystalline Zn350, which agreed with XRD and XPS characterization. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over commercial ZnO sample shows no detection of liquid products in all aqueous solutions, which discloses a negative photocatalytic activity towards CO2 reduction. Fig. 9a-c illustrates the hydrocarbon compounds that generated over ZnO samples using NaHCO3 aqueous solution.Zn300 showed the formation of 52 mol g -1 of CH3OH, besides the generation of CH3CHO with a production yield of 12.2 mol g -1 as shown in fig.9a.However, as depicted in Fig. 9b, greater production of CH3OH of 113 mol g -1 along with a slightly lower amount of CH3CHO 11 mol g -1 was attained over Zn350 (Figure S2).On the other hand, Zn400 demonstrated the lowest performance in NaHCO3 solution with the formation of 5.3 mol g -1 of CH3OH and 8 mol g -1 of CH3CHO as illustrated in Fig. 9c.However, in NaOH, as illustrated in Fig. 10a, the performance of Zn300 declared a higher production of CH3OH 63.7 mol g -1 and a lower generation of CH3CHO of 10.7 mol g -1 . Nevertheless, upon using Zn350, CH3OH was produced after 1 h of irradiation with a maximum production yield of 22 mol g -1 then it was diminished, however, the generation of CH3CHO was slightly increased to 11.7 mol g -1 as shown in Fig. 10b.On the other hand, Zn400 showed a production yield of CH3OH and CH3CHO of 50.9 mol g -1 and 11.6 mol g -1 , respectively as shown in Fig. 10c. CO2 photoreduction was furtherly investigated in NaCl aqueous solution.Apparently, CH3CHO production has been improved over ZnO surfaces in 0.5 M NaCl, implying the role of Cl -to facilitate the C-C coupling reaction.As indicated in Fig. 11a, Zn300 exhibited greater photocatalytic performance for CH3OH and CH3CHO formation in NaCl (Figure S3).The production yield of CH3OH and CH3CHO over Zn300 was 95.4 mol g -1 and 19.5 mol g -1 , respectively.Although the generation of methanol was clearly observed after 2 h of irradiation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f via using Zn350, the formation of CH3CHO was considerably enhanced (Figure S2).Thus, the production yield of CH3OH and CH3CHO over Zn350 were 10.9 and 16 mol g -1 , respectively (Fig. 11b).Surprisingly, CO2 photoreduction over Zn400 revealed no significant activity in NaCl solution (Figure S4). According to our previous study 30, the existence of HCO3 -ions in the reaction medium ought to increase the selectivity towards CH3OH production than OH -or Cl -ions, in addition to the high charge/carriers separation.The highest methanol yield which was obtained by using Zn350 might be explained by the inclusion of adsorbed OH -species on ZnO surface, which was approved by XPS data.The adsorbed OH -may transfer its electron into a hole carrier in an oxygen vacant site forming OH radical that facilitate CH3OH formation 31.However, this predicted mechanism is not significant with both NaOH and NaCl.The high amounts and agglomeration of OH -ions in NaOH solution on the surface of Zn350 may reduce CO2 adsorption which may lead to a lower photocatalytic performance.In addition, the same trend has been noticed in NaCl, where Cl -ions obstruct the transfer of electrons from OH -by scavenging hole carriers.On the other hand, CO2 photoreduction over Zn300 and Zn400 showed a dissimilar reaction route, in which the selectivity of CH3OH production increases in Cl -OH - HCO3 -order.This deduction could be attributed to the multiple oxygen vacant sites in Zn300 and Zn400.In addition to the anions' role to trap the photogenerated hole carriers 32,33, oxygen vacancies play either as electron trap sites or as recombination centers 34.In that case, the separation between photogenerated charge carriers would be enhanced, which makes it easier for the oxygen vacancies in the lattice to facilitate the electrons transfer to the adsorbed HCO3 - and CO3 2-intermediates on ZnO surface to initiate its reduction process.Unfortunately, no liquid products have been detected over Zn400 surface in NaCl solution.Hence, the excessive oxygen vacancies in Zn400 may become recombination centers that played a critical part in suppressing the photocatalytic behavior as previously confirmed by PL analysis 34.In general, the production rate of C2 product (acetaldehyde) is increasing in Cl -OH -HCO3 -order, which confirms the scavenging effect of OH -and Cl -ions to provide more electrons for the generation of acetaldehyde through C-C coupling reaction.and Zn350 get energized and bounce from the edge of VB to that of the CB, which then are captured through oxygen vacant site causing an increase in the photocatalytic activity as shown in Fig. 12a.In the case of Zn400, the excess oxygen vacancies regions performed as recombination centers, which triggered a great decrease in the photocatalytic activity (Fig. 12b). Fig. 13 shows the maximum photocatalytic yield of all samples using different anions.In addition, a comparison of recent CO2 photoreduction over ZnO was provided in Table 1."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Mercury", "source": "Prior to the photoreduction experiment, the solution was continuously purged with CO2 (99.99) for 1 h in dark, followed by switching on the 150-Watt Hg lamp at a fixed intensity of 254 nm to initiate the photoreduction of CO2.", "context": "Zinc carbonate basic laborchemie Apolda, sodium bicarbonate ( 99.5, Sigma-Aldrich), Commercial ZnO (labeled as C), sodium hydroxide ( 99.5, Sigma-Aldrich), and sodium chloride (POCH 99.5) were used without any mandatory purification.

The FE-SEM images regarding ZnO samples are illustrated in Fig. 3a-c.The surface scanning of Zn300 appeared as a flower-like shape as seen in Fig. 3a.In the meantime, further investigations of the FE-SEM images revealed that by increasing the calcination temperature of ZnO preparation to 350 and 400 C, ZnO loses its flower-like morphological structure as clearly observed in Fig. 3b,3c.In that case, Zn350 has shown a pyramidal-like structure while Zn400 presented as irregular shapes.

The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of ZnO samples are illustrated in Fig. 5. ZnO nanoparticles reveals a characteristic absorption peak at max 357, 355, 355, and 352 nm for Zn300, Zn350, Zn400, and C, respectively as seen in Fig. 5a 18.The red shift of the prepared ZnO samples, in addition to higher absorption, revealing a better light harvesting ability than commercial ZnO.Besides, the calculated bandgap of ZnO samples was 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, and 3.21 eV for Zn300, Zn350, Zn400, and C, respectively as illustrated in Fig. 5b.Fig. 6 illustrates the photoluminescence spectrum (PL) of ZnO samples.ZnO exhibited emission bands in various portions in the visible light region.This emission behavior, termed as defect level bands, represents multiple defects stats in ZnO surface 19.The blue emission is linked to the presence of zinc interstitial (Zni) that acts as shallow donor trap sites that positioned beneath the CB of ZnO 20.The green emission was associated with oxygen-deficient sites (VO) in ZnO lattice.Vo create a deep level trap sites above the VB that capture hole carriers and/or as an electrons generation site 21.Accordingly, the cut off in the maximum PL intensity for commercial ZnO (C) indicates a very poor photocatalytic behavior via rapid recombination between photogenerated charges (not shown here).In contrast, the low emission peaks of the asprepared ZnO samples indicates a much better photocatalytic response through electron and hole J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f separation.Apparently, Zn300 supposed to be the best catalyst towards the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 followed by Zn350 then Zn400. The elemental composition of ZnO catalysts was verified and approved by XPS.As illustrated in Fig. 7a-c eV that corresponds to Zn species 22.Moreover, the O 1s spectra for all ZnO samples revealed the observation of two signals.The O 1s signals at 530.21, 530.9, and 530.36 eV according Zn300, Zn350, and Zn400 respectively were ascribed to lattice oxygen in ZnO as seen in Fig. 7d-f 23.Further, the O 1s signals at 531.15 and 531.79 eV for Zn300 and Zn400 respectively (Fig. 7d,f) were assigned to Vo in the samples 24, however the O 1s signal at 532.5 eV for Zn350 was due to the presence of hydroxide ion OH -on its surface Fig.7e 25,26.The general shift of Vo signal in Zn400 to higher binding energy indicates the state of highly defected-ZnO lattice, which is well consistence with FE-SEM analysis.Oxygen vacancies improve the inhibition of charge carriers recombination, narrowing the bandgap, and promoting the catalyst to reap more of the incident photons, which could be a good parameter for higher photocatalytic activity towards CO2 photoreduction 27. Raman and FTIR analysis were performed to furtherly investigate the existence of oxygen vacancies.Fig. 8a displays the Raman spectra of ZnO samples.The strong signal, which is clearly spotted at 435.85 cm -1 for all samples, was referred to E2H active mode, demonstrating the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO structure and affirms previous characterization results 19.Besides, the spotted peaks at 329.84 and 380.35 cm -1 were attributed to the E2H-E2L and A1(TO) multiphonon modes, respectively.However, the characteristic emerged signal at 574.58 cm -1 is standing for the A1(LO) vibration, which reveals the presence of oxygen vacancies in ZnO lattice and strongly confirms the data acquired from the PL and XPS description 28.However, it was noted that the oxygen vacancy signal of Zn350 was much weaker than that of the other ZnO samples.Furthermore, FTIR detected oxygen vacancy defects in ZnO lattice as seen in Fig. 8b. An oxygen vacancy related signal was emerged at 500 cm -1 in ZnO lattice, which was stronger in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f both Zn300 and Zn400 than in Zn350 29.These inferences approve the formation of a well crystalline Zn350, which agreed with XRD and XPS characterization. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over commercial ZnO sample shows no detection of liquid products in all aqueous solutions, which discloses a negative photocatalytic activity towards CO2 reduction. Fig. 9a-c illustrates the hydrocarbon compounds that generated over ZnO samples using NaHCO3 aqueous solution.Zn300 showed the formation of 52 mol g -1 of CH3OH, besides the generation of CH3CHO with a production yield of 12.2 mol g -1 as shown in fig.9a.However, as depicted in Fig. 9b, greater production of CH3OH of 113 mol g -1 along with a slightly lower amount of CH3CHO 11 mol g -1 was attained over Zn350 (Figure S2).On the other hand, Zn400 demonstrated the lowest performance in NaHCO3 solution with the formation of 5.3 mol g -1 of CH3OH and 8 mol g -1 of CH3CHO as illustrated in Fig. 9c.However, in NaOH, as illustrated in Fig. 10a, the performance of Zn300 declared a higher production of CH3OH 63.7 mol g -1 and a lower generation of CH3CHO of 10.7 mol g -1 . Nevertheless, upon using Zn350, CH3OH was produced after 1 h of irradiation with a maximum production yield of 22 mol g -1 then it was diminished, however, the generation of CH3CHO was slightly increased to 11.7 mol g -1 as shown in Fig. 10b.On the other hand, Zn400 showed a production yield of CH3OH and CH3CHO of 50.9 mol g -1 and 11.6 mol g -1 , respectively as shown in Fig. 10c. CO2 photoreduction was furtherly investigated in NaCl aqueous solution.Apparently, CH3CHO production has been improved over ZnO surfaces in 0.5 M NaCl, implying the role of Cl -to facilitate the C-C coupling reaction.As indicated in Fig. 11a, Zn300 exhibited greater photocatalytic performance for CH3OH and CH3CHO formation in NaCl (Figure S3).The production yield of CH3OH and CH3CHO over Zn300 was 95.4 mol g -1 and 19.5 mol g -1 , respectively.Although the generation of methanol was clearly observed after 2 h of irradiation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f via using Zn350, the formation of CH3CHO was considerably enhanced (Figure S2).Thus, the production yield of CH3OH and CH3CHO over Zn350 were 10.9 and 16 mol g -1 , respectively (Fig. 11b).Surprisingly, CO2 photoreduction over Zn400 revealed no significant activity in NaCl solution (Figure S4). According to our previous study 30, the existence of HCO3 -ions in the reaction medium ought to increase the selectivity towards CH3OH production than OH -or Cl -ions, in addition to the high charge/carriers separation.The highest methanol yield which was obtained by using Zn350 might be explained by the inclusion of adsorbed OH -species on ZnO surface, which was approved by XPS data.The adsorbed OH -may transfer its electron into a hole carrier in an oxygen vacant site forming OH radical that facilitate CH3OH formation 31.However, this predicted mechanism is not significant with both NaOH and NaCl.The high amounts and agglomeration of OH -ions in NaOH solution on the surface of Zn350 may reduce CO2 adsorption which may lead to a lower photocatalytic performance.In addition, the same trend has been noticed in NaCl, where Cl -ions obstruct the transfer of electrons from OH -by scavenging hole carriers.On the other hand, CO2 photoreduction over Zn300 and Zn400 showed a dissimilar reaction route, in which the selectivity of CH3OH production increases in Cl -OH - HCO3 -order.This deduction could be attributed to the multiple oxygen vacant sites in Zn300 and Zn400.In addition to the anions' role to trap the photogenerated hole carriers 32,33, oxygen vacancies play either as electron trap sites or as recombination centers 34.In that case, the separation between photogenerated charge carriers would be enhanced, which makes it easier for the oxygen vacancies in the lattice to facilitate the electrons transfer to the adsorbed HCO3 - and CO3 2-intermediates on ZnO surface to initiate its reduction process.Unfortunately, no liquid products have been detected over Zn400 surface in NaCl solution.Hence, the excessive oxygen vacancies in Zn400 may become recombination centers that played a critical part in suppressing the photocatalytic behavior as previously confirmed by PL analysis 34.In general, the production rate of C2 product (acetaldehyde) is increasing in Cl -OH -HCO3 -order, which confirms the scavenging effect of OH -and Cl -ions to provide more electrons for the generation of acetaldehyde through C-C coupling reaction.and Zn350 get energized and bounce from the edge of VB to that of the CB, which then are captured through oxygen vacant site causing an increase in the photocatalytic activity as shown in Fig. 12a.In the case of Zn400, the excess oxygen vacancies regions performed as recombination centers, which triggered a great decrease in the photocatalytic activity (Fig. 12b). Fig. 13 shows the maximum photocatalytic yield of all samples using different anions.In addition, a comparison of recent CO2 photoreduction over ZnO was provided in Table 1."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "A 0.1 g of catalyst was dispersed into 50 ml of 0.5 M aqueous solution of (NaHCO3, NaOH, or NaCl) to conduct the photoreduction J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f experiments.Prior to the photoreduction experiment, the solution was continuously purged with CO2 (99.99) for 1 h in dark, followed by switching on the 150-Watt Hg lamp at a fixed intensity of 254 nm to initiate the photoreduction of CO2.", "context": "Zinc carbonate basic laborchemie Apolda, sodium bicarbonate ( 99.5, Sigma-Aldrich), Commercial ZnO (labeled as C), sodium hydroxide ( 99.5, Sigma-Aldrich), and sodium chloride (POCH 99.5) were used without any mandatory purification.
