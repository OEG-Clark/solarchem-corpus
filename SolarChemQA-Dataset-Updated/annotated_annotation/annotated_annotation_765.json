Photoelectrochemical measurements including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photocurrent responses analysis were measured on an electrochemical system (CHI 660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd.China).A typical three-electrode was immersed in a 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution.Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass covered by the prepared sample was employed as the working electrode, while Pt and Ag/AgCl electrodes were employed as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively.The working electrode was obtained by the following steps: the prepared sample (10 mg) was dispersed into a mixed solution of ethanol (1 mL) and nafion (20 L, 5), then the mixture was ultrasonically dispersed for 2 h.After that, 0.1 mL slurry was dropped on the surface of FTO glass (1 1 cm).After evaporation of ethanol, the photocatalyst was uniformly attached to the FTO glass.EIS and photocurrent measurements were taken with a 300 W Xenon lamp. A typical photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment was conducted in a gas-enclosed circulation system with a 500 mL reactor purchased from Perfect Light Company (Beijing, China).A 300 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the light source during the operation.In a standard experimental procedure, 50 mg photocatalyst was mixed with 100 mL deionized water under appropriate magnetic stirring to achieve the uniform dispersion.Before light irradiation, the suspension was firstly subjected to a vacuum treatment, then pure CO 2 (99.999) was introduced into the reaction vessel under the control of a mass flow meter, and the pressure were maintained at 100 kPa for 30 min to achieve the balance of adsorption-desorption.The temperature was controlled at 25C during the entire experiment.During the reaction process, 0.15 mL of gas was collected from the glass chamber every hour, and the carbon-based evaporation product was specifically identified by a gas chromatography (GC-2010 Plus, SHIMADZU, Japan)."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "In a standard experimental procedure, 50 mg photocatalyst was mixed with 100 mL deionized water under appropriate magnetic stirring to achieve the uniform dispersion.", "context": "Urea (H 2 NCONH 3 ), acetone (CH 3 COCH 3 ), sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate (Na 2 S 2 O 3 5H 2 O) and bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi (NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Corp, P.
