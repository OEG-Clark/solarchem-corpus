99.7) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.Hydrogen peroxide, H 2 O 2 (30.0) and concentrated sulfuric acid, H 2 SO 4 (95-97) were supplied by Chemolab.Hydrochloric acid, HCl (37 diluted to 10) was supplied by Merck.All chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and were used as received without further purification.Deionized water (DI-H 2 O) was used in all experiments. Using graphite powder as the starting material, graphite oxide was prepared using the modified Hummers' Method 373839.In detail, 3 g of graphite powder was added into a mixture consisting of 12 mL H 2 SO 4 , 2.5 g P 2 O 5 and 2.5 g K 2 S 2 O 8 , heated at 80 C. The mixture was kept under continuous magnetic stirring for 4.5 h at the same temperature, and was subsequently allowed to cool to ambient temperature.After diluting with 500 mL of DI-H 2 O, the mixture was filtered and washed repeatedly with DI-H 2 O until the pH of the filtrate became neutral.The product was then dried in an air oven overnight.Next, the pre-oxidized graphite was dispersed into 120 mL of H 2 SO 4 in an ice bath.15 g of KMnO 4 was slowly added under continuous magnetic stirring while maintaining the temperature below 20 C.After stirring for 2 h, the mixture was gradually diluted with 250 mL of DI-H 2 O in an ice bath to keep the temperature below 50 C.After an additional 2 h of stirring, the solution was further diluted with 700 mL of DI-H 2 O, followed by introducing 20 mL of H 2 O 2 .The mixture was filtered and washed with 1 L of HCl and 1 L of DI-H 2 O. Finally, the precipitate was dried in an air oven at 60 C for 24 h, producing graphite oxide. The fabrication of O 2 -TiO 2 have been reported in our previous work 18.In brief, TBOT was added into DI-H 2 O chilled to 0 C, resulting in an immediate precipitation of hydrolyzed titanium species.After filtration and washing with 1 L of DI-H 2 O, the precipitate was added into a mixture containing 100 mL DI-H 2 O and 80 mL H 2 O 2 , forming an orange colored peroxo-titanate complex.The solution was subsequently heated at 50 C for 3 h and dried in an air oven at 100 C overnight.The yellowish solid material was then calcined in air at 300 C for 2 h with a temperature ramping rate of 10 C/min.Control TiO 2 was prepared using a similar procedure without the addition of H 2 O 2 as oxygen precursor. The binary composite of GO-OTiO 2 was synthesized through a simple wet impregnation method.To attain GO sheets, a precalculated amount of graphite oxide was dispersed into 80 mL of DI-H 2 O and ultrasonicated for 1.5 h to exfoliate and separate the graphitic layers.Next, 0.5 g of O 2 -TiO 2 was introduced into the GO aqueous solution.After stirring for 1 h, the solution was heated to 80 C for 2 h, and then dried in an air oven overnight before characterization.The synthesis procedure is illustrated in Fig. 1.The GO content studied was 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt. with respect to O 2 -TiO 2 .GO-control TiO 2 (GO-TiO 2 ) was also prepared using a similar approach. The structural features and elemental composition of all photocatalysts were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Hitachi SU8010) equipped with an Oxford-Horiba Inca XMax50 energy dispersive X-ray (EDX).The specimen for FESEM analysis was prepared by depositing a drop of diluted suspension in ethanol on a silicon wafer.High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were taken with a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope operating at 200 kV.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples were prepared by depositing a drop of diluted suspension in ethanol on a lacey-film-coated copper grid.X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were attained on a Bruker D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu-K radiation ( 0.154056 nm) at a scan rate of 0.02 s -1 .The accelerating voltage and applied current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) wide and narrow scan spectra were acquired using PHI Quantera II, equipped with an Al K X-ray source (1486.6 eV) at 10 mA, 15 kV, analyzing under 2.4 10 -6 Pa ultra-vacuum environment.The spectra were obtained using vision software which included vision manager and vision processing.All spectra were charge corrected by means of adventitious carbon signal (C 1s) at 284.8 eV.High resolution peaks were deconvoluted using Gaussian-Lorentzian functions with identical full width at half maximum (FWHM) after a Shirley background subtraction.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorbance spectra were acquired using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 100) equipped with an integrated sphere.The absorbance spectra were analyzed under ambient temperature in the wavelength ranging from 200-800 nm.The band gap energies of the photocatalysts were estimated from the Kubelka-Munk (KM) function, F(R) and the extrapolation of the Tauc plot F(R)hv 1/2 to the abscissa of photon energy, hv.Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out at room temperature by a 325 nm He-Cd laser as the excitation light source using Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope.The emission spectra were recorded from 400-800 nm. The photocatalytic activities of the developed GO-OTiO 2 binary nanocomposites were studied in a CO 2 photoreduction system at ambient condition in a continuous gas flow reactor as reported in our previous work 5,18.The CO 2 photoreduction process was performed under visible light irradiation with a maximum light intensity of 15 W using energy-saving daylight bulbs (Philips, TOR-NADO 15W WW E27 220-240 V 1CT).The as-prepared samples were coated onto glass rods using double-sided tape and fixed into quartz tubes, which were then placed under the irradiation of visible light.The amount of photocatalyst used was held constant in all runs.After loading the photocatalyst-coated glass rods, highly pure CO 2 (99.99) was bubbled through water to produce a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor into the photoreactor at atmospheric pressure.Before switching on the light source, wet CO 2 was permitted to flow through the photoreactor at 30 mL/min for 30 min to eliminate any excess air and to ensure the complete adsorption of gas molecules.After purging the reactor with wet CO 2 , the visible light source was switched on and the CO 2 photoreduction process was conducted at 5 mL/min using a mass flow controller.The average intensity of the light source was measured to be 8.5 mW cm -2 by using a pyranometer (Kipp and Zonen type CMP 6).The distance between the light source and the photoreactor was measured to be about 5 cm.The product gas generated from the CO 2 photoreduction process was collected at 1-h intervals and was analysed by a GC (Agilent 7890A) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The entire photoreaction system was enclosed within a black box to avoid any interference of light source from the surrounding.The total yield of CH 4 gas was calculated using Eq. ( 1).
