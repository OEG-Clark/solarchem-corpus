The morphology and microstructure of the as-synthesized samples are investigated by SEM, TEM, HRTEM, and TEM-EDX, as exhibited in Fig. 3 and Figs.S1-2.From Fig. S1, it can be seen that the MgIn 2 S 4 is characterized by microsphere composed of nanosheets.The introduction of Sn dopant has not made an obvious difference to the morphology of MgIn 2 S 4 .The TEM images in Fig. 3a andb and Fig. S2 further confirm that the microsphere of as-prepared sample is an aggregation of nanosheets.For the HRTEM image in Fig. 3c, Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample displays clear lattice fringes with lattice plane spacing of 0.321 nm and 0.318 nm, which can be contributed to the typical (113) facets.The result of TEM-EDX reflects the existence of Mg, Sn, In, and S atoms (Fig. 3d). The photocatalytic activities of as-prepared samples were evaluated by the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment.As shown in Fig. 4a, CO 2 can be photo-reduced to CO and CH 4 in the presence of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 samples.The Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 samples exhibit markedly enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity compared with pristine MgIn 2 S 4 .With enlarging the content of Sn dopant, the CO 2 conversion rate first ascends, achieving the maximum rate at Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample, and then decrease because excess metal ion dopant would act as the center of electron-hole recombination 27.After illumination for 4 h, the highest yield of CO and CH 4 is 1.70 and 0.13 umol/g, which is about 3.35 and 3.33 times higher than that of pristine MgIn 2 S 4 (the yield of CO and CH 4 is 0.39 and 0.03 umol/g), respectively.The Table S1 portrays the performance comparison of different photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To verify the selectivity of product formation from CO 2 reduction over Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample by using other scavenger, we conduct the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment under the same conditions just substituting triethylamine for TEOA, and the time dependence of CH 4 and CO yields for photo-reduction of CO 2 over Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample is shown in Fig. S4.The products using triethylamine as scavenger are CO and CH 4 , while the yield of CO is lower than that using TEOA as scavenger, but the yield of CH 4 is higher than that using TEOA as scavenger.Particularly, in the blank experiments, neither CO or CH 4 is produced and detected without photocatalyst, or without irradiation, or substitute CO 2 gas with nitrogen gas.Furthermore, as corroborated by the isotopic experiment using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 (Fig. 4b), the m/z at 45, 17, and 29 on the GC-MS spectra can be attributed to 13 CO 2 , 13 CH 4 , and 13 CO, respectively.Thus, it can be confirmed that the CO and CH 4 are derived from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction over Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample, rather than the decomposition of any organic impurity. Besides the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of semiconductor photocatalysts, the stability and recyclability are also pivotal for practical applications, which is evaluated by conducting three-run cycling CO 2 photoreduction experiments.After three successive cycles, as shown in Fig. 4c, the Sn-MgIn2S4-2 sample maintains over 60 of its photocatalytic activity in photo-reducing CO 2 to generate both CO and CH 4 .In addition, it can be found from Fig. 4d and Fig. S5 that no obvious variations of XRD pattern and SEM image for Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample between before and after photoreaction can be detected.These results imply the favorable photostability of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample, which is beneficial for its potential practical application.The specific surface areas (S BET ) of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples are determined to be 73.9 and 40.1 m 2 /g based on the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method (Fig. S6).Generally, a higher surface area of semiconductor photocatalysts implies the more active sites exposed for CO 2 adsorption and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, which is be advantageous for the photocatalysis performance 36.Although the S BET of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 is smaller than that of MgIn 2 S 4 , the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 do reveal the important positive effect of Sn dopant.We also measure the CO 2 adsorption ability of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples, which is crucial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to hydrocarbons 26.As shown in Fig. 5a, the introduction of Sn dopant would strengthen the CO 2 adsorption capacity.Moreover, during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, water serve as the electron donor and a proton source, suggesting that the contact degree between photocatalyst and water has an impact on the CO 2 photoconversion efficiency 37.The static water contact-angle measurement of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples are examined, as exhibited in Fig. S7.It can be found that the contact angle of these two samples is not significantly different, so the contact degree is not the cause of the enhancement for photocatalytic activity. The separation and migration efficiency of photo-generate charges are critical to the photocatalysis performance over semiconductor photocatalysts.The EIS Nynquist plots, transient photocurrent responses, and PL spectra of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples are measured and displayed in Fig. 5b-d.For EIS Nynquist plots (Fig. 5b), the sharply reduced arc radius of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 compared with MgIn 2 S 4 can be detected.In general, the smaller EIS Nynquist plots is, the higher charge transfer efficiency is 38.The Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample exhibits a remarkable enhanced current density in relative to that of MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 5c), while the higher current density represents a better charge separation efficiency 39.The photoluminescence emission (PL) intensity of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 is lower than that of MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 5d), demonstrating a lower charge recombination rate over Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 40.According to the above measurement results, it can be inferred that Sn 2 doping in MgIn 2 S 4 can effectively promote the separation and transportation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, so enhancing photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity. DFT calculations are carried out to try to understand how the Sn dopants alter the photocatalytic performance of MgIn 2 S 4 .In the light of the XPS results (Fig. 2), the Sn-doped MgIn 2 S 4 is modelled by replacing one Mg atom with one Sn atom in the unit cell, as shown in Fig. 6a andb.Table .S2 exhibits that Sn doping has little effect on the structure of MgIn 2 S 4 , and the lattice parameter increases slightly from 10.90 A for MgIn 2 S 4 to 10.97 A for Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 , which is due to the larger atomic radius of Sn elements.The main factors affecting the photocatalytic conversion efficiency are the light absorption range of photocatalytic materials and the separation and utilization efficiency of photogenerated carriers.The band structure results exhibit that Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 has a narrower bandgap (0.69 eV) than MgIn 2 S 4 (1.74 eV) (Fig. 6c and Fig. S8c), and noticeably, the band structure changes from the direct band gap to indirect band gap.For indirect band materials, the momentum between the CBM and VBM is mismatch.The recombination between electrons and holes must conserve momentum, so, for semiconductor photocatalyst, the indirect-transition of band structure can significantly reduce charge recombination rate compared with the direct-transition of band structure 41.Sn doping increase the dispersion of the contour distribution of VBM and CBM, suggesting Sn doping promotes the charge mobility 42.A narrow band gap can improve the light absorption and affect both the electron delocalization and mobility of the photoexcited charge, which significantly affect the photocatalytic efficiency 43.Comparing the DOS of the simulated MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 systems, for MgIn 2 S 4 , 44.The effective masse of holes is much larger than those of electrons for both the pristine and the doped samples, and thus the mobility of photoinduced carriers is primarily determined by the mobility of holes.The m h of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 is significantly reduced compared to that of MgIn 2 S 4 , so the migration of photoinduced carriers is greatly promoted. Fig. 7a shows the DRS spectra and digital photo of suspensions of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 sample.The introduction of Sn dopant can effectively extend the light absorption range, which is consistent to the color change from red (color of pristine MgIn 2 S 4 ) to dark brown (color of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 ), and induce the generation of a tail in the edge, which keeps in line with the result of theoretical results in Fig. 6d.Because Sn doping in MgIn 2 S 4 causes the band structure changes from the direct band gap to indirect band gap, the energy band gap (Eg) of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 are determined to be 2.10 and 1.65 eV (Fig. S9) on the basis of Kubelka-Munk equation, respectively.The experimental Eg calculated from DRS spectra is a bit bigger than that of theoretical value, the error of which is normal because of the limitation for the exchange-correlation potentials 45.On the basis of Mott-Schottky curve in Fig. S10, the CB potential of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples are calculated to be -1.67 and -1.38 eV versus Ag/AgCl, which are equal to -1.57, and -1.28 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), so the VB potential can be determined to be 0.53 and 0.37 eV, respectively, as portrayed in Fig. 7b.As shown in Fig. S11, XPS valence band spectra of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples are conducted to investigate the band edges, and the VB XPS values are determined to be 1.67 and 1.59 eV, the order of which coincides with the VB potential calculated above.Both the CB potentials of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples meet the thermodynamic requirements of the CO 2 reduction into CH 4 and CO reaction: CO 2 8H 8e - CH 4 2H 2 O (the reaction potential is -0.24V VS NHE), CO 2 2H 2e - CO H 2 O (the reaction potential is -0.53 V VS NHE), respectively.The CO evolution during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction over MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples are higher than CH 4 evolution, which may be ascribed to the easily occur for double electron reaction, and the same phenomenon has also been reported 464748.Electrons and holes would be produced with irradiation and transfer to the photocatalytic surface reactive site.CO 2 would be reduced by electrons to be CH 4 and CO, while the TEOA would be oxidized by holes to generates C1 products as well as H 2 49."}, {"llm generation": "MgIn 2 S 4", "source": "In summary, we confirm that metal ion doping is a feasible strategy to alter the electronic and band structures for semiconductor photocatalysts and thus remarkedly promotes their photocatalysis performance with taking MgIn 2 S 4 as the model.", "context": "In summary, we confirm that metal ion doping is a feasible strategy to alter the electronic and band structures for semiconductor photocatalysts and thus remarkedly promotes their photocatalysis performance with taking MgIn 2 S 4 as the model.Sn 2 doped MgIn 2 S 4 photocatalysts exhibits greatly enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity in relative to pristine MgIn 2 S 4 .Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample realize the highest CO 2 photoconversion rate among all of the samples.With further enlarging the content of Sn dopant, the photocatalytic activities of Sn-doped MgIn 2 S 4 samples declines, revealing the existence of optimal amount for metal ion doping.The theoretical calculation and experimental results demonstrate that the enhancement of photocatalytic activity for Sn-doped MgIn 2 S 4 photocatalysts is ascribed to the promoted separation and transportation efficiency of photoinduced charges, strengthened CO 2 adsorption ability, and expanded light absorption range resulting from Sn doping.This study supports that metal ion doping strategy is attractive for the designing and fabrication of efficient semiconductor photocatalyst.

The morphology and microstructure of the as-synthesized samples are investigated by SEM, TEM, HRTEM, and TEM-EDX, as exhibited in Fig. 3 and Figs.S1-2.From Fig. S1, it can be seen that the MgIn 2 S 4 is characterized by microsphere composed of nanosheets.The introduction of Sn dopant has not made an obvious difference to the morphology of MgIn 2 S 4 .The TEM images in Fig. 3a andb and Fig. S2 further confirm that the microsphere of as-prepared sample is an aggregation of nanosheets.For the HRTEM image in Fig. 3c, Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample displays clear lattice fringes with lattice plane spacing of 0.321 nm and 0.318 nm, which can be contributed to the typical (113) facets.The result of TEM-EDX reflects the existence of Mg, Sn, In, and S atoms (Fig. 3d). The photocatalytic activities of as-prepared samples were evaluated by the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment.As shown in Fig. 4a, CO 2 can be photo-reduced to CO and CH 4 in the presence of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 samples.The Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 samples exhibit markedly enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity compared with pristine MgIn 2 S 4 .With enlarging the content of Sn dopant, the CO 2 conversion rate first ascends, achieving the maximum rate at Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample, and then decrease because excess metal ion dopant would act as the center of electron-hole recombination 27.After illumination for 4 h, the highest yield of CO and CH 4 is 1.70 and 0.13 umol/g, which is about 3.35 and 3.33 times higher than that of pristine MgIn 2 S 4 (the yield of CO and CH 4 is 0.39 and 0.03 umol/g), respectively.The Table S1 portrays the performance comparison of different photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To verify the selectivity of product formation from CO 2 reduction over Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample by using other scavenger, we conduct the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment under the same conditions just substituting triethylamine for TEOA, and the time dependence of CH 4 and CO yields for photo-reduction of CO 2 over Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample is shown in Fig. S4.The products using triethylamine as scavenger are CO and CH 4 , while the yield of CO is lower than that using TEOA as scavenger, but the yield of CH 4 is higher than that using TEOA as scavenger.Particularly, in the blank experiments, neither CO or CH 4 is produced and detected without photocatalyst, or without irradiation, or substitute CO 2 gas with nitrogen gas.Furthermore, as corroborated by the isotopic experiment using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 (Fig. 4b), the m/z at 45, 17, and 29 on the GC-MS spectra can be attributed to 13 CO 2 , 13 CH 4 , and 13 CO, respectively.Thus, it can be confirmed that the CO and CH 4 are derived from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction over Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample, rather than the decomposition of any organic impurity. Besides the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of semiconductor photocatalysts, the stability and recyclability are also pivotal for practical applications, which is evaluated by conducting three-run cycling CO 2 photoreduction experiments.After three successive cycles, as shown in Fig. 4c, the Sn-MgIn2S4-2 sample maintains over 60 of its photocatalytic activity in photo-reducing CO 2 to generate both CO and CH 4 .In addition, it can be found from Fig. 4d and Fig. S5 that no obvious variations of XRD pattern and SEM image for Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample between before and after photoreaction can be detected.These results imply the favorable photostability of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample, which is beneficial for its potential practical application.The specific surface areas (S BET ) of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples are determined to be 73.9 and 40.1 m 2 /g based on the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method (Fig. S6).Generally, a higher surface area of semiconductor photocatalysts implies the more active sites exposed for CO 2 adsorption and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, which is be advantageous for the photocatalysis performance 36.Although the S BET of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 is smaller than that of MgIn 2 S 4 , the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 do reveal the important positive effect of Sn dopant.We also measure the CO 2 adsorption ability of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples, which is crucial for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to hydrocarbons 26.As shown in Fig. 5a, the introduction of Sn dopant would strengthen the CO 2 adsorption capacity.Moreover, during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, water serve as the electron donor and a proton source, suggesting that the contact degree between photocatalyst and water has an impact on the CO 2 photoconversion efficiency 37.The static water contact-angle measurement of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples are examined, as exhibited in Fig. S7.It can be found that the contact angle of these two samples is not significantly different, so the contact degree is not the cause of the enhancement for photocatalytic activity. The separation and migration efficiency of photo-generate charges are critical to the photocatalysis performance over semiconductor photocatalysts.The EIS Nynquist plots, transient photocurrent responses, and PL spectra of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples are measured and displayed in Fig. 5b-d.For EIS Nynquist plots (Fig. 5b), the sharply reduced arc radius of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 compared with MgIn 2 S 4 can be detected.In general, the smaller EIS Nynquist plots is, the higher charge transfer efficiency is 38.The Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 sample exhibits a remarkable enhanced current density in relative to that of MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 5c), while the higher current density represents a better charge separation efficiency 39.The photoluminescence emission (PL) intensity of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 is lower than that of MgIn 2 S 4 (Fig. 5d), demonstrating a lower charge recombination rate over Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 40.According to the above measurement results, it can be inferred that Sn 2 doping in MgIn 2 S 4 can effectively promote the separation and transportation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, so enhancing photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity. DFT calculations are carried out to try to understand how the Sn dopants alter the photocatalytic performance of MgIn 2 S 4 .In the light of the XPS results (Fig. 2), the Sn-doped MgIn 2 S 4 is modelled by replacing one Mg atom with one Sn atom in the unit cell, as shown in Fig. 6a andb.Table .S2 exhibits that Sn doping has little effect on the structure of MgIn 2 S 4 , and the lattice parameter increases slightly from 10.90 A for MgIn 2 S 4 to 10.97 A for Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 , which is due to the larger atomic radius of Sn elements.The main factors affecting the photocatalytic conversion efficiency are the light absorption range of photocatalytic materials and the separation and utilization efficiency of photogenerated carriers.The band structure results exhibit that Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 has a narrower bandgap (0.69 eV) than MgIn 2 S 4 (1.74 eV) (Fig. 6c and Fig. S8c), and noticeably, the band structure changes from the direct band gap to indirect band gap.For indirect band materials, the momentum between the CBM and VBM is mismatch.The recombination between electrons and holes must conserve momentum, so, for semiconductor photocatalyst, the indirect-transition of band structure can significantly reduce charge recombination rate compared with the direct-transition of band structure 41.Sn doping increase the dispersion of the contour distribution of VBM and CBM, suggesting Sn doping promotes the charge mobility 42.A narrow band gap can improve the light absorption and affect both the electron delocalization and mobility of the photoexcited charge, which significantly affect the photocatalytic efficiency 43.Comparing the DOS of the simulated MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 systems, for MgIn 2 S 4 , 44.The effective masse of holes is much larger than those of electrons for both the pristine and the doped samples, and thus the mobility of photoinduced carriers is primarily determined by the mobility of holes.The m h of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 is significantly reduced compared to that of MgIn 2 S 4 , so the migration of photoinduced carriers is greatly promoted. Fig. 7a shows the DRS spectra and digital photo of suspensions of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 sample.The introduction of Sn dopant can effectively extend the light absorption range, which is consistent to the color change from red (color of pristine MgIn 2 S 4 ) to dark brown (color of Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 ), and induce the generation of a tail in the edge, which keeps in line with the result of theoretical results in Fig. 6d.Because Sn doping in MgIn 2 S 4 causes the band structure changes from the direct band gap to indirect band gap, the energy band gap (Eg) of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 are determined to be 2.10 and 1.65 eV (Fig. S9) on the basis of Kubelka-Munk equation, respectively.The experimental Eg calculated from DRS spectra is a bit bigger than that of theoretical value, the error of which is normal because of the limitation for the exchange-correlation potentials 45.On the basis of Mott-Schottky curve in Fig. S10, the CB potential of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples are calculated to be -1.67 and -1.38 eV versus Ag/AgCl, which are equal to -1.57, and -1.28 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), so the VB potential can be determined to be 0.53 and 0.37 eV, respectively, as portrayed in Fig. 7b.As shown in Fig. S11, XPS valence band spectra of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples are conducted to investigate the band edges, and the VB XPS values are determined to be 1.67 and 1.59 eV, the order of which coincides with the VB potential calculated above.Both the CB potentials of MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples meet the thermodynamic requirements of the CO 2 reduction into CH 4 and CO reaction: CO 2 8H 8e - CH 4 2H 2 O (the reaction potential is -0.24V VS NHE), CO 2 2H 2e - CO H 2 O (the reaction potential is -0.53 V VS NHE), respectively.The CO evolution during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction over MgIn 2 S 4 and Sn-MgIn 2 S 4 -2 samples are higher than CH 4 evolution, which may be ascribed to the easily occur for double electron reaction, and the same phenomenon has also been reported 464748.Electrons and holes would be produced with irradiation and transfer to the photocatalytic surface reactive site.CO 2 would be reduced by electrons to be CH 4 and CO, while the TEOA would be oxidized by holes to generates C1 products as well as H 2 49."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "Typically, 50 mg photocatalyst was ultrasonically dispersed in 90 mL ultrapure water and 10 mL TEOA (triethanolamine) used as sacrificial agent, and then the suspension was transferred into a 300 mL photoreactor sealed with an optical quartz window at the top.", "context": "The reagents, In(NO 3 ) X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) were recorded on a Bruker D8 focus with Cu K radiation.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALAB 250xi (ThermoFsher, England) electron spectrometer.Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on Hitachi SU8020 and JEM-2100, respectively.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained using a Hitachi U-3310 UV-vis spectrophotometer.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore diameter distribution of samples were measured through nitrogen adsorption-desorption on Micromeritics ASAP 2460 (USA).The CO 2 adsorption ability of as-obtained samples was investigated by An ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, USA).The photoluminescence emission (PL) spectra were measured at a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh FLS980) using xenon lamp as an excitation source.All the measurements were conducted at room temperature.
