The structures of the as-obtained samples were further studied by high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image on a typical nanosheet.The HRTEM image of ZIS reveals a relatively regular atomic arrangement in the crystal lattice, with the 0.33 nm interplanar distances matching with the d (1 0 0) spacings of ZnIn 2 S 4 , and the interaxial angles of 120consistent with its hexagonal phase (Fig. S1c) 23,24.In contrast, CTAB-ZIS shows much discontinued crystal fringes, indicating the presence of larger amount of structure defects in the CTAB-ZIS nanosheets (Fig. 1c) 25,26.Moreover, the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) has been conducted, and the deviation of plots compared with that of ZIS further proves the subtle atomic distortion of CTAB-ZIS (insets of Fig. 1c,S1c) 23.TEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping images demonstrate that CTAB-ZIS exhibits higher molar ratio of N element as compared to pristine ZIS due to the hybridization of CTAB into the sample (Fig. 1d, 1e andS3). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of ZIS and CTAB-ZIS (Fig. S4,S5) indicate the presence of Zn, In, and S elements in the chemical states of 2, 3, and A2 respectively, in agreement with reported data on ZnIn 2 S 4 27,28.In the case of CTAB-ZIS, the peak intensities of S 2p, In 3d, and Zn 2p are weaker while that of C and N are stronger than that of ZIS, indicating the adsorption of CTAB on the surface of CTAB-ZIS, as supported by the Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectra analysis (Fig. S6) 26.The atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements (Fig. 1f, g and S7) further show the inhibited layer stacking of CTAB-ZIS in comparison with that of ZIS.The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ZIS and CTAB-ZIS present similar profiles (Fig. S8), and all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to a hexagonal phase of ZnIn 2 S 4 (ICDD-JCPDS card No. 72-0773, a b 3.85 A, c 24.68A) 22,28.Note that as compared to ZIS, the discernible peaks of (1 0 4) and (1 0 8) are absent in CTAB-ZIS and the position of peak (0 0 6) shifts to low angle, as clearly shown in Fig. 2a, which indicates the decreased crystalline symmetry of CTAB-ZIS 22,25.The structural defects of CTAB-ZIS can be further supported by the Raman spectra analysis (Fig. S9).In the crystal structure of layered ZnIn 2 S 4 , the stacking of atoms along the c-axis is in a repeated sequence of S-Zn-S-In-S-In-S (Fig. S10) 21.The d (0 0 6) space is consistent with one sixth of the lattice constant along the c-axis of the ZnIn 2 S 4 structure 23,24.Thus, the results suggest that CTAB would insert into the layered crystal structure and expand the interlayer space along the c-axis of the CTAB-ZIS products during the hydrothermal synthetic process 25. The Rietveld analysis of XRD (inset of Fig. 2a) shows that the c/a value of ZIS is 6.65, while that for CTAB-ZIS is 6.76, which deviates more from that of perfect hexagonal phase ZnIn 2 S 4 (6.41)23, suggesting that CTAB-ZIS has larger crystalline distortion extent than that of ZIS 23, which is consistent with that observed in HRTEM images.The presence of larger amount of defects in CTAB-ZIS nanosheets was also confirmed by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra 29.As displayed in Fig. 2b, the broad emission band in 400-500 nm is caused by the different localized resonant vacancy states in the conduction band (CB) 30,31.The emission peak centered at 520 nm is derived from band edge emission.The peak centered at 620 nm should be assigned to the defect state related emissions, corresponding to the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results (Fig. S11) 24,29.The localized vacancy state resonant and defect-related emissions are more intense for CTAB-ZIS as compared to ZIS due to more crystalline and surface disorders in CTAB-ZIS. The light-harvesting capability of ZIS and CTAB-ZIS was measured by the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS).As displayed in Fig. 2c, the two samples show almost the same absorption profile with absorption edge at about 590 nm.The steep shape of the visible edge and the strong absorption in the visible region reveal that the absorption band is ascribed to the transition from the valence band (VB) to the CB 27,32.Based on UV-vis DRS, the band gap (E g ) energies of the samples were obtained by the Kubelka-Munk method, and that of CTAB-ZIS was calculated to be about 2.49 eV, slightly smaller than that of ZIS (2.53 eV), as shown in Fig. 2d.The narrowed band gap of CTAB-ZIS could help to improve the light harvesting and contribute to the photoactivity 33. The samples were then applied to the dual-functional system towards photocatalytic CO 2 reduction pairing with selective oxidation of BA under visible light (k 420 nm) irradiation.Upon illumination, BA was converted to BAD and CAC coupled products, including HB and BZ.The products were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method (Fig. S12).The activity comparison between ZIS and CTAB-ZIS under different reaction conditions is displayed in Table 1.CTAB-ZIS exhibits significantly enhanced activity for CO evolution by 25 times in contrast to ZIS; meanwhile, the conversion of BA improved from 78 to 99 along with the formation rate of H 2 increased by more than 2 times (entry 1 and 2).The time course of the gas products over CTAB-ZIS further indicates that BA has been almost totally converted after reaction for 7 h (Fig. S13).Controlled experiments indicate that the reaction is a photocatalytic process, since the removal of light irradiation or catalysts results in the absence of products detection (entry 3 and 4) 33.Once CO 2 was replaced with Argon (Ar), no detectable CO was observed, suggesting that the carboncontaining products from decomposition of possible carbon residues on photocatalysts are negligible (entry 5) 34.Moreover, the half-reaction of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with sacrificial reagents (TEOA) instead of BA exhibits much lower CO-evolution activity than that in the cooperative photoredox catalytic system (entry 6), manifesting the efficiency superiority of the asdesigned dual-functional photocatalytic system toward CO 2 CTAB-ZIS 0.86 43.84 ---7 f CTAB-ZIS 0.08 0.13 ---reduction with CO-evolving integrated with the oxidation of BA under mild conditions 9,12,13.The absence of TEOA or BA results in negligible amount of products evolution (entry 7), further emphasizing the importance of efficient electrons and holes separation on the reaction occurrence 13. Since the adsorption/activation of CO 2 molecules on catalysts surface would be the essential step affecting the reaction pathway and dynamics of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 35, CO 2 adsorption performance over the samples was firstly monitored for the under-lying reaction mechanism investigation.As shown in Fig. 3a, the CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) analysis declares that CTAB-ZIS exhibits a much stronger CO 2 desorption peak at about 200 C, suggesting that CTAB-ZIS with more surface defects largely favors CO 2 adsorption and activation 36373839, which can ultimately offer more opportunities for the electrons transfer from catalysts surface for CO 2 photoreduction 40.Charge carrier lifetimes of the samples were evaluated by the timeresolved photoluminescence (PL) decay spectra (Fig. 3b) and fitted by exponential decay kinetics function, based on which the average emission lifetimes reflecting the overall emission decay behavior of samples were calculated, according to the following equations 17,41: where s 1 and s 2 are the emission lifetimes, while A 1 and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.As listed in the inset table of Fig. 3b, the short lifetime component (s 1 ) is originated from the recombination of charge carriers in the surface defect states, while the longer lifetime component (s 2 ) is caused by the free excitons recombination within the samples 42.It can be clearly seen that the emission lifetime of CTAB-ZIS decreased from the 11 ns of ZIS to 2.9 ns, nearly 4 times shorter than that of ZIS.The reduced decay lifetime suggests the faster interfacial charge transfer occurring in CTAB-ZIS 41,42. It is because that the introduced defect can act as trap states to trap photogenerated electrons from the CB of semiconductor to participate in the surface catalytic reactions, and thus accelerate the charge carriers separation and ultimately contribute to the enhanced activity (Fig. 3d).As the band structure of semiconductors could largely affect their photocatalytic activity through endowing the charge carriers with disparate redox ability 23,43,44, relative locations of VB maximum for ZIS and CTAB-ZIS were measured via the XPS valence spectra.As displayed in Fig. 3c, the pristine ZIS and CTAB-ZIS possess distinct VBs with the edge of maximum energy at about 1.86 and 1.18 eV, respectively.Combing with their band gaps (Fig. 2d), the locations of CB minimum for ZIS and CTAB-ZIS were calculated to be A0.67 and A1.31 eV, respectively.As schematically shown in Fig. 3d, the CB minimum of CTAB-ZIS upshifts by about 0.64 eV with respect to ZIS, which endows the photoexcited electrons in CTAB-ZIS with a higher reducibility to react with CO 2 and hydrogen ions denoted by BA to form CO molecular and H 2 respectively during the photocatalytic process.At the same time, the VB maximum of CTAB-ZIS elevates about 0.68 eV as compared to ZIS, implying that the ability of as-generated holes for oxidation was reduced to some extent, which is however not directly consistent with the promoted BA conversion of CTAB-ZIS.This is might because that the rate-determining step of this dual-functional reaction is the reductive reaction for CO/H 2 evolution 45.The suppressed H 2 evolution of ZIS also can be reflected by its significant color change from pristine yellow to deep brown during the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S14), which can be ascribed to the in-situ formed S-H bonds, as reported by previous literatures 46.By contrast, only very slight color change can be detected for CTAB-ZIS after photocatalytic reaction, suggesting more efficient H 2 release from the catalysts surface, which could result from the less negative surface potential for H species adsorption (Fig. S15).As a result, the ratio of electron/hole i.e., R (e A /h ) consumed in the reaction over ZIS was lower than 1.0 (Table S1).As for CTAB-ZIS, the R (e A /h ) is higher than 1.0 and this might be caused by the adsorption of BA derived intermediates or products and/or the photogenerated hole-induced structure changes of the catalysts during the long-time reaction 474849. Note that the oxidative ability difference between CTAB-ZIS and ZIS could be one reason for the selectivity difference 50.As schematically shown in Fig. 4a, upon light irradiation, the catalysts are photoexcited to produce electron-hole pairs.The BA will be firstly oxidized to a-hydroxybenzyl radicals (C a radicals), and the C a radicals either can be further oxidized by holes to form BAD, or combine with another C a radical to produce HB, which can undergo an oxidative dehydrogenation to BZ 15,18.The generation of C a radicals during the reaction was revealed by the in-situ EPR spectroscopic studies using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin-trapping agent (Fig. 4b), which shows six characteristic signals belonging to the DMPO-C a radicals adduct under light irradiation 9, for both ZIS and CTAB-ZIS.Moreover, in the case of CTAB-ZIS, the signals intensities of DMPO-C a radicals are stronger than that for ZIS, suggesting larger amout of C a radicals existed in the CTAB-ZIS-based reaction system, due to the weaker oxidative power in contrast to ZIS, which subsequently favors CAC coupling of the asformed C a radicals to CAC coupled products (including HB and BZ).In contrast, the stronger oxidative ability of ZIS benefits the further oxidation process of C a radicals for BAD formation.Ultimately, CTAB-ZIS exhibits increased selectivity of transforming BA to CAC coupled products from 54 of ZIS to 69.Besides, CTAB-ZIS shows quite stable activity in the closed redox reaction during the three times of recycling experiments (Fig. S16).The gas-phase products distribution of CO and H 2 evolution changes negligibly, and the BA conversion correspondingly stays at the high value of 99 (Fig. 4c).Note that the products selectivity is gradually altered along with the recycling times, as that for BAD decreased from the onbased 31 to 7 while that for CAC products increased from 69 to 93 (Fig. 4c).This can be ascribed to the increased structural defects in CTAB-ZIS after the catalytic reaction experiments (Fig. S17 andS18)."}, {"llm generation": "Visible", "source": "Reaction conditions: 5 mL CH 3 CN, 10 mg catalyst, 5 mL BA, 1 atm CO 2 , room temperature, 300 W Xenon lamp, visible light (k 420 nm) for 7 h.", "context": "In summary, we have demonstrated that the defectived ZIS prepared through a facile CTAB surfactant assisted functionalizing strategy can be used as a promising platform to achieve the dual-functional photoredox reaction by pairing CO 2 reduction with selective oxidation of BA to CAC coupled products.The synergistic effects of the narrowed band gap, faster charge carrier separation and elevated CB electrons reducibility induced by the defect engineering contribute to the markedly enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of CTAB-ZIS in contrast to pristine ZIS.The damped oxidative ability of CTAB-ZIS in comparison with ZIS and its unique defective structure favor the CAC coupling process and thus result in the increased selectivity of BA oxidation to CAC coupled products.This work provides a feasible strategy for the design of a promising photocatalyst for efficient visible light-driven CO 2 -to-CO conversion and selective alcohol oxidation to CAC coupled products, which sheds light on the potential opportunity to establish the novel photocatalytic system for coupling cost-effective CO 2 reduction with selective organic synthesis in a cooperative manner under ambient conditions.
