As shown by the TEM image (Fig. 4e), TCQD were uniformly immobilized on C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 shell-core nanosheets with an intimate contact.The HRTEM image (Fig. 4f) exhibited typical C 3 N 4 and clear lattice fringes with d-spacings of 0.26 and 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (0110) plane of TCQD and the (1 0 1) plane of TiO 2 , respectively.These results provided evidence for the successful construction of TCQD that were closely attached to the TiO 2 /C 3 N 4 core-shell structure through strong interfacial van der Waals interactions.X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and FTIR spectra were collected to verify the crystal structure of the as-synthesized samples.The XRD patterns of T, CN, T-CN, T-CN-TC, and T-CN4 are presented in Fig. 5a.The well-defined diffraction peaks of T corresponded to anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS file No. 21-1272) and rutile TiO 2 (JCPDS file No. 21-1276) 14.In the case of T-CN and T-CN-TC, the weak diffraction peaks of the ultrathin C 3 N 4 layer were covered with the strong diffraction peaks of TiO 2 4.The XRD pattern of T-CN4 was acquired to further confirm the structure of the C 3 N 4 -capped TiO 2 nanosheets.The characteristic graphite structure of g-C 3 N 4 can be distinguished by peaks at 27.7and 13.Notably, no diffraction peaks of TCQD were observed in T-CN-TC because of the low content of TCQD and the high dispersity.
