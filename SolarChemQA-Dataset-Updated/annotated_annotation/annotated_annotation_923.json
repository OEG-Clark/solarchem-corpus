all-solid-state Zscheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst Fig. 1 shows the schematic of synthesis procedures of 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalysts.3DOM-TiO 2 C material was firstly compound by the improved method of CCT with anaerobic calcination in Ar.The CCT with opal structure is assembled by the centrifugation of monodispersed polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microsphere.During the anaerobic calcination process for removal of CCT at 600 C, tetrabutyl titanate as TiO 2 precursor is thermally decomposed to TiO 2 nanocrystal, and the PMMA microsphere template is thermally dehydrated and polymerized of the CAC bond to form a graphite carbon coating on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystal spontaneously.Thus, 3DOM carbon-coated TiO 2 (TiO 2 C) support was obtained.Supported Pt NPs on the inner wall of 3DOM-TiO 2 C (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) were elaborately fabricated by gas bubbling-assisted membrance reduction (GBMR) method (Fig. S1).The heterogenous nucleation and growth processes of supported Pt nanocrystals can be regulated by the homogeneous dispersion of reductant 34.The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, as the other isolated system, were assembled into the ordered macropore of Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C material by in-situ

3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst is shown in inset of Fig. 2a.It is observed that the pore wall is composed by carbon-coated TiO 2 nanocrystals.The interplanar crystal spacing of 3.5 A is corresponding to (1 0 1) crystal face of anatasetype TiO 2 353637 and TiO 2 nanocrystals are coated by the carbon layers with thickness of 1-2 molecular.The photograph (bottom of inset in Fig. 2a) exhibits its ash-black color, indicating the enhancing visible light-harvesting efficiency in comparison with the white color of TiO 2 shown in Fig. S2A.Fig. 2b shows the HAADF-STEM (high angle annular dark field scanning TEM) image of 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst.The porous wall of 3DOM material consists of a mass of nanocrystals with the sizes of 5-15 nm. Elemental compositions of one nanocrystal were analyzed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELs), and the EELs mapping are shown in Fig. 2c.Carbon element (red) evenly distributed on the surface of Ti (blue) and O (green) elements, further confirmed TiO 2 C core-shell structure is formed.It is observed clearly in Fig. 2d that after introduce Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, TEM image of 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst exhibits the perfect 3DOM structure.As shown in Fig. 2e, the spherical Pt NPs with interplanar crystal spacings of 2.3 A are evenly loaded on the pore wall of 3DOM-TiO 2 C.The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets are stacked into the inner pore of Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C via in-situ growth method, and are strongly interlinked with porous wall (simulated diagram in the top of Fig. 2e), which is beneficial to the transfer of photogenerated electrons (catalyst model in the bottom of Fig. 2e).In addtion, SEM and TEM images of other catalysts are shown in Figs.S3 andS4. To observe the phase structures of TiO 2 nanocrystal, carbon coating and g-C 3 N 4 in 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst, XRD and Raman spectra are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively.As shown in Fig. 3, the main diffraction peaks (2h) located at 25.4, 37.9, 48.1, 54.9 and 62.8, which is assigned to the (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (2 1 1) and (2 0 4) crystal facets of anatase-phase TiO 2 (PDF 21-1272), respectively.And two peaks located at 13.1 and 27.4are assigned to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets in the ternary 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalysts, which is consistent with the results of the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Fig. S5) 38,39.The absorption band located at 1639 cm A1 is assigned to the C-N stretching vibration modes, while the absorption peak centered at 3192 cm A1 can be originated from N-H stretching vibration modes, and four strong absorption bands situated at 1243, 1319, 1411, 1563 cm A1 are attributed to the typical stretching mode of CN heterocycle, respectively.And the characteristic breathing mode of triazine units was detected by FT-IR on the absorption band at 812 cm A1 .For 3DOM- (2) (517 cm A1 ), and E g(2) (638 cm A1 ) modes of anatase phase, respectively 40.For 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst, the characteristic band of Eg (1) mode has shifted obviously to 152 cm A1 , suggesting the carbon-doping into surface lattice of TiO 2 41.And two bands located at 1341 and 1580 cm A1 are clearly observed, which are attributed to D-band and G-band of the graphitized carbon layers, respectively 42,43.For ternary 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst, the relatively intensity of D/Gbands is higher than those of other catalysts, indicating that g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets grown in-situ increases the defect site density of graphene-coated layers because of the vectorial transfer of electron at the ternary interface 44. To explore the electronic states of Pt NPs in compositions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Pt in Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC is shown in Fig. 5 and the contents of different valence states are listed in the Table S1.According to the standard principle, the deconvolutions of spectra were divided.The binding energy increases with the promotion of the valence state, so the lowest binding energy (70.2 and 73.5 eV) corresponds to the metallic (Pt 0 ) and the highest binding energy (74.1 and 76.9 eV) corresponds to the ionic (Pt 4 ).According to the spectra, the intermediate transition valence state (Pt 2 ) also exists, corresponding to the binding energies of 71.2 and 74.8 eV 45.The presence of ionic Pt (Pt 2 and Pt 4 ) species indicates that Pt NPs were taken away a certain number of electrons in the process of synthesis and the formation of new chemical interactions.The surface density of ionic Pt species increases from 31.8 (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) to 67.1 (3DOM-CNPTC), indicating the strong electron delivery from Pt to g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets in CNPTC catalyst 46.It is attributed to the strong interaction between Pt NPs as an electron-donating and circumambient TiO 2 nanocrystals or g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.It confirms the possibility that Pt NPs can be utilized as an intermediate path for electron transmission in the ternary 3DOM-CNPTC system 47.duction of carbon coating, 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst displays the stronger absorption efficiency for visible light (400-800 nm) compared with 3DOM-TiO 2 , which is attributed to the formation of p-p conjugated structure at the interface between TiO 2 and graphitized carbon layers for improving light-harvesting efficiency 48,49.As the synergistic effect of two systems, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has a strong absorption spectrum in the range of UV-Visible light.The absorption peak around 390 nm is particularly prominent, which is superimposed by the absorption peak of g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Furthermore, the separation efficiency of photoinduced electrons and holes is another important factor to improve the photochemical conversion efficiency 50. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the charge-transfer property over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.As shown in Fig. 6b, 3DOM TiO 2 exhibits the strongest PL emission peak at 580 nm, indicating that a large number of photogenerated electrons and holes have recombined.For 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst, its intensity of PL emission peak decreases obviously, suggesting that carbon-coated layers enhance the effective charge separation ability.After introduction of Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows the weakest PL emission peak, indicating that ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C heterjunctions boost the separation efficiency and restrain the recombination of photoelectrons and holes 51.In order to better understand the charge transfer of 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts, the electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range of 10,000-0.1 Hz at A0.74 V vs. RHE was detected.Nyquist plots of 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts are in Fig. S7A (irradiation 100 mW cm A2 ).The equivalent circuit and parameters are shown in Fig. S8 and Table S2.The diameter of the spectra is proportional to the charge transfer resistance (Rct), which represents the charge transfer capacity between the catalysts and the reactants.It is well-known that the smaller arc radius, the lesser obstruction of electrons-holes transferring.As shown, obtains the smallest value at 3DOM-CNPTC, which indicate the 3DOM-CNPTC obtains more effective separation of photogenerated electronhole pairs.Under condition of visible-light irradiation, the Rct value of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst is much smaller than that of in the dark, suggesting that the large amount of photogenerated electrons and holes are generated and transferred rapidly under visible-light illumination (Fig. S7B).Based on the results of UV-Vis DRS and PL spectra, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst with ternary synergy effect shows the optimal visible-light-harvesting efficiency and separation efficiency of photoelectrons and holes.Moreover, photogenerated electrons and holes will be transferred to the catalyst surface and interact with CO 2 at the two-phase interface. The photocatalytic performances of CO 2 reduction over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst were evaluated by a gas closed circulation system with a continuous flow mode under Xe lamp irradiation of visible light (!420 nm).And the gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC).The performances of the photocatalysts for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction with H 2 O are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1.The amount of catalysts used in the photoreaction is 0.1 g.Photocatalytically splitting H 2 O into H 2 is a competitive reaction in CO 2 reduction, and it's also the source of protons for CH 4 product 52.To comparison with the photocatalytic activities reported by other researchers, it is generally accepted that the commercial P25 was used as the reference sample due to its good photocatalytic performance and uniform crystal phase structure.Herein, commercial P25 purchased from Degussa (Co., Germany) was used to the reference catalyst, which composes of anatase (80) and rutile (20) with its average particle size of 21 nm.Compared to P25 and 3DOM-TiO 2 , 3DOM-TiO 2 C displays the higher CO 2 photoreduction catalytic activity, i.e., the formation rates of CO and CH 4 are 0.87 and 0.21 lmol h A1 , respectively.It indicates that the carbon-coated layers can enhance photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 catalyst.After introduce supported Pt NPs, the formation rates of H 2 and CH 4 products over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst increases to 2.28 and 1.56 lmol h A1 , respectively.And its selectivity for CO 2 reduction is the lowest (75.6) except for P25.It suggests that Pt NPs as electron-rich sites are beneficial for promoting the formation of H-containing products and improv- ing the rate of multi-electron and proton process (CH 4 selectivity, 64.4).Pure g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets show the high formation rate of CO (2.46 lmol h A1 ) and selectivity for CO 2 reduction (96.7), while its formation rate and selectivity of CH 4 product is the lowest.It may be related to the good adsorption and activation properties of pure g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reactant.And the binary synergetic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C in g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst improves remarkably the formation rate of CO product (2.76 lmol h A1 ), indicating that g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets have excellent activation property for CO 2 molecule and restrain the formation of H-containing products due to low surface photoelectron density.In order to increase the surface electron-rich density, Pt NPs are assembled into the middle between g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C.The ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst exhibits the largest formation rate of CH 4 product (6.56 lmol h A1 ) and the highest selectivity for CO 2 reduction (97.1) compared with single and binary catalysts, which is 130-fold of commercial P25.The selectivity of CH 4 product increases from 2 (g-C 3 N 4 ) to 81.7 (3DOM-CNPTC), indicating that the synergy effect of ternary components is beneficial for improving the selectivity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 .For the reaction of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, the oxidation product is O 2 .Based on the formation rates of reduction products (CH 4 , CO and H 2 ), the theoretical formation rate of O 2 were calculated and shown in Table S3.The stoichiometric formation rate of O 2 was approximately equal to the practical formation rate of O 2 , indicating that H 2 O was only electron donor during the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 . It is significant to explore the utilization efficiency of solar energy, an important parameter for the evaluation of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O 53.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is used to calculate the conversion rate of light energy to chemical energy in the whole CO 2 reduction process by the equation: AQE 2n(CO) 8n(CH 4 )/Number of incident photons A 100.As demonstrated in Table 1, the AQE value of 3DOM-TiO 2 specimen (0.05) is higher than that of P25 (0.04), meaning the utilization efficiency of photoelectrons of photonic crystal structure in 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst enhanced.After combined carbon coating with 3DOM-TiO 2 to form composites, the AQE value of sample is 0.26, indicating that carbon-coated layers on TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost solar energy utilization efficiency.For the Z-schemetype ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, the AQE values further increase, and 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has the largest apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) value (5.67), which is more than 140-fold of commercial P25.It suggests that 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has high solar energy utilization efficiency, which is attributed to the properties of high-efficient visible-light harvesting and photogenerated carries separation. Based on the remarkable photocatalytic reduction CO 2 performance, it is crucial to investigate the stability of 3DOM-CNPTC cat-alyst by the cycle tests for CO 2 reduction, and the result is shown in Fig. S9.It can be clearly seen that the yield of the products in ten repetitions presented no obvious change, which exhibited the commendable cyclic stability of as-prepared 3DOM-CNPTC.The structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC was also obtained, the SEM and TEM images of the samples after reaction are shown in Figs.S10 andS11, respectively.The nanostructure of all-solidstate Z-scheme-type ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C system and the particle size of supported Pt NPs are as similar as the initial samples, indicating the good structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.Additionally, a series of blank examinations were carried out in the absence of illumination, catalysts, and reactants (CO 2 and H 2 O).At this time, the products CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction were not detected.It indicates that the three essential elements of reaction, light, catalyst and reactant are indispensable to the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.To demonstrate the source of carbon and hydrogen elements in the reaction products, the isotopic tracing CO 2 reduction of containing 13 C and 2 H(D) reactants by GC-MS were shown in Fig. S12.The peaks located at the m/z of 21 and 29 are assigned to 13 CD 4 and 13 CO products, respectively.As shown in Fig. S12C, during photocatalytic 13 CO 2 reduction with D 2 O after 8 h irradiation, the amounts of isotopic 13 CD 4 , 13 CO and D 2 products over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst obtained by GC-MS are close to the results obtained by GC.The isotopic tracing experiment of 13 C and D indicates that the carbon and hydrogen elements in the product of CO and CH 4 originate from CO 2 and H 2 O, respectively.It satisfies three requirements for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as follows: Confirming the source of carbon in CO 2 reduction products; determining the relative amount of H 2 and CO 2 reduction products; checking the stoichiometric O 2 in Table S3 54. It is helpful to reveal the reaction mechanism of catalysts by investigating the selectivity of reaction products.The processes of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction involve three crucial steps: the photoexcitation of charges, the separation and transfer of electrons and holes, and the capture of reactants on the catalyst surface 55.The first two steps determine the charge density transferred to the reaction interface, while the latter step is concerned with the activation and the surface density of the reactants.The survey of the above two points are indispensable to reveal the structure-activity relationship of catalysts. The activation property of the reactants on the catalyst surface will affect the direction of the CO 2 reduction reaction.The efficiency of CO 2 reduction reaction is closely related to the surface concentration of CO 2 on the catalyst.For investigating surface enrichment of adsorbed CO 2 , Fig. 8b exhibits the CO 2 -TPD curves Table 1 The formation rates, the selectivity of CO and CH 4 productions and the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 with H 2 O over 3DOM-TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts. Formation 1 that the CO 2 reduction selectivity of catalysts containing g-C 3 N 4 are higher than 90.Therefore, the catalysts with g-C 3 N 4 will obtain a high CO 2 reduction efficiency due to the large amount of CO 2 adsorbed on its surface.In addition, the conduction band (CB) of the photocatalyst should be lower than the reduction potential of the desired reaction, that is, the formation potential of CO (Eq.1: CO 2 2H 2e CO H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CO) A0.53V) and the formation potential of CH 4 (Eq.2: CO 2 8H 8e CH 4 H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) A0.24V) 56.The 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts can reduce CO 2 to CH 4 and CO because the conduction positions of TiO 2 (A0.56 V vs. NHE at pH 7) and g-C 3 N 4 (A1.30V vs. NHE at pH 7) match with the potential requirements 55.For CB potential position, it is observed that the g-C 3 N 4 material is more prone to CO 2 reduction compared to the 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst.Moreover, because of the E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) value is more negative than E h (CO 2 /CO), it seems easily achieve the photoconversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .But the CO 2 reduction reaction to CH 4 requires eight electrons and eight protons, a luxury compared with the two required for CO 57.Therefore, the surface enrichment of electrons and protons considerably affects the catalytic performance and selectivity of CO 2 photoconversion. As shown in Fig. 8a, the transient photocurrent responses of the catalysts were investigated, in order to further investigate the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons.The photocurrent density of 3DOM TiO 2 C support is higher than 3DOM-TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 catalysts, indicating that the carbon-coated layers on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost the transportation of photogenerated electrons.After introduce Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 , the photocurrent densities over binary Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts are improved obviously compared with those of single component catalysts.3DOM-CNPTC catalyst exhibits fast, repeatable and the highest intensity of transient photocurrent responses in the cycling processes of light on and off, indicating that all-solid-state Z-scheme structure improves the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons and is beneficial to promote the reaction of eight electrons (CH 4 formation) 58.In addition to the photogenerated electrons, the protons are the ultimate contributor to the formation of methane.It is well known that platinum is an excellent cocatalyst for water cracking reaction.Proton is an important resource in CO 2 hydrogenation, which is mainly provided by water cracking reaction.Consequently, the foramtion rate of CH 4 product over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was higher than those of 3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Thus, the introduced Pt nanoparticles play a crucial role in promoting the process of CO 2 hydrogenation. To sum up, high electron density, proton supply and CO 2 adsorption are the three necessary factors for the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .Pure g-C 3 N 4 can effectively improve the reaction efficiency of CO 2 reduction.However, due to the lack of protons supply, the reduction product was still dominated by CO product, even the high electron density was obtained by combining with 3DOM-TiO 2 C (g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C).The selectivity of CO 2 reduction over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was only 75 because of the limitation surface concentration of CO 2 .An efficient Z-scheme reaction system with Pt nanoparticles as electron transport medium was successfully constructed, and a high electron density was obtained.Thus, all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows outstanding conversion efficiency for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 . To insight into the transfer of photogenerated electron during CO 2 reduction, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed, and the optimized model of all-solid-state Zscheme CNPTC structure is shown in Fig. S16.As shown in Fig. 9, the covalent heterojunctions appear at the interface between TiO 2 C, Pt and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.The unstable electrons generated by photoexcitation of TiO 2 C are eager to react or transfer to a lower band position to reduce its high reduction potential.Carbon-coated layers are employed as an interfacial conduction layer 59 and the relatively middle potential of Pt NPs sets up a step between conduction band of TiO 2 to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 .The Z-scheme of CNPTC catalyst was built by the recombination of charges on conduction band of TiO B) ?Pt ?g-C 3 N 4 (VB).According to the above experimental results, the mechanism of all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction is proposed (Fig. 10).All-solidstate Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst absorbs photons to generate photoelectrons and holes.The photoelectrons derived from photoexcited TiO 2 C are captured by the carbon-coated layers and transfer to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 via Pt NPs.Further photoelectrons on conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 enriched by N-sites located at the interface of Pt and g-C 3 N 4 .Finally, photoelectrons react with absorbed CO 2 and H 2 O into the target products (CO and CH 4 ), and the holes stayed in valence band of TiO 2 C oxidize H 2 O to O 2 .The formation rate and selectivity of CH 4 product depend on the surface enrichment of electrons and CO 2 molecule."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets", "source": "The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, as the other isolated system, were assembled into the ordered macropore of Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C material by in-situ growth method with thermally anaerobic decomposition of urea.", "context": "3.1.Synthesis and structural characterizations of all-solid-state Zscheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst Fig. 1 shows the schematic of synthesis procedures of 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalysts.3DOM-TiO 2 C material was firstly compound by the improved method of CCT with anaerobic calcination in Ar.The CCT with opal structure is assembled by the centrifugation of monodispersed polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microsphere.During the anaerobic calcination process for removal of CCT at 600 C, tetrabutyl titanate as TiO 2 precursor is thermally decomposed to TiO 2 nanocrystal, and the PMMA microsphere template is thermally dehydrated and polymerized of the CAC bond to form a graphite carbon coating on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystal spontaneously.Thus, 3DOM carbon-coated TiO 2 (TiO 2 C) support was obtained.Supported Pt NPs on the inner wall of 3DOM-TiO 2 C (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) were elaborately fabricated by gas bubbling-assisted membrance reduction (GBMR) method (Fig. S1).The heterogenous nucleation and growth processes of supported Pt nanocrystals can be regulated by the homogeneous dispersion of reductant 34.The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, as the other isolated system, were assembled into the ordered macropore of Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C material by in-situ growth method with thermally anaerobic decomposition of urea.Finally, the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst of g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C was successfully fabricated, and the synthesis details can be found in the Experimental sections.and forms the slow photon effect for improving visible lightharvesting efficiency 22.High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst is shown in inset of Fig. 2a.It is observed that the pore wall is composed by carbon-coated TiO 2 nanocrystals.The interplanar crystal spacing of 3.5 A is corresponding to (1 0 1) crystal face of anatasetype TiO 2 353637 and TiO 2 nanocrystals are coated by the carbon layers with thickness of 1-2 molecular.The photograph (bottom of inset in Fig. 2a) exhibits its ash-black color, indicating the enhancing visible light-harvesting efficiency in comparison with the white color of TiO 2 shown in Fig. S2A.Fig. 2b shows the HAADF-STEM (high angle annular dark field scanning TEM) image of 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst.The porous wall of 3DOM material consists of a mass of nanocrystals with the sizes of 5-15 nm.

To explore the electronic states of Pt NPs in compositions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Pt in Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC is shown in Fig. 5 and the contents of different valence states are listed in the Table S1.According to the standard principle, the deconvolutions of spectra were divided.The binding energy increases with the promotion of the valence state, so the lowest binding energy (70.2 and 73.5 eV) corresponds to the metallic (Pt 0 ) and the highest binding energy (74.1 and 76.9 eV) corresponds to the ionic (Pt 4 ).According to the spectra, the intermediate transition valence state (Pt 2 ) also exists, corresponding to the binding energies of 71.2 and 74.8 eV 45.The presence of ionic Pt (Pt 2 and Pt 4 ) species indicates that Pt NPs were taken away a certain number of electrons in the process of synthesis and the formation of new chemical interactions.The surface density of ionic Pt species increases from 31.8 (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) to 67.1 (3DOM-CNPTC), indicating the strong electron delivery from Pt to g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets in CNPTC catalyst 46.It is attributed to the strong interaction between Pt NPs as an electron-donating and circumambient TiO 2 nanocrystals or g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.It confirms the possibility that Pt NPs can be utilized as an intermediate path for electron transmission in the ternary 3DOM-CNPTC system 47.duction of carbon coating, 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst displays the stronger absorption efficiency for visible light (400-800 nm) compared with 3DOM-TiO 2 , which is attributed to the formation of p-p conjugated structure at the interface between TiO 2 and graphitized carbon layers for improving light-harvesting efficiency 48,49.As the synergistic effect of two systems, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has a strong absorption spectrum in the range of UV-Visible light.The absorption peak around 390 nm is particularly prominent, which is superimposed by the absorption peak of g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Furthermore, the separation efficiency of photoinduced electrons and holes is another important factor to improve the photochemical conversion efficiency 50. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the charge-transfer property over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.As shown in Fig. 6b, 3DOM TiO 2 exhibits the strongest PL emission peak at 580 nm, indicating that a large number of photogenerated electrons and holes have recombined.For 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst, its intensity of PL emission peak decreases obviously, suggesting that carbon-coated layers enhance the effective charge separation ability.After introduction of Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows the weakest PL emission peak, indicating that ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C heterjunctions boost the separation efficiency and restrain the recombination of photoelectrons and holes 51.In order to better understand the charge transfer of 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts, the electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range of 10,000-0.1 Hz at A0.74 V vs. RHE was detected.Nyquist plots of 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts are in Fig. S7A (irradiation 100 mW cm A2 ).The equivalent circuit and parameters are shown in Fig. S8 and Table S2.The diameter of the spectra is proportional to the charge transfer resistance (Rct), which represents the charge transfer capacity between the catalysts and the reactants.It is well-known that the smaller arc radius, the lesser obstruction of electrons-holes transferring.As shown, obtains the smallest value at 3DOM-CNPTC, which indicate the 3DOM-CNPTC obtains more effective separation of photogenerated electronhole pairs.Under condition of visible-light irradiation, the Rct value of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst is much smaller than that of in the dark, suggesting that the large amount of photogenerated electrons and holes are generated and transferred rapidly under visible-light illumination (Fig. S7B).Based on the results of UV-Vis DRS and PL spectra, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst with ternary synergy effect shows the optimal visible-light-harvesting efficiency and separation efficiency of photoelectrons and holes.Moreover, photogenerated electrons and holes will be transferred to the catalyst surface and interact with CO 2 at the two-phase interface. The photocatalytic performances of CO 2 reduction over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst were evaluated by a gas closed circulation system with a continuous flow mode under Xe lamp irradiation of visible light (!420 nm).And the gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC).The performances of the photocatalysts for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction with H 2 O are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1.The amount of catalysts used in the photoreaction is 0.1 g.Photocatalytically splitting H 2 O into H 2 is a competitive reaction in CO 2 reduction, and it's also the source of protons for CH 4 product 52.To comparison with the photocatalytic activities reported by other researchers, it is generally accepted that the commercial P25 was used as the reference sample due to its good photocatalytic performance and uniform crystal phase structure.Herein, commercial P25 purchased from Degussa (Co., Germany) was used to the reference catalyst, which composes of anatase (80) and rutile (20) with its average particle size of 21 nm.Compared to P25 and 3DOM-TiO 2 , 3DOM-TiO 2 C displays the higher CO 2 photoreduction catalytic activity, i.e., the formation rates of CO and CH 4 are 0.87 and 0.21 lmol h A1 , respectively.It indicates that the carbon-coated layers can enhance photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 catalyst.After introduce supported Pt NPs, the formation rates of H 2 and CH 4 products over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst increases to 2.28 and 1.56 lmol h A1 , respectively.And its selectivity for CO 2 reduction is the lowest (75.6) except for P25.It suggests that Pt NPs as electron-rich sites are beneficial for promoting the formation of H-containing products and improv- ing the rate of multi-electron and proton process (CH 4 selectivity, 64.4).Pure g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets show the high formation rate of CO (2.46 lmol h A1 ) and selectivity for CO 2 reduction (96.7), while its formation rate and selectivity of CH 4 product is the lowest.It may be related to the good adsorption and activation properties of pure g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reactant.And the binary synergetic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C in g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst improves remarkably the formation rate of CO product (2.76 lmol h A1 ), indicating that g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets have excellent activation property for CO 2 molecule and restrain the formation of H-containing products due to low surface photoelectron density.In order to increase the surface electron-rich density, Pt NPs are assembled into the middle between g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C.The ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst exhibits the largest formation rate of CH 4 product (6.56 lmol h A1 ) and the highest selectivity for CO 2 reduction (97.1) compared with single and binary catalysts, which is 130-fold of commercial P25.The selectivity of CH 4 product increases from 2 (g-C 3 N 4 ) to 81.7 (3DOM-CNPTC), indicating that the synergy effect of ternary components is beneficial for improving the selectivity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 .For the reaction of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, the oxidation product is O 2 .Based on the formation rates of reduction products (CH 4 , CO and H 2 ), the theoretical formation rate of O 2 were calculated and shown in Table S3.The stoichiometric formation rate of O 2 was approximately equal to the practical formation rate of O 2 , indicating that H 2 O was only electron donor during the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 . It is significant to explore the utilization efficiency of solar energy, an important parameter for the evaluation of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O 53.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is used to calculate the conversion rate of light energy to chemical energy in the whole CO 2 reduction process by the equation: AQE 2n(CO) 8n(CH 4 )/Number of incident photons A 100.As demonstrated in Table 1, the AQE value of 3DOM-TiO 2 specimen (0.05) is higher than that of P25 (0.04), meaning the utilization efficiency of photoelectrons of photonic crystal structure in 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst enhanced.After combined carbon coating with 3DOM-TiO 2 to form composites, the AQE value of sample is 0.26, indicating that carbon-coated layers on TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost solar energy utilization efficiency.For the Z-schemetype ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, the AQE values further increase, and 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has the largest apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) value (5.67), which is more than 140-fold of commercial P25.It suggests that 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has high solar energy utilization efficiency, which is attributed to the properties of high-efficient visible-light harvesting and photogenerated carries separation. Based on the remarkable photocatalytic reduction CO 2 performance, it is crucial to investigate the stability of 3DOM-CNPTC cat-alyst by the cycle tests for CO 2 reduction, and the result is shown in Fig. S9.It can be clearly seen that the yield of the products in ten repetitions presented no obvious change, which exhibited the commendable cyclic stability of as-prepared 3DOM-CNPTC.The structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC was also obtained, the SEM and TEM images of the samples after reaction are shown in Figs.S10 andS11, respectively.The nanostructure of all-solidstate Z-scheme-type ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C system and the particle size of supported Pt NPs are as similar as the initial samples, indicating the good structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.Additionally, a series of blank examinations were carried out in the absence of illumination, catalysts, and reactants (CO 2 and H 2 O).At this time, the products CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction were not detected.It indicates that the three essential elements of reaction, light, catalyst and reactant are indispensable to the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.To demonstrate the source of carbon and hydrogen elements in the reaction products, the isotopic tracing CO 2 reduction of containing 13 C and 2 H(D) reactants by GC-MS were shown in Fig. S12.The peaks located at the m/z of 21 and 29 are assigned to 13 CD 4 and 13 CO products, respectively.As shown in Fig. S12C, during photocatalytic 13 CO 2 reduction with D 2 O after 8 h irradiation, the amounts of isotopic 13 CD 4 , 13 CO and D 2 products over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst obtained by GC-MS are close to the results obtained by GC.The isotopic tracing experiment of 13 C and D indicates that the carbon and hydrogen elements in the product of CO and CH 4 originate from CO 2 and H 2 O, respectively.It satisfies three requirements for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as follows: Confirming the source of carbon in CO 2 reduction products; determining the relative amount of H 2 and CO 2 reduction products; checking the stoichiometric O 2 in Table S3 54. It is helpful to reveal the reaction mechanism of catalysts by investigating the selectivity of reaction products.The processes of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction involve three crucial steps: the photoexcitation of charges, the separation and transfer of electrons and holes, and the capture of reactants on the catalyst surface 55.The first two steps determine the charge density transferred to the reaction interface, while the latter step is concerned with the activation and the surface density of the reactants.The survey of the above two points are indispensable to reveal the structure-activity relationship of catalysts. The activation property of the reactants on the catalyst surface will affect the direction of the CO 2 reduction reaction.The efficiency of CO 2 reduction reaction is closely related to the surface concentration of CO 2 on the catalyst.For investigating surface enrichment of adsorbed CO 2 , Fig. 8b exhibits the CO 2 -TPD curves Table 1 The formation rates, the selectivity of CO and CH 4 productions and the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 with H 2 O over 3DOM-TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts. Formation 1 that the CO 2 reduction selectivity of catalysts containing g-C 3 N 4 are higher than 90.Therefore, the catalysts with g-C 3 N 4 will obtain a high CO 2 reduction efficiency due to the large amount of CO 2 adsorbed on its surface.In addition, the conduction band (CB) of the photocatalyst should be lower than the reduction potential of the desired reaction, that is, the formation potential of CO (Eq.1: CO 2 2H 2e CO H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CO) A0.53V) and the formation potential of CH 4 (Eq.2: CO 2 8H 8e CH 4 H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) A0.24V) 56.The 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts can reduce CO 2 to CH 4 and CO because the conduction positions of TiO 2 (A0.56 V vs. NHE at pH 7) and g-C 3 N 4 (A1.30V vs. NHE at pH 7) match with the potential requirements 55.For CB potential position, it is observed that the g-C 3 N 4 material is more prone to CO 2 reduction compared to the 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst.Moreover, because of the E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) value is more negative than E h (CO 2 /CO), it seems easily achieve the photoconversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .But the CO 2 reduction reaction to CH 4 requires eight electrons and eight protons, a luxury compared with the two required for CO 57.Therefore, the surface enrichment of electrons and protons considerably affects the catalytic performance and selectivity of CO 2 photoconversion. As shown in Fig. 8a, the transient photocurrent responses of the catalysts were investigated, in order to further investigate the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons.The photocurrent density of 3DOM TiO 2 C support is higher than 3DOM-TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 catalysts, indicating that the carbon-coated layers on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost the transportation of photogenerated electrons.After introduce Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 , the photocurrent densities over binary Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts are improved obviously compared with those of single component catalysts.3DOM-CNPTC catalyst exhibits fast, repeatable and the highest intensity of transient photocurrent responses in the cycling processes of light on and off, indicating that all-solid-state Z-scheme structure improves the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons and is beneficial to promote the reaction of eight electrons (CH 4 formation) 58.In addition to the photogenerated electrons, the protons are the ultimate contributor to the formation of methane.It is well known that platinum is an excellent cocatalyst for water cracking reaction.Proton is an important resource in CO 2 hydrogenation, which is mainly provided by water cracking reaction.Consequently, the foramtion rate of CH 4 product over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was higher than those of 3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Thus, the introduced Pt nanoparticles play a crucial role in promoting the process of CO 2 hydrogenation. To sum up, high electron density, proton supply and CO 2 adsorption are the three necessary factors for the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .Pure g-C 3 N 4 can effectively improve the reaction efficiency of CO 2 reduction.However, due to the lack of protons supply, the reduction product was still dominated by CO product, even the high electron density was obtained by combining with 3DOM-TiO 2 C (g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C).The selectivity of CO 2 reduction over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was only 75 because of the limitation surface concentration of CO 2 .An efficient Z-scheme reaction system with Pt nanoparticles as electron transport medium was successfully constructed, and a high electron density was obtained.Thus, all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows outstanding conversion efficiency for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 . To insight into the transfer of photogenerated electron during CO 2 reduction, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed, and the optimized model of all-solid-state Zscheme CNPTC structure is shown in Fig. S16.As shown in Fig. 9, the covalent heterojunctions appear at the interface between TiO 2 C, Pt and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.The unstable electrons generated by photoexcitation of TiO 2 C are eager to react or transfer to a lower band position to reduce its high reduction potential.Carbon-coated layers are employed as an interfacial conduction layer 59 and the relatively middle potential of Pt NPs sets up a step between conduction band of TiO 2 to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 .The Z-scheme of CNPTC catalyst was built by the recombination of charges on conduction band of TiO B) ?Pt ?g-C 3 N 4 (VB).According to the above experimental results, the mechanism of all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction is proposed (Fig. 10).All-solidstate Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst absorbs photons to generate photoelectrons and holes.The photoelectrons derived from photoexcited TiO 2 C are captured by the carbon-coated layers and transfer to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 via Pt NPs.Further photoelectrons on conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 enriched by N-sites located at the interface of Pt and g-C 3 N 4 .Finally, photoelectrons react with absorbed CO 2 and H 2 O into the target products (CO and CH 4 ), and the holes stayed in valence band of TiO 2 C oxidize H 2 O to O 2 .The formation rate and selectivity of CH 4 product depend on the surface enrichment of electrons and CO 2 molecule."}, {"llm generation": "3DOM-TiO 2 C", "source": "In this work, we have fabricated the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst is composed of two photochemical systems of 3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets as well as Pt NPs used for electron transfer medium.", "context": "In this work, we have fabricated the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst is composed of two photochemical systems of 3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets as well as Pt NPs used for electron transfer medium.3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows high catalytic activity for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction, i.e., its formation rates of CH 4 is 6.56 lmol h A1 , and its quantum efficiency achieves 5.67 under visible light (420 nm), which is more than 140 times the commercial P25.The activity and selectivity for CO 2 photoreduction are strongly dependent on the surface enrichment of electrons and CO 2 .Based on the results of characterizations and DFT calculation, it is proposed that the photoelectrons are enriched on the N-sites located at the interface of Pt and g-C 3 N 4 , and can react with absorbed CO 2 and H 2 O into the selective CH 4 product.It demonstrates that all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst can optimize the selectivity of products and the quantum efficiency for CO 2 reduction, giving new possibilities for achieving high-performance solar-driven CO 2 reduction.

The chloroplatinic acid was used as the source of platinum which was reduced by sodium borohydride, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) was added as the protective agent 31,32.As the use of bubble assisted diffusion reductant in the reduction process this method is called the gas bubbling-assisted membrane reduction (GBMR) method and the detailed preparation processes of GBMR method is shown in Supporting Information. The pure was obtained by calcination of urea.To be specific, the various weight ratio of urea was evenly mixed with the support, and was placed in a covered ceramic crucible and heated with inert atmosphere at 550 C for 4 h in a tube furnace at the temperature rate of 5 o CAmin A1 .With rising of the temperature, the urea would be melted and flowed into the internal structure of the pore, where the urea occurred in the heating polycondensation into g-C 3 N 4 .Finally, the g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets were successfully grown on the inner wall of porous channel and the composites were called 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst. The specific surface area of the catalyst was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and the cryogenic nitrogen adsorption desorption was tested on Autosorb-iQ instrument (Quantachrome, USA).Scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) images and corresponding EDS mappings were carried on a Talos F200X (FEI) equipped with a Super-EDS and a JEOl JEM 2100 instrument.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were obtained using a FEI Quanta 200F instrument.The content of platinum in the catalyst was analyzed by inductive coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy, which was conducted on OPTIMA 7300 V produced by Perkin Elmer and dissolved the catalysts with a mixture of nitrohydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid.X-ray diffractometer (XRD) experiments were carried out in a Shimadzu XRD 6000.The Raman spectra were obtained on Renishaw Micro-Raman spectra with a 532 nm laser.The absorption performance of the UV-Visible range was investigated by a U-4100 ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer.The X-ray photoelectron spectra were carried out on Perkin-ElmerPHI-1600 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer.An infrared spectrometer (Nicolet IS10) provided the fourier transform infrared spectra of catalysts.Electron-hole recombination was investigated by a F-7000 photoluminescence spectrum (PL).The wavelength of the excitation light source was 380 nm and the scanning speed was 120 nm min A1 .In-situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) were measured using an infrared spectrometer (Nicolet IS50) and matched by an MCT detector and a high temperature cell with a liquid nitrogen cooling system.The sample was fixed in the Harrick infrared cell, nitrogen was added to purge (50 mL min A1 ) and the temperature was hold at 200 C for 60 min to ensure that the surface adsorbents were removed.Then the sample was cooled back to room temperature and a background line was scanned with a resolution of 4 cm A1 by accumulating 64 scans under nitrogen atmosphere.Finally, the CO 2 (50 cm 3 min A1 ) was absorbed for half an hour and then switched back to the nitrogen atmosphere for testing.Transient photocurrent responses, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) of the catalysts were tested on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E) using a three-electrode system.For the preparation method for photoelectrode, 10 mg of powder-type sample was ultrasonically dispersed in 1 mL of ethyl alcohol along with 50 lL of Nafion-117 film solution (Alfa Aesar).After ultrasonication for 30 min, the dispersed solution (100 lL) was spin-coated onto the FTO electrode (1 cm 2 ) and dried in drying oven at 65 C.The detail informations of photoelectrochemical characterizations were exhibited in the Supporting Information. The Labsolar-H 2 -II instrument (Perfect light company, China) was used to test the photocatalysis performance of carbon dioxide reduction.A 300 W xenon lamp was chosen to simulate a solar light source with an external filter (!420 nm).The certain amount of catalyst (0.1 g) was dispersed in a glass surface dish with a diameter of 6.5 cm and added the certain amount of deionized water (2.5 mL), then fixed the photoreactor by glass clamps and vacuumized it.The whole system was purged by carbon dioxide gas three times before testing.A cyclic condensation system was used to ensure that the entire reaction system remained at room temperature and pressure.The spectroradiometer determined the incident light intensity was 80 mW cm A2 .The whole test process was eight hours, during which each hour of product detection was done by a gas chromatograph with two detectors (GC-9560, HuaAiSePu Corp.).The flame ionization detector (FID) with methane converter was used to detect the amounts of CO and CH 4 , and the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to determination of the product amounts (O 2 and H 2 ).And the carrier gas of the GC is Argon (Ar).The external standard method was used to analyze the yield of the gas products.The selectivity of reaction products reflects the performance of the catalysts, and the selectivity of CO 2 reduction was calculated by the following formula: The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured in monochromatic light of 420 nm, and the number of incident photons was obtained by light intensity conversion.The AQE of a photocatalyst is the ratio of the number of photoelectrons consumed by the products (CO and CH 4 ) to the number of incident photons, and the specific calculation formula is as follow: Density functional theory calculation.All the spin-polarized DFT-D2 calculations were conducted in the ''Vienna ab initio simulation package\" (VASP code 5.4.1), using the generalized gradient correlation functional.The projector-augmented wave method was used with a plane-wave basis 33.The cut off energy and Gaussian smearing width were respectively set to 500 eV and 0.2 eV.The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 5 A 5 A 1 K points.All structures and energy are allowed to relax below 0.05 eV A A1 ."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The photocatalytic performances of CO 2 reduction over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst were evaluated by a gas closed circulation system with a continuous flow mode under Xe lamp irradiation of visible light (!420 nm).", "context": "3.1.Synthesis and structural characterizations of all-solid-state Zscheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst Fig. 1 shows the schematic of synthesis procedures of 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalysts.3DOM-TiO 2 C material was firstly compound by the improved method of CCT with anaerobic calcination in Ar.The CCT with opal structure is assembled by the centrifugation of monodispersed polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microsphere.During the anaerobic calcination process for removal of CCT at 600 C, tetrabutyl titanate as TiO 2 precursor is thermally decomposed to TiO 2 nanocrystal, and the PMMA microsphere template is thermally dehydrated and polymerized of the CAC bond to form a graphite carbon coating on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystal spontaneously.Thus, 3DOM carbon-coated TiO 2 (TiO 2 C) support was obtained.Supported Pt NPs on the inner wall of 3DOM-TiO 2 C (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) were elaborately fabricated by gas bubbling-assisted membrance reduction (GBMR) method (Fig. S1).The heterogenous nucleation and growth processes of supported Pt nanocrystals can be regulated by the homogeneous dispersion of reductant 34.The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, as the other isolated system, were assembled into the ordered macropore of Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C material by in-situ growth method with thermally anaerobic decomposition of urea.Finally, the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst of g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C was successfully fabricated, and the synthesis details can be found in the Experimental sections.and forms the slow photon effect for improving visible lightharvesting efficiency 22.High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst is shown in inset of Fig. 2a.It is observed that the pore wall is composed by carbon-coated TiO 2 nanocrystals.The interplanar crystal spacing of 3.5 A is corresponding to (1 0 1) crystal face of anatasetype TiO 2 353637 and TiO 2 nanocrystals are coated by the carbon layers with thickness of 1-2 molecular.The photograph (bottom of inset in Fig. 2a) exhibits its ash-black color, indicating the enhancing visible light-harvesting efficiency in comparison with the white color of TiO 2 shown in Fig. S2A.Fig. 2b shows the HAADF-STEM (high angle annular dark field scanning TEM) image of 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst.The porous wall of 3DOM material consists of a mass of nanocrystals with the sizes of 5-15 nm. Elemental compositions of one nanocrystal were analyzed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELs), and the EELs mapping are shown in Fig. 2c.Carbon element (red) evenly distributed on the surface of Ti (blue) and O (green) elements, further confirmed TiO 2 C core-shell structure is formed.It is observed clearly in Fig. 2d that after introduce Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, TEM image of 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst exhibits the perfect 3DOM structure.As shown in Fig. 2e, the spherical Pt NPs with interplanar crystal spacings of 2.3 A are evenly loaded on the pore wall of 3DOM-TiO 2 C.The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets are stacked into the inner pore of Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C via in-situ growth method, and are strongly interlinked with porous wall (simulated diagram in the top of Fig. 2e), which is beneficial to the transfer of photogenerated electrons (catalyst model in the bottom of Fig. 2e).In addtion, SEM and TEM images of other catalysts are shown in Figs.S3 andS4. To observe the phase structures of TiO 2 nanocrystal, carbon coating and g-C 3 N 4 in 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst, XRD and Raman spectra are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively.As shown in Fig. 3, the main diffraction peaks (2h) located at 25.4, 37.9, 48.1, 54.9 and 62.8, which is assigned to the (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (2 1 1) and (2 0 4) crystal facets of anatase-phase TiO 2 (PDF 21-1272), respectively.And two peaks located at 13.1 and 27.4are assigned to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets in the ternary 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalysts, which is consistent with the results of the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Fig. S5) 38,39.The absorption band located at 1639 cm A1 is assigned to the C-N stretching vibration modes, while the absorption peak centered at 3192 cm A1 can be originated from N-H stretching vibration modes, and four strong absorption bands situated at 1243, 1319, 1411, 1563 cm A1 are attributed to the typical stretching mode of CN heterocycle, respectively.And the characteristic breathing mode of triazine units was detected by FT-IR on the absorption band at 812 cm A1 .For 3DOM- (2) (517 cm A1 ), and E g(2) (638 cm A1 ) modes of anatase phase, respectively 40.For 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst, the characteristic band of Eg (1) mode has shifted obviously to 152 cm A1 , suggesting the carbon-doping into surface lattice of TiO 2 41.And two bands located at 1341 and 1580 cm A1 are clearly observed, which are attributed to D-band and G-band of the graphitized carbon layers, respectively 42,43.For ternary 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst, the relatively intensity of D/Gbands is higher than those of other catalysts, indicating that g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets grown in-situ increases the defect site density of graphene-coated layers because of the vectorial transfer of electron at the ternary interface 44. To explore the electronic states of Pt NPs in compositions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Pt in Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC is shown in Fig. 5 and the contents of different valence states are listed in the Table S1.According to the standard principle, the deconvolutions of spectra were divided.The binding energy increases with the promotion of the valence state, so the lowest binding energy (70.2 and 73.5 eV) corresponds to the metallic (Pt 0 ) and the highest binding energy (74.1 and 76.9 eV) corresponds to the ionic (Pt 4 ).According to the spectra, the intermediate transition valence state (Pt 2 ) also exists, corresponding to the binding energies of 71.2 and 74.8 eV 45.The presence of ionic Pt (Pt 2 and Pt 4 ) species indicates that Pt NPs were taken away a certain number of electrons in the process of synthesis and the formation of new chemical interactions.The surface density of ionic Pt species increases from 31.8 (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) to 67.1 (3DOM-CNPTC), indicating the strong electron delivery from Pt to g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets in CNPTC catalyst 46.It is attributed to the strong interaction between Pt NPs as an electron-donating and circumambient TiO 2 nanocrystals or g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.It confirms the possibility that Pt NPs can be utilized as an intermediate path for electron transmission in the ternary 3DOM-CNPTC system 47.duction of carbon coating, 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst displays the stronger absorption efficiency for visible light (400-800 nm) compared with 3DOM-TiO 2 , which is attributed to the formation of p-p conjugated structure at the interface between TiO 2 and graphitized carbon layers for improving light-harvesting efficiency 48,49.As the synergistic effect of two systems, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has a strong absorption spectrum in the range of UV-Visible light.The absorption peak around 390 nm is particularly prominent, which is superimposed by the absorption peak of g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Furthermore, the separation efficiency of photoinduced electrons and holes is another important factor to improve the photochemical conversion efficiency 50. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the charge-transfer property over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.As shown in Fig. 6b, 3DOM TiO 2 exhibits the strongest PL emission peak at 580 nm, indicating that a large number of photogenerated electrons and holes have recombined.For 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst, its intensity of PL emission peak decreases obviously, suggesting that carbon-coated layers enhance the effective charge separation ability.After introduction of Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows the weakest PL emission peak, indicating that ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C heterjunctions boost the separation efficiency and restrain the recombination of photoelectrons and holes 51.In order to better understand the charge transfer of 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts, the electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range of 10,000-0.1 Hz at A0.74 V vs. RHE was detected.Nyquist plots of 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts are in Fig. S7A (irradiation 100 mW cm A2 ).The equivalent circuit and parameters are shown in Fig. S8 and Table S2.The diameter of the spectra is proportional to the charge transfer resistance (Rct), which represents the charge transfer capacity between the catalysts and the reactants.It is well-known that the smaller arc radius, the lesser obstruction of electrons-holes transferring.As shown, obtains the smallest value at 3DOM-CNPTC, which indicate the 3DOM-CNPTC obtains more effective separation of photogenerated electronhole pairs.Under condition of visible-light irradiation, the Rct value of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst is much smaller than that of in the dark, suggesting that the large amount of photogenerated electrons and holes are generated and transferred rapidly under visible-light illumination (Fig. S7B).Based on the results of UV-Vis DRS and PL spectra, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst with ternary synergy effect shows the optimal visible-light-harvesting efficiency and separation efficiency of photoelectrons and holes.Moreover, photogenerated electrons and holes will be transferred to the catalyst surface and interact with CO 2 at the two-phase interface. The photocatalytic performances of CO 2 reduction over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst were evaluated by a gas closed circulation system with a continuous flow mode under Xe lamp irradiation of visible light (!420 nm).And the gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC).The performances of the photocatalysts for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction with H 2 O are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1.The amount of catalysts used in the photoreaction is 0.1 g.Photocatalytically splitting H 2 O into H 2 is a competitive reaction in CO 2 reduction, and it's also the source of protons for CH 4 product 52.To comparison with the photocatalytic activities reported by other researchers, it is generally accepted that the commercial P25 was used as the reference sample due to its good photocatalytic performance and uniform crystal phase structure.Herein, commercial P25 purchased from Degussa (Co., Germany) was used to the reference catalyst, which composes of anatase (80) and rutile (20) with its average particle size of 21 nm.Compared to P25 and 3DOM-TiO 2 , 3DOM-TiO 2 C displays the higher CO 2 photoreduction catalytic activity, i.e., the formation rates of CO and CH 4 are 0.87 and 0.21 lmol h A1 , respectively.It indicates that the carbon-coated layers can enhance photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 catalyst.After introduce supported Pt NPs, the formation rates of H 2 and CH 4 products over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst increases to 2.28 and 1.56 lmol h A1 , respectively.And its selectivity for CO 2 reduction is the lowest (75.6) except for P25.It suggests that Pt NPs as electron-rich sites are beneficial for promoting the formation of H-containing products and improv- ing the rate of multi-electron and proton process (CH 4 selectivity, 64.4).Pure g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets show the high formation rate of CO (2.46 lmol h A1 ) and selectivity for CO 2 reduction (96.7), while its formation rate and selectivity of CH 4 product is the lowest.It may be related to the good adsorption and activation properties of pure g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reactant.And the binary synergetic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C in g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst improves remarkably the formation rate of CO product (2.76 lmol h A1 ), indicating that g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets have excellent activation property for CO 2 molecule and restrain the formation of H-containing products due to low surface photoelectron density.In order to increase the surface electron-rich density, Pt NPs are assembled into the middle between g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C.The ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst exhibits the largest formation rate of CH 4 product (6.56 lmol h A1 ) and the highest selectivity for CO 2 reduction (97.1) compared with single and binary catalysts, which is 130-fold of commercial P25.The selectivity of CH 4 product increases from 2 (g-C 3 N 4 ) to 81.7 (3DOM-CNPTC), indicating that the synergy effect of ternary components is beneficial for improving the selectivity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 .For the reaction of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, the oxidation product is O 2 .Based on the formation rates of reduction products (CH 4 , CO and H 2 ), the theoretical formation rate of O 2 were calculated and shown in Table S3.The stoichiometric formation rate of O 2 was approximately equal to the practical formation rate of O 2 , indicating that H 2 O was only electron donor during the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 . It is significant to explore the utilization efficiency of solar energy, an important parameter for the evaluation of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O 53.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is used to calculate the conversion rate of light energy to chemical energy in the whole CO 2 reduction process by the equation: AQE 2n(CO) 8n(CH 4 )/Number of incident photons A 100.As demonstrated in Table 1, the AQE value of 3DOM-TiO 2 specimen (0.05) is higher than that of P25 (0.04), meaning the utilization efficiency of photoelectrons of photonic crystal structure in 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst enhanced.After combined carbon coating with 3DOM-TiO 2 to form composites, the AQE value of sample is 0.26, indicating that carbon-coated layers on TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost solar energy utilization efficiency.For the Z-schemetype ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, the AQE values further increase, and 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has the largest apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) value (5.67), which is more than 140-fold of commercial P25.It suggests that 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has high solar energy utilization efficiency, which is attributed to the properties of high-efficient visible-light harvesting and photogenerated carries separation. Based on the remarkable photocatalytic reduction CO 2 performance, it is crucial to investigate the stability of 3DOM-CNPTC cat-alyst by the cycle tests for CO 2 reduction, and the result is shown in Fig. S9.It can be clearly seen that the yield of the products in ten repetitions presented no obvious change, which exhibited the commendable cyclic stability of as-prepared 3DOM-CNPTC.The structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC was also obtained, the SEM and TEM images of the samples after reaction are shown in Figs.S10 andS11, respectively.The nanostructure of all-solidstate Z-scheme-type ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C system and the particle size of supported Pt NPs are as similar as the initial samples, indicating the good structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.Additionally, a series of blank examinations were carried out in the absence of illumination, catalysts, and reactants (CO 2 and H 2 O).At this time, the products CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction were not detected.It indicates that the three essential elements of reaction, light, catalyst and reactant are indispensable to the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.To demonstrate the source of carbon and hydrogen elements in the reaction products, the isotopic tracing CO 2 reduction of containing 13 C and 2 H(D) reactants by GC-MS were shown in Fig. S12.The peaks located at the m/z of 21 and 29 are assigned to 13 CD 4 and 13 CO products, respectively.As shown in Fig. S12C, during photocatalytic 13 CO 2 reduction with D 2 O after 8 h irradiation, the amounts of isotopic 13 CD 4 , 13 CO and D 2 products over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst obtained by GC-MS are close to the results obtained by GC.The isotopic tracing experiment of 13 C and D indicates that the carbon and hydrogen elements in the product of CO and CH 4 originate from CO 2 and H 2 O, respectively.It satisfies three requirements for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as follows: Confirming the source of carbon in CO 2 reduction products; determining the relative amount of H 2 and CO 2 reduction products; checking the stoichiometric O 2 in Table S3 54. It is helpful to reveal the reaction mechanism of catalysts by investigating the selectivity of reaction products.The processes of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction involve three crucial steps: the photoexcitation of charges, the separation and transfer of electrons and holes, and the capture of reactants on the catalyst surface 55.The first two steps determine the charge density transferred to the reaction interface, while the latter step is concerned with the activation and the surface density of the reactants.The survey of the above two points are indispensable to reveal the structure-activity relationship of catalysts. The activation property of the reactants on the catalyst surface will affect the direction of the CO 2 reduction reaction.The efficiency of CO 2 reduction reaction is closely related to the surface concentration of CO 2 on the catalyst.For investigating surface enrichment of adsorbed CO 2 , Fig. 8b exhibits the CO 2 -TPD curves Table 1 The formation rates, the selectivity of CO and CH 4 productions and the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 with H 2 O over 3DOM-TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts. Formation 1 that the CO 2 reduction selectivity of catalysts containing g-C 3 N 4 are higher than 90.Therefore, the catalysts with g-C 3 N 4 will obtain a high CO 2 reduction efficiency due to the large amount of CO 2 adsorbed on its surface.In addition, the conduction band (CB) of the photocatalyst should be lower than the reduction potential of the desired reaction, that is, the formation potential of CO (Eq.1: CO 2 2H 2e CO H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CO) A0.53V) and the formation potential of CH 4 (Eq.2: CO 2 8H 8e CH 4 H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) A0.24V) 56.The 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts can reduce CO 2 to CH 4 and CO because the conduction positions of TiO 2 (A0.56 V vs. NHE at pH 7) and g-C 3 N 4 (A1.30V vs. NHE at pH 7) match with the potential requirements 55.For CB potential position, it is observed that the g-C 3 N 4 material is more prone to CO 2 reduction compared to the 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst.Moreover, because of the E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) value is more negative than E h (CO 2 /CO), it seems easily achieve the photoconversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .But the CO 2 reduction reaction to CH 4 requires eight electrons and eight protons, a luxury compared with the two required for CO 57.Therefore, the surface enrichment of electrons and protons considerably affects the catalytic performance and selectivity of CO 2 photoconversion. As shown in Fig. 8a, the transient photocurrent responses of the catalysts were investigated, in order to further investigate the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons.The photocurrent density of 3DOM TiO 2 C support is higher than 3DOM-TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 catalysts, indicating that the carbon-coated layers on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost the transportation of photogenerated electrons.After introduce Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 , the photocurrent densities over binary Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts are improved obviously compared with those of single component catalysts.3DOM-CNPTC catalyst exhibits fast, repeatable and the highest intensity of transient photocurrent responses in the cycling processes of light on and off, indicating that all-solid-state Z-scheme structure improves the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons and is beneficial to promote the reaction of eight electrons (CH 4 formation) 58.In addition to the photogenerated electrons, the protons are the ultimate contributor to the formation of methane.It is well known that platinum is an excellent cocatalyst for water cracking reaction.Proton is an important resource in CO 2 hydrogenation, which is mainly provided by water cracking reaction.Consequently, the foramtion rate of CH 4 product over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was higher than those of 3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Thus, the introduced Pt nanoparticles play a crucial role in promoting the process of CO 2 hydrogenation. To sum up, high electron density, proton supply and CO 2 adsorption are the three necessary factors for the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .Pure g-C 3 N 4 can effectively improve the reaction efficiency of CO 2 reduction.However, due to the lack of protons supply, the reduction product was still dominated by CO product, even the high electron density was obtained by combining with 3DOM-TiO 2 C (g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C).The selectivity of CO 2 reduction over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was only 75 because of the limitation surface concentration of CO 2 .An efficient Z-scheme reaction system with Pt nanoparticles as electron transport medium was successfully constructed, and a high electron density was obtained.Thus, all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows outstanding conversion efficiency for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 . To insight into the transfer of photogenerated electron during CO 2 reduction, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed, and the optimized model of all-solid-state Zscheme CNPTC structure is shown in Fig. S16.As shown in Fig. 9, the covalent heterojunctions appear at the interface between TiO 2 C, Pt and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.The unstable electrons generated by photoexcitation of TiO 2 C are eager to react or transfer to a lower band position to reduce its high reduction potential.Carbon-coated layers are employed as an interfacial conduction layer 59 and the relatively middle potential of Pt NPs sets up a step between conduction band of TiO 2 to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 .The Z-scheme of CNPTC catalyst was built by the recombination of charges on conduction band of TiO B) ?Pt ?g-C 3 N 4 (VB).According to the above experimental results, the mechanism of all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction is proposed (Fig. 10).All-solidstate Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst absorbs photons to generate photoelectrons and holes.The photoelectrons derived from photoexcited TiO 2 C are captured by the carbon-coated layers and transfer to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 via Pt NPs.Further photoelectrons on conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 enriched by N-sites located at the interface of Pt and g-C 3 N 4 .Finally, photoelectrons react with absorbed CO 2 and H 2 O into the target products (CO and CH 4 ), and the holes stayed in valence band of TiO 2 C oxidize H 2 O to O 2 .The formation rate and selectivity of CH 4 product depend on the surface enrichment of electrons and CO 2 molecule."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Visible light", "source": "As the synergistic effect of two systems, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has a strong absorption spectrum in the range of UV-Visible light.", "context": "3.1.Synthesis and structural characterizations of all-solid-state Zscheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst Fig. 1 shows the schematic of synthesis procedures of 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalysts.3DOM-TiO 2 C material was firstly compound by the improved method of CCT with anaerobic calcination in Ar.The CCT with opal structure is assembled by the centrifugation of monodispersed polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microsphere.During the anaerobic calcination process for removal of CCT at 600 C, tetrabutyl titanate as TiO 2 precursor is thermally decomposed to TiO 2 nanocrystal, and the PMMA microsphere template is thermally dehydrated and polymerized of the CAC bond to form a graphite carbon coating on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystal spontaneously.Thus, 3DOM carbon-coated TiO 2 (TiO 2 C) support was obtained.Supported Pt NPs on the inner wall of 3DOM-TiO 2 C (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) were elaborately fabricated by gas bubbling-assisted membrance reduction (GBMR) method (Fig. S1).The heterogenous nucleation and growth processes of supported Pt nanocrystals can be regulated by the homogeneous dispersion of reductant 34.The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, as the other isolated system, were assembled into the ordered macropore of Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C material by in-situ growth method with thermally anaerobic decomposition of urea.Finally, the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst of g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C was successfully fabricated, and the synthesis details can be found in the Experimental sections.and forms the slow photon effect for improving visible lightharvesting efficiency 22.High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst is shown in inset of Fig. 2a.It is observed that the pore wall is composed by carbon-coated TiO 2 nanocrystals.The interplanar crystal spacing of 3.5 A is corresponding to (1 0 1) crystal face of anatasetype TiO 2 353637 and TiO 2 nanocrystals are coated by the carbon layers with thickness of 1-2 molecular.The photograph (bottom of inset in Fig. 2a) exhibits its ash-black color, indicating the enhancing visible light-harvesting efficiency in comparison with the white color of TiO 2 shown in Fig. S2A.Fig. 2b shows the HAADF-STEM (high angle annular dark field scanning TEM) image of 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst.The porous wall of 3DOM material consists of a mass of nanocrystals with the sizes of 5-15 nm.

To observe the phase structures of TiO 2 nanocrystal, carbon coating and g-C 3 N 4 in 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst, XRD and Raman spectra are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively.As shown in Fig. 3, the main diffraction peaks (2h) located at 25.4, 37.9, 48.1, 54.9 and 62.8, which is assigned to the (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (2 1 1) and (2 0 4) crystal facets of anatase-phase TiO 2 (PDF 21-1272), respectively.And two peaks located at 13.1 and 27.4are assigned to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets in the ternary 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalysts, which is consistent with the results of the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Fig. S5) 38,39.The absorption band located at 1639 cm A1 is assigned to the C-N stretching vibration modes, while the absorption peak centered at 3192 cm A1 can be originated from N-H stretching vibration modes, and four strong absorption bands situated at 1243, 1319, 1411, 1563 cm A1 are attributed to the typical stretching mode of CN heterocycle, respectively.And the characteristic breathing mode of triazine units was detected by FT-IR on the absorption band at 812 cm A1 .For 3DOM- (2) (517 cm A1 ), and E g(2) (638 cm A1 ) modes of anatase phase, respectively 40.For 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst, the characteristic band of Eg (1) mode has shifted obviously to 152 cm A1 , suggesting the carbon-doping into surface lattice of TiO 2 41.And two bands located at 1341 and 1580 cm A1 are clearly observed, which are attributed to D-band and G-band of the graphitized carbon layers, respectively 42,43.For ternary 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst, the relatively intensity of D/Gbands is higher than those of other catalysts, indicating that g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets grown in-situ increases the defect site density of graphene-coated layers because of the vectorial transfer of electron at the ternary interface 44. To explore the electronic states of Pt NPs in compositions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Pt in Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC is shown in Fig. 5 and the contents of different valence states are listed in the Table S1.According to the standard principle, the deconvolutions of spectra were divided.The binding energy increases with the promotion of the valence state, so the lowest binding energy (70.2 and 73.5 eV) corresponds to the metallic (Pt 0 ) and the highest binding energy (74.1 and 76.9 eV) corresponds to the ionic (Pt 4 ).According to the spectra, the intermediate transition valence state (Pt 2 ) also exists, corresponding to the binding energies of 71.2 and 74.8 eV 45.The presence of ionic Pt (Pt 2 and Pt 4 ) species indicates that Pt NPs were taken away a certain number of electrons in the process of synthesis and the formation of new chemical interactions.The surface density of ionic Pt species increases from 31.8 (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) to 67.1 (3DOM-CNPTC), indicating the strong electron delivery from Pt to g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets in CNPTC catalyst 46.It is attributed to the strong interaction between Pt NPs as an electron-donating and circumambient TiO 2 nanocrystals or g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.It confirms the possibility that Pt NPs can be utilized as an intermediate path for electron transmission in the ternary 3DOM-CNPTC system 47.duction of carbon coating, 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst displays the stronger absorption efficiency for visible light (400-800 nm) compared with 3DOM-TiO 2 , which is attributed to the formation of p-p conjugated structure at the interface between TiO 2 and graphitized carbon layers for improving light-harvesting efficiency 48,49.As the synergistic effect of two systems, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has a strong absorption spectrum in the range of UV-Visible light.The absorption peak around 390 nm is particularly prominent, which is superimposed by the absorption peak of g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Furthermore, the separation efficiency of photoinduced electrons and holes is another important factor to improve the photochemical conversion efficiency 50. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the charge-transfer property over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.As shown in Fig. 6b, 3DOM TiO 2 exhibits the strongest PL emission peak at 580 nm, indicating that a large number of photogenerated electrons and holes have recombined.For 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst, its intensity of PL emission peak decreases obviously, suggesting that carbon-coated layers enhance the effective charge separation ability.After introduction of Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows the weakest PL emission peak, indicating that ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C heterjunctions boost the separation efficiency and restrain the recombination of photoelectrons and holes 51.In order to better understand the charge transfer of 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts, the electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range of 10,000-0.1 Hz at A0.74 V vs. RHE was detected.Nyquist plots of 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts are in Fig. S7A (irradiation 100 mW cm A2 ).The equivalent circuit and parameters are shown in Fig. S8 and Table S2.The diameter of the spectra is proportional to the charge transfer resistance (Rct), which represents the charge transfer capacity between the catalysts and the reactants.It is well-known that the smaller arc radius, the lesser obstruction of electrons-holes transferring.As shown, obtains the smallest value at 3DOM-CNPTC, which indicate the 3DOM-CNPTC obtains more effective separation of photogenerated electronhole pairs.Under condition of visible-light irradiation, the Rct value of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst is much smaller than that of in the dark, suggesting that the large amount of photogenerated electrons and holes are generated and transferred rapidly under visible-light illumination (Fig. S7B).Based on the results of UV-Vis DRS and PL spectra, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst with ternary synergy effect shows the optimal visible-light-harvesting efficiency and separation efficiency of photoelectrons and holes.Moreover, photogenerated electrons and holes will be transferred to the catalyst surface and interact with CO 2 at the two-phase interface.

It is significant to explore the utilization efficiency of solar energy, an important parameter for the evaluation of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O 53.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is used to calculate the conversion rate of light energy to chemical energy in the whole CO 2 reduction process by the equation: AQE 2n(CO) 8n(CH 4 )/Number of incident photons A 100.As demonstrated in Table 1, the AQE value of 3DOM-TiO 2 specimen (0.05) is higher than that of P25 (0.04), meaning the utilization efficiency of photoelectrons of photonic crystal structure in 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst enhanced.After combined carbon coating with 3DOM-TiO 2 to form composites, the AQE value of sample is 0.26, indicating that carbon-coated layers on TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost solar energy utilization efficiency.For the Z-schemetype ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, the AQE values further increase, and 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has the largest apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) value (5.67), which is more than 140-fold of commercial P25.It suggests that 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has high solar energy utilization efficiency, which is attributed to the properties of high-efficient visible-light harvesting and photogenerated carries separation. Based on the remarkable photocatalytic reduction CO 2 performance, it is crucial to investigate the stability of 3DOM-CNPTC cat-alyst by the cycle tests for CO 2 reduction, and the result is shown in Fig. S9.It can be clearly seen that the yield of the products in ten repetitions presented no obvious change, which exhibited the commendable cyclic stability of as-prepared 3DOM-CNPTC.The structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC was also obtained, the SEM and TEM images of the samples after reaction are shown in Figs.S10 andS11, respectively.The nanostructure of all-solidstate Z-scheme-type ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C system and the particle size of supported Pt NPs are as similar as the initial samples, indicating the good structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.Additionally, a series of blank examinations were carried out in the absence of illumination, catalysts, and reactants (CO 2 and H 2 O).At this time, the products CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction were not detected.It indicates that the three essential elements of reaction, light, catalyst and reactant are indispensable to the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.To demonstrate the source of carbon and hydrogen elements in the reaction products, the isotopic tracing CO 2 reduction of containing 13 C and 2 H(D) reactants by GC-MS were shown in Fig. S12.The peaks located at the m/z of 21 and 29 are assigned to 13 CD 4 and 13 CO products, respectively.As shown in Fig. S12C, during photocatalytic 13 CO 2 reduction with D 2 O after 8 h irradiation, the amounts of isotopic 13 CD 4 , 13 CO and D 2 products over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst obtained by GC-MS are close to the results obtained by GC.The isotopic tracing experiment of 13 C and D indicates that the carbon and hydrogen elements in the product of CO and CH 4 originate from CO 2 and H 2 O, respectively.It satisfies three requirements for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as follows: Confirming the source of carbon in CO 2 reduction products; determining the relative amount of H 2 and CO 2 reduction products; checking the stoichiometric O 2 in Table S3 54. It is helpful to reveal the reaction mechanism of catalysts by investigating the selectivity of reaction products.The processes of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction involve three crucial steps: the photoexcitation of charges, the separation and transfer of electrons and holes, and the capture of reactants on the catalyst surface 55.The first two steps determine the charge density transferred to the reaction interface, while the latter step is concerned with the activation and the surface density of the reactants.The survey of the above two points are indispensable to reveal the structure-activity relationship of catalysts. The activation property of the reactants on the catalyst surface will affect the direction of the CO 2 reduction reaction.The efficiency of CO 2 reduction reaction is closely related to the surface concentration of CO 2 on the catalyst.For investigating surface enrichment of adsorbed CO 2 , Fig. 8b exhibits the CO 2 -TPD curves Table 1 The formation rates, the selectivity of CO and CH 4 productions and the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 with H 2 O over 3DOM-TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts. Formation 1 that the CO 2 reduction selectivity of catalysts containing g-C 3 N 4 are higher than 90.Therefore, the catalysts with g-C 3 N 4 will obtain a high CO 2 reduction efficiency due to the large amount of CO 2 adsorbed on its surface.In addition, the conduction band (CB) of the photocatalyst should be lower than the reduction potential of the desired reaction, that is, the formation potential of CO (Eq.1: CO 2 2H 2e CO H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CO) A0.53V) and the formation potential of CH 4 (Eq.2: CO 2 8H 8e CH 4 H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) A0.24V) 56.The 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts can reduce CO 2 to CH 4 and CO because the conduction positions of TiO 2 (A0.56 V vs. NHE at pH 7) and g-C 3 N 4 (A1.30V vs. NHE at pH 7) match with the potential requirements 55.For CB potential position, it is observed that the g-C 3 N 4 material is more prone to CO 2 reduction compared to the 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst.Moreover, because of the E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) value is more negative than E h (CO 2 /CO), it seems easily achieve the photoconversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .But the CO 2 reduction reaction to CH 4 requires eight electrons and eight protons, a luxury compared with the two required for CO 57.Therefore, the surface enrichment of electrons and protons considerably affects the catalytic performance and selectivity of CO 2 photoconversion. As shown in Fig. 8a, the transient photocurrent responses of the catalysts were investigated, in order to further investigate the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons.The photocurrent density of 3DOM TiO 2 C support is higher than 3DOM-TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 catalysts, indicating that the carbon-coated layers on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost the transportation of photogenerated electrons.After introduce Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 , the photocurrent densities over binary Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts are improved obviously compared with those of single component catalysts.3DOM-CNPTC catalyst exhibits fast, repeatable and the highest intensity of transient photocurrent responses in the cycling processes of light on and off, indicating that all-solid-state Z-scheme structure improves the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons and is beneficial to promote the reaction of eight electrons (CH 4 formation) 58.In addition to the photogenerated electrons, the protons are the ultimate contributor to the formation of methane.It is well known that platinum is an excellent cocatalyst for water cracking reaction.Proton is an important resource in CO 2 hydrogenation, which is mainly provided by water cracking reaction.Consequently, the foramtion rate of CH 4 product over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was higher than those of 3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Thus, the introduced Pt nanoparticles play a crucial role in promoting the process of CO 2 hydrogenation. To sum up, high electron density, proton supply and CO 2 adsorption are the three necessary factors for the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .Pure g-C 3 N 4 can effectively improve the reaction efficiency of CO 2 reduction.However, due to the lack of protons supply, the reduction product was still dominated by CO product, even the high electron density was obtained by combining with 3DOM-TiO 2 C (g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C).The selectivity of CO 2 reduction over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was only 75 because of the limitation surface concentration of CO 2 .An efficient Z-scheme reaction system with Pt nanoparticles as electron transport medium was successfully constructed, and a high electron density was obtained.Thus, all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows outstanding conversion efficiency for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 . To insight into the transfer of photogenerated electron during CO 2 reduction, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed, and the optimized model of all-solid-state Zscheme CNPTC structure is shown in Fig. S16.As shown in Fig. 9, the covalent heterojunctions appear at the interface between TiO 2 C, Pt and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.The unstable electrons generated by photoexcitation of TiO 2 C are eager to react or transfer to a lower band position to reduce its high reduction potential.Carbon-coated layers are employed as an interfacial conduction layer 59 and the relatively middle potential of Pt NPs sets up a step between conduction band of TiO 2 to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 .The Z-scheme of CNPTC catalyst was built by the recombination of charges on conduction band of TiO B) ?Pt ?g-C 3 N 4 (VB).According to the above experimental results, the mechanism of all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction is proposed (Fig. 10).All-solidstate Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst absorbs photons to generate photoelectrons and holes.The photoelectrons derived from photoexcited TiO 2 C are captured by the carbon-coated layers and transfer to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 via Pt NPs.Further photoelectrons on conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 enriched by N-sites located at the interface of Pt and g-C 3 N 4 .Finally, photoelectrons react with absorbed CO 2 and H 2 O into the target products (CO and CH 4 ), and the holes stayed in valence band of TiO 2 C oxidize H 2 O to O 2 .The formation rate and selectivity of CH 4 product depend on the surface enrichment of electrons and CO 2 molecule."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "Based on the results of UV-Vis DRS and PL spectra, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst with ternary synergy effect shows the optimal visible-light-harvesting efficiency and separation efficiency of photoelectrons and holes.", "context": "3.1.Synthesis and structural characterizations of all-solid-state Zscheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst Fig. 1 shows the schematic of synthesis procedures of 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalysts.3DOM-TiO 2 C material was firstly compound by the improved method of CCT with anaerobic calcination in Ar.The CCT with opal structure is assembled by the centrifugation of monodispersed polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microsphere.During the anaerobic calcination process for removal of CCT at 600 C, tetrabutyl titanate as TiO 2 precursor is thermally decomposed to TiO 2 nanocrystal, and the PMMA microsphere template is thermally dehydrated and polymerized of the CAC bond to form a graphite carbon coating on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystal spontaneously.Thus, 3DOM carbon-coated TiO 2 (TiO 2 C) support was obtained.Supported Pt NPs on the inner wall of 3DOM-TiO 2 C (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) were elaborately fabricated by gas bubbling-assisted membrance reduction (GBMR) method (Fig. S1).The heterogenous nucleation and growth processes of supported Pt nanocrystals can be regulated by the homogeneous dispersion of reductant 34.The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, as the other isolated system, were assembled into the ordered macropore of Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C material by in-situ growth method with thermally anaerobic decomposition of urea.Finally, the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst of g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C was successfully fabricated, and the synthesis details can be found in the Experimental sections.and forms the slow photon effect for improving visible lightharvesting efficiency 22.High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst is shown in inset of Fig. 2a.It is observed that the pore wall is composed by carbon-coated TiO 2 nanocrystals.The interplanar crystal spacing of 3.5 A is corresponding to (1 0 1) crystal face of anatasetype TiO 2 353637 and TiO 2 nanocrystals are coated by the carbon layers with thickness of 1-2 molecular.The photograph (bottom of inset in Fig. 2a) exhibits its ash-black color, indicating the enhancing visible light-harvesting efficiency in comparison with the white color of TiO 2 shown in Fig. S2A.Fig. 2b shows the HAADF-STEM (high angle annular dark field scanning TEM) image of 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst.The porous wall of 3DOM material consists of a mass of nanocrystals with the sizes of 5-15 nm. Elemental compositions of one nanocrystal were analyzed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELs), and the EELs mapping are shown in Fig. 2c.Carbon element (red) evenly distributed on the surface of Ti (blue) and O (green) elements, further confirmed TiO 2 C core-shell structure is formed.It is observed clearly in Fig. 2d that after introduce Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, TEM image of 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst exhibits the perfect 3DOM structure.As shown in Fig. 2e, the spherical Pt NPs with interplanar crystal spacings of 2.3 A are evenly loaded on the pore wall of 3DOM-TiO 2 C.The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets are stacked into the inner pore of Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C via in-situ growth method, and are strongly interlinked with porous wall (simulated diagram in the top of Fig. 2e), which is beneficial to the transfer of photogenerated electrons (catalyst model in the bottom of Fig. 2e).In addtion, SEM and TEM images of other catalysts are shown in Figs.S3 andS4. To observe the phase structures of TiO 2 nanocrystal, carbon coating and g-C 3 N 4 in 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst, XRD and Raman spectra are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively.As shown in Fig. 3, the main diffraction peaks (2h) located at 25.4, 37.9, 48.1, 54.9 and 62.8, which is assigned to the (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (2 1 1) and (2 0 4) crystal facets of anatase-phase TiO 2 (PDF 21-1272), respectively.And two peaks located at 13.1 and 27.4are assigned to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets in the ternary 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalysts, which is consistent with the results of the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Fig. S5) 38,39.The absorption band located at 1639 cm A1 is assigned to the C-N stretching vibration modes, while the absorption peak centered at 3192 cm A1 can be originated from N-H stretching vibration modes, and four strong absorption bands situated at 1243, 1319, 1411, 1563 cm A1 are attributed to the typical stretching mode of CN heterocycle, respectively.And the characteristic breathing mode of triazine units was detected by FT-IR on the absorption band at 812 cm A1 .For 3DOM- (2) (517 cm A1 ), and E g(2) (638 cm A1 ) modes of anatase phase, respectively 40.For 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst, the characteristic band of Eg (1) mode has shifted obviously to 152 cm A1 , suggesting the carbon-doping into surface lattice of TiO 2 41.And two bands located at 1341 and 1580 cm A1 are clearly observed, which are attributed to D-band and G-band of the graphitized carbon layers, respectively 42,43.For ternary 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst, the relatively intensity of D/Gbands is higher than those of other catalysts, indicating that g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets grown in-situ increases the defect site density of graphene-coated layers because of the vectorial transfer of electron at the ternary interface 44. To explore the electronic states of Pt NPs in compositions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Pt in Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC is shown in Fig. 5 and the contents of different valence states are listed in the Table S1.According to the standard principle, the deconvolutions of spectra were divided.The binding energy increases with the promotion of the valence state, so the lowest binding energy (70.2 and 73.5 eV) corresponds to the metallic (Pt 0 ) and the highest binding energy (74.1 and 76.9 eV) corresponds to the ionic (Pt 4 ).According to the spectra, the intermediate transition valence state (Pt 2 ) also exists, corresponding to the binding energies of 71.2 and 74.8 eV 45.The presence of ionic Pt (Pt 2 and Pt 4 ) species indicates that Pt NPs were taken away a certain number of electrons in the process of synthesis and the formation of new chemical interactions.The surface density of ionic Pt species increases from 31.8 (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) to 67.1 (3DOM-CNPTC), indicating the strong electron delivery from Pt to g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets in CNPTC catalyst 46.It is attributed to the strong interaction between Pt NPs as an electron-donating and circumambient TiO 2 nanocrystals or g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.It confirms the possibility that Pt NPs can be utilized as an intermediate path for electron transmission in the ternary 3DOM-CNPTC system 47.duction of carbon coating, 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst displays the stronger absorption efficiency for visible light (400-800 nm) compared with 3DOM-TiO 2 , which is attributed to the formation of p-p conjugated structure at the interface between TiO 2 and graphitized carbon layers for improving light-harvesting efficiency 48,49.As the synergistic effect of two systems, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has a strong absorption spectrum in the range of UV-Visible light.The absorption peak around 390 nm is particularly prominent, which is superimposed by the absorption peak of g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Furthermore, the separation efficiency of photoinduced electrons and holes is another important factor to improve the photochemical conversion efficiency 50. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the charge-transfer property over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.As shown in Fig. 6b, 3DOM TiO 2 exhibits the strongest PL emission peak at 580 nm, indicating that a large number of photogenerated electrons and holes have recombined.For 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst, its intensity of PL emission peak decreases obviously, suggesting that carbon-coated layers enhance the effective charge separation ability.After introduction of Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows the weakest PL emission peak, indicating that ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C heterjunctions boost the separation efficiency and restrain the recombination of photoelectrons and holes 51.In order to better understand the charge transfer of 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts, the electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range of 10,000-0.1 Hz at A0.74 V vs. RHE was detected.Nyquist plots of 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts are in Fig. S7A (irradiation 100 mW cm A2 ).The equivalent circuit and parameters are shown in Fig. S8 and Table S2.The diameter of the spectra is proportional to the charge transfer resistance (Rct), which represents the charge transfer capacity between the catalysts and the reactants.It is well-known that the smaller arc radius, the lesser obstruction of electrons-holes transferring.As shown, obtains the smallest value at 3DOM-CNPTC, which indicate the 3DOM-CNPTC obtains more effective separation of photogenerated electronhole pairs.Under condition of visible-light irradiation, the Rct value of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst is much smaller than that of in the dark, suggesting that the large amount of photogenerated electrons and holes are generated and transferred rapidly under visible-light illumination (Fig. S7B).Based on the results of UV-Vis DRS and PL spectra, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst with ternary synergy effect shows the optimal visible-light-harvesting efficiency and separation efficiency of photoelectrons and holes.Moreover, photogenerated electrons and holes will be transferred to the catalyst surface and interact with CO 2 at the two-phase interface. The photocatalytic performances of CO 2 reduction over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst were evaluated by a gas closed circulation system with a continuous flow mode under Xe lamp irradiation of visible light (!420 nm).And the gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC).The performances of the photocatalysts for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction with H 2 O are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1.The amount of catalysts used in the photoreaction is 0.1 g.Photocatalytically splitting H 2 O into H 2 is a competitive reaction in CO 2 reduction, and it's also the source of protons for CH 4 product 52.To comparison with the photocatalytic activities reported by other researchers, it is generally accepted that the commercial P25 was used as the reference sample due to its good photocatalytic performance and uniform crystal phase structure.Herein, commercial P25 purchased from Degussa (Co., Germany) was used to the reference catalyst, which composes of anatase (80) and rutile (20) with its average particle size of 21 nm.Compared to P25 and 3DOM-TiO 2 , 3DOM-TiO 2 C displays the higher CO 2 photoreduction catalytic activity, i.e., the formation rates of CO and CH 4 are 0.87 and 0.21 lmol h A1 , respectively.It indicates that the carbon-coated layers can enhance photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 catalyst.After introduce supported Pt NPs, the formation rates of H 2 and CH 4 products over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst increases to 2.28 and 1.56 lmol h A1 , respectively.And its selectivity for CO 2 reduction is the lowest (75.6) except for P25.It suggests that Pt NPs as electron-rich sites are beneficial for promoting the formation of H-containing products and improv- ing the rate of multi-electron and proton process (CH 4 selectivity, 64.4).Pure g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets show the high formation rate of CO (2.46 lmol h A1 ) and selectivity for CO 2 reduction (96.7), while its formation rate and selectivity of CH 4 product is the lowest.It may be related to the good adsorption and activation properties of pure g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reactant.And the binary synergetic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C in g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst improves remarkably the formation rate of CO product (2.76 lmol h A1 ), indicating that g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets have excellent activation property for CO 2 molecule and restrain the formation of H-containing products due to low surface photoelectron density.In order to increase the surface electron-rich density, Pt NPs are assembled into the middle between g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C.The ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst exhibits the largest formation rate of CH 4 product (6.56 lmol h A1 ) and the highest selectivity for CO 2 reduction (97.1) compared with single and binary catalysts, which is 130-fold of commercial P25.The selectivity of CH 4 product increases from 2 (g-C 3 N 4 ) to 81.7 (3DOM-CNPTC), indicating that the synergy effect of ternary components is beneficial for improving the selectivity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 .For the reaction of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, the oxidation product is O 2 .Based on the formation rates of reduction products (CH 4 , CO and H 2 ), the theoretical formation rate of O 2 were calculated and shown in Table S3.The stoichiometric formation rate of O 2 was approximately equal to the practical formation rate of O 2 , indicating that H 2 O was only electron donor during the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 . It is significant to explore the utilization efficiency of solar energy, an important parameter for the evaluation of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O 53.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is used to calculate the conversion rate of light energy to chemical energy in the whole CO 2 reduction process by the equation: AQE 2n(CO) 8n(CH 4 )/Number of incident photons A 100.As demonstrated in Table 1, the AQE value of 3DOM-TiO 2 specimen (0.05) is higher than that of P25 (0.04), meaning the utilization efficiency of photoelectrons of photonic crystal structure in 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst enhanced.After combined carbon coating with 3DOM-TiO 2 to form composites, the AQE value of sample is 0.26, indicating that carbon-coated layers on TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost solar energy utilization efficiency.For the Z-schemetype ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, the AQE values further increase, and 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has the largest apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) value (5.67), which is more than 140-fold of commercial P25.It suggests that 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has high solar energy utilization efficiency, which is attributed to the properties of high-efficient visible-light harvesting and photogenerated carries separation. Based on the remarkable photocatalytic reduction CO 2 performance, it is crucial to investigate the stability of 3DOM-CNPTC cat-alyst by the cycle tests for CO 2 reduction, and the result is shown in Fig. S9.It can be clearly seen that the yield of the products in ten repetitions presented no obvious change, which exhibited the commendable cyclic stability of as-prepared 3DOM-CNPTC.The structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC was also obtained, the SEM and TEM images of the samples after reaction are shown in Figs.S10 andS11, respectively.The nanostructure of all-solidstate Z-scheme-type ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C system and the particle size of supported Pt NPs are as similar as the initial samples, indicating the good structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.Additionally, a series of blank examinations were carried out in the absence of illumination, catalysts, and reactants (CO 2 and H 2 O).At this time, the products CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction were not detected.It indicates that the three essential elements of reaction, light, catalyst and reactant are indispensable to the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.To demonstrate the source of carbon and hydrogen elements in the reaction products, the isotopic tracing CO 2 reduction of containing 13 C and 2 H(D) reactants by GC-MS were shown in Fig. S12.The peaks located at the m/z of 21 and 29 are assigned to 13 CD 4 and 13 CO products, respectively.As shown in Fig. S12C, during photocatalytic 13 CO 2 reduction with D 2 O after 8 h irradiation, the amounts of isotopic 13 CD 4 , 13 CO and D 2 products over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst obtained by GC-MS are close to the results obtained by GC.The isotopic tracing experiment of 13 C and D indicates that the carbon and hydrogen elements in the product of CO and CH 4 originate from CO 2 and H 2 O, respectively.It satisfies three requirements for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as follows: Confirming the source of carbon in CO 2 reduction products; determining the relative amount of H 2 and CO 2 reduction products; checking the stoichiometric O 2 in Table S3 54. It is helpful to reveal the reaction mechanism of catalysts by investigating the selectivity of reaction products.The processes of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction involve three crucial steps: the photoexcitation of charges, the separation and transfer of electrons and holes, and the capture of reactants on the catalyst surface 55.The first two steps determine the charge density transferred to the reaction interface, while the latter step is concerned with the activation and the surface density of the reactants.The survey of the above two points are indispensable to reveal the structure-activity relationship of catalysts. The activation property of the reactants on the catalyst surface will affect the direction of the CO 2 reduction reaction.The efficiency of CO 2 reduction reaction is closely related to the surface concentration of CO 2 on the catalyst.For investigating surface enrichment of adsorbed CO 2 , Fig. 8b exhibits the CO 2 -TPD curves Table 1 The formation rates, the selectivity of CO and CH 4 productions and the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 with H 2 O over 3DOM-TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts. Formation 1 that the CO 2 reduction selectivity of catalysts containing g-C 3 N 4 are higher than 90.Therefore, the catalysts with g-C 3 N 4 will obtain a high CO 2 reduction efficiency due to the large amount of CO 2 adsorbed on its surface.In addition, the conduction band (CB) of the photocatalyst should be lower than the reduction potential of the desired reaction, that is, the formation potential of CO (Eq.1: CO 2 2H 2e CO H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CO) A0.53V) and the formation potential of CH 4 (Eq.2: CO 2 8H 8e CH 4 H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) A0.24V) 56.The 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts can reduce CO 2 to CH 4 and CO because the conduction positions of TiO 2 (A0.56 V vs. NHE at pH 7) and g-C 3 N 4 (A1.30V vs. NHE at pH 7) match with the potential requirements 55.For CB potential position, it is observed that the g-C 3 N 4 material is more prone to CO 2 reduction compared to the 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst.Moreover, because of the E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) value is more negative than E h (CO 2 /CO), it seems easily achieve the photoconversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .But the CO 2 reduction reaction to CH 4 requires eight electrons and eight protons, a luxury compared with the two required for CO 57.Therefore, the surface enrichment of electrons and protons considerably affects the catalytic performance and selectivity of CO 2 photoconversion. As shown in Fig. 8a, the transient photocurrent responses of the catalysts were investigated, in order to further investigate the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons.The photocurrent density of 3DOM TiO 2 C support is higher than 3DOM-TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 catalysts, indicating that the carbon-coated layers on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost the transportation of photogenerated electrons.After introduce Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 , the photocurrent densities over binary Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts are improved obviously compared with those of single component catalysts.3DOM-CNPTC catalyst exhibits fast, repeatable and the highest intensity of transient photocurrent responses in the cycling processes of light on and off, indicating that all-solid-state Z-scheme structure improves the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons and is beneficial to promote the reaction of eight electrons (CH 4 formation) 58.In addition to the photogenerated electrons, the protons are the ultimate contributor to the formation of methane.It is well known that platinum is an excellent cocatalyst for water cracking reaction.Proton is an important resource in CO 2 hydrogenation, which is mainly provided by water cracking reaction.Consequently, the foramtion rate of CH 4 product over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was higher than those of 3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Thus, the introduced Pt nanoparticles play a crucial role in promoting the process of CO 2 hydrogenation. To sum up, high electron density, proton supply and CO 2 adsorption are the three necessary factors for the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .Pure g-C 3 N 4 can effectively improve the reaction efficiency of CO 2 reduction.However, due to the lack of protons supply, the reduction product was still dominated by CO product, even the high electron density was obtained by combining with 3DOM-TiO 2 C (g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C).The selectivity of CO 2 reduction over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was only 75 because of the limitation surface concentration of CO 2 .An efficient Z-scheme reaction system with Pt nanoparticles as electron transport medium was successfully constructed, and a high electron density was obtained.Thus, all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows outstanding conversion efficiency for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 . To insight into the transfer of photogenerated electron during CO 2 reduction, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed, and the optimized model of all-solid-state Zscheme CNPTC structure is shown in Fig. S16.As shown in Fig. 9, the covalent heterojunctions appear at the interface between TiO 2 C, Pt and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.The unstable electrons generated by photoexcitation of TiO 2 C are eager to react or transfer to a lower band position to reduce its high reduction potential.Carbon-coated layers are employed as an interfacial conduction layer 59 and the relatively middle potential of Pt NPs sets up a step between conduction band of TiO 2 to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 .The Z-scheme of CNPTC catalyst was built by the recombination of charges on conduction band of TiO B) ?Pt ?g-C 3 N 4 (VB).According to the above experimental results, the mechanism of all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction is proposed (Fig. 10).All-solidstate Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst absorbs photons to generate photoelectrons and holes.The photoelectrons derived from photoexcited TiO 2 C are captured by the carbon-coated layers and transfer to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 via Pt NPs.Further photoelectrons on conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 enriched by N-sites located at the interface of Pt and g-C 3 N 4 .Finally, photoelectrons react with absorbed CO 2 and H 2 O into the target products (CO and CH 4 ), and the holes stayed in valence band of TiO 2 C oxidize H 2 O to O 2 .The formation rate and selectivity of CH 4 product depend on the surface enrichment of electrons and CO 2 molecule."}, {"llm generation": "visible light (420 nm)", "source": "3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows high catalytic activity for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction, i.e., its formation rates of CH 4 is 6.56 lmol h A1 , and its quantum efficiency achieves 5.67 under visible light (420 nm), which is more than 140 times the commercial P25.", "context": "In this work, we have fabricated the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst is composed of two photochemical systems of 3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets as well as Pt NPs used for electron transfer medium.3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows high catalytic activity for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction, i.e., its formation rates of CH 4 is 6.56 lmol h A1 , and its quantum efficiency achieves 5.67 under visible light (420 nm), which is more than 140 times the commercial P25.The activity and selectivity for CO 2 photoreduction are strongly dependent on the surface enrichment of electrons and CO 2 .Based on the results of characterizations and DFT calculation, it is proposed that the photoelectrons are enriched on the N-sites located at the interface of Pt and g-C 3 N 4 , and can react with absorbed CO 2 and H 2 O into the selective CH 4 product.It demonstrates that all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst can optimize the selectivity of products and the quantum efficiency for CO 2 reduction, giving new possibilities for achieving high-performance solar-driven CO 2 reduction.

The chloroplatinic acid was used as the source of platinum which was reduced by sodium borohydride, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) was added as the protective agent 31,32.As the use of bubble assisted diffusion reductant in the reduction process this method is called the gas bubbling-assisted membrane reduction (GBMR) method and the detailed preparation processes of GBMR method is shown in Supporting Information. The pure was obtained by calcination of urea.To be specific, the various weight ratio of urea was evenly mixed with the support, and was placed in a covered ceramic crucible and heated with inert atmosphere at 550 C for 4 h in a tube furnace at the temperature rate of 5 o CAmin A1 .With rising of the temperature, the urea would be melted and flowed into the internal structure of the pore, where the urea occurred in the heating polycondensation into g-C 3 N 4 .Finally, the g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets were successfully grown on the inner wall of porous channel and the composites were called 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst. The specific surface area of the catalyst was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and the cryogenic nitrogen adsorption desorption was tested on Autosorb-iQ instrument (Quantachrome, USA).Scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) images and corresponding EDS mappings were carried on a Talos F200X (FEI) equipped with a Super-EDS and a JEOl JEM 2100 instrument.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were obtained using a FEI Quanta 200F instrument.The content of platinum in the catalyst was analyzed by inductive coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy, which was conducted on OPTIMA 7300 V produced by Perkin Elmer and dissolved the catalysts with a mixture of nitrohydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid.X-ray diffractometer (XRD) experiments were carried out in a Shimadzu XRD 6000.The Raman spectra were obtained on Renishaw Micro-Raman spectra with a 532 nm laser.The absorption performance of the UV-Visible range was investigated by a U-4100 ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer.The X-ray photoelectron spectra were carried out on Perkin-ElmerPHI-1600 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer.An infrared spectrometer (Nicolet IS10) provided the fourier transform infrared spectra of catalysts.Electron-hole recombination was investigated by a F-7000 photoluminescence spectrum (PL).The wavelength of the excitation light source was 380 nm and the scanning speed was 120 nm min A1 .In-situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) were measured using an infrared spectrometer (Nicolet IS50) and matched by an MCT detector and a high temperature cell with a liquid nitrogen cooling system.The sample was fixed in the Harrick infrared cell, nitrogen was added to purge (50 mL min A1 ) and the temperature was hold at 200 C for 60 min to ensure that the surface adsorbents were removed.Then the sample was cooled back to room temperature and a background line was scanned with a resolution of 4 cm A1 by accumulating 64 scans under nitrogen atmosphere.Finally, the CO 2 (50 cm 3 min A1 ) was absorbed for half an hour and then switched back to the nitrogen atmosphere for testing.Transient photocurrent responses, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) of the catalysts were tested on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E) using a three-electrode system.For the preparation method for photoelectrode, 10 mg of powder-type sample was ultrasonically dispersed in 1 mL of ethyl alcohol along with 50 lL of Nafion-117 film solution (Alfa Aesar).After ultrasonication for 30 min, the dispersed solution (100 lL) was spin-coated onto the FTO electrode (1 cm 2 ) and dried in drying oven at 65 C.The detail informations of photoelectrochemical characterizations were exhibited in the Supporting Information. The Labsolar-H 2 -II instrument (Perfect light company, China) was used to test the photocatalysis performance of carbon dioxide reduction.A 300 W xenon lamp was chosen to simulate a solar light source with an external filter (!420 nm).The certain amount of catalyst (0.1 g) was dispersed in a glass surface dish with a diameter of 6.5 cm and added the certain amount of deionized water (2.5 mL), then fixed the photoreactor by glass clamps and vacuumized it.The whole system was purged by carbon dioxide gas three times before testing.A cyclic condensation system was used to ensure that the entire reaction system remained at room temperature and pressure.The spectroradiometer determined the incident light intensity was 80 mW cm A2 .The whole test process was eight hours, during which each hour of product detection was done by a gas chromatograph with two detectors (GC-9560, HuaAiSePu Corp.).The flame ionization detector (FID) with methane converter was used to detect the amounts of CO and CH 4 , and the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to determination of the product amounts (O 2 and H 2 ).And the carrier gas of the GC is Argon (Ar).The external standard method was used to analyze the yield of the gas products.The selectivity of reaction products reflects the performance of the catalysts, and the selectivity of CO 2 reduction was calculated by the following formula: The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured in monochromatic light of 420 nm, and the number of incident photons was obtained by light intensity conversion.The AQE of a photocatalyst is the ratio of the number of photoelectrons consumed by the products (CO and CH 4 ) to the number of incident photons, and the specific calculation formula is as follow: Density functional theory calculation.All the spin-polarized DFT-D2 calculations were conducted in the ''Vienna ab initio simulation package\" (VASP code 5.4.1), using the generalized gradient correlation functional.The projector-augmented wave method was used with a plane-wave basis 33.The cut off energy and Gaussian smearing width were respectively set to 500 eV and 0.2 eV.The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 5 A 5 A 1 K points.All structures and energy are allowed to relax below 0.05 eV A A1 ."}, {"llm generation": "Xe lamp", "source": "The photocatalytic performances of CO 2 reduction over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst were evaluated by a gas closed circulation system with a continuous flow mode under Xe lamp irradiation of visible light (!420 nm).", "context": "3.1.Synthesis and structural characterizations of all-solid-state Zscheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst Fig. 1 shows the schematic of synthesis procedures of 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalysts.3DOM-TiO 2 C material was firstly compound by the improved method of CCT with anaerobic calcination in Ar.The CCT with opal structure is assembled by the centrifugation of monodispersed polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microsphere.During the anaerobic calcination process for removal of CCT at 600 C, tetrabutyl titanate as TiO 2 precursor is thermally decomposed to TiO 2 nanocrystal, and the PMMA microsphere template is thermally dehydrated and polymerized of the CAC bond to form a graphite carbon coating on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystal spontaneously.Thus, 3DOM carbon-coated TiO 2 (TiO 2 C) support was obtained.Supported Pt NPs on the inner wall of 3DOM-TiO 2 C (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) were elaborately fabricated by gas bubbling-assisted membrance reduction (GBMR) method (Fig. S1).The heterogenous nucleation and growth processes of supported Pt nanocrystals can be regulated by the homogeneous dispersion of reductant 34.The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, as the other isolated system, were assembled into the ordered macropore of Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C material by in-situ growth method with thermally anaerobic decomposition of urea.Finally, the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst of g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C was successfully fabricated, and the synthesis details can be found in the Experimental sections.and forms the slow photon effect for improving visible lightharvesting efficiency 22.High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst is shown in inset of Fig. 2a.It is observed that the pore wall is composed by carbon-coated TiO 2 nanocrystals.The interplanar crystal spacing of 3.5 A is corresponding to (1 0 1) crystal face of anatasetype TiO 2 353637 and TiO 2 nanocrystals are coated by the carbon layers with thickness of 1-2 molecular.The photograph (bottom of inset in Fig. 2a) exhibits its ash-black color, indicating the enhancing visible light-harvesting efficiency in comparison with the white color of TiO 2 shown in Fig. S2A.Fig. 2b shows the HAADF-STEM (high angle annular dark field scanning TEM) image of 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst.The porous wall of 3DOM material consists of a mass of nanocrystals with the sizes of 5-15 nm.

To observe the phase structures of TiO 2 nanocrystal, carbon coating and g-C 3 N 4 in 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst, XRD and Raman spectra are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively.As shown in Fig. 3, the main diffraction peaks (2h) located at 25.4, 37.9, 48.1, 54.9 and 62.8, which is assigned to the (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (2 1 1) and (2 0 4) crystal facets of anatase-phase TiO 2 (PDF 21-1272), respectively.And two peaks located at 13.1 and 27.4are assigned to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating the formation of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets in the ternary 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalysts, which is consistent with the results of the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Fig. S5) 38,39.The absorption band located at 1639 cm A1 is assigned to the C-N stretching vibration modes, while the absorption peak centered at 3192 cm A1 can be originated from N-H stretching vibration modes, and four strong absorption bands situated at 1243, 1319, 1411, 1563 cm A1 are attributed to the typical stretching mode of CN heterocycle, respectively.And the characteristic breathing mode of triazine units was detected by FT-IR on the absorption band at 812 cm A1 .For 3DOM- (2) (517 cm A1 ), and E g(2) (638 cm A1 ) modes of anatase phase, respectively 40.For 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst, the characteristic band of Eg (1) mode has shifted obviously to 152 cm A1 , suggesting the carbon-doping into surface lattice of TiO 2 41.And two bands located at 1341 and 1580 cm A1 are clearly observed, which are attributed to D-band and G-band of the graphitized carbon layers, respectively 42,43.For ternary 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst, the relatively intensity of D/Gbands is higher than those of other catalysts, indicating that g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets grown in-situ increases the defect site density of graphene-coated layers because of the vectorial transfer of electron at the ternary interface 44. To explore the electronic states of Pt NPs in compositions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Pt in Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC is shown in Fig. 5 and the contents of different valence states are listed in the Table S1.According to the standard principle, the deconvolutions of spectra were divided.The binding energy increases with the promotion of the valence state, so the lowest binding energy (70.2 and 73.5 eV) corresponds to the metallic (Pt 0 ) and the highest binding energy (74.1 and 76.9 eV) corresponds to the ionic (Pt 4 ).According to the spectra, the intermediate transition valence state (Pt 2 ) also exists, corresponding to the binding energies of 71.2 and 74.8 eV 45.The presence of ionic Pt (Pt 2 and Pt 4 ) species indicates that Pt NPs were taken away a certain number of electrons in the process of synthesis and the formation of new chemical interactions.The surface density of ionic Pt species increases from 31.8 (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) to 67.1 (3DOM-CNPTC), indicating the strong electron delivery from Pt to g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets in CNPTC catalyst 46.It is attributed to the strong interaction between Pt NPs as an electron-donating and circumambient TiO 2 nanocrystals or g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.It confirms the possibility that Pt NPs can be utilized as an intermediate path for electron transmission in the ternary 3DOM-CNPTC system 47.duction of carbon coating, 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst displays the stronger absorption efficiency for visible light (400-800 nm) compared with 3DOM-TiO 2 , which is attributed to the formation of p-p conjugated structure at the interface between TiO 2 and graphitized carbon layers for improving light-harvesting efficiency 48,49.As the synergistic effect of two systems, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has a strong absorption spectrum in the range of UV-Visible light.The absorption peak around 390 nm is particularly prominent, which is superimposed by the absorption peak of g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Furthermore, the separation efficiency of photoinduced electrons and holes is another important factor to improve the photochemical conversion efficiency 50. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the charge-transfer property over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.As shown in Fig. 6b, 3DOM TiO 2 exhibits the strongest PL emission peak at 580 nm, indicating that a large number of photogenerated electrons and holes have recombined.For 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst, its intensity of PL emission peak decreases obviously, suggesting that carbon-coated layers enhance the effective charge separation ability.After introduction of Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows the weakest PL emission peak, indicating that ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C heterjunctions boost the separation efficiency and restrain the recombination of photoelectrons and holes 51.In order to better understand the charge transfer of 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts, the electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range of 10,000-0.1 Hz at A0.74 V vs. RHE was detected.Nyquist plots of 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts are in Fig. S7A (irradiation 100 mW cm A2 ).The equivalent circuit and parameters are shown in Fig. S8 and Table S2.The diameter of the spectra is proportional to the charge transfer resistance (Rct), which represents the charge transfer capacity between the catalysts and the reactants.It is well-known that the smaller arc radius, the lesser obstruction of electrons-holes transferring.As shown, obtains the smallest value at 3DOM-CNPTC, which indicate the 3DOM-CNPTC obtains more effective separation of photogenerated electronhole pairs.Under condition of visible-light irradiation, the Rct value of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst is much smaller than that of in the dark, suggesting that the large amount of photogenerated electrons and holes are generated and transferred rapidly under visible-light illumination (Fig. S7B).Based on the results of UV-Vis DRS and PL spectra, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst with ternary synergy effect shows the optimal visible-light-harvesting efficiency and separation efficiency of photoelectrons and holes.Moreover, photogenerated electrons and holes will be transferred to the catalyst surface and interact with CO 2 at the two-phase interface. The photocatalytic performances of CO 2 reduction over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst were evaluated by a gas closed circulation system with a continuous flow mode under Xe lamp irradiation of visible light (!420 nm).And the gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC).The performances of the photocatalysts for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction with H 2 O are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1.The amount of catalysts used in the photoreaction is 0.1 g.Photocatalytically splitting H 2 O into H 2 is a competitive reaction in CO 2 reduction, and it's also the source of protons for CH 4 product 52.To comparison with the photocatalytic activities reported by other researchers, it is generally accepted that the commercial P25 was used as the reference sample due to its good photocatalytic performance and uniform crystal phase structure.Herein, commercial P25 purchased from Degussa (Co., Germany) was used to the reference catalyst, which composes of anatase (80) and rutile (20) with its average particle size of 21 nm.Compared to P25 and 3DOM-TiO 2 , 3DOM-TiO 2 C displays the higher CO 2 photoreduction catalytic activity, i.e., the formation rates of CO and CH 4 are 0.87 and 0.21 lmol h A1 , respectively.It indicates that the carbon-coated layers can enhance photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 catalyst.After introduce supported Pt NPs, the formation rates of H 2 and CH 4 products over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst increases to 2.28 and 1.56 lmol h A1 , respectively.And its selectivity for CO 2 reduction is the lowest (75.6) except for P25.It suggests that Pt NPs as electron-rich sites are beneficial for promoting the formation of H-containing products and improv- ing the rate of multi-electron and proton process (CH 4 selectivity, 64.4).Pure g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets show the high formation rate of CO (2.46 lmol h A1 ) and selectivity for CO 2 reduction (96.7), while its formation rate and selectivity of CH 4 product is the lowest.It may be related to the good adsorption and activation properties of pure g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reactant.And the binary synergetic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C in g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst improves remarkably the formation rate of CO product (2.76 lmol h A1 ), indicating that g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets have excellent activation property for CO 2 molecule and restrain the formation of H-containing products due to low surface photoelectron density.In order to increase the surface electron-rich density, Pt NPs are assembled into the middle between g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C.The ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst exhibits the largest formation rate of CH 4 product (6.56 lmol h A1 ) and the highest selectivity for CO 2 reduction (97.1) compared with single and binary catalysts, which is 130-fold of commercial P25.The selectivity of CH 4 product increases from 2 (g-C 3 N 4 ) to 81.7 (3DOM-CNPTC), indicating that the synergy effect of ternary components is beneficial for improving the selectivity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 .For the reaction of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, the oxidation product is O 2 .Based on the formation rates of reduction products (CH 4 , CO and H 2 ), the theoretical formation rate of O 2 were calculated and shown in Table S3.The stoichiometric formation rate of O 2 was approximately equal to the practical formation rate of O 2 , indicating that H 2 O was only electron donor during the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 . It is significant to explore the utilization efficiency of solar energy, an important parameter for the evaluation of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O 53.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is used to calculate the conversion rate of light energy to chemical energy in the whole CO 2 reduction process by the equation: AQE 2n(CO) 8n(CH 4 )/Number of incident photons A 100.As demonstrated in Table 1, the AQE value of 3DOM-TiO 2 specimen (0.05) is higher than that of P25 (0.04), meaning the utilization efficiency of photoelectrons of photonic crystal structure in 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst enhanced.After combined carbon coating with 3DOM-TiO 2 to form composites, the AQE value of sample is 0.26, indicating that carbon-coated layers on TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost solar energy utilization efficiency.For the Z-schemetype ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, the AQE values further increase, and 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has the largest apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) value (5.67), which is more than 140-fold of commercial P25.It suggests that 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has high solar energy utilization efficiency, which is attributed to the properties of high-efficient visible-light harvesting and photogenerated carries separation. Based on the remarkable photocatalytic reduction CO 2 performance, it is crucial to investigate the stability of 3DOM-CNPTC cat-alyst by the cycle tests for CO 2 reduction, and the result is shown in Fig. S9.It can be clearly seen that the yield of the products in ten repetitions presented no obvious change, which exhibited the commendable cyclic stability of as-prepared 3DOM-CNPTC.The structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC was also obtained, the SEM and TEM images of the samples after reaction are shown in Figs.S10 andS11, respectively.The nanostructure of all-solidstate Z-scheme-type ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C system and the particle size of supported Pt NPs are as similar as the initial samples, indicating the good structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.Additionally, a series of blank examinations were carried out in the absence of illumination, catalysts, and reactants (CO 2 and H 2 O).At this time, the products CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction were not detected.It indicates that the three essential elements of reaction, light, catalyst and reactant are indispensable to the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.To demonstrate the source of carbon and hydrogen elements in the reaction products, the isotopic tracing CO 2 reduction of containing 13 C and 2 H(D) reactants by GC-MS were shown in Fig. S12.The peaks located at the m/z of 21 and 29 are assigned to 13 CD 4 and 13 CO products, respectively.As shown in Fig. S12C, during photocatalytic 13 CO 2 reduction with D 2 O after 8 h irradiation, the amounts of isotopic 13 CD 4 , 13 CO and D 2 products over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst obtained by GC-MS are close to the results obtained by GC.The isotopic tracing experiment of 13 C and D indicates that the carbon and hydrogen elements in the product of CO and CH 4 originate from CO 2 and H 2 O, respectively.It satisfies three requirements for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as follows: Confirming the source of carbon in CO 2 reduction products; determining the relative amount of H 2 and CO 2 reduction products; checking the stoichiometric O 2 in Table S3 54. It is helpful to reveal the reaction mechanism of catalysts by investigating the selectivity of reaction products.The processes of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction involve three crucial steps: the photoexcitation of charges, the separation and transfer of electrons and holes, and the capture of reactants on the catalyst surface 55.The first two steps determine the charge density transferred to the reaction interface, while the latter step is concerned with the activation and the surface density of the reactants.The survey of the above two points are indispensable to reveal the structure-activity relationship of catalysts. The activation property of the reactants on the catalyst surface will affect the direction of the CO 2 reduction reaction.The efficiency of CO 2 reduction reaction is closely related to the surface concentration of CO 2 on the catalyst.For investigating surface enrichment of adsorbed CO 2 , Fig. 8b exhibits the CO 2 -TPD curves Table 1 The formation rates, the selectivity of CO and CH 4 productions and the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 with H 2 O over 3DOM-TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts. Formation 1 that the CO 2 reduction selectivity of catalysts containing g-C 3 N 4 are higher than 90.Therefore, the catalysts with g-C 3 N 4 will obtain a high CO 2 reduction efficiency due to the large amount of CO 2 adsorbed on its surface.In addition, the conduction band (CB) of the photocatalyst should be lower than the reduction potential of the desired reaction, that is, the formation potential of CO (Eq.1: CO 2 2H 2e CO H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CO) A0.53V) and the formation potential of CH 4 (Eq.2: CO 2 8H 8e CH 4 H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) A0.24V) 56.The 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts can reduce CO 2 to CH 4 and CO because the conduction positions of TiO 2 (A0.56 V vs. NHE at pH 7) and g-C 3 N 4 (A1.30V vs. NHE at pH 7) match with the potential requirements 55.For CB potential position, it is observed that the g-C 3 N 4 material is more prone to CO 2 reduction compared to the 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst.Moreover, because of the E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) value is more negative than E h (CO 2 /CO), it seems easily achieve the photoconversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .But the CO 2 reduction reaction to CH 4 requires eight electrons and eight protons, a luxury compared with the two required for CO 57.Therefore, the surface enrichment of electrons and protons considerably affects the catalytic performance and selectivity of CO 2 photoconversion. As shown in Fig. 8a, the transient photocurrent responses of the catalysts were investigated, in order to further investigate the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons.The photocurrent density of 3DOM TiO 2 C support is higher than 3DOM-TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 catalysts, indicating that the carbon-coated layers on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost the transportation of photogenerated electrons.After introduce Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 , the photocurrent densities over binary Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts are improved obviously compared with those of single component catalysts.3DOM-CNPTC catalyst exhibits fast, repeatable and the highest intensity of transient photocurrent responses in the cycling processes of light on and off, indicating that all-solid-state Z-scheme structure improves the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons and is beneficial to promote the reaction of eight electrons (CH 4 formation) 58.In addition to the photogenerated electrons, the protons are the ultimate contributor to the formation of methane.It is well known that platinum is an excellent cocatalyst for water cracking reaction.Proton is an important resource in CO 2 hydrogenation, which is mainly provided by water cracking reaction.Consequently, the foramtion rate of CH 4 product over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was higher than those of 3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Thus, the introduced Pt nanoparticles play a crucial role in promoting the process of CO 2 hydrogenation. To sum up, high electron density, proton supply and CO 2 adsorption are the three necessary factors for the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .Pure g-C 3 N 4 can effectively improve the reaction efficiency of CO 2 reduction.However, due to the lack of protons supply, the reduction product was still dominated by CO product, even the high electron density was obtained by combining with 3DOM-TiO 2 C (g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C).The selectivity of CO 2 reduction over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was only 75 because of the limitation surface concentration of CO 2 .An efficient Z-scheme reaction system with Pt nanoparticles as electron transport medium was successfully constructed, and a high electron density was obtained.Thus, all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows outstanding conversion efficiency for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 . To insight into the transfer of photogenerated electron during CO 2 reduction, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed, and the optimized model of all-solid-state Zscheme CNPTC structure is shown in Fig. S16.As shown in Fig. 9, the covalent heterojunctions appear at the interface between TiO 2 C, Pt and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.The unstable electrons generated by photoexcitation of TiO 2 C are eager to react or transfer to a lower band position to reduce its high reduction potential.Carbon-coated layers are employed as an interfacial conduction layer 59 and the relatively middle potential of Pt NPs sets up a step between conduction band of TiO 2 to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 .The Z-scheme of CNPTC catalyst was built by the recombination of charges on conduction band of TiO B) ?Pt ?g-C 3 N 4 (VB).According to the above experimental results, the mechanism of all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction is proposed (Fig. 10).All-solidstate Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst absorbs photons to generate photoelectrons and holes.The photoelectrons derived from photoexcited TiO 2 C are captured by the carbon-coated layers and transfer to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 via Pt NPs.Further photoelectrons on conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 enriched by N-sites located at the interface of Pt and g-C 3 N 4 .Finally, photoelectrons react with absorbed CO 2 and H 2 O into the target products (CO and CH 4 ), and the holes stayed in valence band of TiO 2 C oxidize H 2 O to O 2 .The formation rate and selectivity of CH 4 product depend on the surface enrichment of electrons and CO 2 molecule."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "gas", "source": "The photocatalytic performances of CO 2 reduction over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst were evaluated by a gas closed circulation system with a continuous flow mode under Xe lamp irradiation of visible light (!420 nm).", "context": "3.1.Synthesis and structural characterizations of all-solid-state Zscheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst Fig. 1 shows the schematic of synthesis procedures of 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalysts.3DOM-TiO 2 C material was firstly compound by the improved method of CCT with anaerobic calcination in Ar.The CCT with opal structure is assembled by the centrifugation of monodispersed polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microsphere.During the anaerobic calcination process for removal of CCT at 600 C, tetrabutyl titanate as TiO 2 precursor is thermally decomposed to TiO 2 nanocrystal, and the PMMA microsphere template is thermally dehydrated and polymerized of the CAC bond to form a graphite carbon coating on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystal spontaneously.Thus, 3DOM carbon-coated TiO 2 (TiO 2 C) support was obtained.Supported Pt NPs on the inner wall of 3DOM-TiO 2 C (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) were elaborately fabricated by gas bubbling-assisted membrance reduction (GBMR) method (Fig. S1).The heterogenous nucleation and growth processes of supported Pt nanocrystals can be regulated by the homogeneous dispersion of reductant 34.The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, as the other isolated system, were assembled into the ordered macropore of Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C material by in-situ growth method with thermally anaerobic decomposition of urea.Finally, the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst of g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C was successfully fabricated, and the synthesis details can be found in the Experimental sections.and forms the slow photon effect for improving visible lightharvesting efficiency 22.High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst is shown in inset of Fig. 2a.It is observed that the pore wall is composed by carbon-coated TiO 2 nanocrystals.The interplanar crystal spacing of 3.5 A is corresponding to (1 0 1) crystal face of anatasetype TiO 2 353637 and TiO 2 nanocrystals are coated by the carbon layers with thickness of 1-2 molecular.The photograph (bottom of inset in Fig. 2a) exhibits its ash-black color, indicating the enhancing visible light-harvesting efficiency in comparison with the white color of TiO 2 shown in Fig. S2A.Fig. 2b shows the HAADF-STEM (high angle annular dark field scanning TEM) image of 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst.The porous wall of 3DOM material consists of a mass of nanocrystals with the sizes of 5-15 nm.

To explore the electronic states of Pt NPs in compositions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Pt in Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC is shown in Fig. 5 and the contents of different valence states are listed in the Table S1.According to the standard principle, the deconvolutions of spectra were divided.The binding energy increases with the promotion of the valence state, so the lowest binding energy (70.2 and 73.5 eV) corresponds to the metallic (Pt 0 ) and the highest binding energy (74.1 and 76.9 eV) corresponds to the ionic (Pt 4 ).According to the spectra, the intermediate transition valence state (Pt 2 ) also exists, corresponding to the binding energies of 71.2 and 74.8 eV 45.The presence of ionic Pt (Pt 2 and Pt 4 ) species indicates that Pt NPs were taken away a certain number of electrons in the process of synthesis and the formation of new chemical interactions.The surface density of ionic Pt species increases from 31.8 (Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C) to 67.1 (3DOM-CNPTC), indicating the strong electron delivery from Pt to g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets in CNPTC catalyst 46.It is attributed to the strong interaction between Pt NPs as an electron-donating and circumambient TiO 2 nanocrystals or g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.It confirms the possibility that Pt NPs can be utilized as an intermediate path for electron transmission in the ternary 3DOM-CNPTC system 47.duction of carbon coating, 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst displays the stronger absorption efficiency for visible light (400-800 nm) compared with 3DOM-TiO 2 , which is attributed to the formation of p-p conjugated structure at the interface between TiO 2 and graphitized carbon layers for improving light-harvesting efficiency 48,49.As the synergistic effect of two systems, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has a strong absorption spectrum in the range of UV-Visible light.The absorption peak around 390 nm is particularly prominent, which is superimposed by the absorption peak of g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Furthermore, the separation efficiency of photoinduced electrons and holes is another important factor to improve the photochemical conversion efficiency 50. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the charge-transfer property over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.As shown in Fig. 6b, 3DOM TiO 2 exhibits the strongest PL emission peak at 580 nm, indicating that a large number of photogenerated electrons and holes have recombined.For 3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst, its intensity of PL emission peak decreases obviously, suggesting that carbon-coated layers enhance the effective charge separation ability.After introduction of Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows the weakest PL emission peak, indicating that ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C heterjunctions boost the separation efficiency and restrain the recombination of photoelectrons and holes 51.In order to better understand the charge transfer of 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts, the electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range of 10,000-0.1 Hz at A0.74 V vs. RHE was detected.Nyquist plots of 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts are in Fig. S7A (irradiation 100 mW cm A2 ).The equivalent circuit and parameters are shown in Fig. S8 and Table S2.The diameter of the spectra is proportional to the charge transfer resistance (Rct), which represents the charge transfer capacity between the catalysts and the reactants.It is well-known that the smaller arc radius, the lesser obstruction of electrons-holes transferring.As shown, obtains the smallest value at 3DOM-CNPTC, which indicate the 3DOM-CNPTC obtains more effective separation of photogenerated electronhole pairs.Under condition of visible-light irradiation, the Rct value of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst is much smaller than that of in the dark, suggesting that the large amount of photogenerated electrons and holes are generated and transferred rapidly under visible-light illumination (Fig. S7B).Based on the results of UV-Vis DRS and PL spectra, 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst with ternary synergy effect shows the optimal visible-light-harvesting efficiency and separation efficiency of photoelectrons and holes.Moreover, photogenerated electrons and holes will be transferred to the catalyst surface and interact with CO 2 at the two-phase interface. The photocatalytic performances of CO 2 reduction over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst were evaluated by a gas closed circulation system with a continuous flow mode under Xe lamp irradiation of visible light (!420 nm).And the gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC).The performances of the photocatalysts for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction with H 2 O are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1.The amount of catalysts used in the photoreaction is 0.1 g.Photocatalytically splitting H 2 O into H 2 is a competitive reaction in CO 2 reduction, and it's also the source of protons for CH 4 product 52.To comparison with the photocatalytic activities reported by other researchers, it is generally accepted that the commercial P25 was used as the reference sample due to its good photocatalytic performance and uniform crystal phase structure.Herein, commercial P25 purchased from Degussa (Co., Germany) was used to the reference catalyst, which composes of anatase (80) and rutile (20) with its average particle size of 21 nm.Compared to P25 and 3DOM-TiO 2 , 3DOM-TiO 2 C displays the higher CO 2 photoreduction catalytic activity, i.e., the formation rates of CO and CH 4 are 0.87 and 0.21 lmol h A1 , respectively.It indicates that the carbon-coated layers can enhance photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 catalyst.After introduce supported Pt NPs, the formation rates of H 2 and CH 4 products over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst increases to 2.28 and 1.56 lmol h A1 , respectively.And its selectivity for CO 2 reduction is the lowest (75.6) except for P25.It suggests that Pt NPs as electron-rich sites are beneficial for promoting the formation of H-containing products and improv- ing the rate of multi-electron and proton process (CH 4 selectivity, 64.4).Pure g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets show the high formation rate of CO (2.46 lmol h A1 ) and selectivity for CO 2 reduction (96.7), while its formation rate and selectivity of CH 4 product is the lowest.It may be related to the good adsorption and activation properties of pure g-C 3 N 4 for CO 2 reactant.And the binary synergetic effect of g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C in g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst improves remarkably the formation rate of CO product (2.76 lmol h A1 ), indicating that g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets have excellent activation property for CO 2 molecule and restrain the formation of H-containing products due to low surface photoelectron density.In order to increase the surface electron-rich density, Pt NPs are assembled into the middle between g-C 3 N 4 and 3DOM-TiO 2 C.The ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst exhibits the largest formation rate of CH 4 product (6.56 lmol h A1 ) and the highest selectivity for CO 2 reduction (97.1) compared with single and binary catalysts, which is 130-fold of commercial P25.The selectivity of CH 4 product increases from 2 (g-C 3 N 4 ) to 81.7 (3DOM-CNPTC), indicating that the synergy effect of ternary components is beneficial for improving the selectivity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 .For the reaction of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, the oxidation product is O 2 .Based on the formation rates of reduction products (CH 4 , CO and H 2 ), the theoretical formation rate of O 2 were calculated and shown in Table S3.The stoichiometric formation rate of O 2 was approximately equal to the practical formation rate of O 2 , indicating that H 2 O was only electron donor during the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 . It is significant to explore the utilization efficiency of solar energy, an important parameter for the evaluation of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O 53.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is used to calculate the conversion rate of light energy to chemical energy in the whole CO 2 reduction process by the equation: AQE 2n(CO) 8n(CH 4 )/Number of incident photons A 100.As demonstrated in Table 1, the AQE value of 3DOM-TiO 2 specimen (0.05) is higher than that of P25 (0.04), meaning the utilization efficiency of photoelectrons of photonic crystal structure in 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst enhanced.After combined carbon coating with 3DOM-TiO 2 to form composites, the AQE value of sample is 0.26, indicating that carbon-coated layers on TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost solar energy utilization efficiency.For the Z-schemetype ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, the AQE values further increase, and 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has the largest apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) value (5.67), which is more than 140-fold of commercial P25.It suggests that 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst has high solar energy utilization efficiency, which is attributed to the properties of high-efficient visible-light harvesting and photogenerated carries separation. Based on the remarkable photocatalytic reduction CO 2 performance, it is crucial to investigate the stability of 3DOM-CNPTC cat-alyst by the cycle tests for CO 2 reduction, and the result is shown in Fig. S9.It can be clearly seen that the yield of the products in ten repetitions presented no obvious change, which exhibited the commendable cyclic stability of as-prepared 3DOM-CNPTC.The structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC was also obtained, the SEM and TEM images of the samples after reaction are shown in Figs.S10 andS11, respectively.The nanostructure of all-solidstate Z-scheme-type ternary g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C system and the particle size of supported Pt NPs are as similar as the initial samples, indicating the good structure stability of 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst.Additionally, a series of blank examinations were carried out in the absence of illumination, catalysts, and reactants (CO 2 and H 2 O).At this time, the products CO and CH 4 from CO 2 photoreduction were not detected.It indicates that the three essential elements of reaction, light, catalyst and reactant are indispensable to the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.To demonstrate the source of carbon and hydrogen elements in the reaction products, the isotopic tracing CO 2 reduction of containing 13 C and 2 H(D) reactants by GC-MS were shown in Fig. S12.The peaks located at the m/z of 21 and 29 are assigned to 13 CD 4 and 13 CO products, respectively.As shown in Fig. S12C, during photocatalytic 13 CO 2 reduction with D 2 O after 8 h irradiation, the amounts of isotopic 13 CD 4 , 13 CO and D 2 products over 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst obtained by GC-MS are close to the results obtained by GC.The isotopic tracing experiment of 13 C and D indicates that the carbon and hydrogen elements in the product of CO and CH 4 originate from CO 2 and H 2 O, respectively.It satisfies three requirements for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as follows: Confirming the source of carbon in CO 2 reduction products; determining the relative amount of H 2 and CO 2 reduction products; checking the stoichiometric O 2 in Table S3 54. It is helpful to reveal the reaction mechanism of catalysts by investigating the selectivity of reaction products.The processes of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction involve three crucial steps: the photoexcitation of charges, the separation and transfer of electrons and holes, and the capture of reactants on the catalyst surface 55.The first two steps determine the charge density transferred to the reaction interface, while the latter step is concerned with the activation and the surface density of the reactants.The survey of the above two points are indispensable to reveal the structure-activity relationship of catalysts. The activation property of the reactants on the catalyst surface will affect the direction of the CO 2 reduction reaction.The efficiency of CO 2 reduction reaction is closely related to the surface concentration of CO 2 on the catalyst.For investigating surface enrichment of adsorbed CO 2 , Fig. 8b exhibits the CO 2 -TPD curves Table 1 The formation rates, the selectivity of CO and CH 4 productions and the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 with H 2 O over 3DOM-TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 , 3DOM-TiO 2 C, Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C, g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C and 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts. Formation 1 that the CO 2 reduction selectivity of catalysts containing g-C 3 N 4 are higher than 90.Therefore, the catalysts with g-C 3 N 4 will obtain a high CO 2 reduction efficiency due to the large amount of CO 2 adsorbed on its surface.In addition, the conduction band (CB) of the photocatalyst should be lower than the reduction potential of the desired reaction, that is, the formation potential of CO (Eq.1: CO 2 2H 2e CO H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CO) A0.53V) and the formation potential of CH 4 (Eq.2: CO 2 8H 8e CH 4 H 2 O, E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) A0.24V) 56.The 3DOM-CNPTC catalysts can reduce CO 2 to CH 4 and CO because the conduction positions of TiO 2 (A0.56 V vs. NHE at pH 7) and g-C 3 N 4 (A1.30V vs. NHE at pH 7) match with the potential requirements 55.For CB potential position, it is observed that the g-C 3 N 4 material is more prone to CO 2 reduction compared to the 3DOM-TiO 2 catalyst.Moreover, because of the E h (CO 2 /CH 4 ) value is more negative than E h (CO 2 /CO), it seems easily achieve the photoconversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .But the CO 2 reduction reaction to CH 4 requires eight electrons and eight protons, a luxury compared with the two required for CO 57.Therefore, the surface enrichment of electrons and protons considerably affects the catalytic performance and selectivity of CO 2 photoconversion. As shown in Fig. 8a, the transient photocurrent responses of the catalysts were investigated, in order to further investigate the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons.The photocurrent density of 3DOM TiO 2 C support is higher than 3DOM-TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 catalysts, indicating that the carbon-coated layers on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystals can boost the transportation of photogenerated electrons.After introduce Pt NPs and g-C 3 N 4 , the photocurrent densities over binary Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts are improved obviously compared with those of single component catalysts.3DOM-CNPTC catalyst exhibits fast, repeatable and the highest intensity of transient photocurrent responses in the cycling processes of light on and off, indicating that all-solid-state Z-scheme structure improves the surface enrichment of photogenerated electrons and is beneficial to promote the reaction of eight electrons (CH 4 formation) 58.In addition to the photogenerated electrons, the protons are the ultimate contributor to the formation of methane.It is well known that platinum is an excellent cocatalyst for water cracking reaction.Proton is an important resource in CO 2 hydrogenation, which is mainly provided by water cracking reaction.Consequently, the foramtion rate of CH 4 product over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was higher than those of 3DOM-TiO 2 C and g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C catalysts.Thus, the introduced Pt nanoparticles play a crucial role in promoting the process of CO 2 hydrogenation. To sum up, high electron density, proton supply and CO 2 adsorption are the three necessary factors for the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .Pure g-C 3 N 4 can effectively improve the reaction efficiency of CO 2 reduction.However, due to the lack of protons supply, the reduction product was still dominated by CO product, even the high electron density was obtained by combining with 3DOM-TiO 2 C (g-C 3 N 4 /3DOM-TiO 2 C).The selectivity of CO 2 reduction over Pt/3DOM-TiO 2 C catalyst was only 75 because of the limitation surface concentration of CO 2 .An efficient Z-scheme reaction system with Pt nanoparticles as electron transport medium was successfully constructed, and a high electron density was obtained.Thus, all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst shows outstanding conversion efficiency for reducing CO 2 to CH 4 . To insight into the transfer of photogenerated electron during CO 2 reduction, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed, and the optimized model of all-solid-state Zscheme CNPTC structure is shown in Fig. S16.As shown in Fig. 9, the covalent heterojunctions appear at the interface between TiO 2 C, Pt and g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.The unstable electrons generated by photoexcitation of TiO 2 C are eager to react or transfer to a lower band position to reduce its high reduction potential.Carbon-coated layers are employed as an interfacial conduction layer 59 and the relatively middle potential of Pt NPs sets up a step between conduction band of TiO 2 to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 .The Z-scheme of CNPTC catalyst was built by the recombination of charges on conduction band of TiO B) ?Pt ?g-C 3 N 4 (VB).According to the above experimental results, the mechanism of all-solid-state Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction is proposed (Fig. 10).All-solidstate Z-scheme 3DOM-CNPTC catalyst absorbs photons to generate photoelectrons and holes.The photoelectrons derived from photoexcited TiO 2 C are captured by the carbon-coated layers and transfer to valence band of g-C 3 N 4 via Pt NPs.Further photoelectrons on conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 enriched by N-sites located at the interface of Pt and g-C 3 N 4 .Finally, photoelectrons react with absorbed CO 2 and H 2 O into the target products (CO and CH 4 ), and the holes stayed in valence band of TiO 2 C oxidize H 2 O to O 2 .The formation rate and selectivity of CH 4 product depend on the surface enrichment of electrons and CO 2 molecule."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
