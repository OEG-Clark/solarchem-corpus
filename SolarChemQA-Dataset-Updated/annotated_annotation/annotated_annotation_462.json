The SEM image of the sample calcined at 1173 K for 1 h in KCl flux (F/P 2) shows a structure with a large number of nanoplates and a small number of nanorods (Fig. 4(a) and (b)).Since there were no other phases except for the TTB phase according to the XRD patterns (Fig. 3A andB), these nanoplates should comprise either crystallized or amorphous Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 .EDS analysis of one nanoparticle indicated that K, Sr, Ta, and O elements were well mapped with its morphology (Fig. S1); therefore, we expect that these nanoplates are also Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 .Only nanorods were observed when the calcination time was increased to 3 h (Fig. 4(c)).The well-shaped Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods were obtained when the samples were calcined at 1173 K for more than 3 h using KCl flux (F/P 2) (Fig. 4(d)-(f)). The mass ratio of flux (KCl to precursors) usually affects the morphology, phase, purity, and crystallinity of the products 25.First, we compared the flux method with the SSR and PC methods for the fabrication of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 .Interestingly, pure TTB structure of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 could not be obtained by the SSR and PC methods.The XRD patterns clearly show that a pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 is not obtained by the SSR method without any flux (Fig. 5A).The main phase is assigned to Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 obtained after performing calcination for 3 h at 1173 K 26.We tried to prepare Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 at high temperatures and long calcination periods using the SSR method (e.g., 1773 K for 24 h); however, the pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 was still not obtained (Fig. S2(a)).PC method is one of the most famous methods for the fabrication of tantalates, and has been investigated by many researchers 23,272829.However, the pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 was still not obtained at 1173 K for 3 h using the PC method (Fig. S2(b)).These results indicate that both the SSR and PC methods are unsuitable for the fabrication of the pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 at 1173 K for 3 h.However, the pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 was obtained even with the low ratio of KCl flux (F/P 0.5) at 1173 K for 3 h.Further increasing the F/P ratio from 1.0 to 3.0 did not cause any obvious phase change (Fig. 5B).Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the SSR method (without KCl flux) showed the lowest crystallite diameter and BET specific surface area amongst all the samples (Fig. 5C).This can be explained by the fact that the particles are sintered easily by using the SSR method.In contrast, Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the flux method in different F/P ratios showed similar crystallite diameters and BET specific surface areas, indicating that these physical properties are influenced by the presence or absence of flux but not by the F/P ratio. Fig. 6 shows the SEM images of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 prepared by calcination at 1173 K for 3 h in different F/P ratios.The morphology of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the SSR method (F/P 0) at 1173 K for 3 h displayed irregular nanoparticles of 0.5-1 m diameters (Fig. 6(a) and (b)).nanoparticles of large sizes were obtained by the SSR method at 1773 K for 24 h without flux (Fig. S3(a)), whereas nanoparticles of similar morphology were obtained by the PC method at 1173 K for 3 h (Fig. S3(b)).However, only nanorods were observed in the samples fabricated by the flux method (Fig. 6(c)-(f)).Despite increasing the F/P ratio from 0.5 to 2.0, the length of these nanorods did not change significantly, further increasing the F/P ratio to 3.0 increased the length of nanorods (Fig. 6(f)).Based on the analysis above, it can be concluded that KCl flux plays an essential role in the growth of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods. In order to obtain information about elemental distribution for the Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods, EDS analysis was carefully performed.(300 nm) is lower than that of the flux method (310 nm).Moreover, all the materials fabricated by using the flux method showed a similar absorption edge at around 310 nm, indicating that materials prepared using different flux ratios showed no obvious effect on the band gap.Fig. 8D shows 1.0 wt Ag-loaded Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 sample fabricated at 1173 K for 3 h in KCl flux (F/P 2).The broad absorption band from 330 to 650 nm is owing to the surface plasmon absorption of Ag nanoparticles deposited by a chemical reduction method 1617181922,23. The fabricated Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods with 1.0 wt Ag cocatalyst exhibited activity for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O under UV irradiation (Fig. 9A).An almost stoichiometric formation rate of O 2 as an oxidation product together with those of CO and H 2 as reduction products were obtained in all cases, which indicates that H 2 O works as an electron donor for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 .All the components of the system, i.e., photocatalyst, photoirradiation, CO 2 bubbling, a Ag cocatalyst, and a NaHCO 3 additive, are necessary to achieve the highly selective conversion of CO 2 into CO.We carried out five blank tests by keeping one component absent in each test and performed the reaction.We observed that Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 with the Ag cocatalyst in an aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 with bubbling CO 2 under photoirradiation can consistently achieve a high formation rate of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O, as shown in Fig. 9A.Without the NaHCO 3 additive, water splitting proceeded as the dominant reaction, leading to the evolution of the highest formation rate of H 2 (Fig. 9B).Carbonate species might play an important role in desorption of O 2 during photocatalytic water splitting, which was reported by Sayama et al. 30.In our system, NaHCO 3 might also play such kind of function, which leads to the suppression of the H 2 generation when flowing CO 2. Similarly, without the Ag cocatalyst, H 2 was the main product, while the evolution of CO was very low (Fig. 9C).This indicates that the Ag cocatalyst is an important factor in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 in an aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 .When inert Ar gas was used instead of CO 2 , maximum photocatalytic water splitting was observed and only a very small amount of CO derived from NaHCO 3 was formed (Fig. 9D).This indicates that CO 2 acts not only as a carbon source, but also as a balance gas to maintain the concentration of the HCO 3 -ion, which provides suitable pH values for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O.In the absence of a photocatalyst or photoirradiation (Fig. 9E andF), almost no products were detected.Fig. 10A shows the formation rates of CO, O 2 , and H 2 for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanoplates and nanorods calcined at different temperatures for 3 h in KCl flux (F/P 2) and characterized by XRD, BET analysis, and SEM, as shown in Figs. 1 and2.Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 calcined at 1123 K for 3 h in KCl flux (F/P 2) exhibited the lowest formation rate of CO (38.2 mol h -1 ) and the highest formation rate of H 2 (43.2 mol h -1 ), resulting in a selectivity of only 46.9 toward CO evolution.When the calcination temperature was increased by only 50 K to up to 1173 K, the formation rate of CO increased to 63.0 mol h -1 , while the formation rate of H 2 was significantly suppressed to only 12.6 mol h -1 .The resulting selectivity toward CO evolution dramatically increased to 83.3.This result implies that the mixture of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanoplates and nanorods containing an unknown impurity, even with the highest BET specific surface area, exhibits activity in favor of water splitting and not for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O. Increasing the calcination temperature from 1223 K to 1373 K led to a slight decrease in the photocatalytic activity for the formation rate of CO, which might be due to the decrease in the BET specific surface area and the increase in the length of the nanorods 31.Overall, these results indicate that the Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods prepared using a flux method show high formation rates of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution. Fig. 10B shows the formation rates of CO, O 2 , and H 2 for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanoplates and nanorods calcined for different calcination periods at 1173 K in KCl flux (F/P 2), and were characterized by XRD, BET analysis, and SEM, as shown in Figs. 3 and4.The Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 calcined for 1 h comprised a mixture of nanoplates and nanorods and showed the lowest formation rate of CO (42.8 mol h -1 ).This result was similar to that observed when the Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 particles were calcined at 1123 K for 3 h.We can therefore conclude that the important factor for obtaining a high formation rate of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution is the formation of pure nanorods, and not a high BET specific surface area.Increasing the calcination duration from 5 to 20 h led to a slight decrease in the formation rate of CO and an increase of the formation rate of H 2 . Fig. 10C shows the formation rates of CO, O 2 , and H 2 for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanoparticles and nanorods calcined in different F/P ratios at 1173 K for 3 h and characterized by XRD, BET analysis, and SEM, as shown in Figs. 5 and6.A F/P ratio of 0 means that the sample was fabricated using the SSR method (without flux).The F/P 0 sample comprising mainly of Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 nanoparticles showed the lowest selectivity toward CO evolution (48.4) among all the samples with different mass ratios of flux.The low formation rate of CO (44 mol h -1 ) indicates that we did not observe a high formation rate of CO or a good selectivity toward CO evolution in the absence of pure phase Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 .We also carried out the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the SSR method at 1773 K for 24 h.However, such a high calcination temperature and long calcination duration led to a very small BET specific surface area (0.5 m 2 g -1 ) and very low photocatalytic activity (Table S1(a)).Pure phase of Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 was obtained by using SrCl 2 as flux at 1273 K for 6 h (Fig. S2(c)), which was similar to the findings reported elsewhere 26.The as-fabricated Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 mainly showed activity for the overall water splitting reaction under the phase of Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 impurity then leads to low photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion to CO using H 2 O as an electron donor. The formation rate of CO increased and that of H 2 dramatically suppressed over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the flux method, as compared to that prepared by the SSR method.Flux method as a simple and cost-effective way to fabricate well-shaped and well-crystallized particles has been widely investigated 25,32,33.Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods fabricated in KCl flux in a lower calcination temperature and shorter time showed the highest photocatalytic activity and good selectivity toward CO evolution comparing with that of samples fabricated using SSR method.This might be due to the formation of regular morphology of photocatalyst, these nanorods were grown along the 001 direction, which was reported by Wang et al. 24.The nanorods were also reported to be more efficiency for migration of photogenerated electrons and holes than that of nanoparticles 23, which should be responsible for the high photocatalytic activity of CO 2 conversion by H 2 O.The formation rate of CO and selectivity toward CO evolution increased with an increase in the F/P ratio and reached a maximum at F/P 1.0.Further increase in the F/P ratio to 3.0 led to a significant decrease in the photocatalytic activity toward CO evolution.The Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods fabricated at F/P 1.0 showed the highest photocatalytic activity toward CO evolution at 65.5 mol h -1 and good selectivity toward CO evolution (88.7) among all the samples.Fig. 11 shows the time course of H 2 , O 2 , and CO evolutions for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over the Agmodified Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods calcined at 1173 K for 3 h in KCl flux (F/P 1), which represents the optimal fabrication conditions.CO was evolved as the main reduction product, and a small amount of H 2 was generated during the first run.Simultaneously, the evolution of O 2 increased linearly during the reaction.The evolution of CO, H 2 , and O 2 are in an approximately stoichiometric ratio, indicating that the number of photo-electrons used for the reduction of CO 2 and protons is equivalent to the number of holes consumed for H 2 O oxidation.It was observed that the formation rate of CO decreased together with a small increase in the formation rate of H 2 , during the second and third runs.However, it should be noted that the main product of the photocatalytic reduction was still CO even during the third run, indicating that CO was produced in preference to H 2 . Fig. 12a andb show the SEM images of the Ag-modified Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorod calcined at 1173 K for 3 h in KCl (F/P 1) flux before and after the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O.It was clearly seen that Ag nanoparticles were well anchored on the nanorods, and the size of these Ag nanoparticles is 5-30 nm (Fig. S4a).We have previously reported that only the smaller Ag nanoparticles contribute to the high selectivity toward CO evolution and the subsequent evolution of stoichiometric amounts of O 2 for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Ag/SrO/Ta 2 O 5 19.However, the size of Ag nanoparticles after photoirradication was increased to 20-80 nm (Fig. S4b), which was much larger than that before the photoirradiation, on the other hand, the number of Ag anchored on the surface of nanorods were decreased (Fig. 12c andd), which should be due to re-photodeposition and aggregation of the Ag nanoparticles.Ag nanoparticles are known to easily leach into a solution as Ag ions under photoirradiation 34. Fig. 13 shows Ag 3d X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of Agmodified Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods calcined at 1173 K for 3 h in KCl (F/P 1) flux before the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O. Ag 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks appeared at binding energies of 367.4 and 373.4 eV, respectively.The 3d peaks of Ag are doublets with energy separation of 6.0 eV.This indicates that the metallic Ag nanoparticles are dispersed on the surface of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 35.The Ag 3d XPS after the reaction showed an obvious decrease of peak intensity.The percentage of Ag/Ta atom after the reaction was 6, which was much smaller than that before the reaction (Ag/Ta 17), implying the dissolution of Ag during the photocatalytic reaction.It is also noted that the Ag 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks shift to a lower binding energy after the reaction, which indicates that zerovalent Ag changed into monovalent Ag 36.From the results of SEM and XPS, the sudden decline in the formation rate of CO evolution is attributed to the aggregation and dissolution of Ag nanoparticles as cocatalysts.Based on these analyses, we conclude that it is important to ensure that the cocatalyst consist of highly dispersed Ag nanoparticles anchored on the surface of the Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods, and that the pH value is controlled in an aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 , in order to ensure a stable rate of formation of CO."}, {"llm generation": "Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods", "source": "The Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods, synthesized by a facile flux method using potassium chloride (KCl) as flux with a Ag cocatalyst, showed a high rate of formation of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution, in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O.", "context": "The Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods, synthesized by a facile flux method using potassium chloride (KCl) as flux with a Ag cocatalyst, showed a high rate of formation of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution, in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O.The photocatalytic activity was significantly affected by the preparation methods, calcination temperature, calcination time, and ratio of flux to the precursors.As compared to the SSR and PC methods, the flux method not only generates pure phase Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 at low calcination temperatures and short calcination durations, but also achieves a high formation rate of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution.

The SEM image of the sample calcined at 1173 K for 1 h in KCl flux (F/P 2) shows a structure with a large number of nanoplates and a small number of nanorods (Fig. 4(a) and (b)).Since there were no other phases except for the TTB phase according to the XRD patterns (Fig. 3A andB), these nanoplates should comprise either crystallized or amorphous Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 .EDS analysis of one nanoparticle indicated that K, Sr, Ta, and O elements were well mapped with its morphology (Fig. S1); therefore, we expect that these nanoplates are also Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 .Only nanorods were observed when the calcination time was increased to 3 h (Fig. 4(c)).The well-shaped Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods were obtained when the samples were calcined at 1173 K for more than 3 h using KCl flux (F/P 2) (Fig. 4(d)-(f)). The mass ratio of flux (KCl to precursors) usually affects the morphology, phase, purity, and crystallinity of the products 25.First, we compared the flux method with the SSR and PC methods for the fabrication of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 .Interestingly, pure TTB structure of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 could not be obtained by the SSR and PC methods.The XRD patterns clearly show that a pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 is not obtained by the SSR method without any flux (Fig. 5A).The main phase is assigned to Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 obtained after performing calcination for 3 h at 1173 K 26.We tried to prepare Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 at high temperatures and long calcination periods using the SSR method (e.g., 1773 K for 24 h); however, the pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 was still not obtained (Fig. S2(a)).PC method is one of the most famous methods for the fabrication of tantalates, and has been investigated by many researchers 23,272829.However, the pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 was still not obtained at 1173 K for 3 h using the PC method (Fig. S2(b)).These results indicate that both the SSR and PC methods are unsuitable for the fabrication of the pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 at 1173 K for 3 h.However, the pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 was obtained even with the low ratio of KCl flux (F/P 0.5) at 1173 K for 3 h.Further increasing the F/P ratio from 1.0 to 3.0 did not cause any obvious phase change (Fig. 5B).Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the SSR method (without KCl flux) showed the lowest crystallite diameter and BET specific surface area amongst all the samples (Fig. 5C).This can be explained by the fact that the particles are sintered easily by using the SSR method.In contrast, Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the flux method in different F/P ratios showed similar crystallite diameters and BET specific surface areas, indicating that these physical properties are influenced by the presence or absence of flux but not by the F/P ratio. Fig. 6 shows the SEM images of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 prepared by calcination at 1173 K for 3 h in different F/P ratios.The morphology of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the SSR method (F/P 0) at 1173 K for 3 h displayed irregular nanoparticles of 0.5-1 m diameters (Fig. 6(a) and (b)).nanoparticles of large sizes were obtained by the SSR method at 1773 K for 24 h without flux (Fig. S3(a)), whereas nanoparticles of similar morphology were obtained by the PC method at 1173 K for 3 h (Fig. S3(b)).However, only nanorods were observed in the samples fabricated by the flux method (Fig. 6(c)-(f)).Despite increasing the F/P ratio from 0.5 to 2.0, the length of these nanorods did not change significantly, further increasing the F/P ratio to 3.0 increased the length of nanorods (Fig. 6(f)).Based on the analysis above, it can be concluded that KCl flux plays an essential role in the growth of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods. In order to obtain information about elemental distribution for the Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods, EDS analysis was carefully performed.(300 nm) is lower than that of the flux method (310 nm).Moreover, all the materials fabricated by using the flux method showed a similar absorption edge at around 310 nm, indicating that materials prepared using different flux ratios showed no obvious effect on the band gap.Fig. 8D shows 1.0 wt Ag-loaded Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 sample fabricated at 1173 K for 3 h in KCl flux (F/P 2).The broad absorption band from 330 to 650 nm is owing to the surface plasmon absorption of Ag nanoparticles deposited by a chemical reduction method 1617181922,23. The fabricated Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods with 1.0 wt Ag cocatalyst exhibited activity for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O under UV irradiation (Fig. 9A).An almost stoichiometric formation rate of O 2 as an oxidation product together with those of CO and H 2 as reduction products were obtained in all cases, which indicates that H 2 O works as an electron donor for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 .All the components of the system, i.e., photocatalyst, photoirradiation, CO 2 bubbling, a Ag cocatalyst, and a NaHCO 3 additive, are necessary to achieve the highly selective conversion of CO 2 into CO.We carried out five blank tests by keeping one component absent in each test and performed the reaction.We observed that Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 with the Ag cocatalyst in an aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 with bubbling CO 2 under photoirradiation can consistently achieve a high formation rate of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O, as shown in Fig. 9A.Without the NaHCO 3 additive, water splitting proceeded as the dominant reaction, leading to the evolution of the highest formation rate of H 2 (Fig. 9B).Carbonate species might play an important role in desorption of O 2 during photocatalytic water splitting, which was reported by Sayama et al. 30.In our system, NaHCO 3 might also play such kind of function, which leads to the suppression of the H 2 generation when flowing CO 2. Similarly, without the Ag cocatalyst, H 2 was the main product, while the evolution of CO was very low (Fig. 9C).This indicates that the Ag cocatalyst is an important factor in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 in an aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 .When inert Ar gas was used instead of CO 2 , maximum photocatalytic water splitting was observed and only a very small amount of CO derived from NaHCO 3 was formed (Fig. 9D).This indicates that CO 2 acts not only as a carbon source, but also as a balance gas to maintain the concentration of the HCO 3 -ion, which provides suitable pH values for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O.In the absence of a photocatalyst or photoirradiation (Fig. 9E andF), almost no products were detected.Fig. 10A shows the formation rates of CO, O 2 , and H 2 for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanoplates and nanorods calcined at different temperatures for 3 h in KCl flux (F/P 2) and characterized by XRD, BET analysis, and SEM, as shown in Figs. 1 and2.Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 calcined at 1123 K for 3 h in KCl flux (F/P 2) exhibited the lowest formation rate of CO (38.2 mol h -1 ) and the highest formation rate of H 2 (43.2 mol h -1 ), resulting in a selectivity of only 46.9 toward CO evolution.When the calcination temperature was increased by only 50 K to up to 1173 K, the formation rate of CO increased to 63.0 mol h -1 , while the formation rate of H 2 was significantly suppressed to only 12.6 mol h -1 .The resulting selectivity toward CO evolution dramatically increased to 83.3.This result implies that the mixture of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanoplates and nanorods containing an unknown impurity, even with the highest BET specific surface area, exhibits activity in favor of water splitting and not for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O. Increasing the calcination temperature from 1223 K to 1373 K led to a slight decrease in the photocatalytic activity for the formation rate of CO, which might be due to the decrease in the BET specific surface area and the increase in the length of the nanorods 31.Overall, these results indicate that the Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods prepared using a flux method show high formation rates of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution. Fig. 10B shows the formation rates of CO, O 2 , and H 2 for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanoplates and nanorods calcined for different calcination periods at 1173 K in KCl flux (F/P 2), and were characterized by XRD, BET analysis, and SEM, as shown in Figs. 3 and4.The Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 calcined for 1 h comprised a mixture of nanoplates and nanorods and showed the lowest formation rate of CO (42.8 mol h -1 ).This result was similar to that observed when the Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 particles were calcined at 1123 K for 3 h.We can therefore conclude that the important factor for obtaining a high formation rate of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution is the formation of pure nanorods, and not a high BET specific surface area.Increasing the calcination duration from 5 to 20 h led to a slight decrease in the formation rate of CO and an increase of the formation rate of H 2 . Fig. 10C shows the formation rates of CO, O 2 , and H 2 for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanoparticles and nanorods calcined in different F/P ratios at 1173 K for 3 h and characterized by XRD, BET analysis, and SEM, as shown in Figs. 5 and6.A F/P ratio of 0 means that the sample was fabricated using the SSR method (without flux).The F/P 0 sample comprising mainly of Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 nanoparticles showed the lowest selectivity toward CO evolution (48.4) among all the samples with different mass ratios of flux.The low formation rate of CO (44 mol h -1 ) indicates that we did not observe a high formation rate of CO or a good selectivity toward CO evolution in the absence of pure phase Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 .We also carried out the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the SSR method at 1773 K for 24 h.However, such a high calcination temperature and long calcination duration led to a very small BET specific surface area (0.5 m 2 g -1 ) and very low photocatalytic activity (Table S1(a)).Pure phase of Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 was obtained by using SrCl 2 as flux at 1273 K for 6 h (Fig. S2(c)), which was similar to the findings reported elsewhere 26.The as-fabricated Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 mainly showed activity for the overall water splitting reaction under the phase of Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 impurity then leads to low photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion to CO using H 2 O as an electron donor. The formation rate of CO increased and that of H 2 dramatically suppressed over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the flux method, as compared to that prepared by the SSR method.Flux method as a simple and cost-effective way to fabricate well-shaped and well-crystallized particles has been widely investigated 25,32,33.Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods fabricated in KCl flux in a lower calcination temperature and shorter time showed the highest photocatalytic activity and good selectivity toward CO evolution comparing with that of samples fabricated using SSR method.This might be due to the formation of regular morphology of photocatalyst, these nanorods were grown along the 001 direction, which was reported by Wang et al. 24.The nanorods were also reported to be more efficiency for migration of photogenerated electrons and holes than that of nanoparticles 23, which should be responsible for the high photocatalytic activity of CO 2 conversion by H 2 O.The formation rate of CO and selectivity toward CO evolution increased with an increase in the F/P ratio and reached a maximum at F/P 1.0.Further increase in the F/P ratio to 3.0 led to a significant decrease in the photocatalytic activity toward CO evolution.The Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods fabricated at F/P 1.0 showed the highest photocatalytic activity toward CO evolution at 65.5 mol h -1 and good selectivity toward CO evolution (88.7) among all the samples.Fig. 11 shows the time course of H 2 , O 2 , and CO evolutions for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over the Agmodified Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods calcined at 1173 K for 3 h in KCl flux (F/P 1), which represents the optimal fabrication conditions.CO was evolved as the main reduction product, and a small amount of H 2 was generated during the first run.Simultaneously, the evolution of O 2 increased linearly during the reaction.The evolution of CO, H 2 , and O 2 are in an approximately stoichiometric ratio, indicating that the number of photo-electrons used for the reduction of CO 2 and protons is equivalent to the number of holes consumed for H 2 O oxidation.It was observed that the formation rate of CO decreased together with a small increase in the formation rate of H 2 , during the second and third runs.However, it should be noted that the main product of the photocatalytic reduction was still CO even during the third run, indicating that CO was produced in preference to H 2 . Fig. 12a andb show the SEM images of the Ag-modified Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorod calcined at 1173 K for 3 h in KCl (F/P 1) flux before and after the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O.It was clearly seen that Ag nanoparticles were well anchored on the nanorods, and the size of these Ag nanoparticles is 5-30 nm (Fig. S4a).We have previously reported that only the smaller Ag nanoparticles contribute to the high selectivity toward CO evolution and the subsequent evolution of stoichiometric amounts of O 2 for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Ag/SrO/Ta 2 O 5 19.However, the size of Ag nanoparticles after photoirradication was increased to 20-80 nm (Fig. S4b), which was much larger than that before the photoirradiation, on the other hand, the number of Ag anchored on the surface of nanorods were decreased (Fig. 12c andd), which should be due to re-photodeposition and aggregation of the Ag nanoparticles.Ag nanoparticles are known to easily leach into a solution as Ag ions under photoirradiation 34. Fig. 13 shows Ag 3d X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of Agmodified Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods calcined at 1173 K for 3 h in KCl (F/P 1) flux before the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O. Ag 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks appeared at binding energies of 367.4 and 373.4 eV, respectively.The 3d peaks of Ag are doublets with energy separation of 6.0 eV.This indicates that the metallic Ag nanoparticles are dispersed on the surface of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 35.The Ag 3d XPS after the reaction showed an obvious decrease of peak intensity.The percentage of Ag/Ta atom after the reaction was 6, which was much smaller than that before the reaction (Ag/Ta 17), implying the dissolution of Ag during the photocatalytic reaction.It is also noted that the Ag 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks shift to a lower binding energy after the reaction, which indicates that zerovalent Ag changed into monovalent Ag 36.From the results of SEM and XPS, the sudden decline in the formation rate of CO evolution is attributed to the aggregation and dissolution of Ag nanoparticles as cocatalysts.Based on these analyses, we conclude that it is important to ensure that the cocatalyst consist of highly dispersed Ag nanoparticles anchored on the surface of the Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods, and that the pH value is controlled in an aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 , in order to ensure a stable rate of formation of CO."}, {"llm generation": "Ag", "source": "The Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods, synthesized by a facile flux method using potassium chloride (KCl) as flux with a Ag cocatalyst, showed a high rate of formation of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution, in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O.", "context": "The Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods, synthesized by a facile flux method using potassium chloride (KCl) as flux with a Ag cocatalyst, showed a high rate of formation of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution, in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O.The photocatalytic activity was significantly affected by the preparation methods, calcination temperature, calcination time, and ratio of flux to the precursors.As compared to the SSR and PC methods, the flux method not only generates pure phase Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 at low calcination temperatures and short calcination durations, but also achieves a high formation rate of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution.

The Ag cocatalyst was deposited to the as-fabricated Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 by a chemical reduction method.Specifically, 1.8 mL of an aqueous NaPH 2 O 2 solution (0.33 mol L -1 ) was added to 50 mL of a suspension of the photocatalyst (1.5 g) containing 1.4 mL of AgNO 3 (0.1 mol L -1 ).After stirring at 358 K for 1.5 h, the suspension was filtered and dried in air at room temperature for further use. The structure and crystallinity of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku Multiflex powder X-ray diffractometer.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was measured by N 2 adsorption at 77 K using a volumetric gas adsorption apparatus (BELmini, Bel Japan, Inc.).The UV-vis diffuse reflectance (UV-vis DR) spectra were measured using a JASCO Corporation V-670 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere.Spectralon filled with BaSO 4 , supplied by Labsphere Inc., was used as a reflection standard.SEM images were obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, SU-8220, Hitachi High-Technologies) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) at an acceleration voltage of 3.0 kV.The XPS measurement was acquired using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCA 3400, Shimadzu Corp.), and calibrated by the peak that can be assigned to C 1s. The photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O was carried out in a flow system using an inner-irradiation-type reaction vessel at room temperature and ambient pressure.The photocatalyst (1.0 g) was dispersed in ultrapure water (1.0 L) containing 0.1 mol of NaHCO 3 , and CO 2 gas (99.999) was bubbled into the solution at a flow rate of 30 mL min -1 .The suspension was irradiated under a 400 W highpressure mercury lamp with a quartz filter connected to a water cooling system.The generated gaseous products such as H 2 , O 2 , and CO were analyzed by thermal conductivity detector-gas chromatography (TCD-GC) using a GC-8A chromatograph (Shimadzu Corp.) equipped with a Molecular Sieve 5A column with Ar as the carrier gas and by flame ionization detector-gas chromatography (FID-GC) with a methanizer using a ShinCarbon ST column with N 2 as the carrier gas. The selectivity toward CO evolution compared to H 2 evolution and the balance between consumed electrons (e -) and holes (h ) can generally be described using the formulae shown below: where R CO , R H2 , and R O2 represent the rate of formation of CO, H 2 , and O 2 , respectively."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "The fabricated Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods with 1.0 wt Ag cocatalyst exhibited activity for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O under UV irradiation (Fig. 9A).", "context": "Taking into account that the melting point of KCl is approximately 1049 K, we calcined the mixture of KCl and precursors above 1100 K, in order to investigate the effect of calcination temperature on the physical and chemical properties of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 .No obvious change was observed in the XRD patterns of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 with increasing temperature calcined from 1123 K to 1373 K, as shown in Fig. 1A.However, peaks assigned to a slight impurity phase are found in the 2A range 24 -34 in the enlarged XRD pattern of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 calcined at 1123 K, as shown in Fig. 1B.The other peaks in the samples are consistent with those of TTB-type Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 24, which indicates that a pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 is obtained when KCl (F/P 2) is used as flux at 1173 K for 3 h.The crystallite diameter was determined using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (320) plane according to the Scherrer equation.The samples calcined at different temperatures showed similar crystallite diameters (Fig. 1C), which suggests that the calcination temperature does not promote crystallinity.On the other hand, the calcination temperature showed an obvious effect on the BET specific surface area, which decreased from 10.57 to 4.54 m 2 g -1 , as calcination temperature increased from 1123 K to 1373 K.The calcination time does not have an impact on the XRD pattern, but does have an impact on the morphology of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 , as shown in Figs. 3 and4.The pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 was obtained even when calcination was carried out at 1173 K for 1 h.No apparent change was observed in the XRD patterns with an increase in the calcination time from 1 to 20 h (Fig. 3A andB).The crystallite diameter showed a slight enhancement from 42.2 to 43.6 nm; however, the BET specific surface area showed a significant decrease with an increase in the calcining time from 1 to 5 h.Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 calcined at 1173 K for 1 h showed the largest BET specific surface area (10.03 m 2 g -1 ), while that of the other samples was only approximately 6 m 2 g -1 (Fig. 3C). The SEM image of the sample calcined at 1173 K for 1 h in KCl flux (F/P 2) shows a structure with a large number of nanoplates and a small number of nanorods (Fig. 4(a) and (b)).Since there were no other phases except for the TTB phase according to the XRD patterns (Fig. 3A andB), these nanoplates should comprise either crystallized or amorphous Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 .EDS analysis of one nanoparticle indicated that K, Sr, Ta, and O elements were well mapped with its morphology (Fig. S1); therefore, we expect that these nanoplates are also Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 .Only nanorods were observed when the calcination time was increased to 3 h (Fig. 4(c)).The well-shaped Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods were obtained when the samples were calcined at 1173 K for more than 3 h using KCl flux (F/P 2) (Fig. 4(d)-(f)). The mass ratio of flux (KCl to precursors) usually affects the morphology, phase, purity, and crystallinity of the products 25.First, we compared the flux method with the SSR and PC methods for the fabrication of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 .Interestingly, pure TTB structure of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 could not be obtained by the SSR and PC methods.The XRD patterns clearly show that a pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 is not obtained by the SSR method without any flux (Fig. 5A).The main phase is assigned to Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 obtained after performing calcination for 3 h at 1173 K 26.We tried to prepare Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 at high temperatures and long calcination periods using the SSR method (e.g., 1773 K for 24 h); however, the pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 was still not obtained (Fig. S2(a)).PC method is one of the most famous methods for the fabrication of tantalates, and has been investigated by many researchers 23,272829.However, the pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 was still not obtained at 1173 K for 3 h using the PC method (Fig. S2(b)).These results indicate that both the SSR and PC methods are unsuitable for the fabrication of the pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 at 1173 K for 3 h.However, the pure phase of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 was obtained even with the low ratio of KCl flux (F/P 0.5) at 1173 K for 3 h.Further increasing the F/P ratio from 1.0 to 3.0 did not cause any obvious phase change (Fig. 5B).Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the SSR method (without KCl flux) showed the lowest crystallite diameter and BET specific surface area amongst all the samples (Fig. 5C).This can be explained by the fact that the particles are sintered easily by using the SSR method.In contrast, Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the flux method in different F/P ratios showed similar crystallite diameters and BET specific surface areas, indicating that these physical properties are influenced by the presence or absence of flux but not by the F/P ratio. Fig. 6 shows the SEM images of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 prepared by calcination at 1173 K for 3 h in different F/P ratios.The morphology of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the SSR method (F/P 0) at 1173 K for 3 h displayed irregular nanoparticles of 0.5-1 m diameters (Fig. 6(a) and (b)).nanoparticles of large sizes were obtained by the SSR method at 1773 K for 24 h without flux (Fig. S3(a)), whereas nanoparticles of similar morphology were obtained by the PC method at 1173 K for 3 h (Fig. S3(b)).However, only nanorods were observed in the samples fabricated by the flux method (Fig. 6(c)-(f)).Despite increasing the F/P ratio from 0.5 to 2.0, the length of these nanorods did not change significantly, further increasing the F/P ratio to 3.0 increased the length of nanorods (Fig. 6(f)).Based on the analysis above, it can be concluded that KCl flux plays an essential role in the growth of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods. In order to obtain information about elemental distribution for the Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods, EDS analysis was carefully performed.(300 nm) is lower than that of the flux method (310 nm).Moreover, all the materials fabricated by using the flux method showed a similar absorption edge at around 310 nm, indicating that materials prepared using different flux ratios showed no obvious effect on the band gap.Fig. 8D shows 1.0 wt Ag-loaded Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 sample fabricated at 1173 K for 3 h in KCl flux (F/P 2).The broad absorption band from 330 to 650 nm is owing to the surface plasmon absorption of Ag nanoparticles deposited by a chemical reduction method 1617181922,23. The fabricated Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods with 1.0 wt Ag cocatalyst exhibited activity for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O under UV irradiation (Fig. 9A).An almost stoichiometric formation rate of O 2 as an oxidation product together with those of CO and H 2 as reduction products were obtained in all cases, which indicates that H 2 O works as an electron donor for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 .All the components of the system, i.e., photocatalyst, photoirradiation, CO 2 bubbling, a Ag cocatalyst, and a NaHCO 3 additive, are necessary to achieve the highly selective conversion of CO 2 into CO.We carried out five blank tests by keeping one component absent in each test and performed the reaction.We observed that Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 with the Ag cocatalyst in an aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 with bubbling CO 2 under photoirradiation can consistently achieve a high formation rate of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O, as shown in Fig. 9A.Without the NaHCO 3 additive, water splitting proceeded as the dominant reaction, leading to the evolution of the highest formation rate of H 2 (Fig. 9B).Carbonate species might play an important role in desorption of O 2 during photocatalytic water splitting, which was reported by Sayama et al. 30.In our system, NaHCO 3 might also play such kind of function, which leads to the suppression of the H 2 generation when flowing CO 2. Similarly, without the Ag cocatalyst, H 2 was the main product, while the evolution of CO was very low (Fig. 9C).This indicates that the Ag cocatalyst is an important factor in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 in an aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 .When inert Ar gas was used instead of CO 2 , maximum photocatalytic water splitting was observed and only a very small amount of CO derived from NaHCO 3 was formed (Fig. 9D).This indicates that CO 2 acts not only as a carbon source, but also as a balance gas to maintain the concentration of the HCO 3 -ion, which provides suitable pH values for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O.In the absence of a photocatalyst or photoirradiation (Fig. 9E andF), almost no products were detected.Fig. 10A shows the formation rates of CO, O 2 , and H 2 for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanoplates and nanorods calcined at different temperatures for 3 h in KCl flux (F/P 2) and characterized by XRD, BET analysis, and SEM, as shown in Figs. 1 and2.Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 calcined at 1123 K for 3 h in KCl flux (F/P 2) exhibited the lowest formation rate of CO (38.2 mol h -1 ) and the highest formation rate of H 2 (43.2 mol h -1 ), resulting in a selectivity of only 46.9 toward CO evolution.When the calcination temperature was increased by only 50 K to up to 1173 K, the formation rate of CO increased to 63.0 mol h -1 , while the formation rate of H 2 was significantly suppressed to only 12.6 mol h -1 .The resulting selectivity toward CO evolution dramatically increased to 83.3.This result implies that the mixture of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanoplates and nanorods containing an unknown impurity, even with the highest BET specific surface area, exhibits activity in favor of water splitting and not for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O. Increasing the calcination temperature from 1223 K to 1373 K led to a slight decrease in the photocatalytic activity for the formation rate of CO, which might be due to the decrease in the BET specific surface area and the increase in the length of the nanorods 31.Overall, these results indicate that the Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods prepared using a flux method show high formation rates of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution. Fig. 10B shows the formation rates of CO, O 2 , and H 2 for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanoplates and nanorods calcined for different calcination periods at 1173 K in KCl flux (F/P 2), and were characterized by XRD, BET analysis, and SEM, as shown in Figs. 3 and4.The Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 calcined for 1 h comprised a mixture of nanoplates and nanorods and showed the lowest formation rate of CO (42.8 mol h -1 ).This result was similar to that observed when the Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 particles were calcined at 1123 K for 3 h.We can therefore conclude that the important factor for obtaining a high formation rate of CO and good selectivity toward CO evolution is the formation of pure nanorods, and not a high BET specific surface area.Increasing the calcination duration from 5 to 20 h led to a slight decrease in the formation rate of CO and an increase of the formation rate of H 2 . Fig. 10C shows the formation rates of CO, O 2 , and H 2 for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanoparticles and nanorods calcined in different F/P ratios at 1173 K for 3 h and characterized by XRD, BET analysis, and SEM, as shown in Figs. 5 and6.A F/P ratio of 0 means that the sample was fabricated using the SSR method (without flux).The F/P 0 sample comprising mainly of Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 nanoparticles showed the lowest selectivity toward CO evolution (48.4) among all the samples with different mass ratios of flux.The low formation rate of CO (44 mol h -1 ) indicates that we did not observe a high formation rate of CO or a good selectivity toward CO evolution in the absence of pure phase Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 .We also carried out the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the SSR method at 1773 K for 24 h.However, such a high calcination temperature and long calcination duration led to a very small BET specific surface area (0.5 m 2 g -1 ) and very low photocatalytic activity (Table S1(a)).Pure phase of Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 was obtained by using SrCl 2 as flux at 1273 K for 6 h (Fig. S2(c)), which was similar to the findings reported elsewhere 26.The as-fabricated Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 mainly showed activity for the overall water splitting reaction under the phase of Sr 2 Ta 2 O 7 impurity then leads to low photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion to CO using H 2 O as an electron donor. The formation rate of CO increased and that of H 2 dramatically suppressed over Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 fabricated by the flux method, as compared to that prepared by the SSR method.Flux method as a simple and cost-effective way to fabricate well-shaped and well-crystallized particles has been widely investigated 25,32,33.Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods fabricated in KCl flux in a lower calcination temperature and shorter time showed the highest photocatalytic activity and good selectivity toward CO evolution comparing with that of samples fabricated using SSR method.This might be due to the formation of regular morphology of photocatalyst, these nanorods were grown along the 001 direction, which was reported by Wang et al. 24.The nanorods were also reported to be more efficiency for migration of photogenerated electrons and holes than that of nanoparticles 23, which should be responsible for the high photocatalytic activity of CO 2 conversion by H 2 O.The formation rate of CO and selectivity toward CO evolution increased with an increase in the F/P ratio and reached a maximum at F/P 1.0.Further increase in the F/P ratio to 3.0 led to a significant decrease in the photocatalytic activity toward CO evolution.The Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods fabricated at F/P 1.0 showed the highest photocatalytic activity toward CO evolution at 65.5 mol h -1 and good selectivity toward CO evolution (88.7) among all the samples.Fig. 11 shows the time course of H 2 , O 2 , and CO evolutions for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over the Agmodified Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods calcined at 1173 K for 3 h in KCl flux (F/P 1), which represents the optimal fabrication conditions.CO was evolved as the main reduction product, and a small amount of H 2 was generated during the first run.Simultaneously, the evolution of O 2 increased linearly during the reaction.The evolution of CO, H 2 , and O 2 are in an approximately stoichiometric ratio, indicating that the number of photo-electrons used for the reduction of CO 2 and protons is equivalent to the number of holes consumed for H 2 O oxidation.It was observed that the formation rate of CO decreased together with a small increase in the formation rate of H 2 , during the second and third runs.However, it should be noted that the main product of the photocatalytic reduction was still CO even during the third run, indicating that CO was produced in preference to H 2 . Fig. 12a andb show the SEM images of the Ag-modified Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorod calcined at 1173 K for 3 h in KCl (F/P 1) flux before and after the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O.It was clearly seen that Ag nanoparticles were well anchored on the nanorods, and the size of these Ag nanoparticles is 5-30 nm (Fig. S4a).We have previously reported that only the smaller Ag nanoparticles contribute to the high selectivity toward CO evolution and the subsequent evolution of stoichiometric amounts of O 2 for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O over Ag/SrO/Ta 2 O 5 19.However, the size of Ag nanoparticles after photoirradication was increased to 20-80 nm (Fig. S4b), which was much larger than that before the photoirradiation, on the other hand, the number of Ag anchored on the surface of nanorods were decreased (Fig. 12c andd), which should be due to re-photodeposition and aggregation of the Ag nanoparticles.Ag nanoparticles are known to easily leach into a solution as Ag ions under photoirradiation 34. Fig. 13 shows Ag 3d X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of Agmodified Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods calcined at 1173 K for 3 h in KCl (F/P 1) flux before the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by H 2 O. Ag 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks appeared at binding energies of 367.4 and 373.4 eV, respectively.The 3d peaks of Ag are doublets with energy separation of 6.0 eV.This indicates that the metallic Ag nanoparticles are dispersed on the surface of Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 35.The Ag 3d XPS after the reaction showed an obvious decrease of peak intensity.The percentage of Ag/Ta atom after the reaction was 6, which was much smaller than that before the reaction (Ag/Ta 17), implying the dissolution of Ag during the photocatalytic reaction.It is also noted that the Ag 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks shift to a lower binding energy after the reaction, which indicates that zerovalent Ag changed into monovalent Ag 36.From the results of SEM and XPS, the sudden decline in the formation rate of CO evolution is attributed to the aggregation and dissolution of Ag nanoparticles as cocatalysts.Based on these analyses, we conclude that it is important to ensure that the cocatalyst consist of highly dispersed Ag nanoparticles anchored on the surface of the Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 nanorods, and that the pH value is controlled in an aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 , in order to ensure a stable rate of formation of CO."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Mercury", "source": "The suspension was irradiated under a 400 W highpressure mercury lamp with a quartz filter connected to a water cooling system.", "context": "Sr 2 KTa 5 O 15 was fabricated by a KCl flux method with modification of the reported literature by Wark et al. 24.A stoichiometric mixture of K 2 CO 3 (99.5,Wako), SrCO 3 (99.9,Wako), and Ta 2 O 5 (99.9,Kojundo) was ground with a specific amount of KCl (99.9,Wako) in an Al 2 O 3 crucible for 5 min.The mass ratio of the KCl used as flux to the precursors (K 2 CO 3 , SrCO 3 , and Ta 2 O 5 ) is abbreviated as F/P (flux/precursors).The mixture mentioned above was then transferred to a 50 mL the Al 2 O 3 crucible.The resulting mixture was calcined from 1123 K to 1373 K for 1-20 h in air.After cooling down to room temperature, the mixture was thoroughly washed with 300 mL distilled water at 358 K and then filtered with 1.0 L hot water in order to remove any residual salts, and then dried in air at 80 C.
