The length-to-width ratio of Bi2S3 nanoribbons can be tuned by varying the molar ratio of bismuth to sulfur in the precursor source.Fig. 3 shows typical TEM images of Bi2S3 nanoribbons prepared with the molar ratio of bismuth to sulfur equal to the stoichiometric ratio of Bi2S3 (i.e., 2:3).It is found that the Bi2S3 has a width of about 25 nm and length of about 170 nm, i.e., the length-to-width ratio is about 7. The TEM images of Bi2S3 nanoribbons prepared with different bismuth-to-sulfur ratio while at a fixed bismuth concentration of 0.027 mol/L are shown in Fig. 4. When the sulfur source is deficient (Bi:S 2:1), the as-prepared nanoribbons have a width of about 80 nm and length of about 480 nm, i.e., the length-to-width ratio of about 6 (Fig. 4a and4b).Here it can be seen more clearly that the morphology of the obtained Bi2S3 is similar to the bamboo leaf, thus denoted as the nanoribbon.With a further decrease of sulfur source (Bi:S 4:1), the resulting Bi2S3 exhibits parallel close-packed nanostructure by many nanoribbons with about 50 nm in width and about 123 nm in length (Fig. 4c and4d) and the lowest length-to-width ratio of about 2.5 is achieved (i.e., Bi2S3-SAR).When the sulfur source is in excess (Bi:S 1:3), the obtained nanoribbons have a width of about 16 nm and length of about 145 nm (Fig. 4e and4f) and the largest length-to-width ratio of about 9 is achieved (i.e., Bi2S3-LAR).Thus, the length-to-width ratio of the nanoribbons decreases with increasing molar ratio of bismuth to sulfur in the precursor.Since the concentration of bismuth in the precursor is fixed at a constant value, in the beginning the decrease of sulfur source from the excess amount results in an increase in both the width and length of the nanoribbons. The increase rate is faster for the width than that for the length, giving rise to a decrease in the length-to-width ratio.When the molar ratio of bismuth to sulfur increases to a value like 2:1 (i.e., the decrease of sulfur in the precursor reaches an amount), both the width and length decrease with further decrease in the amount of sulfur, and the change rate of length is much faster than that in the width, leading to a sharp decrease in the length-to-width ratio. Based on the above results, the formation mechanism is proposed for the observed Bi2S3 nanoribbons.The ODC is used as the solvent during the synthesis of Bi2S3 nanoribbons, OAm as the reducing agent, BiCl3 as the bismuth precursor, and sulfur powder as the sulfur source.The BiOCl is obtained via the transformation of BiCl3 47 which can react with the injected sulfur source at high temperature to form Bi2S3 due to the strong affinity between bismuth and sulfur.The orthorhombic Bi2S3 exhibits a highly anisotropic layered structure consisting of infinite ribbon-like Bi4S6 polymers, which are linked together by intermolecular attraction between the Bi and S atoms.The chain-like building blocks are parallel to the c-axis 48.Thus, Bi2S3 has a strong tendency to grow along 001 direction, leading to the formation of 1-D structure like nanoribbons and nanowires.The kinetics of nanocrystal growth can be changed significantly, dependent on the amount of the sulfur in the precursor.When there is excessive sulfur in the reaction solution, the presence of free sulfur can increase the thermodynamic driving force for nucleation and thus the formation rate of Bi2S3 49, resulting in a small value for both the width and length of the nanoribbons.It has a larger influence on the width than on the length due to some reason, leading to the decrease in the length-to-width ratio with decreasing amount of sulfur in the precursor solution.Similarly, when the deficiency of sulfur source reaches a specific value (such as Bi:S 2:1), both the width and length decrease with further decrease in the amount of sulfur.So the size of Bi2S3 nanoribbons and, thereby, the length-to-width ratio, can be tuned via changing the bismuth-to-sulfur ratio in the precursor.It is noted that the detailed mechanism is still unclear and needs further study. The energy levels of the obtained Bi2S3 nanoribbons have been studied by the UV-vis absorption spectra and XPS valence band (VB) spectra.All of the as-prepared Bi2S3 nanoribbons clearly show strong adsorption in the UV-visible region and have a broad peak between 650 and 800 nm.The optical bandgap (Eg) of a semiconductor can be calculated from the equation of (h) n A(h -Eg), where is the absorption coefficient, A is the parameter related to the effective mass associated with the valence and conduction bands, and h is the light energy.The n is dependent on the characteristics of the transition in a semiconductor (n 2 for direct transition and n1 for indirect transition).Here n is 2 as Bi2S3 is a direct-gap semiconductor.From the plot of (h) 2 versus h, the Eg of Bi2S3 nanoribbons is determined to be about 1.22, 1.27 and 1.38 eV for Bi2S3-SAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-LAR, respectively (inset of Fig. 5a). The XPS VB spectra of Bi2S3-SAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-LAR are shown in Fig. 5b.The VB value for Bi2S3-SAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-LAR is determined to be 0.70, 0.73 and 0.79 eV, respectively.As the work function of XPS instrument is 4.62 eV, the VB band for the Bi2S3-SAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-LAR is calculated to be 0.82, 0.85 and 0.91 V (vs SHE, provided 4.5 eV vs vacuum level is 0 V vs SHE) , respectively.The respective conduction band (CB) value of the Bi2S3-SAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-LAR is -0.40, -0.42 and -0.47 V in terms of the above Eg values.So the CB potential of Bi2S3 samples becomes more and more negative with increasing amount of sulfur precursor.The alignment of energy levels can thus be drawn (Fig. 6). The CO2 photoreduction over different Bi2S3 nanocatalysts was evaluated in aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm).Fig. 7a 7a shows the CH3OH yield over Bi2S3 nanocatalysts.After 10 h, the yield over Bi2S3-LAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-SAR is 320.2, 280.5 and 259.4 mol/g, respectively.The CH3OH yield over Bi2S3-LAR is about 1.1 times of that over the Bi2S3-MAR and about 1.2 times of that over the Bi2S3-SAR.In addition, the reaction of CH3OH production over the Bi2S3-LAR has been repeated for three times (Fig. 7b). Since no obvious decay can be observed in the production yield, the Bi2S3-LAR nanoribbons photocatalysts are relatively stable under the experimental conditions used in this work. The mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CH3OH over different Bi2S3 nanoribbons is briefly discussed here in terms of Fig. 6, though the details are still unclear.Since the CB potential of Bi2S3 nanoribbons is more negative than the CH3OH redox potential, the electrons photogenerated upon illumination can reduce CO2 into CH3OH.The initial photocatalytic step is believed to be the activation of CO2 on the catalyst surface to form surface-bound metastable radical anion (CO2 ) 50.Then the reduction proceeds via a series of successive steps, involving the transfer of electrons, protons, and/or hydrogen radicals (H), as well as breaking C-O bonds and creating new C-H bonds.The formation of CH3OH can proceed through the pathway of formaldehyde or carbine, depending on the binding mode of CO2 on the catalyst surface 50.In terms of the formaldehyde pathway, the CO2 recombines with H radical to form HCOOH, which is favored in the medium with a high dielectric constant like water 51.Then the HCOOH accepts a further H to form a dihydroxymethyl radical (CH(OH)2), which dehydrates upon attachment of another H to HCHO.The CH3OH is formed by further reduction of HCHO.According to the carbine pathway, the CO2 radicals can react with H to form CO, which is then reduced to C radicals, followed by the formation of a series of CH, CH2 and CH3 radicals through successive reactions 52.The CH3 radicals can react with OH to produce CH3OH. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes left in the valence band of Bi2S3 may oxidize the adsorbed H2O to produce hydroxyl radicals (OH).It may be very difficult to get the O2 evolution since it requires four holes per O2 molecule 50.Moreover, the O2 radicals may be formed and adsorbed on the catalyst surface 50,53.The oxidation species (holes, OH and O2 ) may oxidize the Bi2S3 catalyst itself and even a small fraction of the photoreduction products.The former process explains the observed decay of product yield upon each photoreduction run (Fig. 7b). The photoreduction activity of a nanocatalyst is dependent on many factors.The first one is the CB potential as it reflects the reduction capability of the photogenerated electrons.It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the Bi2S3-LAR exhibits the most negative CB potential, followed by the Bi2S3-MAR, and the Bi2S3-SAR has the least negative CB potential.This sequence agrees well with that for the photoreduction activity. The BET specific surface area is another one since a large BET surface area usually implies a large amount of surface active sites, which is measured using the nitrogen adsorption-desorption method.The BET surface area of the Bi2S3-SAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-LAR is thus calculated to be 13.78, 36.62 and 169.12 m 2 /g, respectively.This is consistent with the TEM results (Fig. 4).The Bi2S3-LAR has a small width and length and thus exhibits the highest BET value.Though the Bi2S3-SAR also has a small width and length, the as-prepared nanoribbons closely pack together, resulting in a less BET value. The recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs is also an important factor that has an impact on the photocatalytic activity of a nanocatalyst, which is studied by the PL spectra in this work as the PL emission results mainly from the recombination of free charge carriers.Fig. 8a shows the PL spectra of different Bi2S3 nanoribbons.It can be seen that the Bi2S3-SAR has the strongest PL intensity, followed by the Bi2S3-MAR, and the Bi2S3-LAR has the lowest intensity.It is known that a low PL intensity may imply a low recombination of the charge carriers 54. Thus, the Bi2S3-LAR exhibits the lowest recombination of electron-hole pairs and, thereby, the highest photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The time-resolved PL is a more accurate technique to study the recombination of charge carriers than the steady-state PL one.Fig. 8b shows the time-resolved PL spectra of different Bi2S3 nanoribbons excited at 650 nm and recorded at 820 nm.All of the samples display an exponential decay, which can be fitted by using the tri-exponential decay kinetics.The results are listed in Table 1.The PL lifetime can be divided into three different processes, the non-radiative process (1), radiative process (2) and energy transfer process (3).It is found that the Bi2S3-LAR shows the longest lifetime among all the samples for all these three processes.Since the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes directly relates with the radiative process 55,56, the Bi2S3-LAR has the highest separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs and, accordingly, the highest photocatalytic reduction of CO2."}, {"llm generation": "Bi2S3 nanoribbons", "source": "The as-prepared Bi2S3 nanoribbons with different length-to-width ratio exhibit different photocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction into CH3OH in the water, which is dependent on the alignment of the energy levels, BET specific surface area, and the recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers.", "context": "In summary, Bi2S3 nanoribbons with different length-to-width ratio have been successfully synthesized via the solvothermal technique.The molar ratio of Bi and S sources plays a crucial role in the modulation of the width and length of the obtained Bi2S3 nanoribbons.The as-prepared Bi2S3 nanoribbons with different length-to-width ratio exhibit different photocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction into CH3OH in the water, which is dependent on the alignment of the energy levels, BET specific surface area, and the recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers.The results indicate that the Bi2S3 may be a promising material for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.It is suggested that the future research focus on the fabrication of heterojunction nanocatalysts based on the Bi2S3, as this may simultaneously improve the photoactivity and photostability. XPS analysis was used to probe the chemical states of Bi and S in the obtainedBi2S3 nanoribbons and to further analyze the surface chemical composition of the samples.No peaks of other elements except Bi, S, C, and O are observed in the XPS survey spectrum (Fig.2a), indicating the high purity of the Bi2S3 nanocrystals. demonstrates the time course of the products of photocatalytic reduction.Representative methanol (CH3OH) signal is observed, and the formation of a small amount of CH3OH is detected after 1 h irradiation.Signals from other potential products like CH4, HCOOH, CO and H2 are not observed.This indicates that the Bi2S3 samples are selective to CH3OH formation.The control experiments are also performed to further understand the mechanism of the CH3OH formation.No hydrocarbon products are detected in the absence of CO2 introduction, light irradiation or nanocatalysts.So the CH3OH is produced solely through the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

The length-to-width ratio of Bi2S3 nanoribbons can be tuned by varying the molar ratio of bismuth to sulfur in the precursor source.Fig. 3 shows typical TEM images of Bi2S3 nanoribbons prepared with the molar ratio of bismuth to sulfur equal to the stoichiometric ratio of Bi2S3 (i.e., 2:3).It is found that the Bi2S3 has a width of about 25 nm and length of about 170 nm, i.e., the length-to-width ratio is about 7. The TEM images of Bi2S3 nanoribbons prepared with different bismuth-to-sulfur ratio while at a fixed bismuth concentration of 0.027 mol/L are shown in Fig. 4. When the sulfur source is deficient (Bi:S 2:1), the as-prepared nanoribbons have a width of about 80 nm and length of about 480 nm, i.e., the length-to-width ratio of about 6 (Fig. 4a and4b).Here it can be seen more clearly that the morphology of the obtained Bi2S3 is similar to the bamboo leaf, thus denoted as the nanoribbon.With a further decrease of sulfur source (Bi:S 4:1), the resulting Bi2S3 exhibits parallel close-packed nanostructure by many nanoribbons with about 50 nm in width and about 123 nm in length (Fig. 4c and4d) and the lowest length-to-width ratio of about 2.5 is achieved (i.e., Bi2S3-SAR).When the sulfur source is in excess (Bi:S 1:3), the obtained nanoribbons have a width of about 16 nm and length of about 145 nm (Fig. 4e and4f) and the largest length-to-width ratio of about 9 is achieved (i.e., Bi2S3-LAR).Thus, the length-to-width ratio of the nanoribbons decreases with increasing molar ratio of bismuth to sulfur in the precursor.Since the concentration of bismuth in the precursor is fixed at a constant value, in the beginning the decrease of sulfur source from the excess amount results in an increase in both the width and length of the nanoribbons. The increase rate is faster for the width than that for the length, giving rise to a decrease in the length-to-width ratio.When the molar ratio of bismuth to sulfur increases to a value like 2:1 (i.e., the decrease of sulfur in the precursor reaches an amount), both the width and length decrease with further decrease in the amount of sulfur, and the change rate of length is much faster than that in the width, leading to a sharp decrease in the length-to-width ratio. Based on the above results, the formation mechanism is proposed for the observed Bi2S3 nanoribbons.The ODC is used as the solvent during the synthesis of Bi2S3 nanoribbons, OAm as the reducing agent, BiCl3 as the bismuth precursor, and sulfur powder as the sulfur source.The BiOCl is obtained via the transformation of BiCl3 47 which can react with the injected sulfur source at high temperature to form Bi2S3 due to the strong affinity between bismuth and sulfur.The orthorhombic Bi2S3 exhibits a highly anisotropic layered structure consisting of infinite ribbon-like Bi4S6 polymers, which are linked together by intermolecular attraction between the Bi and S atoms.The chain-like building blocks are parallel to the c-axis 48.Thus, Bi2S3 has a strong tendency to grow along 001 direction, leading to the formation of 1-D structure like nanoribbons and nanowires.The kinetics of nanocrystal growth can be changed significantly, dependent on the amount of the sulfur in the precursor.When there is excessive sulfur in the reaction solution, the presence of free sulfur can increase the thermodynamic driving force for nucleation and thus the formation rate of Bi2S3 49, resulting in a small value for both the width and length of the nanoribbons.It has a larger influence on the width than on the length due to some reason, leading to the decrease in the length-to-width ratio with decreasing amount of sulfur in the precursor solution.Similarly, when the deficiency of sulfur source reaches a specific value (such as Bi:S 2:1), both the width and length decrease with further decrease in the amount of sulfur.So the size of Bi2S3 nanoribbons and, thereby, the length-to-width ratio, can be tuned via changing the bismuth-to-sulfur ratio in the precursor.It is noted that the detailed mechanism is still unclear and needs further study. The energy levels of the obtained Bi2S3 nanoribbons have been studied by the UV-vis absorption spectra and XPS valence band (VB) spectra.All of the as-prepared Bi2S3 nanoribbons clearly show strong adsorption in the UV-visible region and have a broad peak between 650 and 800 nm.The optical bandgap (Eg) of a semiconductor can be calculated from the equation of (h) n A(h -Eg), where is the absorption coefficient, A is the parameter related to the effective mass associated with the valence and conduction bands, and h is the light energy.The n is dependent on the characteristics of the transition in a semiconductor (n 2 for direct transition and n1 for indirect transition).Here n is 2 as Bi2S3 is a direct-gap semiconductor.From the plot of (h) 2 versus h, the Eg of Bi2S3 nanoribbons is determined to be about 1.22, 1.27 and 1.38 eV for Bi2S3-SAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-LAR, respectively (inset of Fig. 5a). The XPS VB spectra of Bi2S3-SAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-LAR are shown in Fig. 5b.The VB value for Bi2S3-SAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-LAR is determined to be 0.70, 0.73 and 0.79 eV, respectively.As the work function of XPS instrument is 4.62 eV, the VB band for the Bi2S3-SAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-LAR is calculated to be 0.82, 0.85 and 0.91 V (vs SHE, provided 4.5 eV vs vacuum level is 0 V vs SHE) , respectively.The respective conduction band (CB) value of the Bi2S3-SAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-LAR is -0.40, -0.42 and -0.47 V in terms of the above Eg values.So the CB potential of Bi2S3 samples becomes more and more negative with increasing amount of sulfur precursor.The alignment of energy levels can thus be drawn (Fig. 6). The CO2 photoreduction over different Bi2S3 nanocatalysts was evaluated in aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm).Fig. 7a 7a shows the CH3OH yield over Bi2S3 nanocatalysts.After 10 h, the yield over Bi2S3-LAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-SAR is 320.2, 280.5 and 259.4 mol/g, respectively.The CH3OH yield over Bi2S3-LAR is about 1.1 times of that over the Bi2S3-MAR and about 1.2 times of that over the Bi2S3-SAR.In addition, the reaction of CH3OH production over the Bi2S3-LAR has been repeated for three times (Fig. 7b). Since no obvious decay can be observed in the production yield, the Bi2S3-LAR nanoribbons photocatalysts are relatively stable under the experimental conditions used in this work. The mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CH3OH over different Bi2S3 nanoribbons is briefly discussed here in terms of Fig. 6, though the details are still unclear.Since the CB potential of Bi2S3 nanoribbons is more negative than the CH3OH redox potential, the electrons photogenerated upon illumination can reduce CO2 into CH3OH.The initial photocatalytic step is believed to be the activation of CO2 on the catalyst surface to form surface-bound metastable radical anion (CO2 ) 50.Then the reduction proceeds via a series of successive steps, involving the transfer of electrons, protons, and/or hydrogen radicals (H), as well as breaking C-O bonds and creating new C-H bonds.The formation of CH3OH can proceed through the pathway of formaldehyde or carbine, depending on the binding mode of CO2 on the catalyst surface 50.In terms of the formaldehyde pathway, the CO2 recombines with H radical to form HCOOH, which is favored in the medium with a high dielectric constant like water 51.Then the HCOOH accepts a further H to form a dihydroxymethyl radical (CH(OH)2), which dehydrates upon attachment of another H to HCHO.The CH3OH is formed by further reduction of HCHO.According to the carbine pathway, the CO2 radicals can react with H to form CO, which is then reduced to C radicals, followed by the formation of a series of CH, CH2 and CH3 radicals through successive reactions 52.The CH3 radicals can react with OH to produce CH3OH. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes left in the valence band of Bi2S3 may oxidize the adsorbed H2O to produce hydroxyl radicals (OH).It may be very difficult to get the O2 evolution since it requires four holes per O2 molecule 50.Moreover, the O2 radicals may be formed and adsorbed on the catalyst surface 50,53.The oxidation species (holes, OH and O2 ) may oxidize the Bi2S3 catalyst itself and even a small fraction of the photoreduction products.The former process explains the observed decay of product yield upon each photoreduction run (Fig. 7b). The photoreduction activity of a nanocatalyst is dependent on many factors.The first one is the CB potential as it reflects the reduction capability of the photogenerated electrons.It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the Bi2S3-LAR exhibits the most negative CB potential, followed by the Bi2S3-MAR, and the Bi2S3-SAR has the least negative CB potential.This sequence agrees well with that for the photoreduction activity. The BET specific surface area is another one since a large BET surface area usually implies a large amount of surface active sites, which is measured using the nitrogen adsorption-desorption method.The BET surface area of the Bi2S3-SAR, Bi2S3-MAR and Bi2S3-LAR is thus calculated to be 13.78, 36.62 and 169.12 m 2 /g, respectively.This is consistent with the TEM results (Fig. 4).The Bi2S3-LAR has a small width and length and thus exhibits the highest BET value.Though the Bi2S3-SAR also has a small width and length, the as-prepared nanoribbons closely pack together, resulting in a less BET value. The recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs is also an important factor that has an impact on the photocatalytic activity of a nanocatalyst, which is studied by the PL spectra in this work as the PL emission results mainly from the recombination of free charge carriers.Fig. 8a shows the PL spectra of different Bi2S3 nanoribbons.It can be seen that the Bi2S3-SAR has the strongest PL intensity, followed by the Bi2S3-MAR, and the Bi2S3-LAR has the lowest intensity.It is known that a low PL intensity may imply a low recombination of the charge carriers 54. Thus, the Bi2S3-LAR exhibits the lowest recombination of electron-hole pairs and, thereby, the highest photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The time-resolved PL is a more accurate technique to study the recombination of charge carriers than the steady-state PL one.Fig. 8b shows the time-resolved PL spectra of different Bi2S3 nanoribbons excited at 650 nm and recorded at 820 nm.All of the samples display an exponential decay, which can be fitted by using the tri-exponential decay kinetics.The results are listed in Table 1.The PL lifetime can be divided into three different processes, the non-radiative process (1), radiative process (2) and energy transfer process (3).It is found that the Bi2S3-LAR shows the longest lifetime among all the samples for all these three processes.Since the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes directly relates with the radiative process 55,56, the Bi2S3-LAR has the highest separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs and, accordingly, the highest photocatalytic reduction of CO2."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "For the photocatalytic experiments, typically 20 mg of catalyst was added into 80 mL of Milli-Q water.A suspension was obtained after the mixture was sonicated for 1 h.The quartz reactor was connected to a sealed glass pipeline, which is attached to the tanks of N2 and CO2.The reactor was sealed after the suspension was added into it, and purged with N2 to remove the O2 so as to ensure that the reaction system was under anaerobic condition.", "context": "All reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
