Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of obtained carbon nitride samples.There is a single main peak at 2 27.7 (Fig. 1a), which is the interlayer stacking peak.The peak position corresponds to an interlayer distance of d 0.32 nm similar to the (002) plane of the graphite (turbostratic) like carbon nitrides.X-ray diffraction peaks of C 3 N 4 -MCF and C 3 N 4 -SBA-15 are some weaker than those of C 3 N 4 -bulk indicating the lower crystallinity of carbon nitride obtained via matrix synthesis. According to the XRD data in a small angle region (Fig. 1b) obtained samples have slightly ordered mesostructure, which is possibly stipulated by the formation of the framework from relatively large particles.Besides, C 3 N 4 -MCF is more ordered than C 3 N 4 -SBA-15 (it is almost disordered) which can be caused by higher spatial accessibility of mesoporous cellular foam structure IR-spectra of carbon nitrides obtained via bulk and matrix method are shown on Fig. 2. The absorption band at 810 cm -1 can be attributed to the breathing mode of CN heterocycles of triazine units.The peak at 888 cm -1 and broad bands in the range of 3000-3600 cm -1 are due to deformation and stretching modes of N H vibration, besides it can be stipulated with partial condensation of amino groups 34.Peaks at 1637, 1564, 1408, 1321 and 1250 cm -1 are due to the stretching mode of C N heterocycles 35.Indicated peaks are associated with the skeletal stretching vibrations of the existent aromatic rings.The above main absorption bands are identical for all samples. TG analysis (Fig. 3) of the synthesized samples was conducted to examine whether the templates had been completely removed. According to the data from TG analysis (Fig. 3) the total weight loss for C 3 N 4 -MCF is 100.It testifies that the obtained sample contains only carbon nitride, silica matrix is absent (the same result is for C 3 N 4 -SBA-15 too).The TGA curve of carbon nitride sample shows two sharp mass losses: at 77 C and 605 C. The first mass loss can be attributed to water evaporation.The second step is related to the loss of tri-s-triazine-based units or other advanced condensates 36. Analysis of nitrogen ad(de)sorption isotherms (Fig. 4) shows that the synthesized carbon nitride samples are characterized by relatively high specific surface area (S BET -95 m 2 /g for C 3 N 4 -SBA-15, 70 m 2 /g for C 3 N 4 -MCF, 5 m 2 /g for C 3 N 4 -Bulk), total pore volume (V total -up to 0.3 cm 3 /g for C 3 N 4 -MCF, 0.2 cm 3 /g for C 3 N 4 -SBA-15, 0.02 cm 3 /g for C 3 N 4 -Bulk) and low mesopore size uniformity, which is possible due to the peculiarities of the replication process of porous structure of the initial silica matrices MCF and SBA-15 (there are two and three maximums on their mesopore size distributions respectively, Fig. 4, insert). SEM-images (Fig. 5a-c) demonstrate increasing of the dispersity of carbon nitride obtained via matrix synthesis, compared with that in bulk sample.The C 3 N 4 -Bulk sample possesses compact monolithic structure with particle size of several microns.C 3 N 4 -MCF possesses sponge-like structure while morphology of C 3 N 4 -SBA-15 is not uniform (large bulk of few m and smaller particles with size around 500 nm). According to the data of TEM analysis (fig.5, d-f) the obtained sample C 3 N 4 -Bulk possess flake-and fiber-like particles.Carbon nitride obtained in SBA-15 does not replicate the structure of the initial matrix.The structure of C 3 N 4 -MCF is similar in some extent to the foam's one.Carbon nitride obtained in MCF is a sponge-like foam.The foam-like sample also possesses some flakes (50 nm and more). In the absorption spectra of the samples obtained by the processing of diffuse reflectance spectrum using the Kubelka-Munk function (Fig. 6), the bands with the edges of absorbance at 410-440 nm (Bulk), 395-420 nm (SBA-15), 395-410 (MCF) are present.A small blue shift of the optical absorption in porous samples of carbon nitride in relation to the bulk apparently caused by quantum size effects 37,38, which are due to the change in the electronic structure of the elements constituting C 3 N 4 with decreasing of their size.Hypsochromic shift indicates an increase of the band gap, and the growth is more intense for smaller particle size of semiconductor 39.Spectra processing in the coordinates of Tauc equation for direct allowed interband electronic transitions testifies an increasing of the band gap E g of the obtained samples (points of intersection of the tangent to the linear portion of the spectrum with the abscissa axis, Fig. 6 insert) during the transition from a bulk sample of carbon nitride (E g 2.45 eV) to porous.Thus carbon nitride samples synthesized in MCF have higher value E g 2.87 eV, compared with C 3 N 4 , obtained in SBA-15 (E g 2.70 eV).It can be expected that in the case of quantum size effects, and as a result an increasing of energies and chemical potentials of photogenerated charges, the number of possible participants of photo-induced reactions in which carbon nitride can participate as photocatalyst, should be increased 39.Thus, photochemical reactions involving C 3 N 4 with quantum size effects should occur more intensively than in the presence of microcrystals of similar chemical composition and photocatalytic process will generally be carried out with higher quantum yields. Irradiation of the obtained carbon nitride samples with UV-visible light in the presence of CO 2 and water vapor leads to the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane and acetaldehyde.Similarly to the data presented in 13, acetaldehyde is the major product of the photoreduction of carbon dioxide regardless the morphology of carbon nitride (Fig. 7a).However the efficiency of the carbon dioxide reduction on the samples is strongly depend on the morphology.For the bulk material we observe the lowest yield of acetaldehyde of below 0.3 mole g -1 and methane of below 0.02 mole g -1 which is comparative to the results obtained in Ref. 13.In the article yield of acetaldehyde near 0.05 mole g -1 and methane of 0.5 mole g -1 for gC 3 N 4 nanosheets was reached after 5 h.Comparatively to this for the hard-templated samples we obtained 3.5 and 8.0 mole g -1 of acetaldehyde and 0.05 and 0.78 mole g -1 of methane for C 3 N 4 -SBA-15 and C 3 N 4 -MCF respectively.Control experiments demonstrated that under blowing the reactor with inert gas (argon), the absence of the photocatalyst or irradiation organic products within the limits of chromatographic detection are not formed.This gives us the reason to believe that carbon dioxide is the initial source of the carbon during the formation of the final products. Since the mutual correspondence of energy characteristics of components (E e tr E 0 (A/A -) (E e tr E 0 (D/D ), Fig. 8) 39 is the necessary condition of photocatalytic system based on semiconductors functioning, it can be concluded that with increasing of the band gap width of the semiconductor material (the shift of the conduction band to more negative values, and thus the valence zone is in more positive region of electrochemical potential scale), its photoactivity will increase respectively. Our studies of the activity of carbon nitride samples with different value E g , are in full agreement with the above.Attention is called to the increased rate of CH 4 formation under irradiation of C 3 N 4 -SBA-15 (Fig. 7,b) compared with other samples that in our opinion can be connected with the peculiarities of transformation mechanism of intermediate products into methane. Today there is no consensus about the possible stages and directions of the CO 2 photoreduction process.According to the literature, there are two basic ways of the products formation which are: -formation of the final compounds through the reduction of CO 2 to CO and C, followed by protonation of intermediates -reduction of carbon dioxide through a number of organic compounds, according to the scheme In the presented schemes of the mechanism methane is the final product; at the same time they do not explain the formation of compounds with C-C bond, such as acetaldehyde, which is the primary product of CO 2 reduction in our studies.Shkrob et al. based on the EPR-studies of the intermediates during the photoreduction of carbon dioxide in aqueous suspensions of anatase nanoparticles proposed a mechanism involving a number of C 2 compounds in the complex sequence of reactions which includes both the reduction and oxidation stages 40. In our studies, regardless of the carbon nitride structure there was a significant increase in the concentration of acetaldehyde in the reactor in comparison with the amount of generated methane.It can be assumed that the oxidation step of C 3 CO by the holes of the valence band is limiting in photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .Proceeding from the aforesaid, the increased rate of methane accumulation under irradiation of the sample C 3 N 4 -SBA-15 is due to the greater rate of interaction of intermediate (acetaldehyde) with photogenerated holes in the semiconductor. As it turned out, the investigated samples of carbon nitride are semiconductors with a p-type conductivity in accordance with the photoelectrochemical studies results of which are presented in Fig. 9. Photocurrent of cathodic direction is clearly observed on the received chronoamperograms at equilibrium potential in an aqueous solution of background salt.According to 41 this is a characteristic of p-type semiconductors due to the bending of the conduction band and valence band toward lower energies which leads to a set of negative charge at the interface. Since C 3 N 4 -MCF was the most active sample, further investigations were carried out with it.During addition of CO 2 into the system value of cathodic current density compared to this under deaeration with argon decreases (Fig. 10a), probably due to the acceptance of conduction band electrons by carbon dioxide. It is worth noting that the reduction of the value J can also be caused by the decrease in pH (from 7 to 3.8) of the medium by passing carbon dioxide through it.This contributes to the additional protonation of an aqueous electrolyte solution and thus increasing the number of acceptors of photoelectrons followed by liberation of molecular hydrogen.In order to prove the influence of activation of CO 2 with carbon nitride on the value of photocurrent density, the additional studies using an aprotic solvent N,N dimethylformamide were conducted.Results of these studies are shown on Fig. 10b.Chronoamperograms obtained under blowdown with an inert gas and carbon dioxide confirm the possibility of CO 2 molecules interaction with photogenerated electrons of the conduction band in C 3 N 4 which leads to a decrease in the values of cathodic photocurrent."}], "lamp": [], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Investigation of gas-phase photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out in a sealed glass reactor (V 50 cm 3 ).", "context": "In this work we used three different C 3 N 4 photocatalysts including bulk and two porous samples.C 3 N 4 -bulk was obtained via bulk pyrolysis of melamine according to 29.Melamine was placed at the middle of the quartz tube.The heating in inert atmosphere (argon) was conducted at 300 C for 1 h, then at 600 C for 2 h.Finally, yellow carbon nitride powder was obtained.

In the absorption spectra of the samples obtained by the processing of diffuse reflectance spectrum using the Kubelka-Munk function (Fig. 6), the bands with the edges of absorbance at 410-440 nm (Bulk), 395-420 nm (SBA-15), 395-410 (MCF) are present.A small blue shift of the optical absorption in porous samples of carbon nitride in relation to the bulk apparently caused by quantum size effects 37,38, which are due to the change in the electronic structure of the elements constituting C 3 N 4 with decreasing of their size.Hypsochromic shift indicates an increase of the band gap, and the growth is more intense for smaller particle size of semiconductor 39.Spectra processing in the coordinates of Tauc equation for direct allowed interband electronic transitions testifies an increasing of the band gap E g of the obtained samples (points of intersection of the tangent to the linear portion of the spectrum with the abscissa axis, Fig. 6 insert) during the transition from a bulk sample of carbon nitride (E g 2.45 eV) to porous.Thus carbon nitride samples synthesized in MCF have higher value E g 2.87 eV, compared with C 3 N 4 , obtained in SBA-15 (E g 2.70 eV).It can be expected that in the case of quantum size effects, and as a result an increasing of energies and chemical potentials of photogenerated charges, the number of possible participants of photo-induced reactions in which carbon nitride can participate as photocatalyst, should be increased 39.Thus, photochemical reactions involving C 3 N 4 with quantum size effects should occur more intensively than in the presence of microcrystals of similar chemical composition and photocatalytic process will generally be carried out with higher quantum yields. Irradiation of the obtained carbon nitride samples with UV-visible light in the presence of CO 2 and water vapor leads to the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane and acetaldehyde.Similarly to the data presented in 13, acetaldehyde is the major product of the photoreduction of carbon dioxide regardless the morphology of carbon nitride (Fig. 7a).However the efficiency of the carbon dioxide reduction on the samples is strongly depend on the morphology.For the bulk material we observe the lowest yield of acetaldehyde of below 0.3 mole g -1 and methane of below 0.02 mole g -1 which is comparative to the results obtained in Ref. 13.In the article yield of acetaldehyde near 0.05 mole g -1 and methane of 0.5 mole g -1 for gC 3 N 4 nanosheets was reached after 5 h.Comparatively to this for the hard-templated samples we obtained 3.5 and 8.0 mole g -1 of acetaldehyde and 0.05 and 0.78 mole g -1 of methane for C 3 N 4 -SBA-15 and C 3 N 4 -MCF respectively.Control experiments demonstrated that under blowing the reactor with inert gas (argon), the absence of the photocatalyst or irradiation organic products within the limits of chromatographic detection are not formed.This gives us the reason to believe that carbon dioxide is the initial source of the carbon during the formation of the final products. Since the mutual correspondence of energy characteristics of components (E e tr E 0 (A/A -) (E e tr E 0 (D/D ), Fig. 8) 39 is the necessary condition of photocatalytic system based on semiconductors functioning, it can be concluded that with increasing of the band gap width of the semiconductor material (the shift of the conduction band to more negative values, and thus the valence zone is in more positive region of electrochemical potential scale), its photoactivity will increase respectively. Our studies of the activity of carbon nitride samples with different value E g , are in full agreement with the above.Attention is called to the increased rate of CH 4 formation under irradiation of C 3 N 4 -SBA-15 (Fig. 7,b) compared with other samples that in our opinion can be connected with the peculiarities of transformation mechanism of intermediate products into methane. Today there is no consensus about the possible stages and directions of the CO 2 photoreduction process.According to the literature, there are two basic ways of the products formation which are: -formation of the final compounds through the reduction of CO 2 to CO and C, followed by protonation of intermediates -reduction of carbon dioxide through a number of organic compounds, according to the scheme In the presented schemes of the mechanism methane is the final product; at the same time they do not explain the formation of compounds with C-C bond, such as acetaldehyde, which is the primary product of CO 2 reduction in our studies.Shkrob et al. based on the EPR-studies of the intermediates during the photoreduction of carbon dioxide in aqueous suspensions of anatase nanoparticles proposed a mechanism involving a number of C 2 compounds in the complex sequence of reactions which includes both the reduction and oxidation stages 40. In our studies, regardless of the carbon nitride structure there was a significant increase in the concentration of acetaldehyde in the reactor in comparison with the amount of generated methane.It can be assumed that the oxidation step of C 3 CO by the holes of the valence band is limiting in photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .Proceeding from the aforesaid, the increased rate of methane accumulation under irradiation of the sample C 3 N 4 -SBA-15 is due to the greater rate of interaction of intermediate (acetaldehyde) with photogenerated holes in the semiconductor. As it turned out, the investigated samples of carbon nitride are semiconductors with a p-type conductivity in accordance with the photoelectrochemical studies results of which are presented in Fig. 9. Photocurrent of cathodic direction is clearly observed on the received chronoamperograms at equilibrium potential in an aqueous solution of background salt.According to 41 this is a characteristic of p-type semiconductors due to the bending of the conduction band and valence band toward lower energies which leads to a set of negative charge at the interface. Since C 3 N 4 -MCF was the most active sample, further investigations were carried out with it.During addition of CO 2 into the system value of cathodic current density compared to this under deaeration with argon decreases (Fig. 10a), probably due to the acceptance of conduction band electrons by carbon dioxide. It is worth noting that the reduction of the value J can also be caused by the decrease in pH (from 7 to 3.8) of the medium by passing carbon dioxide through it.This contributes to the additional protonation of an aqueous electrolyte solution and thus increasing the number of acceptors of photoelectrons followed by liberation of molecular hydrogen.In order to prove the influence of activation of CO 2 with carbon nitride on the value of photocurrent density, the additional studies using an aprotic solvent N,N dimethylformamide were conducted.Results of these studies are shown on Fig. 10b.Chronoamperograms obtained under blowdown with an inert gas and carbon dioxide confirm the possibility of CO 2 molecules interaction with photogenerated electrons of the conduction band in C 3 N 4 which leads to a decrease in the values of cathodic photocurrent."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "In order to prove the influence of activation of CO 2 with carbon nitride on the value of photocurrent density, the additional studies using an aprotic solvent N,N dimethylformamide were conducted.", "context": "According to CHN-analysis the synthesized samples are characterized by nitrogen content approximately 60, which is close to the amount of nitrogen in the stoichiometric C 3 N 4 (61).The mass ratio C/N is 0.643 that is equal to the value in calculated from the formula C 3 N 4 .CHN-analysis also indicates the presence of residual hydrogen (1.44 wt.) in obtained carbon nitride.According to Zhao Y. et al. 33 hydrogen atoms bind to the edges of the graphene-like C N sheet in the form of C NH 2 and 2C NH bonds.Such hydrogen terminated C N sheet is energetically more stable, and thus exhibits high thermal stability compared with system without hydrogen. Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of obtained carbon nitride samples.There is a single main peak at 2 27.7 (Fig. 1a), which is the interlayer stacking peak.The peak position corresponds to an interlayer distance of d 0.32 nm similar to the (002) plane of the graphite (turbostratic) like carbon nitrides.X-ray diffraction peaks of C 3 N 4 -MCF and C 3 N 4 -SBA-15 are some weaker than those of C 3 N 4 -bulk indicating the lower crystallinity of carbon nitride obtained via matrix synthesis. According to the XRD data in a small angle region (Fig. 1b) obtained samples have slightly ordered mesostructure, which is possibly stipulated by the formation of the framework from relatively large particles.Besides, C 3 N 4 -MCF is more ordered than C 3 N 4 -SBA-15 (it is almost disordered) which can be caused by higher spatial accessibility of mesoporous cellular foam structure IR-spectra of carbon nitrides obtained via bulk and matrix method are shown on Fig. 2. The absorption band at 810 cm -1 can be attributed to the breathing mode of CN heterocycles of triazine units.The peak at 888 cm -1 and broad bands in the range of 3000-3600 cm -1 are due to deformation and stretching modes of N H vibration, besides it can be stipulated with partial condensation of amino groups 34.Peaks at 1637, 1564, 1408, 1321 and 1250 cm -1 are due to the stretching mode of C N heterocycles 35.Indicated peaks are associated with the skeletal stretching vibrations of the existent aromatic rings.The above main absorption bands are identical for all samples. TG analysis (Fig. 3) of the synthesized samples was conducted to examine whether the templates had been completely removed. According to the data from TG analysis (Fig. 3) the total weight loss for C 3 N 4 -MCF is 100.It testifies that the obtained sample contains only carbon nitride, silica matrix is absent (the same result is for C 3 N 4 -SBA-15 too).The TGA curve of carbon nitride sample shows two sharp mass losses: at 77 C and 605 C. The first mass loss can be attributed to water evaporation.The second step is related to the loss of tri-s-triazine-based units or other advanced condensates 36. Analysis of nitrogen ad(de)sorption isotherms (Fig. 4) shows that the synthesized carbon nitride samples are characterized by relatively high specific surface area (S BET -95 m 2 /g for C 3 N 4 -SBA-15, 70 m 2 /g for C 3 N 4 -MCF, 5 m 2 /g for C 3 N 4 -Bulk), total pore volume (V total -up to 0.3 cm 3 /g for C 3 N 4 -MCF, 0.2 cm 3 /g for C 3 N 4 -SBA-15, 0.02 cm 3 /g for C 3 N 4 -Bulk) and low mesopore size uniformity, which is possible due to the peculiarities of the replication process of porous structure of the initial silica matrices MCF and SBA-15 (there are two and three maximums on their mesopore size distributions respectively, Fig. 4, insert).
