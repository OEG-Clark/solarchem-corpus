The tablet-like and flower-like SnS 2 were prepared simply by a direct hydrothermal method.The precursor of tablet-like sample (referred as T-SnS 2 ) was prepared as follows.First, 2.5 mmol of tin (IV) chloride pentahydrate (SnCl 4 A5H 2 O) were dissolved into 30 mL of solution which consisted of 28.5 mL of deionized water and 1.5 mL of formic acid.Afterward, 6.25 mmol of thioacetamide (CH 3 CSNH 2 ) was added into the above solution to form precursor A. The precursor of the flower-like SnS 2 (referred as F-SnS 2 ) was prepared by the following method.In a typical synthetic process, 2.5 mmol of tin (IV) chloride pentahydrate (SnCl 4 A5H 2 O) were dissolved into 30 mL of solution which consisted of 28.5 mL of absolute ethanol and 1.5 mL of acetic acid.Afterward, 6.25 mmol of thioacetamide (CH 3 CSNH 2 ) was added into the above solution to form precursor B. Then, the solution A and B were exposed to magnetic stirring treatment for 30 min, respectively.Finally, they were transferred to 50 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclaves for the reaction at 180 C for 12 h.The samples were then cooled to room temperature naturally and washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 5 min.The collected products were dried at 80 C for 12 h in a dryer at last. The phase and composition of as-prepared samples were examined by an Rigaku Ultima IV XRD equipped with Cu Ka radiation (k 0.15418 nm) at a scan rate of 10min A1 in the range from 10 to 80.The morphologies of the samples were performed on JSM-7100F field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were performed with a JEOL JEM-2100Plus with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were performed to measure the specific surface area of as-prepared samples by a Quantachrome Autosorb.UV-vis DRS of the samples were recorded with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-1950, Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co.

Electrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation by a standard three electrode system with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode, a platinum wire as counter electrode, and a working electrode.The working electrodes were processed by coating method.Briefly, 10 mg of photocatalyst was suspended in the combination of 5 (w/w) nafion solution and absolute ethanol with volume radio of 0.25 to form a slurry which was then dropped onto a 1.5 cm A 1 c m fluorine-tin oxide (FTO) glass electrode with a sheet resistance of 15 X.Afterwards, the films were dried under ambient conditions.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EIS) were measured at the open circuit potential.The Mott-Schottky measurements were executed at fixed frequencies of 500 and 1000 Hz with 5 mV amplitude.And the flat band potentials (V fb ) were obtained from Mott-Schottky plots.Before and during all measurements, the electrolyte (0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 ) was purged with N 2 .The current-time curve tests were conducted by applying a potential (0.5 V vs. SCE) and extra light source to the working electrode.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the chemical state and surface chemical substance composition of the as-prepared samples and the results are shown in Fig. 2. Except for the peaks of C and oxygen adsorbed from the air, there are only the peaks of Sn and S without any other peak observed (Fig. 2a).From Fig. 2b, The binding energies of Sn 3d 5/2 and Sn 3d 3/2 for T-SnS 2 are about 486.7 and 495.1 eV, respectively, corresponding on the valence state of Sn 4 32.The Sn spectra of Sn 3d 5/2 and Sn3d 3/2 for F-SnS 2 show more than one diffraction peak, and the binding energies of Sn elements in F-SnS 2 is 486.1 eV, 486.7 eV, 494.5 eV, and 495.1 eV.On the basis of the literatures, it is found that the two peaks of 486.7 eV and 495.1 eV correspond to Sn 3d 5/2 and Sn 3d 3/2 orbits of Sn 4 as peaks of 486.1 eV and 494.5 eV match Sn 3d 5/2 and Sn 3d 3/2 orbits of Sn 2 , indicating Sn 4 and Sn 2 ions coexisting in the F-SnS 2 samples 32,33.The existence of Sn 2 may generate defective sites, which facilitates the separation of electron-hole pairs and inhibits their subsequent recombination 34,35.Furthermore, the binding energies of S elements in F-SnS 2 corresponding to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 , is 161.7 and 162.9 eV, which are typical values for a divalent metal sulfide with a doublet separation of around 1.2 eV 27.The observed S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 values of T-SnS 2 are slightly higher as compared with F-SnS 2 , which indicates the surrounding environment of sulfur in T-SnS 2 sample is different from that in F-SnS 2 sample.The results hint that microstructural differences possibly exist in the two samples.The morphologies and microstructures of the as-prepared products were investigated by SEM and TEM.Fig. 3(a,b) shows the typical SEM images of the T-SnS 2 sample which exhibit regular hexagonal tablet-like morphology with smooth surfaces.From TEM image (Fig. 3c) and the inset of Fig. 3(b), it can be seen that the side length of each hexagonal tablet is between 80 nm and 120 nm, and the thickness is about 60 nm, which is less than the photogenerated carriers diffusion length of SnS 2 crystal 22.The lattice spacing is measured to be 0.313 nm which is corresponding to the d spacing of (1 0 0) plane (Fig. 3d).Besides, it is found that the lattice spacing of (1 0 0) plane is slightly enlarged to be 0.315 nm, which can induce microstrain in the lattice.Moreover, an edge dislocation is observed as marked by the red circle in the Fig. 3e.For the F-SnS 2 sample, the SEM images (Fig. 3(f,g)) exhibit flower-like spherical structure with a uniform diameter of 4 lm and each sphere is composed of thin sheet with the thickness of 10 nm, which is more favorable for carrier diffusion to the surface to participate in photocatalytic reaction.It is clearly seen that the thickness of F-SnS 2 sample is far thinner than that of T-SnS 2 , which is a good explanation why the relative intensities of (0 0 1) facet of F-SnS 2 is much weaker than that of T-SnS 2 in the XRD patterns 31,36,37.Additionally, the thick of sheets is less than diffusion mean-free path of carriers, which will shorten the diffusion time so that carriers can get to the surface reaction sites from the interior of SnS 2 before losing their energy.The HRTEM images reveal that interplanar spacings of F-SnS 2 are 0.278 nm and 0.330 nm, which is corresponding to (1 0 1) and (1 0 0) facets, respectively.Different morphology hints that T-SnS 2 and F-SnS 2 samples possibly show varied performance on photocatalytic reduction reaction of CO 2 .Moreover, in order to research the meaning of adding different solvent and acid in the precursor solution, comparative SEM images have been given in Fig. S1.It can be concluded that solvents play a major role in morphology control of the samples, and the size of materials becomes larger with adding acid.The possible reason is that the tin ions will bind to acid radical when acid is added into the precursor solution, which can inhibit the nucleation process and facilitate ostawald ripening process leading to larger size. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements were carried out to determine the surface area of the as-prepared SnS 2 samples and the curves of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm have been shown in Fig. S2.The isotherms of T-SnS 2 and F-SnS 2 are both characteristic of a type IV, indicating the presence of a macroporous structure.In addition, the hysteresis loops of type H3 are observed, suggesting that these structures have slitlike pores formed by stacking of nanosheets.T-SnS 2 shows small hysteresis loops and the specific surface area was measured as about 11 m 2 /g, while F-SnS 2 has a distinct large hysteresis loop and the specific surface area was measured as about 25 m 2 /g, which is much larger than that of T-SnS 2 sample.Thus, the F-SnS 2 product should have more active sites under the same conditions, which is very conducive to the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . As well-known, the optical absorption property which is related to the electronic structure feature plays a significant role in photocatalytic performance.The optical absorption properties of T-SnS 2 and F-SnS 2 powders were examined by UV-vis DRS and shown in Fig. 4a.It could be observed that T-SnS 2 and F-SnS 2 all exhibit broad response spectrum in the visible light region, which implies the possibility of reduction of CO 2 under visible-light irradiation.The band gap energy (E g ) of T-SnS 2 and F-SnS 2 are plotted in Fig. 4b and calculated to be 1.98 eV and 2.03 eV respectively, which is smaller than that of previous reports 383940, and beneficial to produce more photogenerated carriers. The potential of photogenerated carriers on the surface of the catalyst determines the redox reaction ability.In order to calculate the potential of the photogenerated electrons of the samples, the impedance spectrums of T-SnS 2 and F-SnS 2 were measured and plotted based on Mott-Schottky principle as shown in Fig. 5.The results show that the T-SnS 2 and F-SnS 2 are both n-type semiconductors and the flat-band potentials of T-SnS 2 and F-SnS 2 are A0.78V (-0.54 V vs NHE) (Fig. 5a) and A0.75 V (-0.51 V vs NHE) (Fig. 5b), respectively.Assuming that the position of the bottom of the conduction band is 0.1 V lower than flat band potential 41, the conduction band potential of the T-SnS 2 and the F-SnS 2 is about A0.64 V. (vs NHE) and A0.61 V (vs NHE), respectively.It is generally believed that the potential of the photogenerated carrier is approximately equal to the potential of its energy level 42, so the potentials of the photogenerated electrons of the T-SnS When the lamp was turned on, the current densities of T-SnS 2 and F-SnS 2 were enlarged to a maximum point which is much higher than the current density at the situation that the lamp was turned off.This hints their excellent ability of responding to visible-light and transferring the photo-induced electrons.And it is observed that the photocurrent density of F-SnS 2 is far stronger than that of T-SnS 2 , which implies that F-SnS 2 possesses higher separation efficiency of photo-induced carriers resulting from shorter carriers diffusion distance in the direction of 0 0 1 and probably owns better photocatalytic efficiency than T-SnS 2 .In addition, it should be noted that the photo current density keeps constant as before after 10 cycles, which demonstrates the commendable photostability of the as-prepared samples. In order to prove the above reasoning, the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 experiments were carried out for 24 h under simulated visible light (420 nm) conditions.For the T-SnS 2 and F-SnS 2 samples as shown in Fig. 8, the photocatalytic products are mainly CO and CH 4 .The output of CO and CH 4 produced by the T-SnS 2 sample is 61.6 and 17.2 mmol g A1 respectively, indicating the high selectivity (79) for CO production.The yield of CO and CH 4 produced by the F-SnS 2 sample is 75.1 and 97.5 mmol g A1 respectively, which is higher than that on T-SnS 2 , probably benefitting from its shorter diffusion distance in 0 0 1 direction, the larger specific surface area and defective sites as generated by the existence of Sn 2 atom.In addition, whether for T-SnS 2 or F-SnS 2 , it is discovered that the yield of CO is significantly higher than that of CH 4 at the initial stage of the reaction which is likely up to the amount of electrons participating in the reaction.The generation of CH 4 involved eight electron aggregations is more difficult than CO production requiring two electrons participated.Interestingly, the CH 4 yield on the F-SnS 2 sample increases sharply after 12 h, probably because some reaction products begin to be converted to CH 4 as the reaction proceeds.Notably, a series of control experiments in N 2 or in dark or without photocatalysts were conducted.As seen in Fig. 9, there were no detectable CO or CH 4 , affirming that the CO and CH 4 was indeed derived from the reaction between H 2 O and CO 2 under visible-light irradiation using the as-obtained samples as photocatalysts. To check the photostability, XRD patterns of the samples before and after the photocatalytic reduction CO 2 reaction have been shown in Fig. 10.The XRD patterns of F-SnS 2 (Fig. 10a) and T-SnS 2 (Fig. 10b) photocatalyst after the photocatalytic experiment are consistent with the one as prepared, which further indicates the photostability of T-SnS 2 and F-SnS 2 photocatalyst."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The light source for the photocatalysis was a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd) with a 420 nm cut-off filter.", "context": "All reagents used in the experiments were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification.
