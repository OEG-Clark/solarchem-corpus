Figure 4 shows the TEM images of Ca 1.50 -Ti 0.75 , Ca 1.28 -Ti 0.85 , Ca 1.00 -Ti 1.00 , and Ca 0.75 -Ti 1.12 .It is seen that the prepared particles are orthorhombic in shape.CaCO 3 is observed on the edge of the CaTiO 3 in Fig. 4a.In the case of Ca 1.00 -Ti 1.00 (Fig. 4c) and Ca 0.75 -Ti 1.12 (Fig. 4d), TiO 2 particles are doped in CaTiO 3 .There are no particles of CaCO 3 or TiO 2 on Ca 1.28 -0.85 (Fig. 4b).The TEM results are agreed well with XRD data.The atomic percentage of elements present in the catalyst was verified by EDS.Table 1 shows the atomic percentage of Ca, Ti, C, and O. UV-visible absorbance spectra and Tauc plots of Ca x Ti y O 3 are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, respectively.The absorption maximum of catalysts appears at 350 nm, which is redshifted with increasing of titanium component from 0.75 to 1.However, the absorption intensity at 320 nm decreases with increasing titanium component.The band gap was calculated using Tauc equation 31.A plot of ( h ) 1/2 versus photon energy (h ) and the intercept of tangent to the X-axis gives the band gap.The band gap of Ca 1.50 -Ti 0.75 , Ca 1.28 -Ti 0.85 , Ca 1.00 -Ti 1.00 , and Ca 0.75 -Ti 1.12 were found to be 3.51, 3.53, 3.44, and 3.45 eV, respectively (Table 2).The band gap of catalysts decreases when the titanium component increases. The PL spectral measurements (Fig. 7) are used to understand the electron-hole recombination process.The PL spectra of catalysts exhibit a strong signal at 468 nm.The PL intensity of catalysts decreases when titanium component increases.It is attributed to the transition of trapped electron to Ti ions.Generally, new oxygen vacancies are created by metal-doping, the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band initially reached the vacant space and then recombined with the photogenerated holes in the valance band to produce fluorescence emission 32.The smallest PL intensity is observed for C 1.00 -Ti 1.00 .It means that the electron-hole recombination rate is minimized when the calcium and titanium content are C 1.00 -Ti 1.00 .The decrease of PL intensity is attributed to the defects (regardless of the chemical stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric) generated in the structure.N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and BET surface area of Ca x Ti y O 3 are shown in Fig. 8 and Table 2, respectively.The isotherms are similar to type III curves, and hence, the prepared catalysts are nonporous materials 33.The BET surface area of catalysts increases as titanium content increases except for Ca 1.28 -Ti 0.85 .It indicates the formation of TiO 2 or C 6 H 15 O 3 Ti as shown in Fig. 3.The perovskite structure is perfectly formed in Ca 1.28 -Ti 0.85 and it exists in a higher density state than other catalysts.Adsorption isotherms and the amount of CO 2 adsorbed on Ca x Ti y O 3 at 374 K are displayed in Fig. 9 and Table 2, respectively.The steepness of the slop in the low-pressure region of CO 2 adsorption isotherm indicates the strong adsorption between CO 2 and monolayer of catalysts 34.The trend of CO 2 adsorption is similar with the BET surface area of catalysts.It confirms that surface area is significantly important in CO 2 adsorption.Up to 2.1834 and 1.2943 cm 3 g -1 of CO 2 uptake was obtained on Ca 0.75 -Ti 1.12 and C 1.00 -Ti 1.00 , respectively.As a result, it is clear that the addition of titanium increases the interaction between CO 2 and catalyst surface. Methane and oxygen yield were used to evaluate the performance of catalysts.Figure 10a summarizes the methane yield over Ca x Ti y O 3 photocatalysts.The methane is just produced after light on 1 or 2 h.After 7 h, the methane yields of catalysts are in the order of Ca 1.00 -Ti 1.00 Ca 0.75 -Ti 1.12 Ca 1.28 -Ti 0.85 Ca 1.50 -Ti 0.75 .Figure 10b shows the oxygen yield over the photocatalysts.The production of oxygen is increased rapidly after 5 h.The yield of oxygen is about twice than that of methane.The best photocatalytic performance (about 17 mol/g catal ) is shown by Ca 1.00 -Ti 1.00 .The mechanism for methane production from CO 2 reduction is as follows 35: (2) 2. CO radical production from CO 2 photocleavage CO e - CO ( 6) 3. Methane production from the photoreaction between CO radical and proton C H e - CH (8) CH 2 H e - CH 3 (10) CH 3 H e - CH 4 (11) 4. The total reaction The reaction mechanism for the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 using Ca 1.00 -Ti 1.00 catalyst was proposed and illustrated in Fig. 11.First, CO 2 could be easily captured by calcium, which is an electron donor.Water (H 2 O) could be decomposed into hydrogen ions (H ) and hydroxyl radical ( OH) by the holes of TiO 2 .H is used for reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .In the case of Ca 1.50 -Ti 0.75 , the formation of CaCO 3 on the catalyst surface interrupts the photoreaction, and hence, the formation of OH and H are decreased.The photoreaction of Ca 1.28 -Ti 0.85 occurs at the edges on the Ti hexagonal structure, and hence, only less surface area could be photoactivated.Ca 0.75 -Ti 1.12 contains more TiO 2 , and therefore, the availability of calcium ions for CO 2 adsorption is less.These are the reasons for the highest yield of CH 4 production using Ca 1.00 -Ti 1.00 ."}, {"llm generation": "CaxTiyO3 (x 1.50, 1.28, 1.00, and 0.75; y 0.75, 0.85, 1.00, and 1.12)", "source": "Fig. 1.The schematic diagram of CaxTiyO3 (x 1.50, 1.28, 1.00, and 0.75; y 0.75, 0.85, 1.00, and 1.12) catalyst synthesis.", "context": "In this study, Ca x Ti y O 3 nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized using a hydrothermal method.Ca x Ti y O 3 catalysts are composed of CaTiO 3 , TiO 2 , CaCO 3 , and C 6 H 15 O 3 Ti.The photocatalytic activity of Ca x Ti y O 3 depends on amount of titanium content.However, excess of titanium prevents synergistic effect between calcium and titanium.C 1.00 -Ti 1.00 showed the best photocatalytic activity with a methane yield about 17 mol/g catal .The photoreduction is one of the fairest ways to convert CO 2 into useful compounds.However, further research needs to improve methane yield.

The structure and crystallinity were determined using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, model MPD from PANalytical) with nickel-filtered CuK radiation (40.0 kV, 30.0 mA).The morphology was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, H-7600, Hitach, Japan) operated at 100 kV.The existence of elements in the sample were analyzed with the help of an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS-250, Horiba) attached to the SEM.The BET surface area was measured using a Belsorp II mini (BEL, Japan Inc.).The UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained using a SCINCO Neosys-2000 spectrometer with a reflectance sphere.Photoluminescence (PL) profiles were obtained using a SCINCO FluoroMate FS-2 (room temperature using a He-Cd laser source at a wavelength of 325 nm).CO 2 absorption isotherms under static conditions were obtained by a Belsorp II mini (BEL, Japan Inc.) at 343 K. The photocatalytic tests for reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O were carried out in a closed quartz vessel (length of 7.50 cm, width of 1.04 cm, and total volume of 7.00 cm 3 ).The schematic diagram of the photo reactor is shown in Fig. 2. A total of 0.2 g of catalyst and 11.30 mg of distilled water were taken in the photoreactor.Supercritical fluid-grade CO 2 with a certified hydrocarbon (less than 1 ppm) was used as reactant.Before irradiation, CO 2 gas was initially introduced into the reactor chamber.Then, the reactor was closed and the lamp was switched on.One UV-lamp (6 W cm -2 , 20 cm length 2.0 diameter, Shinan, Korea) emitting light at 365 nm was used as the irradiation source.The reaction temperature and pressure were maintained at 303 K and 1 atm, respectively.The gas products were analyzed using a gas chromatography (iGC7200, DS Science, Republic of Korea) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionized detector (FID)."}]}}
