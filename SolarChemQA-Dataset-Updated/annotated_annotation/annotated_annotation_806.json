As shown in Fig. 1d, the AFM image and corresponding height prole reveal a few-layered nanosheet morphology with a uniform thickness of about 3.0 nm, which is structurally analogous to graphene.The 1D OCN was then obtained by hydrothermal treatment of the PCN nanosheets with H 2 O 2 at 180 C for 24 h.The morphology of the OCN was investigated by FESEM and TEM.It can be clearly seen in Fig. 1e and f that the OCN exhibited a rod-like shape with a diameter of 200-500 nm and length of several tens of micrometers.XRD pattern of the PCN nanosheets showed two distinct diffraction peaks at 27.5 and 13.0 (Fig. 1g), which can be indexed as ( 002) and (100) characteristic peaks of graphitic materials, respectively.The former is derived from the stacking of the conjugated aromatic system, and the latter can be attributed to the in-plane ordering of tri-s-triazine units.As for the OCN, both the (002) and (100) peaks became more pronounced and sharper compared to the PCN.Moreover, the (002) and (100) peaks shied to larger angle (27.9 ) and smaller angle (10.8 ), respectively, indicating the reconstruction of the stacking and in-plane ordering of conjugated aromatic units.This phenomenon could be attributed to the hydrolysis/oxidation of the nanosheets and the formation of rod-like structure.It is worth mentioning that the OCN was very sensitive to the electron beam under TEM observation.As shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI, a porous structure can be obtained aer irradiation for a few seconds.Nevertheless, the structural disorder in the OCN might be benecial for the band structure engineering and the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers.Fig. 3 shows the FTIR spectra to conrm the chemical structure of the samples.In the FTIR spectrum of the PCN, the peak at 805 cm A1 can be attributed to the characteristic breathing mode of tri-s-triazine units, and the peaks from 1200 to 1700 cm A1 correspond to the typical stretching vibration modes of CN heterocycles.The broad peaks between 3500 and 3000 cm A1 can be assigned to the stretching modes of uncondensed amino and O-H groups. 28,29Compared to the PCN, new peaks emerge at 1735 and 1780 cm A1 for the OCN, suggesting the formation of carbonyl groups.The peak around 2360 cm A1 may be ascribed to the overtone/combination tone of the stretching mode and bending mode of C-O.The results imply that some triazine rings of the PCN framework are broken and sp 2 C-N bonds are replaced by the C-OH or N-C-O bonds, which coincide well with the XPS analysis. To study the formation mechanism of the OCN, time-dependent FESEM and TEM observations of the hydrothermal process were carried out.Fig. 4 shows typical FESEM and TEM images of the samples obtained at different hydrothermal times.It can be seen in Fig. 4a and f that the product remained the nanosheet morphology aer 3 h of the hydrothermal reaction.Aer continuous hydrothermal reaction for 6 h, the PCN nanosheets were gradually dissolved to form short nanorods (Fig. 4b andg).As the reaction time was prolonged to 9 h, long nanorods of several micrometer in length could be seen in Fig. 4c andh.The nanosheets were largely dissolved when the reaction time was prolonged to 12 h, generating a large amount of nanorods (Fig. 4d andi).It can be clearly seen in Fig. 4e and j that pure rod-like structure could be obtained aer 24 h of the hydrothermal reaction.On the basis of the above observations, we propose a plausible mechanism for the formation of the OCN (Fig. S2,ESI ).The formation of the 1D OCN contains chemical tailoring, self-assembly and re-polymerization of the heptazine units.During the hydrothermal reaction in the H 2 O 2 solution, H 2 O 2 decomposed into oxygen, which induced the hydrolysis/ oxidation of the PCN nanosheets.Part of the bridged tertiary nitrogen could be further cut off and the nanosheets would be tailored into smaller pieces comprising heptazine units with -NH and -OH groups.There might be more hydrogen bonds between N-H and O-H, which was quite important in the selfassembly process.With the increasing time, these smaller pieces could be rearranged and reassembled into nanorods by intermolecular hydrogen bonding and interlayer p-p stacking during recrystallization. UV-vis DRS of the PCN and OCN are shown in Fig. 5a.It can be found that there is an absorption threshold value of 481 nm in the intrinsic absorption of the PCN.The OCN exhibits red shi and an absorption edge at 537 nm, which would be highly benecial for absorbing the visible light in the solar spectrum.Moreover, the samples appear in different colors ranging from yellow to ivory white (inset, Fig. 5a).The color change may be ascribed to the enhanced absorption of visible light.The band gaps of the PCN and OCN are determined by the transformational Tauc plots obtained from the Kubellka-Munk function.As shown in Fig. 5b, the band gaps of the PCN and OCN can be estimated as 2.58 and 2.31 eV, respectively.Fig. 5c shows the Mott-Schottky plots to determine the at-band potentials.It is apparent that both the PCN and OCN show a positive linear slope, indicating n-type conductivity.According to the intersections, the at-band potentials of the PCN and OCN are deduced to be A1.16 and A1.28 eV (vs.Ag/AgCl), respectively.For n-type semiconductors, it has been reported that the conduction band (CB) are normally 0.1 eV more negative than the at-band potential.According to the equation E vs. NHE 14 E vs. Ag/AgCl 0.197, the CB values can be determined to be A1.06 and A1.18 eV (vs.NHE) for the PCN and OCN, respectively.Together with the band gap values from the UV-vis DRS, the band structure diagram can be depicted in Fig. 5d.It can be seen that the CB of the OCN is more negative than that of the PCN, indicating a stronger reduction ability for photogenerated electrons.However, the valence band (VB) of the OCN (1.13 V vs. NHE, pH 6.8) is less positive than that of the PCN (1.52 V vs. NHE, pH 6.8), which was in good agreement with the absorption edge red-shied to longer wavelengths with lower energies from UV-vis DRS.Both the positions of CB and VB for the PCN and OCN straddle the reduction and oxidation potentials of water and can be eligible for the photocatalytic hydrogen or oxygen evolution. In order to understand the origin of the change in electronic and optical properties of the OCN, the band structure and partial density of states (PDOS) for the PCN and OCN were calculated (Fig. 6).It can be clearly seen that the electronic DOS for the PCN exhibit a semiconductor character, where Fermi level is located within the middle of the band gap.In contrast, for the OCN, a narrower band gap can be observed with electron distribution around the Fermi level.The calculated band gap values of the PCN (2.76 eV) and OCN (2.35 eV) are a little larger than experimental ones due to the limitations of DFT calculations.Nevertheless, these results could still reveal that the OCN This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019 possess a relatively narrow band gap, which can improve the electrical conductivity and facilitate the charge transfer. Fig. 7a shows the HER polarization curves of the samples with the 5 mV s A1 of scan rate between A1.0 and 0.2 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode).The polarization curves exhibit increasing current densities with the decrease of cathodic potential, corresponding to the water reduction to evolve hydrogen.It can be seen that the OCN presents a lower onset potential and higher current densities (under the potential beyond A0.6 V vs. RHE) than the PCN.Moreover, based on the polarization curves, Tafel plots can be obtained according to the equation of h 14 a b log j (h, j, and b were the overpotential, current density, and Tafel slope, respectively, and a was the intercept).As shown in Fig. 7b, the Tafel slope values for the PCN and OCN can be calculated to be 333 and 212 mV dec A1 , respectively, suggesting the similar reaction pathways and favorable reaction kinetics and enhanced photocatalytic activity of the OCN.Aerwards, we tested the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity.It should be noted that no hydrogen was detected in the absence of either photocatalyst or visible light irradiation.Fig. 7c shows the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of the PCN and OCN as a function of time under the visible light irradiation (l 400 nm).The hydrogen evolution rate of the PCN under l 400 nm was 10.4 mmol h A1 .Notably, the OCN displays an enhanced hydrogen evolution rate (74.0 mmol h A1 ), which is 7 times higher than that of the PCN.Moreover, the OCN exhibits the hydrogen evolution rates of 32.9 and 4.7 mmol h A1 under visible-light irradiation (l 450 nm and 500 nm), respectively (Fig. 7d).The AQE for the OCN was calculated to be 11.38, 7.85 and 5.84 at l 400 nm, 450 nm and 500 nm, respectively (Fig. 7e), which could approximatively match with the UV-vis DRS of the OCN.We also compared the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the OCN with previously reported CN-based photocatalysts (Table S2, ESI ), indicating that the OCN possesses superior photocatalytic H 2 production activities. 30,31In addition, the photocatalytic stability of the OCN was tested.We repeat the hydrogen evolution experiments 4 times.As shown in Fig. 7f, the hydrogen evolution rate of the OCN is mainly unchanged aer 16 h, with a consistently excellent activity in each cycling test.No obvious structural changes could be detected aer long-term cycles, further implying the superior stability of the OCN (Fig. S3, ESI ).N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were employed to determine the specic surface area using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method (Fig. S4,ESI ).Both the PCN and OCN exhibit a type IV isotherm with a type H1 hysteresis loop.The OCN demonstrates a BET surface area of 3.6 m 2 g A1 and total pore volume of 0.19 cm 3 g A1 , respectively, compared to 72.5 m 2 g A1 and 0.12 cm 3 g A1 for the PCN.In addition, the pore size distribution of the OCN reveals a strong and narrow distribution centered at 3.2 nm, while the PCN exhibits a narrow distribution at 3.7 nm and a wide distribution at 24 nm, respectively.Therefore, the enhanced photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity of the OCN could not be attributed to the surface area. PL analysis was applied to investigate the charge transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes in the PCN and OCN.As shown in Fig. 8a, the main PL emission This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019 peaks centered at 450 nm can be attributed to the band-band PL emission with the energy of light approximately equal to the band gap energy.Compared to the PCN, there is a signicant decrease in the PL emission intensity of the OCN, suggesting that the charge recombination of excited electron-hole pairs might be effectively inhibited by the rod-like structure of the OCN.The improved transfer efficiency of charge carriers was also examined by time-resolved uorescence spectra (Fig. 8b).The emission decay data could be t by a triexponential function, and three radiative lifetime components with different percentages were summarized in the inset.Compared with the PCN, the OCN displayed an obviously prolonged lifetimes, implying an accelerated charge-transfer mechanism.It is known that the weak van der Waals force among PCN layers is unfavorable for the charge transfer between the adjacent layers and also, the intrinsically pconjugated planes lead to inefficient random in-plane charge migration. 30Therefore, the increased lifetimes of charge carriers may be relevant to electron transport improvement in the OCN, which would be benecial for increasing the probability of the photogenerated electrons and holes involving in photocatalytic reaction before recombination.To further evaluate the charge transfer and separation efficiency of the PCN and OCN, EIS and transient photocurrent were carried out (Fig. 8c).The OCN shows a much smaller semicircle in the Nyquist plot, suggesting lower interfacial charge transfer resistance.Under light irradiation, the radius of the semicircle turns smaller in comparison with dark cases.Consistently, the OCN exhibits higher photocurrent density than the PCN (Fig. 8d).These results further conrm efficient separation of electron-hole pairs and charge transfer in the OCN, thus contributing to the enhanced photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity. On the basis of these results, the mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic performance for the OCN is illustrated in Fig. 9. Under visible light irradiation, the OCN will absorb photons and generate electron-hole pairs.The formation of rod-like architecture could reduce the band gap and optimize the electronic structure, which improve the visible light absorption.Meanwhile, the 1D nanostructure would provide high photogenerated electron-hole pairs separation and transfer kinetics.The OCN may exhibit direct transfer of photogenerated electrons along the rod orientation direction for favorable charge separation.The resistance is relative weak and thus little recombination would be achieved, as conrmed by EIS and photocurrent response.The photogenerated electrons can transfer and move toward the surface of Pt cocatalysts and reduce H to H 2 , while the holes on the valence band can be consumed by TEOA.The enhanced photocatalytic H 2 evolution performance of the OCN is believed to benet from the improved visible light activity due to favorable energy gap, enhanced light harvesting, and charge separation and transfer resulting from the 1D nanostructure."}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "A MICROSOLAR300 Xe lamp with an UV-cutoff lter (l 400 nm) was utilized as the visible light source.", "context": "Melamine, thiourea, ammonium chloride, sodium sulfate anhydrous (Na 2 SO 4 ), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 , 30), triethanolamine and ethanol were obtained from Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.Dihydrogen hexachloroplatinate hexahydrate (H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received.Deionized water was obtained from Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and used in all experiments.

Fig. 7a shows the HER polarization curves of the samples with the 5 mV s A1 of scan rate between A1.0 and 0.2 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode).The polarization curves exhibit increasing current densities with the decrease of cathodic potential, corresponding to the water reduction to evolve hydrogen.It can be seen that the OCN presents a lower onset potential and higher current densities (under the potential beyond A0.6 V vs. RHE) than the PCN.Moreover, based on the polarization curves, Tafel plots can be obtained according to the equation of h 14 a b log j (h, j, and b were the overpotential, current density, and Tafel slope, respectively, and a was the intercept).As shown in Fig. 7b, the Tafel slope values for the PCN and OCN can be calculated to be 333 and 212 mV dec A1 , respectively, suggesting the similar reaction pathways and favorable reaction kinetics and enhanced photocatalytic activity of the OCN.Aerwards, we tested the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity.It should be noted that no hydrogen was detected in the absence of either photocatalyst or visible light irradiation.Fig. 7c shows the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of the PCN and OCN as a function of time under the visible light irradiation (l 400 nm).The hydrogen evolution rate of the PCN under l 400 nm was 10.4 mmol h A1 .Notably, the OCN displays an enhanced hydrogen evolution rate (74.0 mmol h A1 ), which is 7 times higher than that of the PCN.Moreover, the OCN exhibits the hydrogen evolution rates of 32.9 and 4.7 mmol h A1 under visible-light irradiation (l 450 nm and 500 nm), respectively (Fig. 7d).The AQE for the OCN was calculated to be 11.38, 7.85 and 5.84 at l 400 nm, 450 nm and 500 nm, respectively (Fig. 7e), which could approximatively match with the UV-vis DRS of the OCN.We also compared the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the OCN with previously reported CN-based photocatalysts (Table S2, ESI ), indicating that the OCN possesses superior photocatalytic H 2 production activities. 30,31In addition, the photocatalytic stability of the OCN was tested.We repeat the hydrogen evolution experiments 4 times.As shown in Fig. 7f, the hydrogen evolution rate of the OCN is mainly unchanged aer 16 h, with a consistently excellent activity in each cycling test.No obvious structural changes could be detected aer long-term cycles, further implying the superior stability of the OCN (Fig. S3, ESI ).N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were employed to determine the specic surface area using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method (Fig. S4,ESI ).Both the PCN and OCN exhibit a type IV isotherm with a type H1 hysteresis loop.The OCN demonstrates a BET surface area of 3.6 m 2 g A1 and total pore volume of 0.19 cm 3 g A1 , respectively, compared to 72.5 m 2 g A1 and 0.12 cm 3 g A1 for the PCN.In addition, the pore size distribution of the OCN reveals a strong and narrow distribution centered at 3.2 nm, while the PCN exhibits a narrow distribution at 3.7 nm and a wide distribution at 24 nm, respectively.Therefore, the enhanced photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity of the OCN could not be attributed to the surface area. PL analysis was applied to investigate the charge transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes in the PCN and OCN.As shown in Fig. 8a, the main PL emission This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019 peaks centered at 450 nm can be attributed to the band-band PL emission with the energy of light approximately equal to the band gap energy.Compared to the PCN, there is a signicant decrease in the PL emission intensity of the OCN, suggesting that the charge recombination of excited electron-hole pairs might be effectively inhibited by the rod-like structure of the OCN.The improved transfer efficiency of charge carriers was also examined by time-resolved uorescence spectra (Fig. 8b).The emission decay data could be t by a triexponential function, and three radiative lifetime components with different percentages were summarized in the inset.Compared with the PCN, the OCN displayed an obviously prolonged lifetimes, implying an accelerated charge-transfer mechanism.It is known that the weak van der Waals force among PCN layers is unfavorable for the charge transfer between the adjacent layers and also, the intrinsically pconjugated planes lead to inefficient random in-plane charge migration. 30Therefore, the increased lifetimes of charge carriers may be relevant to electron transport improvement in the OCN, which would be benecial for increasing the probability of the photogenerated electrons and holes involving in photocatalytic reaction before recombination.To further evaluate the charge transfer and separation efficiency of the PCN and OCN, EIS and transient photocurrent were carried out (Fig. 8c).The OCN shows a much smaller semicircle in the Nyquist plot, suggesting lower interfacial charge transfer resistance.Under light irradiation, the radius of the semicircle turns smaller in comparison with dark cases.Consistently, the OCN exhibits higher photocurrent density than the PCN (Fig. 8d).These results further conrm efficient separation of electron-hole pairs and charge transfer in the OCN, thus contributing to the enhanced photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity. On the basis of these results, the mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic performance for the OCN is illustrated in Fig. 9. Under visible light irradiation, the OCN will absorb photons and generate electron-hole pairs.The formation of rod-like architecture could reduce the band gap and optimize the electronic structure, which improve the visible light absorption.Meanwhile, the 1D nanostructure would provide high photogenerated electron-hole pairs separation and transfer kinetics.The OCN may exhibit direct transfer of photogenerated electrons along the rod orientation direction for favorable charge separation.The resistance is relative weak and thus little recombination would be achieved, as conrmed by EIS and photocurrent response.The photogenerated electrons can transfer and move toward the surface of Pt cocatalysts and reduce H to H 2 , while the holes on the valence band can be consumed by TEOA.The enhanced photocatalytic H 2 evolution performance of the OCN is believed to benet from the improved visible light activity due to favorable energy gap, enhanced light harvesting, and charge separation and transfer resulting from the 1D nanostructure."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic", "source": "Fig. 7c shows the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of the PCN and OCN as a function of time under the visible light irradiation (l 400 nm).", "context": "Typical FESEM and TEM images of the PCN clearly demonstrate a well-dened sheet-like structure with wrinkles (Fig. 1b andc). As shown in Fig. 1d, the AFM image and corresponding height prole reveal a few-layered nanosheet morphology with a uniform thickness of about 3.0 nm, which is structurally analogous to graphene.The 1D OCN was then obtained by hydrothermal treatment of the PCN nanosheets with H 2 O 2 at 180 C for 24 h.The morphology of the OCN was investigated by FESEM and TEM.It can be clearly seen in Fig. 1e and f that the OCN exhibited a rod-like shape with a diameter of 200-500 nm and length of several tens of micrometers.XRD pattern of the PCN nanosheets showed two distinct diffraction peaks at 27.5 and 13.0 (Fig. 1g), which can be indexed as ( 002) and (100) characteristic peaks of graphitic materials, respectively.The former is derived from the stacking of the conjugated aromatic system, and the latter can be attributed to the in-plane ordering of tri-s-triazine units.As for the OCN, both the (002) and (100) peaks became more pronounced and sharper compared to the PCN.Moreover, the (002) and (100) peaks shied to larger angle (27.9 ) and smaller angle (10.8 ), respectively, indicating the reconstruction of the stacking and in-plane ordering of conjugated aromatic units.This phenomenon could be attributed to the hydrolysis/oxidation of the nanosheets and the formation of rod-like structure.It is worth mentioning that the OCN was very sensitive to the electron beam under TEM observation.As shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI, a porous structure can be obtained aer irradiation for a few seconds.Nevertheless, the structural disorder in the OCN might be benecial for the band structure engineering and the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers.Fig. 3 shows the FTIR spectra to conrm the chemical structure of the samples.In the FTIR spectrum of the PCN, the peak at 805 cm A1 can be attributed to the characteristic breathing mode of tri-s-triazine units, and the peaks from 1200 to 1700 cm A1 correspond to the typical stretching vibration modes of CN heterocycles.The broad peaks between 3500 and 3000 cm A1 can be assigned to the stretching modes of uncondensed amino and O-H groups. 28,29Compared to the PCN, new peaks emerge at 1735 and 1780 cm A1 for the OCN, suggesting the formation of carbonyl groups.The peak around 2360 cm A1 may be ascribed to the overtone/combination tone of the stretching mode and bending mode of C-O.The results imply that some triazine rings of the PCN framework are broken and sp 2 C-N bonds are replaced by the C-OH or N-C-O bonds, which coincide well with the XPS analysis. To study the formation mechanism of the OCN, time-dependent FESEM and TEM observations of the hydrothermal process were carried out.Fig. 4 shows typical FESEM and TEM images of the samples obtained at different hydrothermal times.It can be seen in Fig. 4a and f that the product remained the nanosheet morphology aer 3 h of the hydrothermal reaction.Aer continuous hydrothermal reaction for 6 h, the PCN nanosheets were gradually dissolved to form short nanorods (Fig. 4b andg).As the reaction time was prolonged to 9 h, long nanorods of several micrometer in length could be seen in Fig. 4c andh.The nanosheets were largely dissolved when the reaction time was prolonged to 12 h, generating a large amount of nanorods (Fig. 4d andi).It can be clearly seen in Fig. 4e and j that pure rod-like structure could be obtained aer 24 h of the hydrothermal reaction.On the basis of the above observations, we propose a plausible mechanism for the formation of the OCN (Fig. S2,ESI ).The formation of the 1D OCN contains chemical tailoring, self-assembly and re-polymerization of the heptazine units.During the hydrothermal reaction in the H 2 O 2 solution, H 2 O 2 decomposed into oxygen, which induced the hydrolysis/ oxidation of the PCN nanosheets.Part of the bridged tertiary nitrogen could be further cut off and the nanosheets would be tailored into smaller pieces comprising heptazine units with -NH and -OH groups.There might be more hydrogen bonds between N-H and O-H, which was quite important in the selfassembly process.With the increasing time, these smaller pieces could be rearranged and reassembled into nanorods by intermolecular hydrogen bonding and interlayer p-p stacking during recrystallization.
