Obviously, the obtained products are square-like nanosheets with good dispersion and with a size ranging from 70 to 100 nm.The HRTEM image exhibits good crystalline and clear lattice fringes with an interplanar lattice spacing of 0.27 nm and an angle of 90 (Fig. 2b), which matches well with the (110) plane of the tetragonal BiOCl crystal.As depicted in the inset of Fig. 2b, the corresponding FFT pattern displays a spot pattern, implying the singlecrystalline characteristic of the obtained nanosheets.The angle of spots labelled in the FFT pattern is 45 , which is identical to the theoretical value of the angle between the (110) and ( 200) planes of tetragonal BiOCl.Based on the above results and the symmetry of tetragonal BiOCl, the bottom and top surfaces of the BiOCl samples are identied as 001 facets. Moreover, the thickness of obtained BiOCl nanomaterials can be tailored by adjusting the reaction time.The BiOCl-UTNS can be obtained when a shorter reaction time was used, while the BiOCl-NP is obtained with a longer reaction time.Similar to the BiOCl-NS, it is noted that both BiOCl-UTNS and BiOCl-NP are comprised of sheet-like, high quantity nanostructures (Fig. 3).The respective thickness of obtained BiOCl-UTNS, BiOCl-NS and BiOCl-NP is about 25, 40 and 95 nm, determined from the TEM images (Fig. 4).On the basis of the above structural information, the percentage of highly reactive (001) facets is estimated to be 70, 49 and 25 for BiOCl-UTNS, BiOCl-NS and BiOCl-NP, respectively. 38As a matter of fact, the thickness of the obtained BiOCl reects the periodic structure of the BiOCl crystal along the c axis.A thicker BiOCl nanosheet corresponds to a larger size of the BiOCl nanocrystal along the c axis.The variation of the thickness of the as-synthesized BiOCl is consistent with the above FWHM variation of the (001) peak in the XRD patterns. A possible growth mechanism of the BiOCl nanosheets is briey discussed here.Normally, the formation of nanocrystals can be divided into nucleation and following crystal growth from the nuclei.The solution with transparent color is obtained at low temperature before the injection of OAm, which can be attributed to the formation of the complexes between Bi 3 and OA and/or TOPO.Once the OAm are injected into the system, the mixed solution turns into white color, implying the formation of BiOCl crystal seeds due to the opposite electric polarity of amine group to the carboxylic and phosphine oxide group, followed by the formation of BiOCl-UTNS.Here the presence of trace amount of water in the reaction system gives rise to mild hydrolysis of Bi 3 , resulting in the controllable growth.In addition, the OA, OAm and TOPO play an important role in the formation of homogeneous BiOCl nanosheets since they can cat as surfactant during the crystal growth.The thickness of BiOCl increases with increasing reaction time owing to the further growth of crystal, resulting in the formation of BiOCl-NS and, eventually, BiOCl-NP. XPS analysis was used to determine the chemical states and surface composition of the as-synthesized BiOCl nanomaterials.The XPS spectra are corrected by referencing the C 1s peak of 284.60 eV.Here BiOCl-NS is used as the example.The peaks of Bi, O, Cl, and C elements can be well identied in the survey spectrum, as shown in Fig. 5a.Two peaks with binding energy of 157.6 and 164.9 eV appear in the Bi 4f XPS spectrum (Fig. 5b), corresponding respectively to the Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 of Bi 3 .The peaks at 196.5 eV and 197.6 eV can be assigned to Cl 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 (Fig. 5b), respectively.The atomic ratio of Bi/O/Cl is determined to be approximately 1 : 1 : 1 according to quantication of the peak area of Bi 4f, O 1s and Cl 2p in the survey spectrum, together with the sensitivity factor of Bi, O and Cl.This agrees well with the stoichiometric ratio of BiOCl.The Bi, O and Cl elements can also be observed in the EDX spectrum (Fig. 5c), which has the same atomic ratio of Bi/O/Cl as the XPS results.The observed Cu and C signals in the EDX arise from the copper grid used for the measurements. The results of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over the BiOCl samples in aqueous solution under UV-light irradiation are shown in Fig. 6a.Different control experiments were carried out, i.e., the BiOCl aqueous suspension under illumination but without CO 2 and BiOCl suspension with CO 2 but without illumination.No photoreduction product like CH 4 can be observed in these control experiments, implying that the light irradiation is critical for the reduction reaction and the CO 2 is indeed the carbon source.Moreover, the BiOCl nanocatalysts exhibit high selectivity to the formation of CH 4 , as no other products can be observed.The CH 4 yield increases with irradiation time, which reaches 41.48, 27.36 and 16.64 mmol g A1 aer 8 h for BiOCl-UTNS, BiOCl-NS and BiOCl-NP, respectively.The CH 4 yield for BiOCl-UTNS is about 1.5 times of that for BiOCl-NS and about 2.5 times of that for BiOCl-NP. The stability of the BiOCl sample was tested by repeating the catalytic experiments and XRD measurements (Fig. 6b andc).Here the BiOCl-UTNS is used as the example.No signicant change in the photocatalytic activity and crystalline structure can be observed aer three cycles, though oxygen vacancies can be created aer photocatalysis as discussed later.Thus, the BiOCl-UTNS is quite stable upon photocatalysis. The photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst is closely related to its energy band structure.Fig. 7a shows the UV-vis diffuse reection spectra (DRS) of BiOCl-NS, BiOCl-UTNS and BiOCl-NP.Obviously, the DRS of all the obtained BiOCl presents a similar absorption edge between 370 and 420 nm, indicating that the BiOCl samples mainly absorb UV light.The bandgap of the as-synthesized samples can be calculated by using (ahy) n 14 k(hy A E g ), where a is the absorption coefficient, k is the parameter related to the effective mass associated with the valence and conduction bands, n is 1/2 for an indirect transition, hy is the absorption energy, and E g is the bandgap energy.The extrapolated intercept of curve of (ahy) 1/2 versus hy based on the optical response corresponds to the bandgap value.The bandgap is thus determined to be about 2.7-2.9 eV for the obtained BiOCl nanosheets.In addition, the valence band maximum (VB) of the obtained BiOCl is determined to be about 1.8-1.9eV by XPS valence band spectra (Fig. 7b).Thus, no big difference is observed in the alignment of energy levels among the BiOCl-UTNS, BiOCl-NS and BiOCl-NP.Since the work function of XPS instrument is 4.62 eV, the VB for the obtained BiOCl is calculated to be about 1.9-2.0V (vs.SHE, provided 4.5 eV vs. vacuum level is 0 V vs. SHE). 39The conduction band minimum (CB) is thus calculated to be around A0.9 to A1.1 V for the obtained BiOCl nanosheets, which is much more negative than the redox potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V).So the VB is around 1.7-1.8V (vs.SHE), which is positive enough to oxidize water.Thus, it is possible for the CO 2 to be photoreduced into CH 4 and water to be oxidized by the photogenerated holes. Though the detailed mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction into CH 4 is still unclear, it can be understood briey as given below.The electrons are excited to the CB of BiOCl upon irradiation with light energy higher than its bandgap energy, le the holes behind in the VB.The holes can oxidize H 2 O to form cOH, which subsequently results in the formation of H and O 2 .The CO 2 molecules can be activated on the catalyst surface to form negative cCO 2 A radicals via the reduction of electrons in the CB, 40 which can be converted into cC radicals, and then the cCH, cCH 2 and cCH 3 radicals via a series of reactions. 41Eventually the CH 4 is produced.It is noted the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 may also go through other mechanism, which denitely needs further study.Since no signal from OA, OAm and TOPO can be observed in the FT-IR spectra, they are considered mainly the morphologycontrol agents.Thus the BiOCl reported here exhibits much higher production yield of CH 4 than the literature is ascribed mainly to the single-crystalline characteristics as well as good dispersion of the BiOCl nanomaterials, as shown by the above TEM images. As the thickness of the BiOCl nanosheets decreases, the surface-to-volume ratio and percentage of the surface atoms with dangling bonds increase dramatically.This can provide more active sites, resulting in improved catalytic activity.This is conrmed by the measurements of BET specic surface area with nitrogen adsorption-desorption method.The BET specic surface area is about 36.62,34.45 and 25.13 m 2 g A1 for BiOCl-UTNS, BiOCl-NS and BiOCl-NP, respectively.That is to say, the BiOCl-UTNS has the largest BET specic surface area and thus the highest photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the BiOCl nanosheets with exposed 001 facets exhibit high photoexcitation activity due to cooperative effect between the surface atomic structure and suitable internal electric eld. 42,43According to the calculation results, the unique surface atomic structure of BiOCl facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies under UV light because of the low energy and long length of the Bi-O bond.Indeed, the ESR signal of oxygen vacancy can be observed aer photocatalysis, while no such signal is observed before the photoreduction of CO 2 (Fig. 8).Accordingly, the color of the catalyst suspension turns to dark gray, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8.It is noted that the oxygen vacancies can facilitate the adsorption of CO 2 and induce visible-light absorption. 44,45Moreover, molecular oxygen can be adsorbed onto the oxygen vacancies too in the 001 facets and form an end-on structure with two nearest sublayer of Bi atoms that extract electrons from the redistributed surface charges to generate cO 2 A radicals, which is in favor of suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.The ultrathin BiOCl nanosheets have the highest percentage of exposed 001 facets, which endows it more CO 2 and cO 2 A species available during the photocatalytic reduction and, thereby, the highest photocatalytic activity.Specically, it has been reported that the predominant defect of the active 001 facets is V 000 Bi V O V 000 Bi in the BiOCl ultrathin nanosheets, which can lead to signicantly promoted photocatalytic activity. 14n addition, a thin layer can facilitate the charge transfer, leading to suppression of the recombination of charge carriers.This can be conrmed by the measurements of transient photocurrent response under UV-light illumination with the same wavelength range used in the photocatalytic reactions, which is shown in Fig. 9a.The photocurrent increases sharply once upon the illumination for all of the samples, while it decreases rapidly once the light is switched off.The BiOCl-UTNS sample has the highest photocurrent, followed by BiOCl-NS, while the BiOCl-NP shows the lowest photocurrent.This is consistent with the order of photocatalytic activity.Obviously, a higher photocurrent indicates more efficient suppression of the recombination of charge carriers, i.e., more efficient separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs.This is further conrmed by time-resolved PL spectra (Fig. 9b).All of the samples display exponential decay.The BiOCl-UTNS shows the slowest decay kinetics among all the products, followed by BiOCl-NS, while the BiOCl-NP shows the fastest decay.The decay curves can be tted by using the tri-exponential decay kinetics. 46The results are listed in Table 1.The lifetime can be divided into three different processes, non-radiative process (s 1 ), radiative process (s 2 ), and energy transfer process (s 3 ). 47,48he recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes directly relates with the radiative process.It is found that the BiOCl-UTNS displays the longest lifetime among all the samples for all the three processes, indicating the highest separation efficiency of electrons and holes."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Moreover, plenty of oxygen vacancies can be generated upon UV-light illumination, which can facilitate the adsorption of CO 2 and molecular oxygen, leading to high activity for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .", "context": "In summary, we have developed a facial hot-injection method for the preparation of thickness-tunable BiOCl nanosheets.The obtained BiOCl nanosheets exhibit high photocatalytic activity for the conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 .Moreover, the thinner the nanosheets, the higher the production yield is.This is ascribed to that the obtained BiOCl nanosheets show good dispersion, good single-crystalline characteristics, large surface-to-volume ratio and high percentage of exposed 001 facets.Moreover, plenty of oxygen vacancies can be generated upon UV-light illumination, which can facilitate the adsorption of CO 2 and molecular oxygen, leading to high activity for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .This work not only presents a novel strategy to controllable synthesis of BiOCl nanomaterials, but also provides insight into the correlation between the structure and photocatalytic activity.

The results of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over the BiOCl samples in aqueous solution under UV-light irradiation are shown in Fig. 6a.Different control experiments were carried out, i.e., the BiOCl aqueous suspension under illumination but without CO 2 and BiOCl suspension with CO 2 but without illumination.No photoreduction product like CH 4 can be observed in these control experiments, implying that the light irradiation is critical for the reduction reaction and the CO 2 is indeed the carbon source.Moreover, the BiOCl nanocatalysts exhibit high selectivity to the formation of CH 4 , as no other products can be observed.The CH 4 yield increases with irradiation time, which reaches 41.48, 27.36 and 16.64 mmol g A1 aer 8 h for BiOCl-UTNS, BiOCl-NS and BiOCl-NP, respectively.The CH 4 yield for BiOCl-UTNS is about 1.5 times of that for BiOCl-NS and about 2.5 times of that for BiOCl-NP. The stability of the BiOCl sample was tested by repeating the catalytic experiments and XRD measurements (Fig. 6b andc).Here the BiOCl-UTNS is used as the example.No signicant change in the photocatalytic activity and crystalline structure can be observed aer three cycles, though oxygen vacancies can be created aer photocatalysis as discussed later.Thus, the BiOCl-UTNS is quite stable upon photocatalysis. The photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst is closely related to its energy band structure.Fig. 7a shows the UV-vis diffuse reection spectra (DRS) of BiOCl-NS, BiOCl-UTNS and BiOCl-NP.Obviously, the DRS of all the obtained BiOCl presents a similar absorption edge between 370 and 420 nm, indicating that the BiOCl samples mainly absorb UV light.The bandgap of the as-synthesized samples can be calculated by using (ahy) n 14 k(hy A E g ), where a is the absorption coefficient, k is the parameter related to the effective mass associated with the valence and conduction bands, n is 1/2 for an indirect transition, hy is the absorption energy, and E g is the bandgap energy.The extrapolated intercept of curve of (ahy) 1/2 versus hy based on the optical response corresponds to the bandgap value.The bandgap is thus determined to be about 2.7-2.9 eV for the obtained BiOCl nanosheets.In addition, the valence band maximum (VB) of the obtained BiOCl is determined to be about 1.8-1.9eV by XPS valence band spectra (Fig. 7b).Thus, no big difference is observed in the alignment of energy levels among the BiOCl-UTNS, BiOCl-NS and BiOCl-NP.Since the work function of XPS instrument is 4.62 eV, the VB for the obtained BiOCl is calculated to be about 1.9-2.0V (vs.SHE, provided 4.5 eV vs. vacuum level is 0 V vs. SHE). 39The conduction band minimum (CB) is thus calculated to be around A0.9 to A1.1 V for the obtained BiOCl nanosheets, which is much more negative than the redox potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V).So the VB is around 1.7-1.8V (vs.SHE), which is positive enough to oxidize water.Thus, it is possible for the CO 2 to be photoreduced into CH 4 and water to be oxidized by the photogenerated holes. Though the detailed mechanism of CO 2 photoreduction into CH 4 is still unclear, it can be understood briey as given below.The electrons are excited to the CB of BiOCl upon irradiation with light energy higher than its bandgap energy, le the holes behind in the VB.The holes can oxidize H 2 O to form cOH, which subsequently results in the formation of H and O 2 .The CO 2 molecules can be activated on the catalyst surface to form negative cCO 2 A radicals via the reduction of electrons in the CB, 40 which can be converted into cC radicals, and then the cCH, cCH 2 and cCH 3 radicals via a series of reactions. 41Eventually the CH 4 is produced.It is noted the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 may also go through other mechanism, which denitely needs further study.Since no signal from OA, OAm and TOPO can be observed in the FT-IR spectra, they are considered mainly the morphologycontrol agents.Thus the BiOCl reported here exhibits much higher production yield of CH 4 than the literature is ascribed mainly to the single-crystalline characteristics as well as good dispersion of the BiOCl nanomaterials, as shown by the above TEM images. As the thickness of the BiOCl nanosheets decreases, the surface-to-volume ratio and percentage of the surface atoms with dangling bonds increase dramatically.This can provide more active sites, resulting in improved catalytic activity.This is conrmed by the measurements of BET specic surface area with nitrogen adsorption-desorption method.The BET specic surface area is about 36.62,34.45 and 25.13 m 2 g A1 for BiOCl-UTNS, BiOCl-NS and BiOCl-NP, respectively.That is to say, the BiOCl-UTNS has the largest BET specic surface area and thus the highest photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the BiOCl nanosheets with exposed 001 facets exhibit high photoexcitation activity due to cooperative effect between the surface atomic structure and suitable internal electric eld. 42,43According to the calculation results, the unique surface atomic structure of BiOCl facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies under UV light because of the low energy and long length of the Bi-O bond.Indeed, the ESR signal of oxygen vacancy can be observed aer photocatalysis, while no such signal is observed before the photoreduction of CO 2 (Fig. 8).Accordingly, the color of the catalyst suspension turns to dark gray, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8.It is noted that the oxygen vacancies can facilitate the adsorption of CO 2 and induce visible-light absorption. 44,45Moreover, molecular oxygen can be adsorbed onto the oxygen vacancies too in the 001 facets and form an end-on structure with two nearest sublayer of Bi atoms that extract electrons from the redistributed surface charges to generate cO 2 A radicals, which is in favor of suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.The ultrathin BiOCl nanosheets have the highest percentage of exposed 001 facets, which endows it more CO 2 and cO 2 A species available during the photocatalytic reduction and, thereby, the highest photocatalytic activity.Specically, it has been reported that the predominant defect of the active 001 facets is V 000 Bi V O V 000 Bi in the BiOCl ultrathin nanosheets, which can lead to signicantly promoted photocatalytic activity. 14n addition, a thin layer can facilitate the charge transfer, leading to suppression of the recombination of charge carriers.This can be conrmed by the measurements of transient photocurrent response under UV-light illumination with the same wavelength range used in the photocatalytic reactions, which is shown in Fig. 9a.The photocurrent increases sharply once upon the illumination for all of the samples, while it decreases rapidly once the light is switched off.The BiOCl-UTNS sample has the highest photocurrent, followed by BiOCl-NS, while the BiOCl-NP shows the lowest photocurrent.This is consistent with the order of photocatalytic activity.Obviously, a higher photocurrent indicates more efficient suppression of the recombination of charge carriers, i.e., more efficient separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs.This is further conrmed by time-resolved PL spectra (Fig. 9b).All of the samples display exponential decay.The BiOCl-UTNS shows the slowest decay kinetics among all the products, followed by BiOCl-NS, while the BiOCl-NP shows the fastest decay.The decay curves can be tted by using the tri-exponential decay kinetics. 46The results are listed in Table 1.The lifetime can be divided into three different processes, non-radiative process (s 1 ), radiative process (s 2 ), and energy transfer process (s 3 ). 47,48he recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes directly relates with the radiative process.It is found that the BiOCl-UTNS displays the longest lifetime among all the samples for all the three processes, indicating the highest separation efficiency of electrons and holes."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Fig.8ESR spectra of BiOCl-UTNS before and after photoreduction of CO 2 .Inset is the corresponding optical image of the suspension.", "context": "In summary, we have developed a facial hot-injection method for the preparation of thickness-tunable BiOCl nanosheets.The obtained BiOCl nanosheets exhibit high photocatalytic activity for the conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 .Moreover, the thinner the nanosheets, the higher the production yield is.This is ascribed to that the obtained BiOCl nanosheets show good dispersion, good single-crystalline characteristics, large surface-to-volume ratio and high percentage of exposed 001 facets.Moreover, plenty of oxygen vacancies can be generated upon UV-light illumination, which can facilitate the adsorption of CO 2 and molecular oxygen, leading to high activity for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .This work not only presents a novel strategy to controllable synthesis of BiOCl nanomaterials, but also provides insight into the correlation between the structure and photocatalytic activity.
