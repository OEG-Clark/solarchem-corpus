The average crystallite size calculated by XRD using the Scherrer equation from whole pattern tting (LeBail method) suggests a decreasing grain size trend, from 161(3) nm for SSR-KTO, 46(1) nm for Eth-KTO down to 32(1) nm for Hex-KTO (Table S1 ). Fig. 2 shows the scanning and transmission electron micrographs of nano-sized KTaO 3 prepared by different methods.While both SSR-KTO and Eth-KTO show the usual cubic-like morphology of KTaO 3 , whereas Hex-KTO shows peculiar conjoined nanoake-like particles.The average particle size seen by the electron micrographs supports the grain size trend calculated from XRD data, with SSR-KTO having the largest particles (200-500 nm), followed by Eth-KTO (50-100 nm) and then Hex-KTO (15-50 nm).Fig. 3 shows the UV-Vis spectrum of the KTaO 3 samples.The bandgap (E g ) of a semiconductor could be inferred from its UV-Vis spectra using the following equation: 41 (ahn where a is the absorption coefficient, hn is the energy of photon, n represents the index which depends on the electronic transition of the semiconductor (for KTaO 3 n 14 2), 41 and A is a proportionality constant related to the material.The bandgap energy was obtained from the intercept of the tangent line in the plot of (ahn) 2 versus energy, and the value was determined to be 3.5 eV for SSR-KTO and 3.7 eV for Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out over 100 mg of KTaO 3 and 6 ml of water in a borosilicate glass reactor.Note that the borosilicate glass transmittance is only z40 at 280 nm (Fig. S1 ), unlike the quartz reactors used in other studies. 20,24A 300 W Xe lamp was used to illuminate the suspension without any addition of electron donors or electric bias.To eliminate the chance of CO production by photodegradation of organic residues on the sample surface, a twostep pretreatment process was performed, in which the photocatalyst particles were rst calcined at 433 K for more than 1 hour in air.Aer that a 2 hour photo-oxidation process in a sealed environment was carried out immediately before each test to further remove possible contaminants and obtain the baseline of CO 2 reduction in the reaction system.A series of control experiments were also carried out to ensure oxygen and CO were only produced from photocatalytic reactions, including (1) CO 2 -free water-catalyst suspension in argon under illumination, (2) CO 2 -saturated water-catalyst suspension in the dark and (3) CO 2 -saturated water without a photocatalyst under illumination.The measurable CO and oxygen under these situations was negligible.As KTaO 3 is a UV-driven photocatalyst, the system has shown no photoactivity when an LP 420 nm lter was used in the experiment. The gases produced by SSR-KTO in a CO 2 saturated suspension system without any cocatalyst or sacricial reagents are revealed in Fig. 4(a) and (b).In all samples, hydrogen and carbon monoxide are both detected as the major reduction products under Xe lamp irradiation.It should be noted that the working spectrum of the system was limited from 280 to 350 nm due to the transmittance of the borosilicate glass reactor and the KTaO 3 bandgap absorption (Fig. S1 ).Furthermore, unlike many photocatalysts which produce a range of carbohydrates, and bring up the need for post-separation of products, 42 the CO 2 photoreduction selectivity over KTaO 3 is nearly 100 towards CO with trace amounts of CH 4 being detected in the system (less than 2).No other detectable organic products in the gaseous phase were observed by a sensitive FID detector. Fig. 4(c) shows that oxygen is evolved from the suspension system.All these products linearly increase with reaction time, indicating a stable photochemical process.It is noted that the observed evolved oxygen is less than the expected stoichiometric amount (i.e. the ideal unity ratio of the number of consumed photoelectrons to the photoholes), which is mainly ascribed to the strong interaction between O 2 and the photocatalyst surface as reported on several photocatalysts. 43444454647 It is likely that unavoidable leakage during sampling and lower oxygen sensitivity of the TCD detector may underestimate the actual oxygen amount slightly.The contamination of organic compounds may also lead to mismatch between the reduction and oxygen products' yield.To minimise measurement errors due to leaking, N 2 has also been tracked as a reference, which further conrms that O 2 yields from water photooxidation due to the linear increase of the ratio of O 2 to N 2 amount.The twostep pre-treatment was also carried out to remove most of the organic residue from material synthesis. Interestingly, the results strongly indicate that the photocatalytic performance is highly inuenced by the size and morphologies of KTaO 3 (Fig. 4).The SSR-KTO sample, which has the largest particle size, yields an average reaction rate of 68.05 ppm g A1 h A1 hydrogen and 8.88 ppm g A1 h A1 CO, respectively.Solvothermally grown KTaO 3 with notably smaller particle size represents higher photocatalytic activity.Eth-KTO samples yield 627.1 ppm g A1 h A1 of hydrogen and 19.35 ppm g A1 h A1 of CO.In particular, Hex-KTO with nano-ake-like morphology shows 1323 ppm g A1 h A1 of hydrogen and 61.98 ppm g A1 h A1 of CO, an impressive 20 and 7 times higher yield for H 2 and CO compared to the cubic SSR-KTO.Correspondingly, O 2 produced by the nanoake-like morphology is nearly 13 times of that produced by SSR-KTO (Fig. 4(c)), consistent with the enhancement of reduction products.The extremely high enhancement is attributed to the particle size and morphologies.It is generally agreed that the smaller particles are more favourable for photocatalytic reaction due to the large surface area. 19,48The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement reveals that the surface areas of nano-sized SSR-KTO, Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO are 2.1 m 2 g A1 , 13.8 m 2 g A1 , and 43.3 m 2 g A1 respectively, in good agreement with the calculated grain sizes from XRD data and observation by SEM.The short diffusion length of electrons in semiconductors does not allow for efficient transfer to the surface to reduce CO 2 and protons.Thus, special morphologies like nanoribbons, 20 nanorods, 9 or nanotubes 48 which facilitate the electron transport to the catalyst surface were found to be favourable for the photocatalytic reactions.PL (photoluminescence) spectra were recorded at room temperature using a 325 nm laser for KTaO 3 samples prepared using different methods to support this conclusion (Fig. S2 ), which revealed the expected emissions at 516 nm and 476 nm. 49SSR-KTO exhibits much stronger emissions in comparison to both Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO.This indicates that the charge recombination in SSR-KTO is much greater than that in other two samples.The difference in photoactivity between Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO is also attributed to their surface area difference.Therefore thin nanoake-like Hex-KTO with the highest surface area and shortest charge transfer pathway is superior to the other samples.While the photoactivity of both CO 2 and proton reduction was enhanced, it was noted that the selectivity of the reduction products (ratio of CO to H 2 ) shis in favour of H 2 .The change in morphology appears to increase the number of available electrons for reduction, but it appears to highly facilitate the proton reduction process than CO 2 .This may be caused by the difficulties of CO 2 reduction, involving low solubility of CO 2 in neutral water and unfavourable surface reaction sites for CO 2 .Thus, it is necessary to look for a suitable cocatalyst to provide favourable reaction sites for CO 2 photoreduction to overcome one of the problems. The effects of different cocatalysts loading on Hex-KTO nanoakes towards the CO 2 reduction have then been investigated, including metallic Pt and Ag prepared by photodeposition (Table 1).It has been found that 0.5 wt Pt loaded on Hex-KTO increases hydrogen yield by three fold compared to bare Hex-KTO and has a negligible effect on CO 2 photoreduction.The results are in agreement with numerous studies, which state that Pt is highly effective only for H 2 production. 35,50n contrast, Ag loading on Hex-KTO dramatically increases the CO yield but decreases hydrogen production.As shown in Fig. 5, the CO yield is found to be 153 ppm g A1 h A1 when 0.01 wt Ag was loaded, resulting in a 240 increase compared with the best result without a cocatalyst.Meanwhile, the H 2 yield decreases by 15 to 1135 ppm g A1 h A1 .Addition of 0.05 Ag loading further decreases the H 2 yield by 70 and the CO 2 yield is 1.8 fold higher than that in the absence of the Ag cocatalyst.Further loading of Ag beyond 0.05 wt decreases both CO and H 2 yields, which might be due to excess silver metal coating which reects photons and reduces light absorption and large silver clusters with less reaction sites.The hydrogen yield decreased with increasing Ag loading. The change in reaction selectivity is due to cocatalyst loading.In photocatalytic water splitting, it is generally agreed that cocatalysts serve as electron sink by formation of Schottky junctions between semiconductor and metal.The metal cocatalysts with larger work function (i.e.lower Fermi level) should more readily trap electrons.In addition, cocatalysts may also provide effective reduction sites, hence dramatically facilitate reduction reaction.Pt is a well-known cocatalyst favoring proton reduction.However, Pt is not an efficient cocatalyst in the CO 2 environment due to the poisoning effect from surface absorbed CO.A study on CO 2 electroreduction shows that CO is bound very tightly to Pt (binding energy around A1.9 eV). 35On the other hand, Ag (4.26-4.74eV) has smaller work function than Pt (5.12-5.93eV), which means that the Fermi level of Ag is higher than that of Pt, leading to a higher overpotential for the electrons on Ag to reduce CO 2 to CO (A0.51 V vs. NHE, pH 14 7).Furthermore, the binding energy of CO on Ag is much weaker than that on Pt (around A0.25 eV).Thus CO can easily leave the catalyst's surface and regenerate the surface for subsequent reduction reaction.In addition, Ag is not a good cocatalyst for H 2 reduction which has been reported by several studies showing more CO evolution than H 2 evolution over Ag loaded photocatalysts or Ag electrodes. 21,35,36These results may attribute to a non-favourable surface for proton reduction. 24o further identify the carbon source of CO production, an isotopic labelling experiment was performed using 13 CO 2 as feedstock.Fig. 6 shows the GC-MS spectra of 13 CO 2 photoreduction over KTaO 3 .One peak is observed by GC at around 9.2 minutes which has been identied to be CO.The area of the peak increases over prolonged irradiation time which further indicates that CO is produced in the reaction.The slight shi of CO peaks in the GC is due to the contamination of moisture in the sample which decreases the column retention time over each injection.The column could be recovered by heating at 280 C for 10 hours to remove water.The MS spectrum shows peaks with m/z 14 28 and 29, which belong to 12 CO and 13 CO.The only carbon-13 source in the system is 13 CO 2 . 12CO is produced from both 12 CO 2 which was used to purge water before adding 13 CO 2 (see the Experimental section) and organic contaminants which come from organic residues absorbed in the reactor.From the MS spectrum, the peak at m/z 14 29 is about three times higher than the peak at m/z 14 28, which shows that more than 60 of CO was produced from CO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "KTaO3", "source": "In summary, we have synthesised nano-KTaO 3 photocatalysts by different methods and for the rst time successfully used them to reduce CO 2 under UV light irradiation in an aqueous suspension system without the need for any sacricial reagents and electrical bias.", "context": "In summary, we have synthesised nano-KTaO 3 photocatalysts by different methods and for the rst time successfully used them to reduce CO 2 under UV light irradiation in an aqueous suspension system without the need for any sacricial reagents and electrical bias.Both reduction and oxidation products have been simultaneously observed over the photocatalyst alone without any cocatalyst indicating that water served as an electron donor for CO 2 reduction.It has been conrmed that CO is produced from CO 2 reduction by using isotope labelled 13 CO 2 .It has also been found that photocatalytic activity depends on the particle size and morphologies.The nanoake-like Hex-KTO shows the best activity for both H 2 production and CO 2 reduction, achieving 20 times (H 2 ) and 7 times (CO) higher activity than the cubic sample prepared by solid state reaction.Pt loading was found to have a positive effect on hydrogen production, but suppresses CO 2 photoreduction.However, the addition of an Ag cocatalyst has been found to be benecial for CO 2 reduction and the CO yield doubles with decreased hydrogen yield.Further investigation is underway to alter the selectivity, such as by using alloy cocatalysts.

The crystallographic phases for the materials prepared as described above were determined using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker D8 Advance, CuKa radiation source).The XRD data were analyzed by using whole pattern tting (the LeBail method) using the Bruker Topas 3 program to extract the lattice parameter and crystallite size; the space group was cubic (Pm 3m, no.221).The morphology of the samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy (JSM-7401F, JEOL) and the UV-Vis diffuse reectance spectra were recorded with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere device (UV-2550, Shimadzu) at room temperature and transformed to the absorption spectra according to the Kubelka-Munk relationship.Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were recorded using a Renishaw 1000 Raman system using a 325 nm laser at room temperature. In the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , 100 mg of photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed in a 128 ml borosilicate glass reactor.A 300 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the light source for the photocatalytic reaction.6 ml of deionized water was added into the reaction system as an electron donor.The reactor was purged with argon gas for 10 minutes.Before irradiation, the gaseous substances in the headspace of the reactor were injected into a gas chromatograph (Varian, GC-450) using a gastight syringe (Hamilton, 1001 LTN) to make sure there were no measurable carbohydrates (including methane, methanol, etc.) in the reactor and to ensure no air is introduced to the system.A two hour photo-oxidation pre-treatment run was carried out in an argon gas environment to remove any carbon residue on the photocatalyst surface.The reaction system was then purged with CO 2 (BOC, zero grade) for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment.During the experiment, about 1.0 ml of gas was continually taken from the headspace of the reaction cell at given time intervals for product analysis using the GC which is equipped with both TCD and FID detectors.CH 4 and CO amounts were analyzed using a highly sensitive FID detector equipped with a methanizer.O 2 levels were measured using a TCD detector.The oxygen yield was obtained aer careful calculation, in which possible leakage during sampling and the dead area of the gas-tight syringe were taken into consideration.For the isotopic 13 CO 2 experiment, the same photocatalytic reaction procedure was used.Aer adding 100 mg photocatalyst into 6 ml of CO 2 saturated water, the septa-sealed reactor was purged with argon gas for 10 minutes.Then, 13 CO 2 ( 13 C 99, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was introduced.The sample was irradiated with a 150 W Xe lamp for 30 minutes, and then 0.5 ml of the reaction product taken from the vessel headspace was analyzed by mass spectrometry (GC/MS, Shimadzu QP-2010SE) with a molecular sieve 5 A capillary column.Helium was used as carrier gas during the measurement."}, {"llm generation": "Pt, Ag", "source": "The effects of different cocatalysts loading on Hex-KTO nanoakes towards the CO 2 reduction have then been investigated, including metallic Pt and Ag prepared by photodeposition (Table 1).", "context": "KTaO 3 samples were synthesized by solid-state reaction (SSR-KTO) and solvothermal methods in a hexane-water mixture (Hex-KTO) and pure ethanol (Eth-KTO). 38,39Fig. 1 displays the Xray diffraction (XRD) data for KTaO 3 samples synthesised by different methods, showing a typical cubic crystal structure.The diffraction data are consistent with the standard reference data (PDF no.38-1470), 40 indicating that KTaO 3 was well crystallised. The average crystallite size calculated by XRD using the Scherrer equation from whole pattern tting (LeBail method) suggests a decreasing grain size trend, from 161(3) nm for SSR-KTO, 46(1) nm for Eth-KTO down to 32(1) nm for Hex-KTO (Table S1 ). Fig. 2 shows the scanning and transmission electron micrographs of nano-sized KTaO 3 prepared by different methods.While both SSR-KTO and Eth-KTO show the usual cubic-like morphology of KTaO 3 , whereas Hex-KTO shows peculiar conjoined nanoake-like particles.The average particle size seen by the electron micrographs supports the grain size trend calculated from XRD data, with SSR-KTO having the largest particles (200-500 nm), followed by Eth-KTO (50-100 nm) and then Hex-KTO (15-50 nm).Fig. 3 shows the UV-Vis spectrum of the KTaO 3 samples.The bandgap (E g ) of a semiconductor could be inferred from its UV-Vis spectra using the following equation: 41 (ahn where a is the absorption coefficient, hn is the energy of photon, n represents the index which depends on the electronic transition of the semiconductor (for KTaO 3 n 14 2), 41 and A is a proportionality constant related to the material.The bandgap energy was obtained from the intercept of the tangent line in the plot of (ahn) 2 versus energy, and the value was determined to be 3.5 eV for SSR-KTO and 3.7 eV for Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out over 100 mg of KTaO 3 and 6 ml of water in a borosilicate glass reactor.Note that the borosilicate glass transmittance is only z40 at 280 nm (Fig. S1 ), unlike the quartz reactors used in other studies. 20,24A 300 W Xe lamp was used to illuminate the suspension without any addition of electron donors or electric bias.To eliminate the chance of CO production by photodegradation of organic residues on the sample surface, a twostep pretreatment process was performed, in which the photocatalyst particles were rst calcined at 433 K for more than 1 hour in air.Aer that a 2 hour photo-oxidation process in a sealed environment was carried out immediately before each test to further remove possible contaminants and obtain the baseline of CO 2 reduction in the reaction system.A series of control experiments were also carried out to ensure oxygen and CO were only produced from photocatalytic reactions, including (1) CO 2 -free water-catalyst suspension in argon under illumination, (2) CO 2 -saturated water-catalyst suspension in the dark and (3) CO 2 -saturated water without a photocatalyst under illumination.The measurable CO and oxygen under these situations was negligible.As KTaO 3 is a UV-driven photocatalyst, the system has shown no photoactivity when an LP 420 nm lter was used in the experiment. The gases produced by SSR-KTO in a CO 2 saturated suspension system without any cocatalyst or sacricial reagents are revealed in Fig. 4(a) and (b).In all samples, hydrogen and carbon monoxide are both detected as the major reduction products under Xe lamp irradiation.It should be noted that the working spectrum of the system was limited from 280 to 350 nm due to the transmittance of the borosilicate glass reactor and the KTaO 3 bandgap absorption (Fig. S1 ).Furthermore, unlike many photocatalysts which produce a range of carbohydrates, and bring up the need for post-separation of products, 42 the CO 2 photoreduction selectivity over KTaO 3 is nearly 100 towards CO with trace amounts of CH 4 being detected in the system (less than 2).No other detectable organic products in the gaseous phase were observed by a sensitive FID detector. Fig. 4(c) shows that oxygen is evolved from the suspension system.All these products linearly increase with reaction time, indicating a stable photochemical process.It is noted that the observed evolved oxygen is less than the expected stoichiometric amount (i.e. the ideal unity ratio of the number of consumed photoelectrons to the photoholes), which is mainly ascribed to the strong interaction between O 2 and the photocatalyst surface as reported on several photocatalysts. 43444454647 It is likely that unavoidable leakage during sampling and lower oxygen sensitivity of the TCD detector may underestimate the actual oxygen amount slightly.The contamination of organic compounds may also lead to mismatch between the reduction and oxygen products' yield.To minimise measurement errors due to leaking, N 2 has also been tracked as a reference, which further conrms that O 2 yields from water photooxidation due to the linear increase of the ratio of O 2 to N 2 amount.The twostep pre-treatment was also carried out to remove most of the organic residue from material synthesis. Interestingly, the results strongly indicate that the photocatalytic performance is highly inuenced by the size and morphologies of KTaO 3 (Fig. 4).The SSR-KTO sample, which has the largest particle size, yields an average reaction rate of 68.05 ppm g A1 h A1 hydrogen and 8.88 ppm g A1 h A1 CO, respectively.Solvothermally grown KTaO 3 with notably smaller particle size represents higher photocatalytic activity.Eth-KTO samples yield 627.1 ppm g A1 h A1 of hydrogen and 19.35 ppm g A1 h A1 of CO.In particular, Hex-KTO with nano-ake-like morphology shows 1323 ppm g A1 h A1 of hydrogen and 61.98 ppm g A1 h A1 of CO, an impressive 20 and 7 times higher yield for H 2 and CO compared to the cubic SSR-KTO.Correspondingly, O 2 produced by the nanoake-like morphology is nearly 13 times of that produced by SSR-KTO (Fig. 4(c)), consistent with the enhancement of reduction products.The extremely high enhancement is attributed to the particle size and morphologies.It is generally agreed that the smaller particles are more favourable for photocatalytic reaction due to the large surface area. 19,48The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement reveals that the surface areas of nano-sized SSR-KTO, Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO are 2.1 m 2 g A1 , 13.8 m 2 g A1 , and 43.3 m 2 g A1 respectively, in good agreement with the calculated grain sizes from XRD data and observation by SEM.The short diffusion length of electrons in semiconductors does not allow for efficient transfer to the surface to reduce CO 2 and protons.Thus, special morphologies like nanoribbons, 20 nanorods, 9 or nanotubes 48 which facilitate the electron transport to the catalyst surface were found to be favourable for the photocatalytic reactions.PL (photoluminescence) spectra were recorded at room temperature using a 325 nm laser for KTaO 3 samples prepared using different methods to support this conclusion (Fig. S2 ), which revealed the expected emissions at 516 nm and 476 nm. 49SSR-KTO exhibits much stronger emissions in comparison to both Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO.This indicates that the charge recombination in SSR-KTO is much greater than that in other two samples.The difference in photoactivity between Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO is also attributed to their surface area difference.Therefore thin nanoake-like Hex-KTO with the highest surface area and shortest charge transfer pathway is superior to the other samples.While the photoactivity of both CO 2 and proton reduction was enhanced, it was noted that the selectivity of the reduction products (ratio of CO to H 2 ) shis in favour of H 2 .The change in morphology appears to increase the number of available electrons for reduction, but it appears to highly facilitate the proton reduction process than CO 2 .This may be caused by the difficulties of CO 2 reduction, involving low solubility of CO 2 in neutral water and unfavourable surface reaction sites for CO 2 .Thus, it is necessary to look for a suitable cocatalyst to provide favourable reaction sites for CO 2 photoreduction to overcome one of the problems. The effects of different cocatalysts loading on Hex-KTO nanoakes towards the CO 2 reduction have then been investigated, including metallic Pt and Ag prepared by photodeposition (Table 1).It has been found that 0.5 wt Pt loaded on Hex-KTO increases hydrogen yield by three fold compared to bare Hex-KTO and has a negligible effect on CO 2 photoreduction.The results are in agreement with numerous studies, which state that Pt is highly effective only for H 2 production. 35,50n contrast, Ag loading on Hex-KTO dramatically increases the CO yield but decreases hydrogen production.As shown in Fig. 5, the CO yield is found to be 153 ppm g A1 h A1 when 0.01 wt Ag was loaded, resulting in a 240 increase compared with the best result without a cocatalyst.Meanwhile, the H 2 yield decreases by 15 to 1135 ppm g A1 h A1 .Addition of 0.05 Ag loading further decreases the H 2 yield by 70 and the CO 2 yield is 1.8 fold higher than that in the absence of the Ag cocatalyst.Further loading of Ag beyond 0.05 wt decreases both CO and H 2 yields, which might be due to excess silver metal coating which reects photons and reduces light absorption and large silver clusters with less reaction sites.The hydrogen yield decreased with increasing Ag loading. The change in reaction selectivity is due to cocatalyst loading.In photocatalytic water splitting, it is generally agreed that cocatalysts serve as electron sink by formation of Schottky junctions between semiconductor and metal.The metal cocatalysts with larger work function (i.e.lower Fermi level) should more readily trap electrons.In addition, cocatalysts may also provide effective reduction sites, hence dramatically facilitate reduction reaction.Pt is a well-known cocatalyst favoring proton reduction.However, Pt is not an efficient cocatalyst in the CO 2 environment due to the poisoning effect from surface absorbed CO.A study on CO 2 electroreduction shows that CO is bound very tightly to Pt (binding energy around A1.9 eV). 35On the other hand, Ag (4.26-4.74eV) has smaller work function than Pt (5.12-5.93eV), which means that the Fermi level of Ag is higher than that of Pt, leading to a higher overpotential for the electrons on Ag to reduce CO 2 to CO (A0.51 V vs. NHE, pH 14 7).Furthermore, the binding energy of CO on Ag is much weaker than that on Pt (around A0.25 eV).Thus CO can easily leave the catalyst's surface and regenerate the surface for subsequent reduction reaction.In addition, Ag is not a good cocatalyst for H 2 reduction which has been reported by several studies showing more CO evolution than H 2 evolution over Ag loaded photocatalysts or Ag electrodes. 21,35,36These results may attribute to a non-favourable surface for proton reduction. 24o further identify the carbon source of CO production, an isotopic labelling experiment was performed using 13 CO 2 as feedstock.Fig. 6 shows the GC-MS spectra of 13 CO 2 photoreduction over KTaO 3 .One peak is observed by GC at around 9.2 minutes which has been identied to be CO.The area of the peak increases over prolonged irradiation time which further indicates that CO is produced in the reaction.The slight shi of CO peaks in the GC is due to the contamination of moisture in the sample which decreases the column retention time over each injection.The column could be recovered by heating at 280 C for 10 hours to remove water.The MS spectrum shows peaks with m/z 14 28 and 29, which belong to 12 CO and 13 CO.The only carbon-13 source in the system is 13 CO 2 . 12CO is produced from both 12 CO 2 which was used to purge water before adding 13 CO 2 (see the Experimental section) and organic contaminants which come from organic residues absorbed in the reactor.From the MS spectrum, the peak at m/z 14 29 is about three times higher than the peak at m/z 14 28, which shows that more than 60 of CO was produced from CO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "Pt", "source": "Pt loading was found to have a positive effect on hydrogen production, but suppresses CO 2 photoreduction.", "context": "In summary, we have synthesised nano-KTaO 3 photocatalysts by different methods and for the rst time successfully used them to reduce CO 2 under UV light irradiation in an aqueous suspension system without the need for any sacricial reagents and electrical bias.Both reduction and oxidation products have been simultaneously observed over the photocatalyst alone without any cocatalyst indicating that water served as an electron donor for CO 2 reduction.It has been conrmed that CO is produced from CO 2 reduction by using isotope labelled 13 CO 2 .It has also been found that photocatalytic activity depends on the particle size and morphologies.The nanoake-like Hex-KTO shows the best activity for both H 2 production and CO 2 reduction, achieving 20 times (H 2 ) and 7 times (CO) higher activity than the cubic sample prepared by solid state reaction.Pt loading was found to have a positive effect on hydrogen production, but suppresses CO 2 photoreduction.However, the addition of an Ag cocatalyst has been found to be benecial for CO 2 reduction and the CO yield doubles with decreased hydrogen yield.Further investigation is underway to alter the selectivity, such as by using alloy cocatalysts.

The average crystallite size calculated by XRD using the Scherrer equation from whole pattern tting (LeBail method) suggests a decreasing grain size trend, from 161(3) nm for SSR-KTO, 46(1) nm for Eth-KTO down to 32(1) nm for Hex-KTO (Table S1 ).

The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out over 100 mg of KTaO 3 and 6 ml of water in a borosilicate glass reactor.Note that the borosilicate glass transmittance is only z40 at 280 nm (Fig. S1 ), unlike the quartz reactors used in other studies. 20,24A 300 W Xe lamp was used to illuminate the suspension without any addition of electron donors or electric bias.To eliminate the chance of CO production by photodegradation of organic residues on the sample surface, a twostep pretreatment process was performed, in which the photocatalyst particles were rst calcined at 433 K for more than 1 hour in air.Aer that a 2 hour photo-oxidation process in a sealed environment was carried out immediately before each test to further remove possible contaminants and obtain the baseline of CO 2 reduction in the reaction system.A series of control experiments were also carried out to ensure oxygen and CO were only produced from photocatalytic reactions, including (1) CO 2 -free water-catalyst suspension in argon under illumination, (2) CO 2 -saturated water-catalyst suspension in the dark and (3) CO 2 -saturated water without a photocatalyst under illumination.The measurable CO and oxygen under these situations was negligible.As KTaO 3 is a UV-driven photocatalyst, the system has shown no photoactivity when an LP 420 nm lter was used in the experiment. The gases produced by SSR-KTO in a CO 2 saturated suspension system without any cocatalyst or sacricial reagents are revealed in Fig. 4(a) and (b).In all samples, hydrogen and carbon monoxide are both detected as the major reduction products under Xe lamp irradiation.It should be noted that the working spectrum of the system was limited from 280 to 350 nm due to the transmittance of the borosilicate glass reactor and the KTaO 3 bandgap absorption (Fig. S1 ).Furthermore, unlike many photocatalysts which produce a range of carbohydrates, and bring up the need for post-separation of products, 42 the CO 2 photoreduction selectivity over KTaO 3 is nearly 100 towards CO with trace amounts of CH 4 being detected in the system (less than 2).No other detectable organic products in the gaseous phase were observed by a sensitive FID detector. Fig. 4(c) shows that oxygen is evolved from the suspension system.All these products linearly increase with reaction time, indicating a stable photochemical process.It is noted that the observed evolved oxygen is less than the expected stoichiometric amount (i.e. the ideal unity ratio of the number of consumed photoelectrons to the photoholes), which is mainly ascribed to the strong interaction between O 2 and the photocatalyst surface as reported on several photocatalysts. 43444454647 It is likely that unavoidable leakage during sampling and lower oxygen sensitivity of the TCD detector may underestimate the actual oxygen amount slightly.The contamination of organic compounds may also lead to mismatch between the reduction and oxygen products' yield.To minimise measurement errors due to leaking, N 2 has also been tracked as a reference, which further conrms that O 2 yields from water photooxidation due to the linear increase of the ratio of O 2 to N 2 amount.The twostep pre-treatment was also carried out to remove most of the organic residue from material synthesis. Interestingly, the results strongly indicate that the photocatalytic performance is highly inuenced by the size and morphologies of KTaO 3 (Fig. 4).The SSR-KTO sample, which has the largest particle size, yields an average reaction rate of 68.05 ppm g A1 h A1 hydrogen and 8.88 ppm g A1 h A1 CO, respectively.Solvothermally grown KTaO 3 with notably smaller particle size represents higher photocatalytic activity.Eth-KTO samples yield 627.1 ppm g A1 h A1 of hydrogen and 19.35 ppm g A1 h A1 of CO.In particular, Hex-KTO with nano-ake-like morphology shows 1323 ppm g A1 h A1 of hydrogen and 61.98 ppm g A1 h A1 of CO, an impressive 20 and 7 times higher yield for H 2 and CO compared to the cubic SSR-KTO.Correspondingly, O 2 produced by the nanoake-like morphology is nearly 13 times of that produced by SSR-KTO (Fig. 4(c)), consistent with the enhancement of reduction products.The extremely high enhancement is attributed to the particle size and morphologies.It is generally agreed that the smaller particles are more favourable for photocatalytic reaction due to the large surface area. 19,48The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement reveals that the surface areas of nano-sized SSR-KTO, Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO are 2.1 m 2 g A1 , 13.8 m 2 g A1 , and 43.3 m 2 g A1 respectively, in good agreement with the calculated grain sizes from XRD data and observation by SEM.The short diffusion length of electrons in semiconductors does not allow for efficient transfer to the surface to reduce CO 2 and protons.Thus, special morphologies like nanoribbons, 20 nanorods, 9 or nanotubes 48 which facilitate the electron transport to the catalyst surface were found to be favourable for the photocatalytic reactions.PL (photoluminescence) spectra were recorded at room temperature using a 325 nm laser for KTaO 3 samples prepared using different methods to support this conclusion (Fig. S2 ), which revealed the expected emissions at 516 nm and 476 nm. 49SSR-KTO exhibits much stronger emissions in comparison to both Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO.This indicates that the charge recombination in SSR-KTO is much greater than that in other two samples.The difference in photoactivity between Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO is also attributed to their surface area difference.Therefore thin nanoake-like Hex-KTO with the highest surface area and shortest charge transfer pathway is superior to the other samples.While the photoactivity of both CO 2 and proton reduction was enhanced, it was noted that the selectivity of the reduction products (ratio of CO to H 2 ) shis in favour of H 2 .The change in morphology appears to increase the number of available electrons for reduction, but it appears to highly facilitate the proton reduction process than CO 2 .This may be caused by the difficulties of CO 2 reduction, involving low solubility of CO 2 in neutral water and unfavourable surface reaction sites for CO 2 .Thus, it is necessary to look for a suitable cocatalyst to provide favourable reaction sites for CO 2 photoreduction to overcome one of the problems.

Interestingly, the results strongly indicate that the photocatalytic performance is highly inuenced by the size and morphologies of KTaO 3 (Fig. 4).The SSR-KTO sample, which has the largest particle size, yields an average reaction rate of 68.05 ppm g A1 h A1 hydrogen and 8.88 ppm g A1 h A1 CO, respectively.Solvothermally grown KTaO 3 with notably smaller particle size represents higher photocatalytic activity.Eth-KTO samples yield 627.1 ppm g A1 h A1 of hydrogen and 19.35 ppm g A1 h A1 of CO.In particular, Hex-KTO with nano-ake-like morphology shows 1323 ppm g A1 h A1 of hydrogen and 61.98 ppm g A1 h A1 of CO, an impressive 20 and 7 times higher yield for H 2 and CO compared to the cubic SSR-KTO.Correspondingly, O 2 produced by the nanoake-like morphology is nearly 13 times of that produced by SSR-KTO (Fig. 4(c)), consistent with the enhancement of reduction products.The extremely high enhancement is attributed to the particle size and morphologies.It is generally agreed that the smaller particles are more favourable for photocatalytic reaction due to the large surface area. 19,48The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement reveals that the surface areas of nano-sized SSR-KTO, Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO are 2.1 m 2 g A1 , 13.8 m 2 g A1 , and 43.3 m 2 g A1 respectively, in good agreement with the calculated grain sizes from XRD data and observation by SEM.The short diffusion length of electrons in semiconductors does not allow for efficient transfer to the surface to reduce CO 2 and protons.Thus, special morphologies like nanoribbons, 20 nanorods, 9 or nanotubes 48 which facilitate the electron transport to the catalyst surface were found to be favourable for the photocatalytic reactions.PL (photoluminescence) spectra were recorded at room temperature using a 325 nm laser for KTaO 3 samples prepared using different methods to support this conclusion (Fig. S2 ), which revealed the expected emissions at 516 nm and 476 nm. 49SSR-KTO exhibits much stronger emissions in comparison to both Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO.This indicates that the charge recombination in SSR-KTO is much greater than that in other two samples.The difference in photoactivity between Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO is also attributed to their surface area difference.Therefore thin nanoake-like Hex-KTO with the highest surface area and shortest charge transfer pathway is superior to the other samples.While the photoactivity of both CO 2 and proton reduction was enhanced, it was noted that the selectivity of the reduction products (ratio of CO to H 2 ) shis in favour of H 2 .The change in morphology appears to increase the number of available electrons for reduction, but it appears to highly facilitate the proton reduction process than CO 2 .This may be caused by the difficulties of CO 2 reduction, involving low solubility of CO 2 in neutral water and unfavourable surface reaction sites for CO 2 .Thus, it is necessary to look for a suitable cocatalyst to provide favourable reaction sites for CO 2 photoreduction to overcome one of the problems. The effects of different cocatalysts loading on Hex-KTO nanoakes towards the CO 2 reduction have then been investigated, including metallic Pt and Ag prepared by photodeposition (Table 1).It has been found that 0.5 wt Pt loaded on Hex-KTO increases hydrogen yield by three fold compared to bare Hex-KTO and has a negligible effect on CO 2 photoreduction.The results are in agreement with numerous studies, which state that Pt is highly effective only for H 2 production. 35,50n contrast, Ag loading on Hex-KTO dramatically increases the CO yield but decreases hydrogen production.As shown in Fig. 5, the CO yield is found to be 153 ppm g A1 h A1 when 0.01 wt Ag was loaded, resulting in a 240 increase compared with the best result without a cocatalyst.Meanwhile, the H 2 yield decreases by 15 to 1135 ppm g A1 h A1 .Addition of 0.05 Ag loading further decreases the H 2 yield by 70 and the CO 2 yield is 1.8 fold higher than that in the absence of the Ag cocatalyst.Further loading of Ag beyond 0.05 wt decreases both CO and H 2 yields, which might be due to excess silver metal coating which reects photons and reduces light absorption and large silver clusters with less reaction sites.The hydrogen yield decreased with increasing Ag loading. The change in reaction selectivity is due to cocatalyst loading.In photocatalytic water splitting, it is generally agreed that cocatalysts serve as electron sink by formation of Schottky junctions between semiconductor and metal.The metal cocatalysts with larger work function (i.e.lower Fermi level) should more readily trap electrons.In addition, cocatalysts may also provide effective reduction sites, hence dramatically facilitate reduction reaction.Pt is a well-known cocatalyst favoring proton reduction.However, Pt is not an efficient cocatalyst in the CO 2 environment due to the poisoning effect from surface absorbed CO.A study on CO 2 electroreduction shows that CO is bound very tightly to Pt (binding energy around A1.9 eV). 35On the other hand, Ag (4.26-4.74eV) has smaller work function than Pt (5.12-5.93eV), which means that the Fermi level of Ag is higher than that of Pt, leading to a higher overpotential for the electrons on Ag to reduce CO 2 to CO (A0.51 V vs. NHE, pH 14 7).Furthermore, the binding energy of CO on Ag is much weaker than that on Pt (around A0.25 eV).Thus CO can easily leave the catalyst's surface and regenerate the surface for subsequent reduction reaction.In addition, Ag is not a good cocatalyst for H 2 reduction which has been reported by several studies showing more CO evolution than H 2 evolution over Ag loaded photocatalysts or Ag electrodes. 21,35,36These results may attribute to a non-favourable surface for proton reduction. 24o further identify the carbon source of CO production, an isotopic labelling experiment was performed using 13 CO 2 as feedstock.Fig. 6 shows the GC-MS spectra of 13 CO 2 photoreduction over KTaO 3 .One peak is observed by GC at around 9.2 minutes which has been identied to be CO.The area of the peak increases over prolonged irradiation time which further indicates that CO is produced in the reaction.The slight shi of CO peaks in the GC is due to the contamination of moisture in the sample which decreases the column retention time over each injection.The column could be recovered by heating at 280 C for 10 hours to remove water.The MS spectrum shows peaks with m/z 14 28 and 29, which belong to 12 CO and 13 CO.The only carbon-13 source in the system is 13 CO 2 . 12CO is produced from both 12 CO 2 which was used to purge water before adding 13 CO 2 (see the Experimental section) and organic contaminants which come from organic residues absorbed in the reactor.From the MS spectrum, the peak at m/z 14 29 is about three times higher than the peak at m/z 14 28, which shows that more than 60 of CO was produced from CO 2 ."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>and protons using water as an electron donor over potassium tantalate nanoflakes", "context": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>and protons using water as an electron donor over potassium tantalate nanoflakes"}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "CO 2 photoreduction over KTaO 3 photocatalysts in water has been investigated.", "context": "CO 2 photoreduction over KTaO 3 photocatalysts in water has been investigated.Both reduction (mainly carbon monoxide and hydrogen) and oxidation products (oxygen) were simultaneously detected in the absence of cocatalysts, sacrificial reagents and electrical bias.KTaO 3 (KTO) samples were synthesized by solid-state reaction (SSR-KTO) and solvothermal methods in a hexane-water mixture (Hex-KTO) and pure ethanol (Eth-KTO).The different synthesis methods were used to control particle sizes and morphologies of KTaO 3 and their correlation towards photocatalytic activity has been further investigated.Strikingly, KTO prepared in a hexane-water mixture solvent represents a nanoflake-like structure, resulting in a seven fold increase in CO 2 reduction and hydrogen evolution activities in comparison to conventional cubic structure KTO under UV light irradiation.CO with trace amounts of CH 4 is produced from CO 2 photoreduction.Upon addition of a silver cocatalyst on KTO, the reduction selectivity has been controlled to favour CO 2 photoreduction, and the CO 2 to CO yield has been doubled compared to bare KTaO 3 ."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out over 100 mg of KTaO 3 and 6 ml of water in a borosilicate glass reactor.", "context": "KTaO 3 samples were synthesized by solid-state reaction (SSR-KTO) and solvothermal methods in a hexane-water mixture (Hex-KTO) and pure ethanol (Eth-KTO). 38,39Fig. 1 displays the Xray diffraction (XRD) data for KTaO 3 samples synthesised by different methods, showing a typical cubic crystal structure.The diffraction data are consistent with the standard reference data (PDF no.38-1470), 40 indicating that KTaO 3 was well crystallised. The average crystallite size calculated by XRD using the Scherrer equation from whole pattern tting (LeBail method) suggests a decreasing grain size trend, from 161(3) nm for SSR-KTO, 46(1) nm for Eth-KTO down to 32(1) nm for Hex-KTO (Table S1 ). Fig. 2 shows the scanning and transmission electron micrographs of nano-sized KTaO 3 prepared by different methods.While both SSR-KTO and Eth-KTO show the usual cubic-like morphology of KTaO 3 , whereas Hex-KTO shows peculiar conjoined nanoake-like particles.The average particle size seen by the electron micrographs supports the grain size trend calculated from XRD data, with SSR-KTO having the largest particles (200-500 nm), followed by Eth-KTO (50-100 nm) and then Hex-KTO (15-50 nm).Fig. 3 shows the UV-Vis spectrum of the KTaO 3 samples.The bandgap (E g ) of a semiconductor could be inferred from its UV-Vis spectra using the following equation: 41 (ahn where a is the absorption coefficient, hn is the energy of photon, n represents the index which depends on the electronic transition of the semiconductor (for KTaO 3 n 14 2), 41 and A is a proportionality constant related to the material.The bandgap energy was obtained from the intercept of the tangent line in the plot of (ahn) 2 versus energy, and the value was determined to be 3.5 eV for SSR-KTO and 3.7 eV for Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out over 100 mg of KTaO 3 and 6 ml of water in a borosilicate glass reactor.Note that the borosilicate glass transmittance is only z40 at 280 nm (Fig. S1 ), unlike the quartz reactors used in other studies. 20,24A 300 W Xe lamp was used to illuminate the suspension without any addition of electron donors or electric bias.To eliminate the chance of CO production by photodegradation of organic residues on the sample surface, a twostep pretreatment process was performed, in which the photocatalyst particles were rst calcined at 433 K for more than 1 hour in air.Aer that a 2 hour photo-oxidation process in a sealed environment was carried out immediately before each test to further remove possible contaminants and obtain the baseline of CO 2 reduction in the reaction system.A series of control experiments were also carried out to ensure oxygen and CO were only produced from photocatalytic reactions, including (1) CO 2 -free water-catalyst suspension in argon under illumination, (2) CO 2 -saturated water-catalyst suspension in the dark and (3) CO 2 -saturated water without a photocatalyst under illumination.The measurable CO and oxygen under these situations was negligible.As KTaO 3 is a UV-driven photocatalyst, the system has shown no photoactivity when an LP 420 nm lter was used in the experiment. The gases produced by SSR-KTO in a CO 2 saturated suspension system without any cocatalyst or sacricial reagents are revealed in Fig. 4(a) and (b).In all samples, hydrogen and carbon monoxide are both detected as the major reduction products under Xe lamp irradiation.It should be noted that the working spectrum of the system was limited from 280 to 350 nm due to the transmittance of the borosilicate glass reactor and the KTaO 3 bandgap absorption (Fig. S1 ).Furthermore, unlike many photocatalysts which produce a range of carbohydrates, and bring up the need for post-separation of products, 42 the CO 2 photoreduction selectivity over KTaO 3 is nearly 100 towards CO with trace amounts of CH 4 being detected in the system (less than 2).No other detectable organic products in the gaseous phase were observed by a sensitive FID detector. Fig. 4(c) shows that oxygen is evolved from the suspension system.All these products linearly increase with reaction time, indicating a stable photochemical process.It is noted that the observed evolved oxygen is less than the expected stoichiometric amount (i.e. the ideal unity ratio of the number of consumed photoelectrons to the photoholes), which is mainly ascribed to the strong interaction between O 2 and the photocatalyst surface as reported on several photocatalysts. 43444454647 It is likely that unavoidable leakage during sampling and lower oxygen sensitivity of the TCD detector may underestimate the actual oxygen amount slightly.The contamination of organic compounds may also lead to mismatch between the reduction and oxygen products' yield.To minimise measurement errors due to leaking, N 2 has also been tracked as a reference, which further conrms that O 2 yields from water photooxidation due to the linear increase of the ratio of O 2 to N 2 amount.The twostep pre-treatment was also carried out to remove most of the organic residue from material synthesis. Interestingly, the results strongly indicate that the photocatalytic performance is highly inuenced by the size and morphologies of KTaO 3 (Fig. 4).The SSR-KTO sample, which has the largest particle size, yields an average reaction rate of 68.05 ppm g A1 h A1 hydrogen and 8.88 ppm g A1 h A1 CO, respectively.Solvothermally grown KTaO 3 with notably smaller particle size represents higher photocatalytic activity.Eth-KTO samples yield 627.1 ppm g A1 h A1 of hydrogen and 19.35 ppm g A1 h A1 of CO.In particular, Hex-KTO with nano-ake-like morphology shows 1323 ppm g A1 h A1 of hydrogen and 61.98 ppm g A1 h A1 of CO, an impressive 20 and 7 times higher yield for H 2 and CO compared to the cubic SSR-KTO.Correspondingly, O 2 produced by the nanoake-like morphology is nearly 13 times of that produced by SSR-KTO (Fig. 4(c)), consistent with the enhancement of reduction products.The extremely high enhancement is attributed to the particle size and morphologies.It is generally agreed that the smaller particles are more favourable for photocatalytic reaction due to the large surface area. 19,48The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement reveals that the surface areas of nano-sized SSR-KTO, Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO are 2.1 m 2 g A1 , 13.8 m 2 g A1 , and 43.3 m 2 g A1 respectively, in good agreement with the calculated grain sizes from XRD data and observation by SEM.The short diffusion length of electrons in semiconductors does not allow for efficient transfer to the surface to reduce CO 2 and protons.Thus, special morphologies like nanoribbons, 20 nanorods, 9 or nanotubes 48 which facilitate the electron transport to the catalyst surface were found to be favourable for the photocatalytic reactions.PL (photoluminescence) spectra were recorded at room temperature using a 325 nm laser for KTaO 3 samples prepared using different methods to support this conclusion (Fig. S2 ), which revealed the expected emissions at 516 nm and 476 nm. 49SSR-KTO exhibits much stronger emissions in comparison to both Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO.This indicates that the charge recombination in SSR-KTO is much greater than that in other two samples.The difference in photoactivity between Eth-KTO and Hex-KTO is also attributed to their surface area difference.Therefore thin nanoake-like Hex-KTO with the highest surface area and shortest charge transfer pathway is superior to the other samples.While the photoactivity of both CO 2 and proton reduction was enhanced, it was noted that the selectivity of the reduction products (ratio of CO to H 2 ) shis in favour of H 2 .The change in morphology appears to increase the number of available electrons for reduction, but it appears to highly facilitate the proton reduction process than CO 2 .This may be caused by the difficulties of CO 2 reduction, involving low solubility of CO 2 in neutral water and unfavourable surface reaction sites for CO 2 .Thus, it is necessary to look for a suitable cocatalyst to provide favourable reaction sites for CO 2 photoreduction to overcome one of the problems. The effects of different cocatalysts loading on Hex-KTO nanoakes towards the CO 2 reduction have then been investigated, including metallic Pt and Ag prepared by photodeposition (Table 1).It has been found that 0.5 wt Pt loaded on Hex-KTO increases hydrogen yield by three fold compared to bare Hex-KTO and has a negligible effect on CO 2 photoreduction.The results are in agreement with numerous studies, which state that Pt is highly effective only for H 2 production. 35,50n contrast, Ag loading on Hex-KTO dramatically increases the CO yield but decreases hydrogen production.As shown in Fig. 5, the CO yield is found to be 153 ppm g A1 h A1 when 0.01 wt Ag was loaded, resulting in a 240 increase compared with the best result without a cocatalyst.Meanwhile, the H 2 yield decreases by 15 to 1135 ppm g A1 h A1 .Addition of 0.05 Ag loading further decreases the H 2 yield by 70 and the CO 2 yield is 1.8 fold higher than that in the absence of the Ag cocatalyst.Further loading of Ag beyond 0.05 wt decreases both CO and H 2 yields, which might be due to excess silver metal coating which reects photons and reduces light absorption and large silver clusters with less reaction sites.The hydrogen yield decreased with increasing Ag loading. The change in reaction selectivity is due to cocatalyst loading.In photocatalytic water splitting, it is generally agreed that cocatalysts serve as electron sink by formation of Schottky junctions between semiconductor and metal.The metal cocatalysts with larger work function (i.e.lower Fermi level) should more readily trap electrons.In addition, cocatalysts may also provide effective reduction sites, hence dramatically facilitate reduction reaction.Pt is a well-known cocatalyst favoring proton reduction.However, Pt is not an efficient cocatalyst in the CO 2 environment due to the poisoning effect from surface absorbed CO.A study on CO 2 electroreduction shows that CO is bound very tightly to Pt (binding energy around A1.9 eV). 35On the other hand, Ag (4.26-4.74eV) has smaller work function than Pt (5.12-5.93eV), which means that the Fermi level of Ag is higher than that of Pt, leading to a higher overpotential for the electrons on Ag to reduce CO 2 to CO (A0.51 V vs. NHE, pH 14 7).Furthermore, the binding energy of CO on Ag is much weaker than that on Pt (around A0.25 eV).Thus CO can easily leave the catalyst's surface and regenerate the surface for subsequent reduction reaction.In addition, Ag is not a good cocatalyst for H 2 reduction which has been reported by several studies showing more CO evolution than H 2 evolution over Ag loaded photocatalysts or Ag electrodes. 21,35,36These results may attribute to a non-favourable surface for proton reduction. 24o further identify the carbon source of CO production, an isotopic labelling experiment was performed using 13 CO 2 as feedstock.Fig. 6 shows the GC-MS spectra of 13 CO 2 photoreduction over KTaO 3 .One peak is observed by GC at around 9.2 minutes which has been identied to be CO.The area of the peak increases over prolonged irradiation time which further indicates that CO is produced in the reaction.The slight shi of CO peaks in the GC is due to the contamination of moisture in the sample which decreases the column retention time over each injection.The column could be recovered by heating at 280 C for 10 hours to remove water.The MS spectrum shows peaks with m/z 14 28 and 29, which belong to 12 CO and 13 CO.The only carbon-13 source in the system is 13 CO 2 . 12CO is produced from both 12 CO 2 which was used to purge water before adding 13 CO 2 (see the Experimental section) and organic contaminants which come from organic residues absorbed in the reactor.From the MS spectrum, the peak at m/z 14 29 is about three times higher than the peak at m/z 14 28, which shows that more than 60 of CO was produced from CO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "In summary, we have synthesised nano-KTaO 3 photocatalysts by different methods and for the rst time successfully used them to reduce CO 2 under UV light irradiation in an aqueous suspension system without the need for any sacricial reagents and electrical bias.", "context": "In summary, we have synthesised nano-KTaO 3 photocatalysts by different methods and for the rst time successfully used them to reduce CO 2 under UV light irradiation in an aqueous suspension system without the need for any sacricial reagents and electrical bias.Both reduction and oxidation products have been simultaneously observed over the photocatalyst alone without any cocatalyst indicating that water served as an electron donor for CO 2 reduction.It has been conrmed that CO is produced from CO 2 reduction by using isotope labelled 13 CO 2 .It has also been found that photocatalytic activity depends on the particle size and morphologies.The nanoake-like Hex-KTO shows the best activity for both H 2 production and CO 2 reduction, achieving 20 times (H 2 ) and 7 times (CO) higher activity than the cubic sample prepared by solid state reaction.Pt loading was found to have a positive effect on hydrogen production, but suppresses CO 2 photoreduction.However, the addition of an Ag cocatalyst has been found to be benecial for CO 2 reduction and the CO yield doubles with decreased hydrogen yield.Further investigation is underway to alter the selectivity, such as by using alloy cocatalysts.
