The micromorphologies of the as-prepared BiOCl-NS and Bi/BiOCl-NS were characterized using TEM (Fig. 2).The pristine BiOCl-NS using EG as a solvent showed nanosheetlike morphology with the length and width are ca.100 nm (Fig. 2a,b).The measured thicknesses of these nanosheets were around 8-28 nm (Fig. S1).However, BiOCl-NP prepared using H 2 O as a solvent exhibited a thickness of a (2) few hundred nanometers (Fig. S2).The HRTEM image of BiOCl-NS clearly shows the lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.275 nm and an angle of 90 (Fig. 2c), well matched with the (110) plane of tetragonal phase BiOCl.This result confirmed the formation of BiOCl nanosheets with the exposed 001 facets in BiOCl-NS sample.Although NaBH 4 reduction destroyed part of the BiOCl-NS surface in the Bi/BiOCl-NS sample, it still maintained nanosheet-like morphology (Fig. 2d and Fig. S3).Besides, uniformly dispersed nanodots on the surface of BiOCl with less than 10 nm in diameter were evident (Fig. 2e).The HRTEM image of Bi/BiOCl-NS sample confirmed that these nanodots are Bi metal with the (012) planes of 0.328 nm (Fig. 2f), consistent with the result of XRD (Fig. 1a).The TEM images and XRD results of the as-prepared samples confirmed the formation of BiOCl nanoplates, BiOCl nanosheets, Bi/BiOCl nanoplates, and Bi/BiOCl nanosheets. To elucidate the surface chemical properties of Bi/BiOCl nanoplates and nanosheets, the chemical states of Bi/BiOCl-NS and Bi/BiOCl-NP were measured by XPS (Fig. 3).The XPS survey patterns of both samples contain the peaks of Bi, O, C, and Cl (Fig. 3a).Both samples were corrected by C 1s at 284.8 eV.As shown in Fig. 3b, two main peaks assigned to Bi 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 were observed in both samples 26,31,32.These two peaks can be further fitted into two pairs of Bi (3-x) (x 0) and Bi metal.The peaks of Bi 4f at 164.4 eV and 159.1 eV in Bi/BiOCl-NP sample were assigned to Bi 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 of Bi (3-x) (x 0), respectively.However, these two peaks shifted to lower binding energies of 164.2 eV and 158.9 eV in Bi/BiOCl-NS sample, indicating a higher electron density around the Bi element due to the appearance of defects in Bi/BiOCl-NS 11,33.In addition, another two pairs of peaks at 162.6 eV (Bi 4f 5/2 ) and 156.9 eV (Bi 4f 7/2 ) assigned to the Bi metal showed no obvious shifts, but the relative intensities increased in Bi/BiOCl-NS sample, implying a higher concentration of Bi metal on the surface of Bi/ BiOCl-NS than that of Bi/BiOCl-NP. The O 1s peaks can be fitted into two peaks in both samples (Fig. 3c).The peaks at 530.2 eV in Bi/BiOCl-NS and 529.8 eV in Bi/BiOCl-NP were assigned to the Bi-O bonds 10,32.O 1s XPS of Bi/BiOCl-NP sample showed an obvious peak at 531.6 eV assigned to the surface OH groups, which was difficult to be found in Bi/BiOCl-NS sample.The fitted peak at 532.9 eV might be assigned to the oxygen vacancies on the surface 10,34,35.Additionally, for the Bi/BiOCl-NS and Bi/BiOCl-NP, there are two main peaks at 197.7 eV and 199.5 eV belonging to Cl 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 3d) 36. The ESR spectroscopy was used to verify the presence of oxygen vacancies.The pristine BiOCl-NS showed no signal all over the range, indicating the absence of the non-solitary pair electrons in the sample.However, Bi/BiOCl-NS and Bi/ BiOCl-NP samples showed significant signals at g 2.001, which is a classic signal of oxygen vacancies (Fig. 4) 11,12,16.Interestingly, the EPR signal of Bi/BiOCl-NS arising from oxygen vacancy is much stronger than that of Bi/BiOCl-NP, indicating a significantly enhanced oxygen vacancy concentration of Bi/BiOCl-NS.The thickness of BiOCl was reported to be a key factor to control the formation of surface oxygen vacancies and photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.This phenomenon is much obvious when BiOCl exposed 001 facets due to much more oxygen atoms on 001 facets than on other facets 37.Specifically, the thinner nanosheets with exposed 001 facets would induce oxygen vacancies easier on the BiOCl surface 38.Therefore, it is reasonable that a thinner BiOCl can induce higher amount of oxygen vacancies after NaBH 4 reduction to form Bi/BiOCl enriched oxygen vacancies.Generally, a high amount of oxygen vacancies on the surface of catalysts is believed to show better activity due to their involvement in new photoexcitation processes 11,13,39. The optical absorption properties of the as-prepared samples were measured using UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra.It can be seen in Fig. 5 that the pristine BiOCl shows absorption edge at around 360 nm, indicating a band gap of 3.4 eV, which is consistent with other reports 25,26.Bi/BiOCl-NS sample showed similar absorption edge the pristine BiOCl.However, an absorption tail extended to the whole visible light range.This is attributed to the formation of oxygen vacancies, which is consistent with the results of XPS and EPR (Figs. 3c,4) 33.In Bi/BiOCl-NP, the absorption peak centered at 500 nm instead of the absorption tail was found due to the formation of Bi particles with its surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect.Based on the analysis above, Bi/BiOCl-NS enriched with oxygen vacancies was formed during the reducing process.The photocatalytic activities of CO 2 reduction over the as-prepared samples were carried out in a close system using 300-W Xe lamp as a light source with H 2 O vapor.The detected products were H 2 , CO, and CH 4 .As shown in Fig. 6, the pristine BiOCl-NP showed the lowest photocatalytic activities of all the detectable products.However, pristine BiOCl-NS sample showed enhanced photocatalytic activity, which is consistent with Ref. 12.It is noted that Bi/BiOCl-NS sample showed the highest photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.The formation amounts of CO, CH 4 and H 2 in 8 h are 38 mol/g, 3.6 mol/g, and 1.9 mol/g, respectively, which are 2.7, 5.1, and 1.4 times of pristine BiOCl-NS sample.Bi/BiOCl-NS with thinner BiOCl nanosheets showed much higher activity in all products than Bi/BiOCl-NP with thicker BiOCl nanoplates.The results also showed that Bi metal on BiOCl showed an overall enhancement of activity compared to bare BiOCl in both nanoplates and nanosheets.Higher oxygen vacancies in Bi/ BiOCl-NS showed higher formation rates of CH 4 and CO, while no obvious enhancement of H 2 .It should be noted that the enhancement of photocatalytic activity was not due to the SPR effect because the sample of Bi/BiOCl-NP with Bi SPR peak showed no activity under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm). Compared with some typical photocatalysts that were reported under similar reaction conditions, photocatalysts synthesized in this study showed moderate activity for formations of CO and CH 4 and good activity for suppressing H 2 formation (Table S1).The time for each product in Fig. 6b showed steadily increasing formation of these products during photoirradiation.The photocatalytic activities of Bi/BiOCl during the first two cycles showed a significant decrease, which might be due to the further reduction of BiOCl and/or disappearance of oxygen vacancies.However, stable photocatalytic activities were observed during the third cycle (Fig. S4). The selectivity of (CO CH 4 ) was higher than 90, whereas H 2 selectivity was less than 10 in all cases, indicating that water splitting during the reaction was heavily suppressed.CH 4 selectivity showed enhancement after Bi metal and oxygen vacancies formed on both BiOCl-NP and BiOCl-NS (Fig. S5), which indicated that Bi metal and oxygen vacancies might be beneficial for the formation of CH 4 .CH 4 selectivity was enhanced by 3 over Bi/BiOCl-NP as compared to that over bare BiOCl-NP.This enhancement was increased to 12 between BiOCl-NS and Bi/BiOCl-NS.Considering that the concentration of oxygen vacancies was much higher in Bi/BiOCl-NS, oxygen vacancy might be the important factor for CH 4 selectivity during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Five blank tests and an isotopic experiment were performed to confirm the photocatalytic process.The results revealed that BiOCl with Bi as cocatalyst in CO 2 and H 2 O atmosphere under photoirradiation can consistently achieve the significant formation of CO, which indicated that the reaction process should be a photocatalytic process (Fig. 7a).The isotopic experiments with 13 CO 2 and H 2 O showed that the 13 CO and 13 CH 4 were formed from 13 CO 2 during the photoirradiation (Fig. 7b).This further confirmed that CO 2 was photocatalytically reduced to carbon sources during the reaction. The specific surface area should show significant effect when comparing the activity between BiOCl-NP and BiOCl-NS.However, when the NaBH 4 was used to reduce both BiOCl-NP and BiOCl-NS, the enhancement of activities between Bi/BiOCl-NP and Bi/BiOCl-NS was obviously different.Bi/BiOCl-NS showed much higher enhancement than Bi/BiOCl-NP with same reduction concentration of NaBH 4 .Specifically, CO formation over Bi/BiOCl-NS was 2.7 times higher than that over BiOCl-NS.However, no obvious enhancement was found over BiOCl-NP and Bi/BiOCl-NP (Fig. 6a).Besides, CH 4 formation over Bi/BiOCl-NS was 5.5 times higher than that over BiOCl-NS.However, the enhancement was only 1.1 over BiOCl-NP and Bi/BiOCl-NP.Therefore, specific surface area should not be the main factor for the enhancement of activity. PL spectra were acquired to study the generation, transfer, and recombination of electron-hole pairs.Figure 8 shows the PL spectra of as-prepared samples with excitation at 250 nm.BiOCl-NP sample showed the highest PL intensity, indicating highest photogenerated electron-hole pairs recombination rate.Therefore, this sample showed the lowest photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Significant decrease of PL intensities of Bi/BiOCl-NP and Bi/BiOCl-NS samples implied that the in situ reduced Bi showed a significant increase in the separation rate of electron-hole pairs.It was reported in our previous works that metal Bi is a good medium for conducting electrons 40,41.When metal Bi is loaded on the surface of the BiOCl, it can effectively improve the transfer efficiency of electrons.In turn, more electrons are involved in the reduction reaction.Interestingly, BiOCl-NS showed lower PL intensity than BiOCl-NP.This means that BiOCl-NS enriched with oxygen vacancies showed a better efficiency for separation of electron-hole pairs. Photocurrent tests were performed to further study the recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers (Fig. 9).All samples showed reproducible on-off effects with the photoirradiation turned on and off.BiOCl-NP sample showed the lowest photocurrent density, whereas BiOCl-NS showed the enhanced photocurrent density.This indicated that thinner BiOCl could be beneficial for the photogenerated charge mobility, consistent with the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.It is found that Bi loading on BiOCl showed obvious enhancement of photocurrent density.Among all tested samples, the Bi/BiOCl-NS showed the highest photocurrent density of 0.87 A/cm 2 , which was about 2 times than that of pristine BiOCl-NS (0.37 A/cm 2 ) and 47 higher than that of Bi/BiOCl-NP (0.59 A/cm 2 ).Note that the trend of photocurrent density is consistent with that of the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction, implying that the separation of charge carriers plays an important role during photocatalysis. Based on the above characterization and discussion, Bi reduction from BiOCl nanosheets with enriched oxygen vacancies is believed to play a crucial role in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.NaBH 4 not only acted as a reductant to form Bi on BiOCl, but also induced the formation of oxygen vacancies.Therefore, the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction was dramatically enhanced compared to the bare BiOCl nanosheets.Bi acts as a metal to effectively enhance the separation of electrons and holes.Such effect could be further enhanced with oxygen vacancies, and therefore, Bi/BiOCl nanosheets showed much higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than Bi/BiOCl nanoplates (Scheme 1)."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The photocatalytic activities of CO 2 reduction over the as-prepared samples were carried out in a close system using 300-W Xe lamp as a light source with H 2 O vapor.", "context": "Figure 1a shows the XRD spectra of the as-synthesized BiOCl and Bi/BiOCl.Both spectra of BiOCl prepared without reduction were perfectly assigned to tetragonal phase of BiOCl (JCPDS-ICDD card No.06-0249).The diffraction peaks of Bi element (JCPDS-ICDD card No.44-1246) were observed in the samples prepared after NaBH 4 reducing.It is noted that the (001) plane assigned to BiOCl at 11.98 showed obvious decrease of relative intensity, indicating that Bi might be formed on 001 facets.No obvious peak shifts were found in the Bi/BiOCl samples reduced by NaBH 4 (Fig. 1b), indicating that Bi elements were not doped into BiOCl.

To elucidate the surface chemical properties of Bi/BiOCl nanoplates and nanosheets, the chemical states of Bi/BiOCl-NS and Bi/BiOCl-NP were measured by XPS (Fig. 3).The XPS survey patterns of both samples contain the peaks of Bi, O, C, and Cl (Fig. 3a).Both samples were corrected by C 1s at 284.8 eV.As shown in Fig. 3b, two main peaks assigned to Bi 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 were observed in both samples 26,31,32.These two peaks can be further fitted into two pairs of Bi (3-x) (x 0) and Bi metal.The peaks of Bi 4f at 164.4 eV and 159.1 eV in Bi/BiOCl-NP sample were assigned to Bi 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 of Bi (3-x) (x 0), respectively.However, these two peaks shifted to lower binding energies of 164.2 eV and 158.9 eV in Bi/BiOCl-NS sample, indicating a higher electron density around the Bi element due to the appearance of defects in Bi/BiOCl-NS 11,33.In addition, another two pairs of peaks at 162.6 eV (Bi 4f 5/2 ) and 156.9 eV (Bi 4f 7/2 ) assigned to the Bi metal showed no obvious shifts, but the relative intensities increased in Bi/BiOCl-NS sample, implying a higher concentration of Bi metal on the surface of Bi/ BiOCl-NS than that of Bi/BiOCl-NP. The O 1s peaks can be fitted into two peaks in both samples (Fig. 3c).The peaks at 530.2 eV in Bi/BiOCl-NS and 529.8 eV in Bi/BiOCl-NP were assigned to the Bi-O bonds 10,32.O 1s XPS of Bi/BiOCl-NP sample showed an obvious peak at 531.6 eV assigned to the surface OH groups, which was difficult to be found in Bi/BiOCl-NS sample.The fitted peak at 532.9 eV might be assigned to the oxygen vacancies on the surface 10,34,35.Additionally, for the Bi/BiOCl-NS and Bi/BiOCl-NP, there are two main peaks at 197.7 eV and 199.5 eV belonging to Cl 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 3d) 36. The ESR spectroscopy was used to verify the presence of oxygen vacancies.The pristine BiOCl-NS showed no signal all over the range, indicating the absence of the non-solitary pair electrons in the sample.However, Bi/BiOCl-NS and Bi/ BiOCl-NP samples showed significant signals at g 2.001, which is a classic signal of oxygen vacancies (Fig. 4) 11,12,16.Interestingly, the EPR signal of Bi/BiOCl-NS arising from oxygen vacancy is much stronger than that of Bi/BiOCl-NP, indicating a significantly enhanced oxygen vacancy concentration of Bi/BiOCl-NS.The thickness of BiOCl was reported to be a key factor to control the formation of surface oxygen vacancies and photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.This phenomenon is much obvious when BiOCl exposed 001 facets due to much more oxygen atoms on 001 facets than on other facets 37.Specifically, the thinner nanosheets with exposed 001 facets would induce oxygen vacancies easier on the BiOCl surface 38.Therefore, it is reasonable that a thinner BiOCl can induce higher amount of oxygen vacancies after NaBH 4 reduction to form Bi/BiOCl enriched oxygen vacancies.Generally, a high amount of oxygen vacancies on the surface of catalysts is believed to show better activity due to their involvement in new photoexcitation processes 11,13,39. The optical absorption properties of the as-prepared samples were measured using UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra.It can be seen in Fig. 5 that the pristine BiOCl shows absorption edge at around 360 nm, indicating a band gap of 3.4 eV, which is consistent with other reports 25,26.Bi/BiOCl-NS sample showed similar absorption edge the pristine BiOCl.However, an absorption tail extended to the whole visible light range.This is attributed to the formation of oxygen vacancies, which is consistent with the results of XPS and EPR (Figs. 3c,4) 33.In Bi/BiOCl-NP, the absorption peak centered at 500 nm instead of the absorption tail was found due to the formation of Bi particles with its surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect.Based on the analysis above, Bi/BiOCl-NS enriched with oxygen vacancies was formed during the reducing process.The photocatalytic activities of CO 2 reduction over the as-prepared samples were carried out in a close system using 300-W Xe lamp as a light source with H 2 O vapor.The detected products were H 2 , CO, and CH 4 .As shown in Fig. 6, the pristine BiOCl-NP showed the lowest photocatalytic activities of all the detectable products.However, pristine BiOCl-NS sample showed enhanced photocatalytic activity, which is consistent with Ref. 12.It is noted that Bi/BiOCl-NS sample showed the highest photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.The formation amounts of CO, CH 4 and H 2 in 8 h are 38 mol/g, 3.6 mol/g, and 1.9 mol/g, respectively, which are 2.7, 5.1, and 1.4 times of pristine BiOCl-NS sample.Bi/BiOCl-NS with thinner BiOCl nanosheets showed much higher activity in all products than Bi/BiOCl-NP with thicker BiOCl nanoplates.The results also showed that Bi metal on BiOCl showed an overall enhancement of activity compared to bare BiOCl in both nanoplates and nanosheets.Higher oxygen vacancies in Bi/ BiOCl-NS showed higher formation rates of CH 4 and CO, while no obvious enhancement of H 2 .It should be noted that the enhancement of photocatalytic activity was not due to the SPR effect because the sample of Bi/BiOCl-NP with Bi SPR peak showed no activity under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm). Compared with some typical photocatalysts that were reported under similar reaction conditions, photocatalysts synthesized in this study showed moderate activity for formations of CO and CH 4 and good activity for suppressing H 2 formation (Table S1).The time for each product in Fig. 6b showed steadily increasing formation of these products during photoirradiation.The photocatalytic activities of Bi/BiOCl during the first two cycles showed a significant decrease, which might be due to the further reduction of BiOCl and/or disappearance of oxygen vacancies.However, stable photocatalytic activities were observed during the third cycle (Fig. S4). The selectivity of (CO CH 4 ) was higher than 90, whereas H 2 selectivity was less than 10 in all cases, indicating that water splitting during the reaction was heavily suppressed.CH 4 selectivity showed enhancement after Bi metal and oxygen vacancies formed on both BiOCl-NP and BiOCl-NS (Fig. S5), which indicated that Bi metal and oxygen vacancies might be beneficial for the formation of CH 4 .CH 4 selectivity was enhanced by 3 over Bi/BiOCl-NP as compared to that over bare BiOCl-NP.This enhancement was increased to 12 between BiOCl-NS and Bi/BiOCl-NS.Considering that the concentration of oxygen vacancies was much higher in Bi/BiOCl-NS, oxygen vacancy might be the important factor for CH 4 selectivity during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Five blank tests and an isotopic experiment were performed to confirm the photocatalytic process.The results revealed that BiOCl with Bi as cocatalyst in CO 2 and H 2 O atmosphere under photoirradiation can consistently achieve the significant formation of CO, which indicated that the reaction process should be a photocatalytic process (Fig. 7a).The isotopic experiments with 13 CO 2 and H 2 O showed that the 13 CO and 13 CH 4 were formed from 13 CO 2 during the photoirradiation (Fig. 7b).This further confirmed that CO 2 was photocatalytically reduced to carbon sources during the reaction. The specific surface area should show significant effect when comparing the activity between BiOCl-NP and BiOCl-NS.However, when the NaBH 4 was used to reduce both BiOCl-NP and BiOCl-NS, the enhancement of activities between Bi/BiOCl-NP and Bi/BiOCl-NS was obviously different.Bi/BiOCl-NS showed much higher enhancement than Bi/BiOCl-NP with same reduction concentration of NaBH 4 .Specifically, CO formation over Bi/BiOCl-NS was 2.7 times higher than that over BiOCl-NS.However, no obvious enhancement was found over BiOCl-NP and Bi/BiOCl-NP (Fig. 6a).Besides, CH 4 formation over Bi/BiOCl-NS was 5.5 times higher than that over BiOCl-NS.However, the enhancement was only 1.1 over BiOCl-NP and Bi/BiOCl-NP.Therefore, specific surface area should not be the main factor for the enhancement of activity. PL spectra were acquired to study the generation, transfer, and recombination of electron-hole pairs.Figure 8 shows the PL spectra of as-prepared samples with excitation at 250 nm.BiOCl-NP sample showed the highest PL intensity, indicating highest photogenerated electron-hole pairs recombination rate.Therefore, this sample showed the lowest photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Significant decrease of PL intensities of Bi/BiOCl-NP and Bi/BiOCl-NS samples implied that the in situ reduced Bi showed a significant increase in the separation rate of electron-hole pairs.It was reported in our previous works that metal Bi is a good medium for conducting electrons 40,41.When metal Bi is loaded on the surface of the BiOCl, it can effectively improve the transfer efficiency of electrons.In turn, more electrons are involved in the reduction reaction.Interestingly, BiOCl-NS showed lower PL intensity than BiOCl-NP.This means that BiOCl-NS enriched with oxygen vacancies showed a better efficiency for separation of electron-hole pairs. Photocurrent tests were performed to further study the recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers (Fig. 9).All samples showed reproducible on-off effects with the photoirradiation turned on and off.BiOCl-NP sample showed the lowest photocurrent density, whereas BiOCl-NS showed the enhanced photocurrent density.This indicated that thinner BiOCl could be beneficial for the photogenerated charge mobility, consistent with the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.It is found that Bi loading on BiOCl showed obvious enhancement of photocurrent density.Among all tested samples, the Bi/BiOCl-NS showed the highest photocurrent density of 0.87 A/cm 2 , which was about 2 times than that of pristine BiOCl-NS (0.37 A/cm 2 ) and 47 higher than that of Bi/BiOCl-NP (0.59 A/cm 2 ).Note that the trend of photocurrent density is consistent with that of the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction, implying that the separation of charge carriers plays an important role during photocatalysis. Based on the above characterization and discussion, Bi reduction from BiOCl nanosheets with enriched oxygen vacancies is believed to play a crucial role in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.NaBH 4 not only acted as a reductant to form Bi on BiOCl, but also induced the formation of oxygen vacancies.Therefore, the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction was dramatically enhanced compared to the bare BiOCl nanosheets.Bi acts as a metal to effectively enhance the separation of electrons and holes.Such effect could be further enhanced with oxygen vacancies, and therefore, Bi/BiOCl nanosheets showed much higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than Bi/BiOCl nanoplates (Scheme 1)."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The CO 2 containing water vapor was continuously introduced into the reactor for around 15 min.", "context": "Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) was purchased from Sigma Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China.All the other reagents were purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Co., Ltd, Chengdu, China.All chemicals were used without further purification, if not specifically mentioned.Ultrapure water was used throughout the experiment.
