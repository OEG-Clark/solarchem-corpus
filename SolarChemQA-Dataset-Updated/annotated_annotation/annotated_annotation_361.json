g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system (G10).", "context": "XRD patterns were recorded in Fig. 1 to reveal the phase structure of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system (G10).For the purpose of comparison, XRD patterns of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO obtained through the same preparation method are also shown in Fig. 1.The XRD patterns of the pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibit two pronounced diffraction peaks that were found at 27.4 and 13.1 , respectively.The stronger peak at 27.4 which is attributed to the interlayer stacking of aromatic systems can be indexed to the (002) crystal plane and corresponds to an interlayer distance of 0.326 nm.The weaker (001) peak at around 13.1 with a distance of 0.675 nm can be ascribed to interlayer planar stacking motifs.These two characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are consistent with the previous results. 18,26,33The prepared pure ZnO demonstrates characteristic diffraction peaks with high intensities of the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO phase, which is the most stable and common form of ZnO under ambient conditions.The XRD pattern of the pure ZnO indicates that the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO crystals with high crystallinity can form under the synthetic conditions, which stems from the decomposition of zinc nitrate hexahydrate.For the obtained G10 sample, nearly all of the characteristic diffraction peaks of wurtzite hexagonal ZnO were clearly shown in its XRD pattern without any noticeable shis of diffraction angles (2q), conrming the existence of the ZnO phase.As for the g-C 3 N 4 phase, only the (002) peak of g-C 3 N 4 was obscurely observed whose diffraction intensity was lower compared with that of the ZnO phase.The relatively poor crystallinity of the g-C 3 N 4 phase indicates that the simultaneous crystallization of the ZnO phase interferes with the condensation process and interlayer stacking patterns of the g-C 3 N 4 phase, thus resulting in its weak diffraction intensity.The XRD patterns of both the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase in the G10 sample suggest that these two phases exist separately in the composite and no strong crystal lattice incorporation is observed between these two phases. To investigate the thermostability and measure the g-C 3 N 4 contents in G10, TGA analyses were performed on both the obtained G10 and pure samples, from ambient temperature to 900 C at a heating rate of 10 C min A1 .The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2. For the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the rapid decay of the TGA curve from around 450 C to 600 C represents the typical thermal decomposition of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating its intrinsic thermal instability in this temperature range.No signicant weight loss is observed in the TGA curve of pure ZnO, con-rming the high thermal stability of ZnO.Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the TGA curve decay of the G10 sample starts and ends at lower temperatures, respectively.This suggests that the obtained G10 sample demonstrates lower thermal stability upon heating than the pure g-C 3 N 4 , which is mainly due to the disturbance of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards interlayer stacking motifs of g-C 3 N 4 or the catalyzing effect of ZnO over g-C 3 N 4 thermal decomposition.A similar phenomenon was also observed in other cases such as g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 coupling. 44he relative content of the ZnO phase in the G10 sample is determined to be 44.6,accounting for nearly half the weight composition of G10.Considering the original mass ratio of the precursors of g-C 3 N 4 (urea) and ZnO (zinc nitrate hexahydrate) to be around 10, a signicant amount of urea is estimated to undergo direct thermal decomposition into gases during polycondensation, 45 because the holding temperature of condensation is precisely within the above measured temperature range for pure g-C 3 N 4 decomposition. XPS analyses were performed to investigate the chemical composition and elucidate the elemental chemical states of all samples.As expected, there are four major elemental states detected in the prepared G10 samples, namely C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s.Fig. 3a-d present the comparison of the high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s between G10 and pure samples, respectively.The C 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 has two obvious peaks at binding energies of 284.7 and 287.7 eV.The peak at a binding energy of 284.7 eV can be attributed to the adventitious carbon impurities, whereas the peak at 287.7 eV can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 .Two similar peaks were also observed in the spectra of G10 at binding energies of 284.5 and 287.4 eV, which shied towards the lower energy region by 0.2 and 0.3 eV, respectively.The N 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 shows two clear peaks at binding energies of 398.3 and 400.2 eV, which can be ascribed to sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen atoms involved in triazine (CN-C) units and amino groups (C-N-H), respectively.Moreover, the weak shoulder peak at 404.2 eV accounts for p-excitations.Similar strong peaks at 398.0 and 400.3 eV were also observed in the N 1s spectra of G10, indicating the existence of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.The Zn 2p spectrum of the pure ZnO demonstrates a doublet at binding energies of 1021.3 and 1044.5 eV, assigned to Zn 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 states, respectively.The corresponding peaks of Zn 2p in the G10 spectra appear at 1020.9, 1023, 1044.1 and 1047.4 eV, showing that the original doublet peak splits up into a quartet peak in total.The doublet peak at 1020.9 and 1044.1 eV is attributed to Zn atoms within the ZnO phase, while the other doublet peak at 1023 and 1047.4 eV is ascribed to Zn atoms at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.The splitting of the original doublet peak indicates the possible interfacial hybridization between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase.Furthermore, compared with pure ZnO, the O 1s states of G10 were observed to shi into the higher energy region.Considering only the interfacial Zn atoms, the binding energy of Zn 2p states of G10 also increased in contrast to pure ZnO.Since the binding energy of C 1s and N 1s states of G10 generally decreased compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 phases of G10 exhibit opposite tendency of binding energy shis relative to the pure samples.This opposite tendency suggests that the total electron density shis from the ZnO phase to the g-C 3 N 4 phase and thus causes the formation of N-Zn-O covalent bonds between two phases, mainly due to the backbonding ability of the fully occupied Zn 3d orbitals and the electron dispersive capacity of C-N p-p conjugated structures.The formation of interfacial covalent bonds indicates the intimate contact between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which is also benecial for the formation of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary composite photocatalytic system, thus facilitating the transfer and separation of charge carriers and further promoting the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. 404 Microstructure observation SEM and TEM images were further used to investigate the microstructure and morphology of all the prepared samples.Fig. 4a presents the typical large ZnO microcrystals obtained under the above mentioned synthetic conditions whose sizes have reached tens of micrometers.These microcrystals generally demonstrate well-dened crystal facets, corresponding to their high crystallinity reected by XRD patterns.Fig. 4b andc show the representative highly porous structure of pure g-C 3 N 4 derived from urea, formed by considerable gas release during thermal condensation.45 Fig. 4d and e display the morphology of the obtained G10 sample, which has much more compact structures compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 .Such elimination of high porosity and the transformation into more compact structures are mainly due to the imbedded crystallization process of the ZnO phase within the original pores of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.This results in the formation of an intimate contact interface between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which enhances the charge transfer and separation between the two phases.Fig. 4f presents the HRTEM image of the interface between the two phases.The ZnO phase exists as relatively small nanoparticles surrounded by the g-C 3 N 4 phase, conrming the existence of the interfacial contact proposed above.The denoted lattice fringes with a d spacing of 0.26 nm can be assigned to the (002) crystal plane of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO.46 In order to further conrm the above interfacial contact, the EDX mapping of the prepared G10 sample was performed to investigate the distribution patterns of the component elements.As seen from Fig. 5, all of the four major elements (C, N, Zn, and O) were uniformly distributed in the G10 sample.Combined with previous discussion, the homogenous distribution of the component elements also suggests that the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase within G10 are indeed fully mixed and intimately contacted, rather than existing as separate aggregates in the G10 sample. The specic surface area and porous structure of all the asprepared samples were investigated by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms.The calculated parameters of their physical properties including specic surface area, pore volume and pore diameter are displayed in Table 1.As seen from Table 1, the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ) has a greater specic surface area than the obtained G10 sample (12.8 m 2 g A1 ), which is due to the addition of the ZnO phase.The rather low specic surface area of pure ZnO can be ascribed to the formation of rather large ZnO microcrystals with high crystallinity under the above synthetic conditions, which can be conrmed by direct SEM observation presented in Fig. 4a.isotherms of both G10 and g-C 3 N 4 belong to type IV, indicating the existence of mesopores (2-50 nm). 18Further observations reveal that the adsorption-desorption isotherm of g-C 3 N 4 generally shis upward relative to G10 in the whole relative pressure range, suggesting a higher specic surface area and larger pore volume of pure g-C 3 N 4 .Comparison of pore size distributions also conrms that G10 has less mesopores and smaller pore volumes in contrast to pure g-C 3 N 4 .Also, the results presented in Table 1 calculated by the BJH method show that pure g-C 3 N 4 has a larger pore volume and larger pore diameter than G10.The isotherms and pore size distributions in Fig. 6 are both consistent with the calculated results shown in Table 1.Moreover, the shapes of hysteresis loops of pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 reect that both can be attributed to the type H3, indicating the presence of silt-like pores generated by particle aggregation.Based on the deduction that the crystallization of ZnO and the thermal condensation of g-C 3 N 4 occur simultaneously to form separate phases, the drastic decline of the specic surface area and pore volume of G10 implies that the crystallization of ZnO can ll up the original silt-like pores within the g-C 3 N 4 phase, which can further lead to a high degree of interfacial contact between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase. The electronic structures of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and the G10 sample were evaluated by UV-vis diffuse reectance spectroscopy.As seen in Fig. 7, for pure g-C 3 N 4 , a sharp increase of light absorption occurs at wavelengths shorter than 450 nm, which can be attributed to the intrinsic band gap of g-C 3 N 4 .As denoted by the dashed line, the absorption edge of g-C 3 N 4 at about 450 nm corresponds to a typical band gap of 2.7 eV, which is consistent with the values reported in other literature studies. 26ompared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the as-prepared G10 sample exhibits stronger light absorption in both ultraviolet and visible light regions.The increased absorption of ultraviolet light can be attributed to the existence of the ZnO phase in the sample.The enhancement of visible light absorption can stem from more defect states in the g-C 3 N 4 phase that are introduced by the interference of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards g-C 3 N 4 condensation.Such extended absorption of visible light originated from the effect of introduced defect states is also observed in other reports. 33In general, the G10 sample has stronger absorption in the whole spectrum and can absorb more solar energy for photocatalytic reactions.Thus, it is not surprising that G10 has better sunlight utilization and higher photocatalytic activity than the pure g-C 3 N 4 . FT-IR spectra of the synthesized G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples are demonstrated in Fig. 8.The pure g-C 3 N 4 presents similar features with the previous reports. 18The peaks at 1632 and 1566 cm A1 can be attributed to the C-N stretching vibration modes, while the peaks at 1423, 1323 and 1254 cm A1 belong to aromatic C-N stretching.The representative peak at 810 cm A1 can be ascribed to the characteristic out-of-plane bending modes of triazine units, corresponding to the condensed C-N heterocycles.The broad absorption band at around 3400 cm A1 corresponds to the adsorbed H 2 O molecules and N-H vibrations of the uncondensed amine groups.The general resemblance of FT-IR spectra between the as-prepared G10 sample and the pure g-C 3 N 4 conrms the preserved graphitic nature of the carbon nitride phase in the G10 sample.Compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic peaks of the stretching modes of C-N heterocycles in the range from 1250 to 1650 cm A1 were observed to merge into a broad absorption band in the G10 sample, indicating the inuence of previously mentioned ZnO crystallization.A similar phenomenon of peak mergence was also reported in other literature studies. 47,48The appearance of new peaks at 2183 and 2056 cm A1 indicates the existence of dangling cyanide groups that should serve as intermediates during the polymerization of urea. 49The relative red-shis of cyanide groups compared with the normal wavenumber of 2250 cm A1 are due to the conjugation effect of the extended C-N aromatic system.The emergence of cyanide groups in G10 suggests that the simultaneous ZnO crystallization could interfere with the thermal polymerization of urea to generate a Fig. 6 Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of pure g-C 3 N 4 (black) and G10 (red). Fig. 7 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). well-dened g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion of XRD patterns, TGA curves and UV-vis spectra, such interference of ZnO crystallization can result in relatively poor crystallinity and give rise to more defect states within the g-C 3 N 4 phase. The photocatalytic activity of various samples for CO 2 reduction was evaluated under simulated solar irradiation in the anaerobic environment.Control experiments were performed in the absence of either light illumination or photocatalysts and no appreciable amounts of any hydrocarbon products were found, conrming that light irradiation and photocatalysts are the two essential factors for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions.In this work, the gaseous CO 2 introduced by the in situ reaction between sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloride aqueous solution serves as the only carbon source and the water vapor can also be generated by the reaction.The nal products of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 detected by gas chromatography (GC) are shown in Fig. 9.As seen in Fig. 9, CH 3 OH was the only product detected by the GC FID method for both the G10 sample and pure g-C 3 N 4 .Typically, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex multielectron transfer process, which has the potential to give rise to more than one reduced species including CH 4 , CH 3 OH, HCOOH and HCHO.However, no products other than CH 3 OH were observed for all the as-prepared samples, indicating that both the synthesized pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 samples exhibit good reaction selectivity to convert CO 2 directly into CH 3 OH under solar irradiation.Although the underlying mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction still remains ambiguous until now, there are three possible reasons regarding why CH 3 OH was the only product detected in our experiments: (1) as mentioned above, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction took place at the solid-gas interface and the products were determined by the extracted gas samples under our experimental conditions.If HCOOH and HCHO were indeed produced upon light irradiation, they were more likely to adsorb on the surfaces of samples than CH 3 OH, due to the stronger polarity of HCOOH and HCHO.Thus, only CH 3 OH could easily desorb into the gas phase aer the reaction and then be detected by the GC FID method; (2) as is well known, HCOOH and HCHO are relatively unstable molecules compared with CH 3 OH, which can be readily re-oxidized into CO 2 by the oxygen gas generated during the reaction process; (3) comparatively speaking, the production of CH 4 from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction requires more electrons (8e A ) and protons (8H ) in contrast to CH 3 OH (6e A and 6H ).In this regard, the specic reaction routes and the nal products can be closely associated with the intrinsic properties of the photocatalysts.It is worth mentioning that such good conversion selectivity of g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into CH 3 OH rather than CH 4 was also conrmed by results from other groups. 50,51As is well known, CH 3 OH is one of the most desirable value-added fuels that are easy to store and utilize, while the good selectivity of CH 3 OH generation can also effectively facilitate the subsequent product separation process. The specic CH 3 OH production rates of various samples were calculated from the GC spectra based on the integral area between each peak and baseline.Fig. 10 presents the comparison of CH 3 OH production rates of the commercial ZnO, the prepared pure ZnO, G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples.The CH 3 OH production rate of the obtained pure ZnO (0.37 mmol h A1 g A1 ) is comparable to that of the commercial ZnO (0.32 mmol h A1 g A1 ), showing the considerable photocatalytic activity of single-phase ZnO by utilizing UV light.Despite the high specic surface area and the large pore volume of g-C 3 N 4 , its CH 3 OH production rate (0.26 mmol h A1 g A1 ) still remains relatively low, mainly due to the high recombination rates of photogenerated electrons and holes.However, compared with both the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO, the obtained G10 sample exhibits the highest CH 3 OH production rate (0.6 mmol h A1 g A1 ).On the basis of the results in Table 1, the specic surface area of G10 (12.8 m 2 g A1 ) is drastically reduced in contrast to the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ), possibly because of the intercalated ZnO crystallization within the original pores in the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Although the specic surface area is critical for heterogenous catalysis, the higher production rate of the G10 sample with a lower specic surface area suggests highly efficient charge carrier separation occurring at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Combined with the previous analyses of surface area and microstructure observation, the Fig. 8 FT-IR spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). Fig. 9 GC spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). intimate interfacial contact between the two phases is benecial for the separation of excited charge carriers, the inhibition of unfavorable recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the further promotion of the photocatalytic activity.In this regard, by coupling ZnO with g-C 3 N 4 via a facile approach, we achieved an enhanced photocatalytic reduction rate of CO 2 into CH 3 OH for pure g-C 3 N 4 by a factor of 2.3, while preserving the original reaction selectivity to directly convert CO 2 into CH 3 OH. In general, there are two possible mechanisms accounting for the photocatalytic activity enhancement induced by spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers in binary photocatalytic systems: (1) conventional heterojunction-type and (2) direct Z-scheme type. 52In order to facilitate analyses, schematic comparison regarding band edge positions of g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO together with the standard potentials of relevant redox couples is presented in Fig. 11.As seen in Fig. 11, the energy potentials of conduction bands (CB) of g-C 3 N 4 (A1.12V vs. NHE) and ZnO (A0.2 V vs. NHE) are both more negative than the standard potential of the CO 2 /CH 3 OH redox couple (0.03 V vs. NHE), while the energy potentials of valence bands (VB) of g-C 3 N 4 (1.57V vs. NHE) and ZnO (3.0 V vs. NHE) are both more positive than the standard potential of the O 2 /H 2 O redox couple (1.23 V vs. NHE).In this regard, both the above two mechanisms can be possible in explaining the enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary photocatalytic system.Schematic diagrams illustrating the detailed processes of the above two possible mechanisms in the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system are demonstrated in Fig. 12.In the heterojunction-type photocatalytic system presented in Fig. 12a, the excited electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 with higher energy potentials to the CB of ZnO with lower energy potentials, resulting in the decrease of electron reducibility.Thus, in this case, it should be the electrons from the CB of ZnO reducing CO 2 into CH 3 OH.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes transfer from the VB of ZnO to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , which also results in the decrease of hole oxidizability.The other type is the direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system shown in Fig. 12b.Upon simultaneous light excitation, both g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO phases can generate excited electron-hole pairs.The excited electrons from the CB of ZnO with lower energy can transfer to combine with the photogenerated holes in g-C 3 N 4 , thus preserving the electrons with stronger reducibility in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and holes with stronger oxidizability in the VB of ZnO.Finally, the electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 can react with CO 2 and produce CH 3 OH.In this regard, it should be noted that the interfacial electron transfer actually occurs in opposite directions for the heterojunction-type (g-C 3 N 4 to ZnO) and direct Z-scheme type (ZnO to g-C 3 N 4 ) photocatalytic systems. 16n order to provide clues to understand the underlying mechanism responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G10, the photoluminescence (PL) analyses of the hydroxyl radicals (OH) produced on the surfaces of pure g-C 3 N 4 , G10 and pure ZnO upon light irradiation were rst carried out by using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule.The spectral changes of the G10 sample against irradiation time and the comparison of the PL peak intensity around 423 nm of the G10, pure ZnO and pure g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 13a andb, respectively.As shown in Fig. 13b ) can be produced, thus resulting in the subsequent absence of PL signals.However, if the G10 sample conforms to a direct Z-scheme mechanism (see Fig. 12b), the photogenerated electrons and holes will be respectively preserved in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and the VB of ZnO, maintaining enough reducibility and oxidizability to produce superoxide anion radicals (O 2 A ) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) respectively. The experimental measurement of hydroxyl radicals (OH) also showed that the PL signals of the G10 sample increased almost linearly with irradiation time, whose intensity is more comparable to that of pure ZnO.The presence of PL signals of the G10 samples conrmed that the hydroxyl radicals (OH) were indeed produced on the surface of G10 upon light illumination either in the direct or indirect pathway. 53On the basis of the above PL analyses, the binary g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO composite photocatalytic system is more likely to follow a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism, rather than the conventional heterojunction-type photocatalytic mechanism. To further investigate the specic mechanism accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the G10 sample, the transient photocurrent responses of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 were recorded by using typical switch on-off cycles of light irradiation.In this work, we adopted two light sources with different wavelengths (365 and 420 nm) to carry out the photocurrent measurements to probe the excitation, transfer, separation and recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.Typically, the value of photocurrent density corresponds to the charge collection efficiency and a higher value of the photocurrent response generally means higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.Fig. 14 shows the comparison of photocurrent-time (I-t) curves of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 upon switch on-off cycles of intermittent light irradiation with two different wavelengths.Interestingly, the pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 exhibit different photocurrent performances on the two occasions.For light illumination at a wavelength of 420 nm shown in Fig. 14a, the pure g-C 3 N 4 demonstrates a higher photocurrent density than G10.Because of the large band gap of ZnO (3.2 eV), only the g-C 3 N 4 phase can be effectively excited under this condition.The lower value of photocurrent of G10 can be mainly due to the limited amount of g-C 3 N 4 phase.In contrast, light irradiation at a wavelength of 365 nm on G10 shows drastically increased photocurrent density that is 7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 , as seen in Fig. 14b.On this occasion, the electrons of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 can be excited and contribute to the increase of photocurrent density.But considering the limited amount of ZnO and the overall enhancement of photocatalytic performances, it is highly possible that the excited electrons in the CB of the ZnO phase are critical to the efficient separation of charge carriers within g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion, such a high photocurrent of G10 is achieved via ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 electron transfer to quench the photogenerated holes and extend the lifetime of exited electrons within the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Thus, based on the comparison of the above two situations, the photocurrent measurements further conrmed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity for selective CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH of G10 can be attributed to a direct Z-scheme mechanism.Furthermore, since ZnO and TiO 2 have similar band gaps and band edge positions, the previous construction of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composite photocatalyst reported recently also provides strong support to the above explanation. 44n order to further conrm the direct Z-scheme mechanism proposed above, the electronic band structures of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were obtained using theoretical DFT calculation under the same conditions.The constructed crystal structures and the calculated electronic band structures of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 15 and 16, respectively.On the basis of the obtained band structures, the effective masses of photogenerated electrons and holes of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were calculated by parabolic tting to the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) based on eqn (1), respectively.Basically, the effective mass of a charge carrier is inversely proportional to its moving velocity according to the following eqn (2), where n and m represent the transfer rate and effective mass of a charge carrier, respectively.Thus, a smaller value of charge carrier effective mass corresponds to a faster transfer rate. 545556 m 14 2 (d 2 E/dk 2 ) A1 (1) In order to characterize the charge separation efficiency, we also adopted the concept of relative effective mass of photogenerated holes to electrons according to eqn (3).This concept was also used by other researchers to rationalize the reactivity of photocatalysts based on electronic band structures. 57In general, a higher D value means that the photogenerated electron-hole pairs will have a higher tendency to separate, thus resulting in slower recombination rates and better photocatalytic performance. The obtained results of charge carrier effective mass in both G-Z and G-F directions are shown in Table 2.As seen from Table 2, both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 generally belong to the intrinsic n-type semiconductors with light electrons and heavy holes.However, it should be noted that the D values of ZnO are much higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 in both G-Z and G-F directions, indicating ZnO possesses higher charge separation efficiency than g-C 3 N 4 .Consistent with literature reports, 34,35 the relatively low D values of g-C 3 N 4 in both directions correspond to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Moreover, the calculated electron effective mass (m e ) in the G-Z direction of ZnO (0.034) is far lighter than that of g-C 3 N 4 (3.9),suggesting that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-Z direction exhibit much faster moving rates and higher tendency to transfer than those of g-C 3 N 4 at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Although the absolute value of m e in the G-F direction of ZnO (0.9) is comparable to that of g-C 3 N 4 (0.41), the much higher D value of ZnO (11.5) than g-C 3 N 4 (1.6) still demonstrates that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-F direction have higher probability to transfer rather than to recombine compared with those of g-C 3 N 4 .In this regard, both the lighter photogenerated electrons and the higher charge separation efficiency of ZnO in contrast to g-C 3 N 4 indicate that the electron transfer at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface is more likely to occur in the ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 rather than the g-C 3 N 4 -to-ZnO direction.Thus, the comparison of theoretical effective mass calculations between ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 also strongly supports the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism proposed above."}, {"llm generation": "pure g-C 3 N 4", "source": "For the purpose of comparison, XRD patterns of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO obtained through the same preparation method are also shown in Fig. 1.", "context": "XRD patterns were recorded in Fig. 1 to reveal the phase structure of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system (G10).For the purpose of comparison, XRD patterns of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO obtained through the same preparation method are also shown in Fig. 1.The XRD patterns of the pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibit two pronounced diffraction peaks that were found at 27.4 and 13.1 , respectively.The stronger peak at 27.4 which is attributed to the interlayer stacking of aromatic systems can be indexed to the (002) crystal plane and corresponds to an interlayer distance of 0.326 nm.The weaker (001) peak at around 13.1 with a distance of 0.675 nm can be ascribed to interlayer planar stacking motifs.These two characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are consistent with the previous results. 18,26,33The prepared pure ZnO demonstrates characteristic diffraction peaks with high intensities of the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO phase, which is the most stable and common form of ZnO under ambient conditions.The XRD pattern of the pure ZnO indicates that the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO crystals with high crystallinity can form under the synthetic conditions, which stems from the decomposition of zinc nitrate hexahydrate.For the obtained G10 sample, nearly all of the characteristic diffraction peaks of wurtzite hexagonal ZnO were clearly shown in its XRD pattern without any noticeable shis of diffraction angles (2q), conrming the existence of the ZnO phase.As for the g-C 3 N 4 phase, only the (002) peak of g-C 3 N 4 was obscurely observed whose diffraction intensity was lower compared with that of the ZnO phase.The relatively poor crystallinity of the g-C 3 N 4 phase indicates that the simultaneous crystallization of the ZnO phase interferes with the condensation process and interlayer stacking patterns of the g-C 3 N 4 phase, thus resulting in its weak diffraction intensity.The XRD patterns of both the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase in the G10 sample suggest that these two phases exist separately in the composite and no strong crystal lattice incorporation is observed between these two phases. To investigate the thermostability and measure the g-C 3 N 4 contents in G10, TGA analyses were performed on both the obtained G10 and pure samples, from ambient temperature to 900 C at a heating rate of 10 C min A1 .The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2. For the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the rapid decay of the TGA curve from around 450 C to 600 C represents the typical thermal decomposition of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating its intrinsic thermal instability in this temperature range.No signicant weight loss is observed in the TGA curve of pure ZnO, con-rming the high thermal stability of ZnO.Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the TGA curve decay of the G10 sample starts and ends at lower temperatures, respectively.This suggests that the obtained G10 sample demonstrates lower thermal stability upon heating than the pure g-C 3 N 4 , which is mainly due to the disturbance of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards interlayer stacking motifs of g-C 3 N 4 or the catalyzing effect of ZnO over g-C 3 N 4 thermal decomposition.A similar phenomenon was also observed in other cases such as g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 coupling. 44he relative content of the ZnO phase in the G10 sample is determined to be 44.6,accounting for nearly half the weight composition of G10.Considering the original mass ratio of the precursors of g-C 3 N 4 (urea) and ZnO (zinc nitrate hexahydrate) to be around 10, a signicant amount of urea is estimated to undergo direct thermal decomposition into gases during polycondensation, 45 because the holding temperature of condensation is precisely within the above measured temperature range for pure g-C 3 N 4 decomposition. XPS analyses were performed to investigate the chemical composition and elucidate the elemental chemical states of all samples.As expected, there are four major elemental states detected in the prepared G10 samples, namely C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s.Fig. 3a-d present the comparison of the high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s between G10 and pure samples, respectively.The C 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 has two obvious peaks at binding energies of 284.7 and 287.7 eV.The peak at a binding energy of 284.7 eV can be attributed to the adventitious carbon impurities, whereas the peak at 287.7 eV can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 .Two similar peaks were also observed in the spectra of G10 at binding energies of 284.5 and 287.4 eV, which shied towards the lower energy region by 0.2 and 0.3 eV, respectively.The N 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 shows two clear peaks at binding energies of 398.3 and 400.2 eV, which can be ascribed to sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen atoms involved in triazine (CN-C) units and amino groups (C-N-H), respectively.Moreover, the weak shoulder peak at 404.2 eV accounts for p-excitations.Similar strong peaks at 398.0 and 400.3 eV were also observed in the N 1s spectra of G10, indicating the existence of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.The Zn 2p spectrum of the pure ZnO demonstrates a doublet at binding energies of 1021.3 and 1044.5 eV, assigned to Zn 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 states, respectively.The corresponding peaks of Zn 2p in the G10 spectra appear at 1020.9, 1023, 1044.1 and 1047.4 eV, showing that the original doublet peak splits up into a quartet peak in total.The doublet peak at 1020.9 and 1044.1 eV is attributed to Zn atoms within the ZnO phase, while the other doublet peak at 1023 and 1047.4 eV is ascribed to Zn atoms at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.The splitting of the original doublet peak indicates the possible interfacial hybridization between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase.Furthermore, compared with pure ZnO, the O 1s states of G10 were observed to shi into the higher energy region.Considering only the interfacial Zn atoms, the binding energy of Zn 2p states of G10 also increased in contrast to pure ZnO.Since the binding energy of C 1s and N 1s states of G10 generally decreased compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 phases of G10 exhibit opposite tendency of binding energy shis relative to the pure samples.This opposite tendency suggests that the total electron density shis from the ZnO phase to the g-C 3 N 4 phase and thus causes the formation of N-Zn-O covalent bonds between two phases, mainly due to the backbonding ability of the fully occupied Zn 3d orbitals and the electron dispersive capacity of C-N p-p conjugated structures.The formation of interfacial covalent bonds indicates the intimate contact between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which is also benecial for the formation of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary composite photocatalytic system, thus facilitating the transfer and separation of charge carriers and further promoting the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. 404 Microstructure observation SEM and TEM images were further used to investigate the microstructure and morphology of all the prepared samples.Fig. 4a presents the typical large ZnO microcrystals obtained under the above mentioned synthetic conditions whose sizes have reached tens of micrometers.These microcrystals generally demonstrate well-dened crystal facets, corresponding to their high crystallinity reected by XRD patterns.Fig. 4b andc show the representative highly porous structure of pure g-C 3 N 4 derived from urea, formed by considerable gas release during thermal condensation.45 Fig. 4d and e display the morphology of the obtained G10 sample, which has much more compact structures compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 .Such elimination of high porosity and the transformation into more compact structures are mainly due to the imbedded crystallization process of the ZnO phase within the original pores of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.This results in the formation of an intimate contact interface between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which enhances the charge transfer and separation between the two phases.Fig. 4f presents the HRTEM image of the interface between the two phases.The ZnO phase exists as relatively small nanoparticles surrounded by the g-C 3 N 4 phase, conrming the existence of the interfacial contact proposed above.The denoted lattice fringes with a d spacing of 0.26 nm can be assigned to the (002) crystal plane of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO.46 In order to further conrm the above interfacial contact, the EDX mapping of the prepared G10 sample was performed to investigate the distribution patterns of the component elements.As seen from Fig. 5, all of the four major elements (C, N, Zn, and O) were uniformly distributed in the G10 sample.Combined with previous discussion, the homogenous distribution of the component elements also suggests that the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase within G10 are indeed fully mixed and intimately contacted, rather than existing as separate aggregates in the G10 sample. The specic surface area and porous structure of all the asprepared samples were investigated by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms.The calculated parameters of their physical properties including specic surface area, pore volume and pore diameter are displayed in Table 1.As seen from Table 1, the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ) has a greater specic surface area than the obtained G10 sample (12.8 m 2 g A1 ), which is due to the addition of the ZnO phase.The rather low specic surface area of pure ZnO can be ascribed to the formation of rather large ZnO microcrystals with high crystallinity under the above synthetic conditions, which can be conrmed by direct SEM observation presented in Fig. 4a.isotherms of both G10 and g-C 3 N 4 belong to type IV, indicating the existence of mesopores (2-50 nm). 18Further observations reveal that the adsorption-desorption isotherm of g-C 3 N 4 generally shis upward relative to G10 in the whole relative pressure range, suggesting a higher specic surface area and larger pore volume of pure g-C 3 N 4 .Comparison of pore size distributions also conrms that G10 has less mesopores and smaller pore volumes in contrast to pure g-C 3 N 4 .Also, the results presented in Table 1 calculated by the BJH method show that pure g-C 3 N 4 has a larger pore volume and larger pore diameter than G10.The isotherms and pore size distributions in Fig. 6 are both consistent with the calculated results shown in Table 1.Moreover, the shapes of hysteresis loops of pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 reect that both can be attributed to the type H3, indicating the presence of silt-like pores generated by particle aggregation.Based on the deduction that the crystallization of ZnO and the thermal condensation of g-C 3 N 4 occur simultaneously to form separate phases, the drastic decline of the specic surface area and pore volume of G10 implies that the crystallization of ZnO can ll up the original silt-like pores within the g-C 3 N 4 phase, which can further lead to a high degree of interfacial contact between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase. The electronic structures of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and the G10 sample were evaluated by UV-vis diffuse reectance spectroscopy.As seen in Fig. 7, for pure g-C 3 N 4 , a sharp increase of light absorption occurs at wavelengths shorter than 450 nm, which can be attributed to the intrinsic band gap of g-C 3 N 4 .As denoted by the dashed line, the absorption edge of g-C 3 N 4 at about 450 nm corresponds to a typical band gap of 2.7 eV, which is consistent with the values reported in other literature studies. 26ompared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the as-prepared G10 sample exhibits stronger light absorption in both ultraviolet and visible light regions.The increased absorption of ultraviolet light can be attributed to the existence of the ZnO phase in the sample.The enhancement of visible light absorption can stem from more defect states in the g-C 3 N 4 phase that are introduced by the interference of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards g-C 3 N 4 condensation.Such extended absorption of visible light originated from the effect of introduced defect states is also observed in other reports. 33In general, the G10 sample has stronger absorption in the whole spectrum and can absorb more solar energy for photocatalytic reactions.Thus, it is not surprising that G10 has better sunlight utilization and higher photocatalytic activity than the pure g-C 3 N 4 . FT-IR spectra of the synthesized G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples are demonstrated in Fig. 8.The pure g-C 3 N 4 presents similar features with the previous reports. 18The peaks at 1632 and 1566 cm A1 can be attributed to the C-N stretching vibration modes, while the peaks at 1423, 1323 and 1254 cm A1 belong to aromatic C-N stretching.The representative peak at 810 cm A1 can be ascribed to the characteristic out-of-plane bending modes of triazine units, corresponding to the condensed C-N heterocycles.The broad absorption band at around 3400 cm A1 corresponds to the adsorbed H 2 O molecules and N-H vibrations of the uncondensed amine groups.The general resemblance of FT-IR spectra between the as-prepared G10 sample and the pure g-C 3 N 4 conrms the preserved graphitic nature of the carbon nitride phase in the G10 sample.Compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic peaks of the stretching modes of C-N heterocycles in the range from 1250 to 1650 cm A1 were observed to merge into a broad absorption band in the G10 sample, indicating the inuence of previously mentioned ZnO crystallization.A similar phenomenon of peak mergence was also reported in other literature studies. 47,48The appearance of new peaks at 2183 and 2056 cm A1 indicates the existence of dangling cyanide groups that should serve as intermediates during the polymerization of urea. 49The relative red-shis of cyanide groups compared with the normal wavenumber of 2250 cm A1 are due to the conjugation effect of the extended C-N aromatic system.The emergence of cyanide groups in G10 suggests that the simultaneous ZnO crystallization could interfere with the thermal polymerization of urea to generate a Fig. 6 Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of pure g-C 3 N 4 (black) and G10 (red). Fig. 7 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). well-dened g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion of XRD patterns, TGA curves and UV-vis spectra, such interference of ZnO crystallization can result in relatively poor crystallinity and give rise to more defect states within the g-C 3 N 4 phase. The photocatalytic activity of various samples for CO 2 reduction was evaluated under simulated solar irradiation in the anaerobic environment.Control experiments were performed in the absence of either light illumination or photocatalysts and no appreciable amounts of any hydrocarbon products were found, conrming that light irradiation and photocatalysts are the two essential factors for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions.In this work, the gaseous CO 2 introduced by the in situ reaction between sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloride aqueous solution serves as the only carbon source and the water vapor can also be generated by the reaction.The nal products of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 detected by gas chromatography (GC) are shown in Fig. 9.As seen in Fig. 9, CH 3 OH was the only product detected by the GC FID method for both the G10 sample and pure g-C 3 N 4 .Typically, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex multielectron transfer process, which has the potential to give rise to more than one reduced species including CH 4 , CH 3 OH, HCOOH and HCHO.However, no products other than CH 3 OH were observed for all the as-prepared samples, indicating that both the synthesized pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 samples exhibit good reaction selectivity to convert CO 2 directly into CH 3 OH under solar irradiation.Although the underlying mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction still remains ambiguous until now, there are three possible reasons regarding why CH 3 OH was the only product detected in our experiments: (1) as mentioned above, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction took place at the solid-gas interface and the products were determined by the extracted gas samples under our experimental conditions.If HCOOH and HCHO were indeed produced upon light irradiation, they were more likely to adsorb on the surfaces of samples than CH 3 OH, due to the stronger polarity of HCOOH and HCHO.Thus, only CH 3 OH could easily desorb into the gas phase aer the reaction and then be detected by the GC FID method; (2) as is well known, HCOOH and HCHO are relatively unstable molecules compared with CH 3 OH, which can be readily re-oxidized into CO 2 by the oxygen gas generated during the reaction process; (3) comparatively speaking, the production of CH 4 from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction requires more electrons (8e A ) and protons (8H ) in contrast to CH 3 OH (6e A and 6H ).In this regard, the specic reaction routes and the nal products can be closely associated with the intrinsic properties of the photocatalysts.It is worth mentioning that such good conversion selectivity of g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into CH 3 OH rather than CH 4 was also conrmed by results from other groups. 50,51As is well known, CH 3 OH is one of the most desirable value-added fuels that are easy to store and utilize, while the good selectivity of CH 3 OH generation can also effectively facilitate the subsequent product separation process. The specic CH 3 OH production rates of various samples were calculated from the GC spectra based on the integral area between each peak and baseline.Fig. 10 presents the comparison of CH 3 OH production rates of the commercial ZnO, the prepared pure ZnO, G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples.The CH 3 OH production rate of the obtained pure ZnO (0.37 mmol h A1 g A1 ) is comparable to that of the commercial ZnO (0.32 mmol h A1 g A1 ), showing the considerable photocatalytic activity of single-phase ZnO by utilizing UV light.Despite the high specic surface area and the large pore volume of g-C 3 N 4 , its CH 3 OH production rate (0.26 mmol h A1 g A1 ) still remains relatively low, mainly due to the high recombination rates of photogenerated electrons and holes.However, compared with both the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO, the obtained G10 sample exhibits the highest CH 3 OH production rate (0.6 mmol h A1 g A1 ).On the basis of the results in Table 1, the specic surface area of G10 (12.8 m 2 g A1 ) is drastically reduced in contrast to the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ), possibly because of the intercalated ZnO crystallization within the original pores in the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Although the specic surface area is critical for heterogenous catalysis, the higher production rate of the G10 sample with a lower specic surface area suggests highly efficient charge carrier separation occurring at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Combined with the previous analyses of surface area and microstructure observation, the Fig. 8 FT-IR spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). Fig. 9 GC spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). intimate interfacial contact between the two phases is benecial for the separation of excited charge carriers, the inhibition of unfavorable recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the further promotion of the photocatalytic activity.In this regard, by coupling ZnO with g-C 3 N 4 via a facile approach, we achieved an enhanced photocatalytic reduction rate of CO 2 into CH 3 OH for pure g-C 3 N 4 by a factor of 2.3, while preserving the original reaction selectivity to directly convert CO 2 into CH 3 OH. In general, there are two possible mechanisms accounting for the photocatalytic activity enhancement induced by spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers in binary photocatalytic systems: (1) conventional heterojunction-type and (2) direct Z-scheme type. 52In order to facilitate analyses, schematic comparison regarding band edge positions of g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO together with the standard potentials of relevant redox couples is presented in Fig. 11.As seen in Fig. 11, the energy potentials of conduction bands (CB) of g-C 3 N 4 (A1.12V vs. NHE) and ZnO (A0.2 V vs. NHE) are both more negative than the standard potential of the CO 2 /CH 3 OH redox couple (0.03 V vs. NHE), while the energy potentials of valence bands (VB) of g-C 3 N 4 (1.57V vs. NHE) and ZnO (3.0 V vs. NHE) are both more positive than the standard potential of the O 2 /H 2 O redox couple (1.23 V vs. NHE).In this regard, both the above two mechanisms can be possible in explaining the enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary photocatalytic system.Schematic diagrams illustrating the detailed processes of the above two possible mechanisms in the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system are demonstrated in Fig. 12.In the heterojunction-type photocatalytic system presented in Fig. 12a, the excited electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 with higher energy potentials to the CB of ZnO with lower energy potentials, resulting in the decrease of electron reducibility.Thus, in this case, it should be the electrons from the CB of ZnO reducing CO 2 into CH 3 OH.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes transfer from the VB of ZnO to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , which also results in the decrease of hole oxidizability.The other type is the direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system shown in Fig. 12b.Upon simultaneous light excitation, both g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO phases can generate excited electron-hole pairs.The excited electrons from the CB of ZnO with lower energy can transfer to combine with the photogenerated holes in g-C 3 N 4 , thus preserving the electrons with stronger reducibility in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and holes with stronger oxidizability in the VB of ZnO.Finally, the electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 can react with CO 2 and produce CH 3 OH.In this regard, it should be noted that the interfacial electron transfer actually occurs in opposite directions for the heterojunction-type (g-C 3 N 4 to ZnO) and direct Z-scheme type (ZnO to g-C 3 N 4 ) photocatalytic systems. 16n order to provide clues to understand the underlying mechanism responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G10, the photoluminescence (PL) analyses of the hydroxyl radicals (OH) produced on the surfaces of pure g-C 3 N 4 , G10 and pure ZnO upon light irradiation were rst carried out by using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule.The spectral changes of the G10 sample against irradiation time and the comparison of the PL peak intensity around 423 nm of the G10, pure ZnO and pure g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 13a andb, respectively.As shown in Fig. 13b ) can be produced, thus resulting in the subsequent absence of PL signals.However, if the G10 sample conforms to a direct Z-scheme mechanism (see Fig. 12b), the photogenerated electrons and holes will be respectively preserved in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and the VB of ZnO, maintaining enough reducibility and oxidizability to produce superoxide anion radicals (O 2 A ) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) respectively. The experimental measurement of hydroxyl radicals (OH) also showed that the PL signals of the G10 sample increased almost linearly with irradiation time, whose intensity is more comparable to that of pure ZnO.The presence of PL signals of the G10 samples conrmed that the hydroxyl radicals (OH) were indeed produced on the surface of G10 upon light illumination either in the direct or indirect pathway. 53On the basis of the above PL analyses, the binary g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO composite photocatalytic system is more likely to follow a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism, rather than the conventional heterojunction-type photocatalytic mechanism. To further investigate the specic mechanism accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the G10 sample, the transient photocurrent responses of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 were recorded by using typical switch on-off cycles of light irradiation.In this work, we adopted two light sources with different wavelengths (365 and 420 nm) to carry out the photocurrent measurements to probe the excitation, transfer, separation and recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.Typically, the value of photocurrent density corresponds to the charge collection efficiency and a higher value of the photocurrent response generally means higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.Fig. 14 shows the comparison of photocurrent-time (I-t) curves of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 upon switch on-off cycles of intermittent light irradiation with two different wavelengths.Interestingly, the pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 exhibit different photocurrent performances on the two occasions.For light illumination at a wavelength of 420 nm shown in Fig. 14a, the pure g-C 3 N 4 demonstrates a higher photocurrent density than G10.Because of the large band gap of ZnO (3.2 eV), only the g-C 3 N 4 phase can be effectively excited under this condition.The lower value of photocurrent of G10 can be mainly due to the limited amount of g-C 3 N 4 phase.In contrast, light irradiation at a wavelength of 365 nm on G10 shows drastically increased photocurrent density that is 7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 , as seen in Fig. 14b.On this occasion, the electrons of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 can be excited and contribute to the increase of photocurrent density.But considering the limited amount of ZnO and the overall enhancement of photocatalytic performances, it is highly possible that the excited electrons in the CB of the ZnO phase are critical to the efficient separation of charge carriers within g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion, such a high photocurrent of G10 is achieved via ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 electron transfer to quench the photogenerated holes and extend the lifetime of exited electrons within the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Thus, based on the comparison of the above two situations, the photocurrent measurements further conrmed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity for selective CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH of G10 can be attributed to a direct Z-scheme mechanism.Furthermore, since ZnO and TiO 2 have similar band gaps and band edge positions, the previous construction of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composite photocatalyst reported recently also provides strong support to the above explanation. 44n order to further conrm the direct Z-scheme mechanism proposed above, the electronic band structures of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were obtained using theoretical DFT calculation under the same conditions.The constructed crystal structures and the calculated electronic band structures of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 15 and 16, respectively.On the basis of the obtained band structures, the effective masses of photogenerated electrons and holes of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were calculated by parabolic tting to the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) based on eqn (1), respectively.Basically, the effective mass of a charge carrier is inversely proportional to its moving velocity according to the following eqn (2), where n and m represent the transfer rate and effective mass of a charge carrier, respectively.Thus, a smaller value of charge carrier effective mass corresponds to a faster transfer rate. 545556 m 14 2 (d 2 E/dk 2 ) A1 (1) In order to characterize the charge separation efficiency, we also adopted the concept of relative effective mass of photogenerated holes to electrons according to eqn (3).This concept was also used by other researchers to rationalize the reactivity of photocatalysts based on electronic band structures. 57In general, a higher D value means that the photogenerated electron-hole pairs will have a higher tendency to separate, thus resulting in slower recombination rates and better photocatalytic performance. The obtained results of charge carrier effective mass in both G-Z and G-F directions are shown in Table 2.As seen from Table 2, both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 generally belong to the intrinsic n-type semiconductors with light electrons and heavy holes.However, it should be noted that the D values of ZnO are much higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 in both G-Z and G-F directions, indicating ZnO possesses higher charge separation efficiency than g-C 3 N 4 .Consistent with literature reports, 34,35 the relatively low D values of g-C 3 N 4 in both directions correspond to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Moreover, the calculated electron effective mass (m e ) in the G-Z direction of ZnO (0.034) is far lighter than that of g-C 3 N 4 (3.9),suggesting that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-Z direction exhibit much faster moving rates and higher tendency to transfer than those of g-C 3 N 4 at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Although the absolute value of m e in the G-F direction of ZnO (0.9) is comparable to that of g-C 3 N 4 (0.41), the much higher D value of ZnO (11.5) than g-C 3 N 4 (1.6) still demonstrates that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-F direction have higher probability to transfer rather than to recombine compared with those of g-C 3 N 4 .In this regard, both the lighter photogenerated electrons and the higher charge separation efficiency of ZnO in contrast to g-C 3 N 4 indicate that the electron transfer at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface is more likely to occur in the ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 rather than the g-C 3 N 4 -to-ZnO direction.Thus, the comparison of theoretical effective mass calculations between ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 also strongly supports the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism proposed above."}, {"llm generation": "pure ZnO", "source": "For the purpose of comparison, XRD patterns of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO obtained through the same preparation method are also shown in Fig. 1.", "context": "XRD patterns were recorded in Fig. 1 to reveal the phase structure of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system (G10).For the purpose of comparison, XRD patterns of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO obtained through the same preparation method are also shown in Fig. 1.The XRD patterns of the pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibit two pronounced diffraction peaks that were found at 27.4 and 13.1 , respectively.The stronger peak at 27.4 which is attributed to the interlayer stacking of aromatic systems can be indexed to the (002) crystal plane and corresponds to an interlayer distance of 0.326 nm.The weaker (001) peak at around 13.1 with a distance of 0.675 nm can be ascribed to interlayer planar stacking motifs.These two characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are consistent with the previous results. 18,26,33The prepared pure ZnO demonstrates characteristic diffraction peaks with high intensities of the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO phase, which is the most stable and common form of ZnO under ambient conditions.The XRD pattern of the pure ZnO indicates that the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO crystals with high crystallinity can form under the synthetic conditions, which stems from the decomposition of zinc nitrate hexahydrate.For the obtained G10 sample, nearly all of the characteristic diffraction peaks of wurtzite hexagonal ZnO were clearly shown in its XRD pattern without any noticeable shis of diffraction angles (2q), conrming the existence of the ZnO phase.As for the g-C 3 N 4 phase, only the (002) peak of g-C 3 N 4 was obscurely observed whose diffraction intensity was lower compared with that of the ZnO phase.The relatively poor crystallinity of the g-C 3 N 4 phase indicates that the simultaneous crystallization of the ZnO phase interferes with the condensation process and interlayer stacking patterns of the g-C 3 N 4 phase, thus resulting in its weak diffraction intensity.The XRD patterns of both the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase in the G10 sample suggest that these two phases exist separately in the composite and no strong crystal lattice incorporation is observed between these two phases. To investigate the thermostability and measure the g-C 3 N 4 contents in G10, TGA analyses were performed on both the obtained G10 and pure samples, from ambient temperature to 900 C at a heating rate of 10 C min A1 .The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2. For the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the rapid decay of the TGA curve from around 450 C to 600 C represents the typical thermal decomposition of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating its intrinsic thermal instability in this temperature range.No signicant weight loss is observed in the TGA curve of pure ZnO, con-rming the high thermal stability of ZnO.Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the TGA curve decay of the G10 sample starts and ends at lower temperatures, respectively.This suggests that the obtained G10 sample demonstrates lower thermal stability upon heating than the pure g-C 3 N 4 , which is mainly due to the disturbance of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards interlayer stacking motifs of g-C 3 N 4 or the catalyzing effect of ZnO over g-C 3 N 4 thermal decomposition.A similar phenomenon was also observed in other cases such as g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 coupling. 44he relative content of the ZnO phase in the G10 sample is determined to be 44.6,accounting for nearly half the weight composition of G10.Considering the original mass ratio of the precursors of g-C 3 N 4 (urea) and ZnO (zinc nitrate hexahydrate) to be around 10, a signicant amount of urea is estimated to undergo direct thermal decomposition into gases during polycondensation, 45 because the holding temperature of condensation is precisely within the above measured temperature range for pure g-C 3 N 4 decomposition. XPS analyses were performed to investigate the chemical composition and elucidate the elemental chemical states of all samples.As expected, there are four major elemental states detected in the prepared G10 samples, namely C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s.Fig. 3a-d present the comparison of the high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s between G10 and pure samples, respectively.The C 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 has two obvious peaks at binding energies of 284.7 and 287.7 eV.The peak at a binding energy of 284.7 eV can be attributed to the adventitious carbon impurities, whereas the peak at 287.7 eV can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 .Two similar peaks were also observed in the spectra of G10 at binding energies of 284.5 and 287.4 eV, which shied towards the lower energy region by 0.2 and 0.3 eV, respectively.The N 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 shows two clear peaks at binding energies of 398.3 and 400.2 eV, which can be ascribed to sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen atoms involved in triazine (CN-C) units and amino groups (C-N-H), respectively.Moreover, the weak shoulder peak at 404.2 eV accounts for p-excitations.Similar strong peaks at 398.0 and 400.3 eV were also observed in the N 1s spectra of G10, indicating the existence of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.The Zn 2p spectrum of the pure ZnO demonstrates a doublet at binding energies of 1021.3 and 1044.5 eV, assigned to Zn 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 states, respectively.The corresponding peaks of Zn 2p in the G10 spectra appear at 1020.9, 1023, 1044.1 and 1047.4 eV, showing that the original doublet peak splits up into a quartet peak in total.The doublet peak at 1020.9 and 1044.1 eV is attributed to Zn atoms within the ZnO phase, while the other doublet peak at 1023 and 1047.4 eV is ascribed to Zn atoms at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.The splitting of the original doublet peak indicates the possible interfacial hybridization between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase.Furthermore, compared with pure ZnO, the O 1s states of G10 were observed to shi into the higher energy region.Considering only the interfacial Zn atoms, the binding energy of Zn 2p states of G10 also increased in contrast to pure ZnO.Since the binding energy of C 1s and N 1s states of G10 generally decreased compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 phases of G10 exhibit opposite tendency of binding energy shis relative to the pure samples.This opposite tendency suggests that the total electron density shis from the ZnO phase to the g-C 3 N 4 phase and thus causes the formation of N-Zn-O covalent bonds between two phases, mainly due to the backbonding ability of the fully occupied Zn 3d orbitals and the electron dispersive capacity of C-N p-p conjugated structures.The formation of interfacial covalent bonds indicates the intimate contact between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which is also benecial for the formation of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary composite photocatalytic system, thus facilitating the transfer and separation of charge carriers and further promoting the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. 404 Microstructure observation SEM and TEM images were further used to investigate the microstructure and morphology of all the prepared samples.Fig. 4a presents the typical large ZnO microcrystals obtained under the above mentioned synthetic conditions whose sizes have reached tens of micrometers.These microcrystals generally demonstrate well-dened crystal facets, corresponding to their high crystallinity reected by XRD patterns.Fig. 4b andc show the representative highly porous structure of pure g-C 3 N 4 derived from urea, formed by considerable gas release during thermal condensation.45 Fig. 4d and e display the morphology of the obtained G10 sample, which has much more compact structures compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 .Such elimination of high porosity and the transformation into more compact structures are mainly due to the imbedded crystallization process of the ZnO phase within the original pores of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.This results in the formation of an intimate contact interface between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which enhances the charge transfer and separation between the two phases.Fig. 4f presents the HRTEM image of the interface between the two phases.The ZnO phase exists as relatively small nanoparticles surrounded by the g-C 3 N 4 phase, conrming the existence of the interfacial contact proposed above.The denoted lattice fringes with a d spacing of 0.26 nm can be assigned to the (002) crystal plane of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO.46 In order to further conrm the above interfacial contact, the EDX mapping of the prepared G10 sample was performed to investigate the distribution patterns of the component elements.As seen from Fig. 5, all of the four major elements (C, N, Zn, and O) were uniformly distributed in the G10 sample.Combined with previous discussion, the homogenous distribution of the component elements also suggests that the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase within G10 are indeed fully mixed and intimately contacted, rather than existing as separate aggregates in the G10 sample. The specic surface area and porous structure of all the asprepared samples were investigated by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms.The calculated parameters of their physical properties including specic surface area, pore volume and pore diameter are displayed in Table 1.As seen from Table 1, the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ) has a greater specic surface area than the obtained G10 sample (12.8 m 2 g A1 ), which is due to the addition of the ZnO phase.The rather low specic surface area of pure ZnO can be ascribed to the formation of rather large ZnO microcrystals with high crystallinity under the above synthetic conditions, which can be conrmed by direct SEM observation presented in Fig. 4a.isotherms of both G10 and g-C 3 N 4 belong to type IV, indicating the existence of mesopores (2-50 nm). 18Further observations reveal that the adsorption-desorption isotherm of g-C 3 N 4 generally shis upward relative to G10 in the whole relative pressure range, suggesting a higher specic surface area and larger pore volume of pure g-C 3 N 4 .Comparison of pore size distributions also conrms that G10 has less mesopores and smaller pore volumes in contrast to pure g-C 3 N 4 .Also, the results presented in Table 1 calculated by the BJH method show that pure g-C 3 N 4 has a larger pore volume and larger pore diameter than G10.The isotherms and pore size distributions in Fig. 6 are both consistent with the calculated results shown in Table 1.Moreover, the shapes of hysteresis loops of pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 reect that both can be attributed to the type H3, indicating the presence of silt-like pores generated by particle aggregation.Based on the deduction that the crystallization of ZnO and the thermal condensation of g-C 3 N 4 occur simultaneously to form separate phases, the drastic decline of the specic surface area and pore volume of G10 implies that the crystallization of ZnO can ll up the original silt-like pores within the g-C 3 N 4 phase, which can further lead to a high degree of interfacial contact between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase. The electronic structures of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and the G10 sample were evaluated by UV-vis diffuse reectance spectroscopy.As seen in Fig. 7, for pure g-C 3 N 4 , a sharp increase of light absorption occurs at wavelengths shorter than 450 nm, which can be attributed to the intrinsic band gap of g-C 3 N 4 .As denoted by the dashed line, the absorption edge of g-C 3 N 4 at about 450 nm corresponds to a typical band gap of 2.7 eV, which is consistent with the values reported in other literature studies. 26ompared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the as-prepared G10 sample exhibits stronger light absorption in both ultraviolet and visible light regions.The increased absorption of ultraviolet light can be attributed to the existence of the ZnO phase in the sample.The enhancement of visible light absorption can stem from more defect states in the g-C 3 N 4 phase that are introduced by the interference of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards g-C 3 N 4 condensation.Such extended absorption of visible light originated from the effect of introduced defect states is also observed in other reports. 33In general, the G10 sample has stronger absorption in the whole spectrum and can absorb more solar energy for photocatalytic reactions.Thus, it is not surprising that G10 has better sunlight utilization and higher photocatalytic activity than the pure g-C 3 N 4 . FT-IR spectra of the synthesized G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples are demonstrated in Fig. 8.The pure g-C 3 N 4 presents similar features with the previous reports. 18The peaks at 1632 and 1566 cm A1 can be attributed to the C-N stretching vibration modes, while the peaks at 1423, 1323 and 1254 cm A1 belong to aromatic C-N stretching.The representative peak at 810 cm A1 can be ascribed to the characteristic out-of-plane bending modes of triazine units, corresponding to the condensed C-N heterocycles.The broad absorption band at around 3400 cm A1 corresponds to the adsorbed H 2 O molecules and N-H vibrations of the uncondensed amine groups.The general resemblance of FT-IR spectra between the as-prepared G10 sample and the pure g-C 3 N 4 conrms the preserved graphitic nature of the carbon nitride phase in the G10 sample.Compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic peaks of the stretching modes of C-N heterocycles in the range from 1250 to 1650 cm A1 were observed to merge into a broad absorption band in the G10 sample, indicating the inuence of previously mentioned ZnO crystallization.A similar phenomenon of peak mergence was also reported in other literature studies. 47,48The appearance of new peaks at 2183 and 2056 cm A1 indicates the existence of dangling cyanide groups that should serve as intermediates during the polymerization of urea. 49The relative red-shis of cyanide groups compared with the normal wavenumber of 2250 cm A1 are due to the conjugation effect of the extended C-N aromatic system.The emergence of cyanide groups in G10 suggests that the simultaneous ZnO crystallization could interfere with the thermal polymerization of urea to generate a Fig. 6 Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of pure g-C 3 N 4 (black) and G10 (red). Fig. 7 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). well-dened g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion of XRD patterns, TGA curves and UV-vis spectra, such interference of ZnO crystallization can result in relatively poor crystallinity and give rise to more defect states within the g-C 3 N 4 phase. The photocatalytic activity of various samples for CO 2 reduction was evaluated under simulated solar irradiation in the anaerobic environment.Control experiments were performed in the absence of either light illumination or photocatalysts and no appreciable amounts of any hydrocarbon products were found, conrming that light irradiation and photocatalysts are the two essential factors for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions.In this work, the gaseous CO 2 introduced by the in situ reaction between sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloride aqueous solution serves as the only carbon source and the water vapor can also be generated by the reaction.The nal products of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 detected by gas chromatography (GC) are shown in Fig. 9.As seen in Fig. 9, CH 3 OH was the only product detected by the GC FID method for both the G10 sample and pure g-C 3 N 4 .Typically, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex multielectron transfer process, which has the potential to give rise to more than one reduced species including CH 4 , CH 3 OH, HCOOH and HCHO.However, no products other than CH 3 OH were observed for all the as-prepared samples, indicating that both the synthesized pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 samples exhibit good reaction selectivity to convert CO 2 directly into CH 3 OH under solar irradiation.Although the underlying mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction still remains ambiguous until now, there are three possible reasons regarding why CH 3 OH was the only product detected in our experiments: (1) as mentioned above, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction took place at the solid-gas interface and the products were determined by the extracted gas samples under our experimental conditions.If HCOOH and HCHO were indeed produced upon light irradiation, they were more likely to adsorb on the surfaces of samples than CH 3 OH, due to the stronger polarity of HCOOH and HCHO.Thus, only CH 3 OH could easily desorb into the gas phase aer the reaction and then be detected by the GC FID method; (2) as is well known, HCOOH and HCHO are relatively unstable molecules compared with CH 3 OH, which can be readily re-oxidized into CO 2 by the oxygen gas generated during the reaction process; (3) comparatively speaking, the production of CH 4 from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction requires more electrons (8e A ) and protons (8H ) in contrast to CH 3 OH (6e A and 6H ).In this regard, the specic reaction routes and the nal products can be closely associated with the intrinsic properties of the photocatalysts.It is worth mentioning that such good conversion selectivity of g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into CH 3 OH rather than CH 4 was also conrmed by results from other groups. 50,51As is well known, CH 3 OH is one of the most desirable value-added fuels that are easy to store and utilize, while the good selectivity of CH 3 OH generation can also effectively facilitate the subsequent product separation process. The specic CH 3 OH production rates of various samples were calculated from the GC spectra based on the integral area between each peak and baseline.Fig. 10 presents the comparison of CH 3 OH production rates of the commercial ZnO, the prepared pure ZnO, G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples.The CH 3 OH production rate of the obtained pure ZnO (0.37 mmol h A1 g A1 ) is comparable to that of the commercial ZnO (0.32 mmol h A1 g A1 ), showing the considerable photocatalytic activity of single-phase ZnO by utilizing UV light.Despite the high specic surface area and the large pore volume of g-C 3 N 4 , its CH 3 OH production rate (0.26 mmol h A1 g A1 ) still remains relatively low, mainly due to the high recombination rates of photogenerated electrons and holes.However, compared with both the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO, the obtained G10 sample exhibits the highest CH 3 OH production rate (0.6 mmol h A1 g A1 ).On the basis of the results in Table 1, the specic surface area of G10 (12.8 m 2 g A1 ) is drastically reduced in contrast to the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ), possibly because of the intercalated ZnO crystallization within the original pores in the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Although the specic surface area is critical for heterogenous catalysis, the higher production rate of the G10 sample with a lower specic surface area suggests highly efficient charge carrier separation occurring at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Combined with the previous analyses of surface area and microstructure observation, the Fig. 8 FT-IR spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). Fig. 9 GC spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). intimate interfacial contact between the two phases is benecial for the separation of excited charge carriers, the inhibition of unfavorable recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the further promotion of the photocatalytic activity.In this regard, by coupling ZnO with g-C 3 N 4 via a facile approach, we achieved an enhanced photocatalytic reduction rate of CO 2 into CH 3 OH for pure g-C 3 N 4 by a factor of 2.3, while preserving the original reaction selectivity to directly convert CO 2 into CH 3 OH. In general, there are two possible mechanisms accounting for the photocatalytic activity enhancement induced by spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers in binary photocatalytic systems: (1) conventional heterojunction-type and (2) direct Z-scheme type. 52In order to facilitate analyses, schematic comparison regarding band edge positions of g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO together with the standard potentials of relevant redox couples is presented in Fig. 11.As seen in Fig. 11, the energy potentials of conduction bands (CB) of g-C 3 N 4 (A1.12V vs. NHE) and ZnO (A0.2 V vs. NHE) are both more negative than the standard potential of the CO 2 /CH 3 OH redox couple (0.03 V vs. NHE), while the energy potentials of valence bands (VB) of g-C 3 N 4 (1.57V vs. NHE) and ZnO (3.0 V vs. NHE) are both more positive than the standard potential of the O 2 /H 2 O redox couple (1.23 V vs. NHE).In this regard, both the above two mechanisms can be possible in explaining the enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary photocatalytic system.Schematic diagrams illustrating the detailed processes of the above two possible mechanisms in the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system are demonstrated in Fig. 12.In the heterojunction-type photocatalytic system presented in Fig. 12a, the excited electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 with higher energy potentials to the CB of ZnO with lower energy potentials, resulting in the decrease of electron reducibility.Thus, in this case, it should be the electrons from the CB of ZnO reducing CO 2 into CH 3 OH.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes transfer from the VB of ZnO to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , which also results in the decrease of hole oxidizability.The other type is the direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system shown in Fig. 12b.Upon simultaneous light excitation, both g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO phases can generate excited electron-hole pairs.The excited electrons from the CB of ZnO with lower energy can transfer to combine with the photogenerated holes in g-C 3 N 4 , thus preserving the electrons with stronger reducibility in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and holes with stronger oxidizability in the VB of ZnO.Finally, the electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 can react with CO 2 and produce CH 3 OH.In this regard, it should be noted that the interfacial electron transfer actually occurs in opposite directions for the heterojunction-type (g-C 3 N 4 to ZnO) and direct Z-scheme type (ZnO to g-C 3 N 4 ) photocatalytic systems. 16n order to provide clues to understand the underlying mechanism responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G10, the photoluminescence (PL) analyses of the hydroxyl radicals (OH) produced on the surfaces of pure g-C 3 N 4 , G10 and pure ZnO upon light irradiation were rst carried out by using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule.The spectral changes of the G10 sample against irradiation time and the comparison of the PL peak intensity around 423 nm of the G10, pure ZnO and pure g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 13a andb, respectively.As shown in Fig. 13b ) can be produced, thus resulting in the subsequent absence of PL signals.However, if the G10 sample conforms to a direct Z-scheme mechanism (see Fig. 12b), the photogenerated electrons and holes will be respectively preserved in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and the VB of ZnO, maintaining enough reducibility and oxidizability to produce superoxide anion radicals (O 2 A ) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) respectively. The experimental measurement of hydroxyl radicals (OH) also showed that the PL signals of the G10 sample increased almost linearly with irradiation time, whose intensity is more comparable to that of pure ZnO.The presence of PL signals of the G10 samples conrmed that the hydroxyl radicals (OH) were indeed produced on the surface of G10 upon light illumination either in the direct or indirect pathway. 53On the basis of the above PL analyses, the binary g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO composite photocatalytic system is more likely to follow a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism, rather than the conventional heterojunction-type photocatalytic mechanism. To further investigate the specic mechanism accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the G10 sample, the transient photocurrent responses of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 were recorded by using typical switch on-off cycles of light irradiation.In this work, we adopted two light sources with different wavelengths (365 and 420 nm) to carry out the photocurrent measurements to probe the excitation, transfer, separation and recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.Typically, the value of photocurrent density corresponds to the charge collection efficiency and a higher value of the photocurrent response generally means higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.Fig. 14 shows the comparison of photocurrent-time (I-t) curves of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 upon switch on-off cycles of intermittent light irradiation with two different wavelengths.Interestingly, the pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 exhibit different photocurrent performances on the two occasions.For light illumination at a wavelength of 420 nm shown in Fig. 14a, the pure g-C 3 N 4 demonstrates a higher photocurrent density than G10.Because of the large band gap of ZnO (3.2 eV), only the g-C 3 N 4 phase can be effectively excited under this condition.The lower value of photocurrent of G10 can be mainly due to the limited amount of g-C 3 N 4 phase.In contrast, light irradiation at a wavelength of 365 nm on G10 shows drastically increased photocurrent density that is 7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 , as seen in Fig. 14b.On this occasion, the electrons of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 can be excited and contribute to the increase of photocurrent density.But considering the limited amount of ZnO and the overall enhancement of photocatalytic performances, it is highly possible that the excited electrons in the CB of the ZnO phase are critical to the efficient separation of charge carriers within g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion, such a high photocurrent of G10 is achieved via ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 electron transfer to quench the photogenerated holes and extend the lifetime of exited electrons within the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Thus, based on the comparison of the above two situations, the photocurrent measurements further conrmed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity for selective CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH of G10 can be attributed to a direct Z-scheme mechanism.Furthermore, since ZnO and TiO 2 have similar band gaps and band edge positions, the previous construction of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composite photocatalyst reported recently also provides strong support to the above explanation. 44n order to further conrm the direct Z-scheme mechanism proposed above, the electronic band structures of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were obtained using theoretical DFT calculation under the same conditions.The constructed crystal structures and the calculated electronic band structures of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 15 and 16, respectively.On the basis of the obtained band structures, the effective masses of photogenerated electrons and holes of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were calculated by parabolic tting to the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) based on eqn (1), respectively.Basically, the effective mass of a charge carrier is inversely proportional to its moving velocity according to the following eqn (2), where n and m represent the transfer rate and effective mass of a charge carrier, respectively.Thus, a smaller value of charge carrier effective mass corresponds to a faster transfer rate. 545556 m 14 2 (d 2 E/dk 2 ) A1 (1) In order to characterize the charge separation efficiency, we also adopted the concept of relative effective mass of photogenerated holes to electrons according to eqn (3).This concept was also used by other researchers to rationalize the reactivity of photocatalysts based on electronic band structures. 57In general, a higher D value means that the photogenerated electron-hole pairs will have a higher tendency to separate, thus resulting in slower recombination rates and better photocatalytic performance. The obtained results of charge carrier effective mass in both G-Z and G-F directions are shown in Table 2.As seen from Table 2, both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 generally belong to the intrinsic n-type semiconductors with light electrons and heavy holes.However, it should be noted that the D values of ZnO are much higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 in both G-Z and G-F directions, indicating ZnO possesses higher charge separation efficiency than g-C 3 N 4 .Consistent with literature reports, 34,35 the relatively low D values of g-C 3 N 4 in both directions correspond to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Moreover, the calculated electron effective mass (m e ) in the G-Z direction of ZnO (0.034) is far lighter than that of g-C 3 N 4 (3.9),suggesting that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-Z direction exhibit much faster moving rates and higher tendency to transfer than those of g-C 3 N 4 at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Although the absolute value of m e in the G-F direction of ZnO (0.9) is comparable to that of g-C 3 N 4 (0.41), the much higher D value of ZnO (11.5) than g-C 3 N 4 (1.6) still demonstrates that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-F direction have higher probability to transfer rather than to recombine compared with those of g-C 3 N 4 .In this regard, both the lighter photogenerated electrons and the higher charge separation efficiency of ZnO in contrast to g-C 3 N 4 indicate that the electron transfer at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface is more likely to occur in the ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 rather than the g-C 3 N 4 -to-ZnO direction.Thus, the comparison of theoretical effective mass calculations between ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 also strongly supports the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism proposed above."}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary composite photocatalytic system", "source": "In summary, a direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary composite photocatalytic system was successfully constructed via a onestep facile calcination method utilizing affordable urea and zinc nitrate hexahydrate as precursors.", "context": "In summary, a direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary composite photocatalytic system was successfully constructed via a onestep facile calcination method utilizing affordable urea and zinc nitrate hexahydrate as precursors.The characterization results show that simultaneous ZnO crystallization takes place within the original pores of g-C 3 N 4 during urea polycondensation, thus leading to two separate phases with intimate interfacial contact.The g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system exhibits stronger and extended light absorption in the visible light range than pure g-C 3 N 4 , which is due to more defect states in the g-C 3 N 4 phase introduced by the interference of ZnO crystallization.Also, the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalyst demonstrates 2.3 times higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction into CH 3 OH with preserved reaction selectivity compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 .The overall enhancement of photoactivity of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary photocatalytic system is attributed to a direct Z-scheme mechanism rather than the conventional heterojunction-type mechanism, which is further conrmed by PL analyses of hydroxyl radicals, photocurrent measurements and DFT calculations of charge carrier effective mass.Considering the improved photoactivity and maintained reaction selectivity of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO system, this work will not only illustrate the coupling effect of ZnO on the enhanced photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 via a direct Z-scheme mechanism, but also provide unprecedented insights into the further construction of direct Z-scheme photocatalytic systems without an electron mediator for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a D/Max-RB X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan), under Cu Ka radiation at a scan rate (2q) of 0.05 s A1 .The accelerating voltage and applied current were 40 kV and 80 mA, respectively.The thermal properties of the obtained samples were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with a DTG-60H analyzer (Shimadzu Corp., Tokyo, Japan).About 5 mg of each sample was heated from ambient temperature to 900 C at a heating rate of 10 C min A1 .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using an ultra-high-vacuum VG ESCA-LAB 210 electron spectrometer equipped with a multi-channel detector.The spectrum was excited by Mg Ka radiation of two anodes in the constant analyzer energy mode and operating at 200 W.All the binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 285.0 eV of the surface adventitious carbon.Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were obtained by using a JSM-7500F (JEOL, Japan) scanning electron microscope.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) analyses were conducted on a Tecnai G 2 F20 S-TWIN microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.UV-visible absorbance spectra were obtained by using the diepressed disk sample and a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2550, SHIMADZU, Japan), in which BaSO 4 was used as the reectance standard.Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of the samples were evaluated using an IR Affiinity-1 FTIR spectrometer that used conventional KBr pellets in the range of 4000-500 cm A1 at room temperature.Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms were measured on an ASAP 2020 nitrogen adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics, USA).All of the samples were degassed at 180 C before measurements.The BET surface area was determined by a multipoint BET method using the adsorption data in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.05-0.25.The pore size distributions were determined using desorption data by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were used to investigate the hydroxyl radicals produced on the surface of all samples upon light irradiation in the presence of 5 A 10 A4 M terephthalic acid in 2 A 10 A3 M NaOH solution, and were measured at room temperature on an F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan).The excitation wavelength was 315 nm, the scanning speed was 1200 nm min A1 and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage was 700 V.The width of both the excitation slit and the emission slit was 2.5 nm.

Photocurrent measurements were performed on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument, Shanghai, China) in a conventional three-electrode conguration including a working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode.The working electrode prepared with the sample has an active area of ca.0.5 cm 2 .A Pt wire and Ag/AgCl electrode (immersed in saturated KCl solution) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.Two different low power LEDs (3 W, 365 and 420 nm) (Shenzhen LAMPLIC Science Co.

The rst-principle DFT calculations performed on a CASTEP code based on the plane-wave pseudopotential method were used to investigate the charge carrier effective masses of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 .The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) was used as the exchangecorrelation function.The ultraso pseudopotential was used to describe the interaction between the ionic core and valence electrons.The lattice parameters and atomic coordinates were relaxed using a cutoff energy of 380 eV and Monkhorst-pack grids of 4 A 4 A 2 k-points for both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 models.Geometric optimization was rst achieved using convergence thresholds of 2 A 10 A5 eV per atom for total energy, 0.03 eV AA1 for maximum force, 0.05 GPa for pressure, and 0.001 A for maximum displacement.The self-consistent calculations were performed with a total tolerance of less than 1 A 10 A6 eV per atom.Aer the geometric optimizations were nished, the band structures of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were obtained and the effective masses of charge carriers were calculated based on the obtained electronic structures."}, {"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "The photocatalytic activity of various samples for CO 2 reduction was evaluated under simulated solar irradiation in the anaerobic environment.", "context": "XRD patterns were recorded in Fig. 1 to reveal the phase structure of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system (G10).For the purpose of comparison, XRD patterns of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO obtained through the same preparation method are also shown in Fig. 1.The XRD patterns of the pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibit two pronounced diffraction peaks that were found at 27.4 and 13.1 , respectively.The stronger peak at 27.4 which is attributed to the interlayer stacking of aromatic systems can be indexed to the (002) crystal plane and corresponds to an interlayer distance of 0.326 nm.The weaker (001) peak at around 13.1 with a distance of 0.675 nm can be ascribed to interlayer planar stacking motifs.These two characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are consistent with the previous results. 18,26,33The prepared pure ZnO demonstrates characteristic diffraction peaks with high intensities of the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO phase, which is the most stable and common form of ZnO under ambient conditions.The XRD pattern of the pure ZnO indicates that the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO crystals with high crystallinity can form under the synthetic conditions, which stems from the decomposition of zinc nitrate hexahydrate.For the obtained G10 sample, nearly all of the characteristic diffraction peaks of wurtzite hexagonal ZnO were clearly shown in its XRD pattern without any noticeable shis of diffraction angles (2q), conrming the existence of the ZnO phase.As for the g-C 3 N 4 phase, only the (002) peak of g-C 3 N 4 was obscurely observed whose diffraction intensity was lower compared with that of the ZnO phase.The relatively poor crystallinity of the g-C 3 N 4 phase indicates that the simultaneous crystallization of the ZnO phase interferes with the condensation process and interlayer stacking patterns of the g-C 3 N 4 phase, thus resulting in its weak diffraction intensity.The XRD patterns of both the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase in the G10 sample suggest that these two phases exist separately in the composite and no strong crystal lattice incorporation is observed between these two phases. To investigate the thermostability and measure the g-C 3 N 4 contents in G10, TGA analyses were performed on both the obtained G10 and pure samples, from ambient temperature to 900 C at a heating rate of 10 C min A1 .The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2. For the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the rapid decay of the TGA curve from around 450 C to 600 C represents the typical thermal decomposition of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating its intrinsic thermal instability in this temperature range.No signicant weight loss is observed in the TGA curve of pure ZnO, con-rming the high thermal stability of ZnO.Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the TGA curve decay of the G10 sample starts and ends at lower temperatures, respectively.This suggests that the obtained G10 sample demonstrates lower thermal stability upon heating than the pure g-C 3 N 4 , which is mainly due to the disturbance of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards interlayer stacking motifs of g-C 3 N 4 or the catalyzing effect of ZnO over g-C 3 N 4 thermal decomposition.A similar phenomenon was also observed in other cases such as g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 coupling. 44he relative content of the ZnO phase in the G10 sample is determined to be 44.6,accounting for nearly half the weight composition of G10.Considering the original mass ratio of the precursors of g-C 3 N 4 (urea) and ZnO (zinc nitrate hexahydrate) to be around 10, a signicant amount of urea is estimated to undergo direct thermal decomposition into gases during polycondensation, 45 because the holding temperature of condensation is precisely within the above measured temperature range for pure g-C 3 N 4 decomposition. XPS analyses were performed to investigate the chemical composition and elucidate the elemental chemical states of all samples.As expected, there are four major elemental states detected in the prepared G10 samples, namely C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s.Fig. 3a-d present the comparison of the high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s between G10 and pure samples, respectively.The C 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 has two obvious peaks at binding energies of 284.7 and 287.7 eV.The peak at a binding energy of 284.7 eV can be attributed to the adventitious carbon impurities, whereas the peak at 287.7 eV can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 .Two similar peaks were also observed in the spectra of G10 at binding energies of 284.5 and 287.4 eV, which shied towards the lower energy region by 0.2 and 0.3 eV, respectively.The N 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 shows two clear peaks at binding energies of 398.3 and 400.2 eV, which can be ascribed to sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen atoms involved in triazine (CN-C) units and amino groups (C-N-H), respectively.Moreover, the weak shoulder peak at 404.2 eV accounts for p-excitations.Similar strong peaks at 398.0 and 400.3 eV were also observed in the N 1s spectra of G10, indicating the existence of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.The Zn 2p spectrum of the pure ZnO demonstrates a doublet at binding energies of 1021.3 and 1044.5 eV, assigned to Zn 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 states, respectively.The corresponding peaks of Zn 2p in the G10 spectra appear at 1020.9, 1023, 1044.1 and 1047.4 eV, showing that the original doublet peak splits up into a quartet peak in total.The doublet peak at 1020.9 and 1044.1 eV is attributed to Zn atoms within the ZnO phase, while the other doublet peak at 1023 and 1047.4 eV is ascribed to Zn atoms at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.The splitting of the original doublet peak indicates the possible interfacial hybridization between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase.Furthermore, compared with pure ZnO, the O 1s states of G10 were observed to shi into the higher energy region.Considering only the interfacial Zn atoms, the binding energy of Zn 2p states of G10 also increased in contrast to pure ZnO.Since the binding energy of C 1s and N 1s states of G10 generally decreased compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 phases of G10 exhibit opposite tendency of binding energy shis relative to the pure samples.This opposite tendency suggests that the total electron density shis from the ZnO phase to the g-C 3 N 4 phase and thus causes the formation of N-Zn-O covalent bonds between two phases, mainly due to the backbonding ability of the fully occupied Zn 3d orbitals and the electron dispersive capacity of C-N p-p conjugated structures.The formation of interfacial covalent bonds indicates the intimate contact between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which is also benecial for the formation of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary composite photocatalytic system, thus facilitating the transfer and separation of charge carriers and further promoting the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. 404 Microstructure observation SEM and TEM images were further used to investigate the microstructure and morphology of all the prepared samples.Fig. 4a presents the typical large ZnO microcrystals obtained under the above mentioned synthetic conditions whose sizes have reached tens of micrometers.These microcrystals generally demonstrate well-dened crystal facets, corresponding to their high crystallinity reected by XRD patterns.Fig. 4b andc show the representative highly porous structure of pure g-C 3 N 4 derived from urea, formed by considerable gas release during thermal condensation.45 Fig. 4d and e display the morphology of the obtained G10 sample, which has much more compact structures compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 .Such elimination of high porosity and the transformation into more compact structures are mainly due to the imbedded crystallization process of the ZnO phase within the original pores of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.This results in the formation of an intimate contact interface between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which enhances the charge transfer and separation between the two phases.Fig. 4f presents the HRTEM image of the interface between the two phases.The ZnO phase exists as relatively small nanoparticles surrounded by the g-C 3 N 4 phase, conrming the existence of the interfacial contact proposed above.The denoted lattice fringes with a d spacing of 0.26 nm can be assigned to the (002) crystal plane of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO.46 In order to further conrm the above interfacial contact, the EDX mapping of the prepared G10 sample was performed to investigate the distribution patterns of the component elements.As seen from Fig. 5, all of the four major elements (C, N, Zn, and O) were uniformly distributed in the G10 sample.Combined with previous discussion, the homogenous distribution of the component elements also suggests that the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase within G10 are indeed fully mixed and intimately contacted, rather than existing as separate aggregates in the G10 sample. The specic surface area and porous structure of all the asprepared samples were investigated by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms.The calculated parameters of their physical properties including specic surface area, pore volume and pore diameter are displayed in Table 1.As seen from Table 1, the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ) has a greater specic surface area than the obtained G10 sample (12.8 m 2 g A1 ), which is due to the addition of the ZnO phase.The rather low specic surface area of pure ZnO can be ascribed to the formation of rather large ZnO microcrystals with high crystallinity under the above synthetic conditions, which can be conrmed by direct SEM observation presented in Fig. 4a.isotherms of both G10 and g-C 3 N 4 belong to type IV, indicating the existence of mesopores (2-50 nm). 18Further observations reveal that the adsorption-desorption isotherm of g-C 3 N 4 generally shis upward relative to G10 in the whole relative pressure range, suggesting a higher specic surface area and larger pore volume of pure g-C 3 N 4 .Comparison of pore size distributions also conrms that G10 has less mesopores and smaller pore volumes in contrast to pure g-C 3 N 4 .Also, the results presented in Table 1 calculated by the BJH method show that pure g-C 3 N 4 has a larger pore volume and larger pore diameter than G10.The isotherms and pore size distributions in Fig. 6 are both consistent with the calculated results shown in Table 1.Moreover, the shapes of hysteresis loops of pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 reect that both can be attributed to the type H3, indicating the presence of silt-like pores generated by particle aggregation.Based on the deduction that the crystallization of ZnO and the thermal condensation of g-C 3 N 4 occur simultaneously to form separate phases, the drastic decline of the specic surface area and pore volume of G10 implies that the crystallization of ZnO can ll up the original silt-like pores within the g-C 3 N 4 phase, which can further lead to a high degree of interfacial contact between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase. The electronic structures of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and the G10 sample were evaluated by UV-vis diffuse reectance spectroscopy.As seen in Fig. 7, for pure g-C 3 N 4 , a sharp increase of light absorption occurs at wavelengths shorter than 450 nm, which can be attributed to the intrinsic band gap of g-C 3 N 4 .As denoted by the dashed line, the absorption edge of g-C 3 N 4 at about 450 nm corresponds to a typical band gap of 2.7 eV, which is consistent with the values reported in other literature studies. 26ompared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the as-prepared G10 sample exhibits stronger light absorption in both ultraviolet and visible light regions.The increased absorption of ultraviolet light can be attributed to the existence of the ZnO phase in the sample.The enhancement of visible light absorption can stem from more defect states in the g-C 3 N 4 phase that are introduced by the interference of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards g-C 3 N 4 condensation.Such extended absorption of visible light originated from the effect of introduced defect states is also observed in other reports. 33In general, the G10 sample has stronger absorption in the whole spectrum and can absorb more solar energy for photocatalytic reactions.Thus, it is not surprising that G10 has better sunlight utilization and higher photocatalytic activity than the pure g-C 3 N 4 . FT-IR spectra of the synthesized G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples are demonstrated in Fig. 8.The pure g-C 3 N 4 presents similar features with the previous reports. 18The peaks at 1632 and 1566 cm A1 can be attributed to the C-N stretching vibration modes, while the peaks at 1423, 1323 and 1254 cm A1 belong to aromatic C-N stretching.The representative peak at 810 cm A1 can be ascribed to the characteristic out-of-plane bending modes of triazine units, corresponding to the condensed C-N heterocycles.The broad absorption band at around 3400 cm A1 corresponds to the adsorbed H 2 O molecules and N-H vibrations of the uncondensed amine groups.The general resemblance of FT-IR spectra between the as-prepared G10 sample and the pure g-C 3 N 4 conrms the preserved graphitic nature of the carbon nitride phase in the G10 sample.Compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic peaks of the stretching modes of C-N heterocycles in the range from 1250 to 1650 cm A1 were observed to merge into a broad absorption band in the G10 sample, indicating the inuence of previously mentioned ZnO crystallization.A similar phenomenon of peak mergence was also reported in other literature studies. 47,48The appearance of new peaks at 2183 and 2056 cm A1 indicates the existence of dangling cyanide groups that should serve as intermediates during the polymerization of urea. 49The relative red-shis of cyanide groups compared with the normal wavenumber of 2250 cm A1 are due to the conjugation effect of the extended C-N aromatic system.The emergence of cyanide groups in G10 suggests that the simultaneous ZnO crystallization could interfere with the thermal polymerization of urea to generate a Fig. 6 Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of pure g-C 3 N 4 (black) and G10 (red). Fig. 7 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). well-dened g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion of XRD patterns, TGA curves and UV-vis spectra, such interference of ZnO crystallization can result in relatively poor crystallinity and give rise to more defect states within the g-C 3 N 4 phase. The photocatalytic activity of various samples for CO 2 reduction was evaluated under simulated solar irradiation in the anaerobic environment.Control experiments were performed in the absence of either light illumination or photocatalysts and no appreciable amounts of any hydrocarbon products were found, conrming that light irradiation and photocatalysts are the two essential factors for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions.In this work, the gaseous CO 2 introduced by the in situ reaction between sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloride aqueous solution serves as the only carbon source and the water vapor can also be generated by the reaction.The nal products of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 detected by gas chromatography (GC) are shown in Fig. 9.As seen in Fig. 9, CH 3 OH was the only product detected by the GC FID method for both the G10 sample and pure g-C 3 N 4 .Typically, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex multielectron transfer process, which has the potential to give rise to more than one reduced species including CH 4 , CH 3 OH, HCOOH and HCHO.However, no products other than CH 3 OH were observed for all the as-prepared samples, indicating that both the synthesized pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 samples exhibit good reaction selectivity to convert CO 2 directly into CH 3 OH under solar irradiation.Although the underlying mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction still remains ambiguous until now, there are three possible reasons regarding why CH 3 OH was the only product detected in our experiments: (1) as mentioned above, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction took place at the solid-gas interface and the products were determined by the extracted gas samples under our experimental conditions.If HCOOH and HCHO were indeed produced upon light irradiation, they were more likely to adsorb on the surfaces of samples than CH 3 OH, due to the stronger polarity of HCOOH and HCHO.Thus, only CH 3 OH could easily desorb into the gas phase aer the reaction and then be detected by the GC FID method; (2) as is well known, HCOOH and HCHO are relatively unstable molecules compared with CH 3 OH, which can be readily re-oxidized into CO 2 by the oxygen gas generated during the reaction process; (3) comparatively speaking, the production of CH 4 from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction requires more electrons (8e A ) and protons (8H ) in contrast to CH 3 OH (6e A and 6H ).In this regard, the specic reaction routes and the nal products can be closely associated with the intrinsic properties of the photocatalysts.It is worth mentioning that such good conversion selectivity of g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into CH 3 OH rather than CH 4 was also conrmed by results from other groups. 50,51As is well known, CH 3 OH is one of the most desirable value-added fuels that are easy to store and utilize, while the good selectivity of CH 3 OH generation can also effectively facilitate the subsequent product separation process. The specic CH 3 OH production rates of various samples were calculated from the GC spectra based on the integral area between each peak and baseline.Fig. 10 presents the comparison of CH 3 OH production rates of the commercial ZnO, the prepared pure ZnO, G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples.The CH 3 OH production rate of the obtained pure ZnO (0.37 mmol h A1 g A1 ) is comparable to that of the commercial ZnO (0.32 mmol h A1 g A1 ), showing the considerable photocatalytic activity of single-phase ZnO by utilizing UV light.Despite the high specic surface area and the large pore volume of g-C 3 N 4 , its CH 3 OH production rate (0.26 mmol h A1 g A1 ) still remains relatively low, mainly due to the high recombination rates of photogenerated electrons and holes.However, compared with both the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO, the obtained G10 sample exhibits the highest CH 3 OH production rate (0.6 mmol h A1 g A1 ).On the basis of the results in Table 1, the specic surface area of G10 (12.8 m 2 g A1 ) is drastically reduced in contrast to the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ), possibly because of the intercalated ZnO crystallization within the original pores in the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Although the specic surface area is critical for heterogenous catalysis, the higher production rate of the G10 sample with a lower specic surface area suggests highly efficient charge carrier separation occurring at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Combined with the previous analyses of surface area and microstructure observation, the Fig. 8 FT-IR spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). Fig. 9 GC spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). intimate interfacial contact between the two phases is benecial for the separation of excited charge carriers, the inhibition of unfavorable recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the further promotion of the photocatalytic activity.In this regard, by coupling ZnO with g-C 3 N 4 via a facile approach, we achieved an enhanced photocatalytic reduction rate of CO 2 into CH 3 OH for pure g-C 3 N 4 by a factor of 2.3, while preserving the original reaction selectivity to directly convert CO 2 into CH 3 OH. In general, there are two possible mechanisms accounting for the photocatalytic activity enhancement induced by spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers in binary photocatalytic systems: (1) conventional heterojunction-type and (2) direct Z-scheme type. 52In order to facilitate analyses, schematic comparison regarding band edge positions of g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO together with the standard potentials of relevant redox couples is presented in Fig. 11.As seen in Fig. 11, the energy potentials of conduction bands (CB) of g-C 3 N 4 (A1.12V vs. NHE) and ZnO (A0.2 V vs. NHE) are both more negative than the standard potential of the CO 2 /CH 3 OH redox couple (0.03 V vs. NHE), while the energy potentials of valence bands (VB) of g-C 3 N 4 (1.57V vs. NHE) and ZnO (3.0 V vs. NHE) are both more positive than the standard potential of the O 2 /H 2 O redox couple (1.23 V vs. NHE).In this regard, both the above two mechanisms can be possible in explaining the enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary photocatalytic system.Schematic diagrams illustrating the detailed processes of the above two possible mechanisms in the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system are demonstrated in Fig. 12.In the heterojunction-type photocatalytic system presented in Fig. 12a, the excited electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 with higher energy potentials to the CB of ZnO with lower energy potentials, resulting in the decrease of electron reducibility.Thus, in this case, it should be the electrons from the CB of ZnO reducing CO 2 into CH 3 OH.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes transfer from the VB of ZnO to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , which also results in the decrease of hole oxidizability.The other type is the direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system shown in Fig. 12b.Upon simultaneous light excitation, both g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO phases can generate excited electron-hole pairs.The excited electrons from the CB of ZnO with lower energy can transfer to combine with the photogenerated holes in g-C 3 N 4 , thus preserving the electrons with stronger reducibility in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and holes with stronger oxidizability in the VB of ZnO.Finally, the electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 can react with CO 2 and produce CH 3 OH.In this regard, it should be noted that the interfacial electron transfer actually occurs in opposite directions for the heterojunction-type (g-C 3 N 4 to ZnO) and direct Z-scheme type (ZnO to g-C 3 N 4 ) photocatalytic systems. 16n order to provide clues to understand the underlying mechanism responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G10, the photoluminescence (PL) analyses of the hydroxyl radicals (OH) produced on the surfaces of pure g-C 3 N 4 , G10 and pure ZnO upon light irradiation were rst carried out by using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule.The spectral changes of the G10 sample against irradiation time and the comparison of the PL peak intensity around 423 nm of the G10, pure ZnO and pure g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 13a andb, respectively.As shown in Fig. 13b ) can be produced, thus resulting in the subsequent absence of PL signals.However, if the G10 sample conforms to a direct Z-scheme mechanism (see Fig. 12b), the photogenerated electrons and holes will be respectively preserved in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and the VB of ZnO, maintaining enough reducibility and oxidizability to produce superoxide anion radicals (O 2 A ) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) respectively. The experimental measurement of hydroxyl radicals (OH) also showed that the PL signals of the G10 sample increased almost linearly with irradiation time, whose intensity is more comparable to that of pure ZnO.The presence of PL signals of the G10 samples conrmed that the hydroxyl radicals (OH) were indeed produced on the surface of G10 upon light illumination either in the direct or indirect pathway. 53On the basis of the above PL analyses, the binary g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO composite photocatalytic system is more likely to follow a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism, rather than the conventional heterojunction-type photocatalytic mechanism. To further investigate the specic mechanism accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the G10 sample, the transient photocurrent responses of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 were recorded by using typical switch on-off cycles of light irradiation.In this work, we adopted two light sources with different wavelengths (365 and 420 nm) to carry out the photocurrent measurements to probe the excitation, transfer, separation and recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.Typically, the value of photocurrent density corresponds to the charge collection efficiency and a higher value of the photocurrent response generally means higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.Fig. 14 shows the comparison of photocurrent-time (I-t) curves of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 upon switch on-off cycles of intermittent light irradiation with two different wavelengths.Interestingly, the pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 exhibit different photocurrent performances on the two occasions.For light illumination at a wavelength of 420 nm shown in Fig. 14a, the pure g-C 3 N 4 demonstrates a higher photocurrent density than G10.Because of the large band gap of ZnO (3.2 eV), only the g-C 3 N 4 phase can be effectively excited under this condition.The lower value of photocurrent of G10 can be mainly due to the limited amount of g-C 3 N 4 phase.In contrast, light irradiation at a wavelength of 365 nm on G10 shows drastically increased photocurrent density that is 7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 , as seen in Fig. 14b.On this occasion, the electrons of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 can be excited and contribute to the increase of photocurrent density.But considering the limited amount of ZnO and the overall enhancement of photocatalytic performances, it is highly possible that the excited electrons in the CB of the ZnO phase are critical to the efficient separation of charge carriers within g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion, such a high photocurrent of G10 is achieved via ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 electron transfer to quench the photogenerated holes and extend the lifetime of exited electrons within the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Thus, based on the comparison of the above two situations, the photocurrent measurements further conrmed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity for selective CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH of G10 can be attributed to a direct Z-scheme mechanism.Furthermore, since ZnO and TiO 2 have similar band gaps and band edge positions, the previous construction of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composite photocatalyst reported recently also provides strong support to the above explanation. 44n order to further conrm the direct Z-scheme mechanism proposed above, the electronic band structures of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were obtained using theoretical DFT calculation under the same conditions.The constructed crystal structures and the calculated electronic band structures of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 15 and 16, respectively.On the basis of the obtained band structures, the effective masses of photogenerated electrons and holes of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were calculated by parabolic tting to the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) based on eqn (1), respectively.Basically, the effective mass of a charge carrier is inversely proportional to its moving velocity according to the following eqn (2), where n and m represent the transfer rate and effective mass of a charge carrier, respectively.Thus, a smaller value of charge carrier effective mass corresponds to a faster transfer rate. 545556 m 14 2 (d 2 E/dk 2 ) A1 (1) In order to characterize the charge separation efficiency, we also adopted the concept of relative effective mass of photogenerated holes to electrons according to eqn (3).This concept was also used by other researchers to rationalize the reactivity of photocatalysts based on electronic band structures. 57In general, a higher D value means that the photogenerated electron-hole pairs will have a higher tendency to separate, thus resulting in slower recombination rates and better photocatalytic performance. The obtained results of charge carrier effective mass in both G-Z and G-F directions are shown in Table 2.As seen from Table 2, both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 generally belong to the intrinsic n-type semiconductors with light electrons and heavy holes.However, it should be noted that the D values of ZnO are much higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 in both G-Z and G-F directions, indicating ZnO possesses higher charge separation efficiency than g-C 3 N 4 .Consistent with literature reports, 34,35 the relatively low D values of g-C 3 N 4 in both directions correspond to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Moreover, the calculated electron effective mass (m e ) in the G-Z direction of ZnO (0.034) is far lighter than that of g-C 3 N 4 (3.9),suggesting that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-Z direction exhibit much faster moving rates and higher tendency to transfer than those of g-C 3 N 4 at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Although the absolute value of m e in the G-F direction of ZnO (0.9) is comparable to that of g-C 3 N 4 (0.41), the much higher D value of ZnO (11.5) than g-C 3 N 4 (1.6) still demonstrates that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-F direction have higher probability to transfer rather than to recombine compared with those of g-C 3 N 4 .In this regard, both the lighter photogenerated electrons and the higher charge separation efficiency of ZnO in contrast to g-C 3 N 4 indicate that the electron transfer at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface is more likely to occur in the ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 rather than the g-C 3 N 4 -to-ZnO direction.Thus, the comparison of theoretical effective mass calculations between ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 also strongly supports the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism proposed above."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic (365 nm)", "source": "In this work, we adopted two light sources with different wavelengths (365 and 420 nm) to carry out the photocurrent measurements to probe the excitation, transfer, separation and recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.", "context": "XRD patterns were recorded in Fig. 1 to reveal the phase structure of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system (G10).For the purpose of comparison, XRD patterns of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO obtained through the same preparation method are also shown in Fig. 1.The XRD patterns of the pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibit two pronounced diffraction peaks that were found at 27.4 and 13.1 , respectively.The stronger peak at 27.4 which is attributed to the interlayer stacking of aromatic systems can be indexed to the (002) crystal plane and corresponds to an interlayer distance of 0.326 nm.The weaker (001) peak at around 13.1 with a distance of 0.675 nm can be ascribed to interlayer planar stacking motifs.These two characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are consistent with the previous results. 18,26,33The prepared pure ZnO demonstrates characteristic diffraction peaks with high intensities of the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO phase, which is the most stable and common form of ZnO under ambient conditions.The XRD pattern of the pure ZnO indicates that the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO crystals with high crystallinity can form under the synthetic conditions, which stems from the decomposition of zinc nitrate hexahydrate.For the obtained G10 sample, nearly all of the characteristic diffraction peaks of wurtzite hexagonal ZnO were clearly shown in its XRD pattern without any noticeable shis of diffraction angles (2q), conrming the existence of the ZnO phase.As for the g-C 3 N 4 phase, only the (002) peak of g-C 3 N 4 was obscurely observed whose diffraction intensity was lower compared with that of the ZnO phase.The relatively poor crystallinity of the g-C 3 N 4 phase indicates that the simultaneous crystallization of the ZnO phase interferes with the condensation process and interlayer stacking patterns of the g-C 3 N 4 phase, thus resulting in its weak diffraction intensity.The XRD patterns of both the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase in the G10 sample suggest that these two phases exist separately in the composite and no strong crystal lattice incorporation is observed between these two phases. To investigate the thermostability and measure the g-C 3 N 4 contents in G10, TGA analyses were performed on both the obtained G10 and pure samples, from ambient temperature to 900 C at a heating rate of 10 C min A1 .The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2. For the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the rapid decay of the TGA curve from around 450 C to 600 C represents the typical thermal decomposition of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating its intrinsic thermal instability in this temperature range.No signicant weight loss is observed in the TGA curve of pure ZnO, con-rming the high thermal stability of ZnO.Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the TGA curve decay of the G10 sample starts and ends at lower temperatures, respectively.This suggests that the obtained G10 sample demonstrates lower thermal stability upon heating than the pure g-C 3 N 4 , which is mainly due to the disturbance of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards interlayer stacking motifs of g-C 3 N 4 or the catalyzing effect of ZnO over g-C 3 N 4 thermal decomposition.A similar phenomenon was also observed in other cases such as g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 coupling. 44he relative content of the ZnO phase in the G10 sample is determined to be 44.6,accounting for nearly half the weight composition of G10.Considering the original mass ratio of the precursors of g-C 3 N 4 (urea) and ZnO (zinc nitrate hexahydrate) to be around 10, a signicant amount of urea is estimated to undergo direct thermal decomposition into gases during polycondensation, 45 because the holding temperature of condensation is precisely within the above measured temperature range for pure g-C 3 N 4 decomposition. XPS analyses were performed to investigate the chemical composition and elucidate the elemental chemical states of all samples.As expected, there are four major elemental states detected in the prepared G10 samples, namely C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s.Fig. 3a-d present the comparison of the high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s between G10 and pure samples, respectively.The C 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 has two obvious peaks at binding energies of 284.7 and 287.7 eV.The peak at a binding energy of 284.7 eV can be attributed to the adventitious carbon impurities, whereas the peak at 287.7 eV can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 .Two similar peaks were also observed in the spectra of G10 at binding energies of 284.5 and 287.4 eV, which shied towards the lower energy region by 0.2 and 0.3 eV, respectively.The N 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 shows two clear peaks at binding energies of 398.3 and 400.2 eV, which can be ascribed to sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen atoms involved in triazine (CN-C) units and amino groups (C-N-H), respectively.Moreover, the weak shoulder peak at 404.2 eV accounts for p-excitations.Similar strong peaks at 398.0 and 400.3 eV were also observed in the N 1s spectra of G10, indicating the existence of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.The Zn 2p spectrum of the pure ZnO demonstrates a doublet at binding energies of 1021.3 and 1044.5 eV, assigned to Zn 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 states, respectively.The corresponding peaks of Zn 2p in the G10 spectra appear at 1020.9, 1023, 1044.1 and 1047.4 eV, showing that the original doublet peak splits up into a quartet peak in total.The doublet peak at 1020.9 and 1044.1 eV is attributed to Zn atoms within the ZnO phase, while the other doublet peak at 1023 and 1047.4 eV is ascribed to Zn atoms at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.The splitting of the original doublet peak indicates the possible interfacial hybridization between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase.Furthermore, compared with pure ZnO, the O 1s states of G10 were observed to shi into the higher energy region.Considering only the interfacial Zn atoms, the binding energy of Zn 2p states of G10 also increased in contrast to pure ZnO.Since the binding energy of C 1s and N 1s states of G10 generally decreased compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 phases of G10 exhibit opposite tendency of binding energy shis relative to the pure samples.This opposite tendency suggests that the total electron density shis from the ZnO phase to the g-C 3 N 4 phase and thus causes the formation of N-Zn-O covalent bonds between two phases, mainly due to the backbonding ability of the fully occupied Zn 3d orbitals and the electron dispersive capacity of C-N p-p conjugated structures.The formation of interfacial covalent bonds indicates the intimate contact between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which is also benecial for the formation of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary composite photocatalytic system, thus facilitating the transfer and separation of charge carriers and further promoting the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. 404 Microstructure observation SEM and TEM images were further used to investigate the microstructure and morphology of all the prepared samples.Fig. 4a presents the typical large ZnO microcrystals obtained under the above mentioned synthetic conditions whose sizes have reached tens of micrometers.These microcrystals generally demonstrate well-dened crystal facets, corresponding to their high crystallinity reected by XRD patterns.Fig. 4b andc show the representative highly porous structure of pure g-C 3 N 4 derived from urea, formed by considerable gas release during thermal condensation.45 Fig. 4d and e display the morphology of the obtained G10 sample, which has much more compact structures compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 .Such elimination of high porosity and the transformation into more compact structures are mainly due to the imbedded crystallization process of the ZnO phase within the original pores of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.This results in the formation of an intimate contact interface between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which enhances the charge transfer and separation between the two phases.Fig. 4f presents the HRTEM image of the interface between the two phases.The ZnO phase exists as relatively small nanoparticles surrounded by the g-C 3 N 4 phase, conrming the existence of the interfacial contact proposed above.The denoted lattice fringes with a d spacing of 0.26 nm can be assigned to the (002) crystal plane of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO.46 In order to further conrm the above interfacial contact, the EDX mapping of the prepared G10 sample was performed to investigate the distribution patterns of the component elements.As seen from Fig. 5, all of the four major elements (C, N, Zn, and O) were uniformly distributed in the G10 sample.Combined with previous discussion, the homogenous distribution of the component elements also suggests that the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase within G10 are indeed fully mixed and intimately contacted, rather than existing as separate aggregates in the G10 sample. The specic surface area and porous structure of all the asprepared samples were investigated by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms.The calculated parameters of their physical properties including specic surface area, pore volume and pore diameter are displayed in Table 1.As seen from Table 1, the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ) has a greater specic surface area than the obtained G10 sample (12.8 m 2 g A1 ), which is due to the addition of the ZnO phase.The rather low specic surface area of pure ZnO can be ascribed to the formation of rather large ZnO microcrystals with high crystallinity under the above synthetic conditions, which can be conrmed by direct SEM observation presented in Fig. 4a.isotherms of both G10 and g-C 3 N 4 belong to type IV, indicating the existence of mesopores (2-50 nm). 18Further observations reveal that the adsorption-desorption isotherm of g-C 3 N 4 generally shis upward relative to G10 in the whole relative pressure range, suggesting a higher specic surface area and larger pore volume of pure g-C 3 N 4 .Comparison of pore size distributions also conrms that G10 has less mesopores and smaller pore volumes in contrast to pure g-C 3 N 4 .Also, the results presented in Table 1 calculated by the BJH method show that pure g-C 3 N 4 has a larger pore volume and larger pore diameter than G10.The isotherms and pore size distributions in Fig. 6 are both consistent with the calculated results shown in Table 1.Moreover, the shapes of hysteresis loops of pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 reect that both can be attributed to the type H3, indicating the presence of silt-like pores generated by particle aggregation.Based on the deduction that the crystallization of ZnO and the thermal condensation of g-C 3 N 4 occur simultaneously to form separate phases, the drastic decline of the specic surface area and pore volume of G10 implies that the crystallization of ZnO can ll up the original silt-like pores within the g-C 3 N 4 phase, which can further lead to a high degree of interfacial contact between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase. The electronic structures of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and the G10 sample were evaluated by UV-vis diffuse reectance spectroscopy.As seen in Fig. 7, for pure g-C 3 N 4 , a sharp increase of light absorption occurs at wavelengths shorter than 450 nm, which can be attributed to the intrinsic band gap of g-C 3 N 4 .As denoted by the dashed line, the absorption edge of g-C 3 N 4 at about 450 nm corresponds to a typical band gap of 2.7 eV, which is consistent with the values reported in other literature studies. 26ompared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the as-prepared G10 sample exhibits stronger light absorption in both ultraviolet and visible light regions.The increased absorption of ultraviolet light can be attributed to the existence of the ZnO phase in the sample.The enhancement of visible light absorption can stem from more defect states in the g-C 3 N 4 phase that are introduced by the interference of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards g-C 3 N 4 condensation.Such extended absorption of visible light originated from the effect of introduced defect states is also observed in other reports. 33In general, the G10 sample has stronger absorption in the whole spectrum and can absorb more solar energy for photocatalytic reactions.Thus, it is not surprising that G10 has better sunlight utilization and higher photocatalytic activity than the pure g-C 3 N 4 . FT-IR spectra of the synthesized G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples are demonstrated in Fig. 8.The pure g-C 3 N 4 presents similar features with the previous reports. 18The peaks at 1632 and 1566 cm A1 can be attributed to the C-N stretching vibration modes, while the peaks at 1423, 1323 and 1254 cm A1 belong to aromatic C-N stretching.The representative peak at 810 cm A1 can be ascribed to the characteristic out-of-plane bending modes of triazine units, corresponding to the condensed C-N heterocycles.The broad absorption band at around 3400 cm A1 corresponds to the adsorbed H 2 O molecules and N-H vibrations of the uncondensed amine groups.The general resemblance of FT-IR spectra between the as-prepared G10 sample and the pure g-C 3 N 4 conrms the preserved graphitic nature of the carbon nitride phase in the G10 sample.Compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic peaks of the stretching modes of C-N heterocycles in the range from 1250 to 1650 cm A1 were observed to merge into a broad absorption band in the G10 sample, indicating the inuence of previously mentioned ZnO crystallization.A similar phenomenon of peak mergence was also reported in other literature studies. 47,48The appearance of new peaks at 2183 and 2056 cm A1 indicates the existence of dangling cyanide groups that should serve as intermediates during the polymerization of urea. 49The relative red-shis of cyanide groups compared with the normal wavenumber of 2250 cm A1 are due to the conjugation effect of the extended C-N aromatic system.The emergence of cyanide groups in G10 suggests that the simultaneous ZnO crystallization could interfere with the thermal polymerization of urea to generate a Fig. 6 Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of pure g-C 3 N 4 (black) and G10 (red). Fig. 7 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). well-dened g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion of XRD patterns, TGA curves and UV-vis spectra, such interference of ZnO crystallization can result in relatively poor crystallinity and give rise to more defect states within the g-C 3 N 4 phase. The photocatalytic activity of various samples for CO 2 reduction was evaluated under simulated solar irradiation in the anaerobic environment.Control experiments were performed in the absence of either light illumination or photocatalysts and no appreciable amounts of any hydrocarbon products were found, conrming that light irradiation and photocatalysts are the two essential factors for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions.In this work, the gaseous CO 2 introduced by the in situ reaction between sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloride aqueous solution serves as the only carbon source and the water vapor can also be generated by the reaction.The nal products of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 detected by gas chromatography (GC) are shown in Fig. 9.As seen in Fig. 9, CH 3 OH was the only product detected by the GC FID method for both the G10 sample and pure g-C 3 N 4 .Typically, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex multielectron transfer process, which has the potential to give rise to more than one reduced species including CH 4 , CH 3 OH, HCOOH and HCHO.However, no products other than CH 3 OH were observed for all the as-prepared samples, indicating that both the synthesized pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 samples exhibit good reaction selectivity to convert CO 2 directly into CH 3 OH under solar irradiation.Although the underlying mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction still remains ambiguous until now, there are three possible reasons regarding why CH 3 OH was the only product detected in our experiments: (1) as mentioned above, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction took place at the solid-gas interface and the products were determined by the extracted gas samples under our experimental conditions.If HCOOH and HCHO were indeed produced upon light irradiation, they were more likely to adsorb on the surfaces of samples than CH 3 OH, due to the stronger polarity of HCOOH and HCHO.Thus, only CH 3 OH could easily desorb into the gas phase aer the reaction and then be detected by the GC FID method; (2) as is well known, HCOOH and HCHO are relatively unstable molecules compared with CH 3 OH, which can be readily re-oxidized into CO 2 by the oxygen gas generated during the reaction process; (3) comparatively speaking, the production of CH 4 from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction requires more electrons (8e A ) and protons (8H ) in contrast to CH 3 OH (6e A and 6H ).In this regard, the specic reaction routes and the nal products can be closely associated with the intrinsic properties of the photocatalysts.It is worth mentioning that such good conversion selectivity of g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into CH 3 OH rather than CH 4 was also conrmed by results from other groups. 50,51As is well known, CH 3 OH is one of the most desirable value-added fuels that are easy to store and utilize, while the good selectivity of CH 3 OH generation can also effectively facilitate the subsequent product separation process. The specic CH 3 OH production rates of various samples were calculated from the GC spectra based on the integral area between each peak and baseline.Fig. 10 presents the comparison of CH 3 OH production rates of the commercial ZnO, the prepared pure ZnO, G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples.The CH 3 OH production rate of the obtained pure ZnO (0.37 mmol h A1 g A1 ) is comparable to that of the commercial ZnO (0.32 mmol h A1 g A1 ), showing the considerable photocatalytic activity of single-phase ZnO by utilizing UV light.Despite the high specic surface area and the large pore volume of g-C 3 N 4 , its CH 3 OH production rate (0.26 mmol h A1 g A1 ) still remains relatively low, mainly due to the high recombination rates of photogenerated electrons and holes.However, compared with both the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO, the obtained G10 sample exhibits the highest CH 3 OH production rate (0.6 mmol h A1 g A1 ).On the basis of the results in Table 1, the specic surface area of G10 (12.8 m 2 g A1 ) is drastically reduced in contrast to the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ), possibly because of the intercalated ZnO crystallization within the original pores in the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Although the specic surface area is critical for heterogenous catalysis, the higher production rate of the G10 sample with a lower specic surface area suggests highly efficient charge carrier separation occurring at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Combined with the previous analyses of surface area and microstructure observation, the Fig. 8 FT-IR spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). Fig. 9 GC spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). intimate interfacial contact between the two phases is benecial for the separation of excited charge carriers, the inhibition of unfavorable recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the further promotion of the photocatalytic activity.In this regard, by coupling ZnO with g-C 3 N 4 via a facile approach, we achieved an enhanced photocatalytic reduction rate of CO 2 into CH 3 OH for pure g-C 3 N 4 by a factor of 2.3, while preserving the original reaction selectivity to directly convert CO 2 into CH 3 OH. In general, there are two possible mechanisms accounting for the photocatalytic activity enhancement induced by spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers in binary photocatalytic systems: (1) conventional heterojunction-type and (2) direct Z-scheme type. 52In order to facilitate analyses, schematic comparison regarding band edge positions of g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO together with the standard potentials of relevant redox couples is presented in Fig. 11.As seen in Fig. 11, the energy potentials of conduction bands (CB) of g-C 3 N 4 (A1.12V vs. NHE) and ZnO (A0.2 V vs. NHE) are both more negative than the standard potential of the CO 2 /CH 3 OH redox couple (0.03 V vs. NHE), while the energy potentials of valence bands (VB) of g-C 3 N 4 (1.57V vs. NHE) and ZnO (3.0 V vs. NHE) are both more positive than the standard potential of the O 2 /H 2 O redox couple (1.23 V vs. NHE).In this regard, both the above two mechanisms can be possible in explaining the enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary photocatalytic system.Schematic diagrams illustrating the detailed processes of the above two possible mechanisms in the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system are demonstrated in Fig. 12.In the heterojunction-type photocatalytic system presented in Fig. 12a, the excited electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 with higher energy potentials to the CB of ZnO with lower energy potentials, resulting in the decrease of electron reducibility.Thus, in this case, it should be the electrons from the CB of ZnO reducing CO 2 into CH 3 OH.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes transfer from the VB of ZnO to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , which also results in the decrease of hole oxidizability.The other type is the direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system shown in Fig. 12b.Upon simultaneous light excitation, both g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO phases can generate excited electron-hole pairs.The excited electrons from the CB of ZnO with lower energy can transfer to combine with the photogenerated holes in g-C 3 N 4 , thus preserving the electrons with stronger reducibility in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and holes with stronger oxidizability in the VB of ZnO.Finally, the electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 can react with CO 2 and produce CH 3 OH.In this regard, it should be noted that the interfacial electron transfer actually occurs in opposite directions for the heterojunction-type (g-C 3 N 4 to ZnO) and direct Z-scheme type (ZnO to g-C 3 N 4 ) photocatalytic systems. 16n order to provide clues to understand the underlying mechanism responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G10, the photoluminescence (PL) analyses of the hydroxyl radicals (OH) produced on the surfaces of pure g-C 3 N 4 , G10 and pure ZnO upon light irradiation were rst carried out by using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule.The spectral changes of the G10 sample against irradiation time and the comparison of the PL peak intensity around 423 nm of the G10, pure ZnO and pure g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 13a andb, respectively.As shown in Fig. 13b ) can be produced, thus resulting in the subsequent absence of PL signals.However, if the G10 sample conforms to a direct Z-scheme mechanism (see Fig. 12b), the photogenerated electrons and holes will be respectively preserved in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and the VB of ZnO, maintaining enough reducibility and oxidizability to produce superoxide anion radicals (O 2 A ) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) respectively. The experimental measurement of hydroxyl radicals (OH) also showed that the PL signals of the G10 sample increased almost linearly with irradiation time, whose intensity is more comparable to that of pure ZnO.The presence of PL signals of the G10 samples conrmed that the hydroxyl radicals (OH) were indeed produced on the surface of G10 upon light illumination either in the direct or indirect pathway. 53On the basis of the above PL analyses, the binary g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO composite photocatalytic system is more likely to follow a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism, rather than the conventional heterojunction-type photocatalytic mechanism. To further investigate the specic mechanism accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the G10 sample, the transient photocurrent responses of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 were recorded by using typical switch on-off cycles of light irradiation.In this work, we adopted two light sources with different wavelengths (365 and 420 nm) to carry out the photocurrent measurements to probe the excitation, transfer, separation and recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.Typically, the value of photocurrent density corresponds to the charge collection efficiency and a higher value of the photocurrent response generally means higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.Fig. 14 shows the comparison of photocurrent-time (I-t) curves of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 upon switch on-off cycles of intermittent light irradiation with two different wavelengths.Interestingly, the pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 exhibit different photocurrent performances on the two occasions.For light illumination at a wavelength of 420 nm shown in Fig. 14a, the pure g-C 3 N 4 demonstrates a higher photocurrent density than G10.Because of the large band gap of ZnO (3.2 eV), only the g-C 3 N 4 phase can be effectively excited under this condition.The lower value of photocurrent of G10 can be mainly due to the limited amount of g-C 3 N 4 phase.In contrast, light irradiation at a wavelength of 365 nm on G10 shows drastically increased photocurrent density that is 7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 , as seen in Fig. 14b.On this occasion, the electrons of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 can be excited and contribute to the increase of photocurrent density.But considering the limited amount of ZnO and the overall enhancement of photocatalytic performances, it is highly possible that the excited electrons in the CB of the ZnO phase are critical to the efficient separation of charge carriers within g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion, such a high photocurrent of G10 is achieved via ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 electron transfer to quench the photogenerated holes and extend the lifetime of exited electrons within the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Thus, based on the comparison of the above two situations, the photocurrent measurements further conrmed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity for selective CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH of G10 can be attributed to a direct Z-scheme mechanism.Furthermore, since ZnO and TiO 2 have similar band gaps and band edge positions, the previous construction of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composite photocatalyst reported recently also provides strong support to the above explanation. 44n order to further conrm the direct Z-scheme mechanism proposed above, the electronic band structures of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were obtained using theoretical DFT calculation under the same conditions.The constructed crystal structures and the calculated electronic band structures of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 15 and 16, respectively.On the basis of the obtained band structures, the effective masses of photogenerated electrons and holes of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were calculated by parabolic tting to the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) based on eqn (1), respectively.Basically, the effective mass of a charge carrier is inversely proportional to its moving velocity according to the following eqn (2), where n and m represent the transfer rate and effective mass of a charge carrier, respectively.Thus, a smaller value of charge carrier effective mass corresponds to a faster transfer rate. 545556 m 14 2 (d 2 E/dk 2 ) A1 (1) In order to characterize the charge separation efficiency, we also adopted the concept of relative effective mass of photogenerated holes to electrons according to eqn (3).This concept was also used by other researchers to rationalize the reactivity of photocatalysts based on electronic band structures. 57In general, a higher D value means that the photogenerated electron-hole pairs will have a higher tendency to separate, thus resulting in slower recombination rates and better photocatalytic performance. The obtained results of charge carrier effective mass in both G-Z and G-F directions are shown in Table 2.As seen from Table 2, both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 generally belong to the intrinsic n-type semiconductors with light electrons and heavy holes.However, it should be noted that the D values of ZnO are much higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 in both G-Z and G-F directions, indicating ZnO possesses higher charge separation efficiency than g-C 3 N 4 .Consistent with literature reports, 34,35 the relatively low D values of g-C 3 N 4 in both directions correspond to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Moreover, the calculated electron effective mass (m e ) in the G-Z direction of ZnO (0.034) is far lighter than that of g-C 3 N 4 (3.9),suggesting that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-Z direction exhibit much faster moving rates and higher tendency to transfer than those of g-C 3 N 4 at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Although the absolute value of m e in the G-F direction of ZnO (0.9) is comparable to that of g-C 3 N 4 (0.41), the much higher D value of ZnO (11.5) than g-C 3 N 4 (1.6) still demonstrates that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-F direction have higher probability to transfer rather than to recombine compared with those of g-C 3 N 4 .In this regard, both the lighter photogenerated electrons and the higher charge separation efficiency of ZnO in contrast to g-C 3 N 4 indicate that the electron transfer at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface is more likely to occur in the ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 rather than the g-C 3 N 4 -to-ZnO direction.Thus, the comparison of theoretical effective mass calculations between ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 also strongly supports the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism proposed above."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic (420 nm)", "source": "In this work, we adopted two light sources with different wavelengths (365 and 420 nm) to carry out the photocurrent measurements to probe the excitation, transfer, separation and recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.", "context": "XRD patterns were recorded in Fig. 1 to reveal the phase structure of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system (G10).For the purpose of comparison, XRD patterns of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO obtained through the same preparation method are also shown in Fig. 1.The XRD patterns of the pure g-C 3 N 4 exhibit two pronounced diffraction peaks that were found at 27.4 and 13.1 , respectively.The stronger peak at 27.4 which is attributed to the interlayer stacking of aromatic systems can be indexed to the (002) crystal plane and corresponds to an interlayer distance of 0.326 nm.The weaker (001) peak at around 13.1 with a distance of 0.675 nm can be ascribed to interlayer planar stacking motifs.These two characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are consistent with the previous results. 18,26,33The prepared pure ZnO demonstrates characteristic diffraction peaks with high intensities of the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO phase, which is the most stable and common form of ZnO under ambient conditions.The XRD pattern of the pure ZnO indicates that the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO crystals with high crystallinity can form under the synthetic conditions, which stems from the decomposition of zinc nitrate hexahydrate.For the obtained G10 sample, nearly all of the characteristic diffraction peaks of wurtzite hexagonal ZnO were clearly shown in its XRD pattern without any noticeable shis of diffraction angles (2q), conrming the existence of the ZnO phase.As for the g-C 3 N 4 phase, only the (002) peak of g-C 3 N 4 was obscurely observed whose diffraction intensity was lower compared with that of the ZnO phase.The relatively poor crystallinity of the g-C 3 N 4 phase indicates that the simultaneous crystallization of the ZnO phase interferes with the condensation process and interlayer stacking patterns of the g-C 3 N 4 phase, thus resulting in its weak diffraction intensity.The XRD patterns of both the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase in the G10 sample suggest that these two phases exist separately in the composite and no strong crystal lattice incorporation is observed between these two phases. To investigate the thermostability and measure the g-C 3 N 4 contents in G10, TGA analyses were performed on both the obtained G10 and pure samples, from ambient temperature to 900 C at a heating rate of 10 C min A1 .The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2. For the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the rapid decay of the TGA curve from around 450 C to 600 C represents the typical thermal decomposition of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating its intrinsic thermal instability in this temperature range.No signicant weight loss is observed in the TGA curve of pure ZnO, con-rming the high thermal stability of ZnO.Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the TGA curve decay of the G10 sample starts and ends at lower temperatures, respectively.This suggests that the obtained G10 sample demonstrates lower thermal stability upon heating than the pure g-C 3 N 4 , which is mainly due to the disturbance of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards interlayer stacking motifs of g-C 3 N 4 or the catalyzing effect of ZnO over g-C 3 N 4 thermal decomposition.A similar phenomenon was also observed in other cases such as g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 coupling. 44he relative content of the ZnO phase in the G10 sample is determined to be 44.6,accounting for nearly half the weight composition of G10.Considering the original mass ratio of the precursors of g-C 3 N 4 (urea) and ZnO (zinc nitrate hexahydrate) to be around 10, a signicant amount of urea is estimated to undergo direct thermal decomposition into gases during polycondensation, 45 because the holding temperature of condensation is precisely within the above measured temperature range for pure g-C 3 N 4 decomposition. XPS analyses were performed to investigate the chemical composition and elucidate the elemental chemical states of all samples.As expected, there are four major elemental states detected in the prepared G10 samples, namely C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s.Fig. 3a-d present the comparison of the high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s between G10 and pure samples, respectively.The C 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 has two obvious peaks at binding energies of 284.7 and 287.7 eV.The peak at a binding energy of 284.7 eV can be attributed to the adventitious carbon impurities, whereas the peak at 287.7 eV can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 .Two similar peaks were also observed in the spectra of G10 at binding energies of 284.5 and 287.4 eV, which shied towards the lower energy region by 0.2 and 0.3 eV, respectively.The N 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 shows two clear peaks at binding energies of 398.3 and 400.2 eV, which can be ascribed to sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen atoms involved in triazine (CN-C) units and amino groups (C-N-H), respectively.Moreover, the weak shoulder peak at 404.2 eV accounts for p-excitations.Similar strong peaks at 398.0 and 400.3 eV were also observed in the N 1s spectra of G10, indicating the existence of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.The Zn 2p spectrum of the pure ZnO demonstrates a doublet at binding energies of 1021.3 and 1044.5 eV, assigned to Zn 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 states, respectively.The corresponding peaks of Zn 2p in the G10 spectra appear at 1020.9, 1023, 1044.1 and 1047.4 eV, showing that the original doublet peak splits up into a quartet peak in total.The doublet peak at 1020.9 and 1044.1 eV is attributed to Zn atoms within the ZnO phase, while the other doublet peak at 1023 and 1047.4 eV is ascribed to Zn atoms at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.The splitting of the original doublet peak indicates the possible interfacial hybridization between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase.Furthermore, compared with pure ZnO, the O 1s states of G10 were observed to shi into the higher energy region.Considering only the interfacial Zn atoms, the binding energy of Zn 2p states of G10 also increased in contrast to pure ZnO.Since the binding energy of C 1s and N 1s states of G10 generally decreased compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 phases of G10 exhibit opposite tendency of binding energy shis relative to the pure samples.This opposite tendency suggests that the total electron density shis from the ZnO phase to the g-C 3 N 4 phase and thus causes the formation of N-Zn-O covalent bonds between two phases, mainly due to the backbonding ability of the fully occupied Zn 3d orbitals and the electron dispersive capacity of C-N p-p conjugated structures.The formation of interfacial covalent bonds indicates the intimate contact between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which is also benecial for the formation of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary composite photocatalytic system, thus facilitating the transfer and separation of charge carriers and further promoting the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. 404 Microstructure observation SEM and TEM images were further used to investigate the microstructure and morphology of all the prepared samples.Fig. 4a presents the typical large ZnO microcrystals obtained under the above mentioned synthetic conditions whose sizes have reached tens of micrometers.These microcrystals generally demonstrate well-dened crystal facets, corresponding to their high crystallinity reected by XRD patterns.Fig. 4b andc show the representative highly porous structure of pure g-C 3 N 4 derived from urea, formed by considerable gas release during thermal condensation.45 Fig. 4d and e display the morphology of the obtained G10 sample, which has much more compact structures compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 .Such elimination of high porosity and the transformation into more compact structures are mainly due to the imbedded crystallization process of the ZnO phase within the original pores of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.This results in the formation of an intimate contact interface between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which enhances the charge transfer and separation between the two phases.Fig. 4f presents the HRTEM image of the interface between the two phases.The ZnO phase exists as relatively small nanoparticles surrounded by the g-C 3 N 4 phase, conrming the existence of the interfacial contact proposed above.The denoted lattice fringes with a d spacing of 0.26 nm can be assigned to the (002) crystal plane of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO.46 In order to further conrm the above interfacial contact, the EDX mapping of the prepared G10 sample was performed to investigate the distribution patterns of the component elements.As seen from Fig. 5, all of the four major elements (C, N, Zn, and O) were uniformly distributed in the G10 sample.Combined with previous discussion, the homogenous distribution of the component elements also suggests that the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase within G10 are indeed fully mixed and intimately contacted, rather than existing as separate aggregates in the G10 sample. The specic surface area and porous structure of all the asprepared samples were investigated by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms.The calculated parameters of their physical properties including specic surface area, pore volume and pore diameter are displayed in Table 1.As seen from Table 1, the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ) has a greater specic surface area than the obtained G10 sample (12.8 m 2 g A1 ), which is due to the addition of the ZnO phase.The rather low specic surface area of pure ZnO can be ascribed to the formation of rather large ZnO microcrystals with high crystallinity under the above synthetic conditions, which can be conrmed by direct SEM observation presented in Fig. 4a.isotherms of both G10 and g-C 3 N 4 belong to type IV, indicating the existence of mesopores (2-50 nm). 18Further observations reveal that the adsorption-desorption isotherm of g-C 3 N 4 generally shis upward relative to G10 in the whole relative pressure range, suggesting a higher specic surface area and larger pore volume of pure g-C 3 N 4 .Comparison of pore size distributions also conrms that G10 has less mesopores and smaller pore volumes in contrast to pure g-C 3 N 4 .Also, the results presented in Table 1 calculated by the BJH method show that pure g-C 3 N 4 has a larger pore volume and larger pore diameter than G10.The isotherms and pore size distributions in Fig. 6 are both consistent with the calculated results shown in Table 1.Moreover, the shapes of hysteresis loops of pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 reect that both can be attributed to the type H3, indicating the presence of silt-like pores generated by particle aggregation.Based on the deduction that the crystallization of ZnO and the thermal condensation of g-C 3 N 4 occur simultaneously to form separate phases, the drastic decline of the specic surface area and pore volume of G10 implies that the crystallization of ZnO can ll up the original silt-like pores within the g-C 3 N 4 phase, which can further lead to a high degree of interfacial contact between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase. The electronic structures of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and the G10 sample were evaluated by UV-vis diffuse reectance spectroscopy.As seen in Fig. 7, for pure g-C 3 N 4 , a sharp increase of light absorption occurs at wavelengths shorter than 450 nm, which can be attributed to the intrinsic band gap of g-C 3 N 4 .As denoted by the dashed line, the absorption edge of g-C 3 N 4 at about 450 nm corresponds to a typical band gap of 2.7 eV, which is consistent with the values reported in other literature studies. 26ompared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the as-prepared G10 sample exhibits stronger light absorption in both ultraviolet and visible light regions.The increased absorption of ultraviolet light can be attributed to the existence of the ZnO phase in the sample.The enhancement of visible light absorption can stem from more defect states in the g-C 3 N 4 phase that are introduced by the interference of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards g-C 3 N 4 condensation.Such extended absorption of visible light originated from the effect of introduced defect states is also observed in other reports. 33In general, the G10 sample has stronger absorption in the whole spectrum and can absorb more solar energy for photocatalytic reactions.Thus, it is not surprising that G10 has better sunlight utilization and higher photocatalytic activity than the pure g-C 3 N 4 . FT-IR spectra of the synthesized G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples are demonstrated in Fig. 8.The pure g-C 3 N 4 presents similar features with the previous reports. 18The peaks at 1632 and 1566 cm A1 can be attributed to the C-N stretching vibration modes, while the peaks at 1423, 1323 and 1254 cm A1 belong to aromatic C-N stretching.The representative peak at 810 cm A1 can be ascribed to the characteristic out-of-plane bending modes of triazine units, corresponding to the condensed C-N heterocycles.The broad absorption band at around 3400 cm A1 corresponds to the adsorbed H 2 O molecules and N-H vibrations of the uncondensed amine groups.The general resemblance of FT-IR spectra between the as-prepared G10 sample and the pure g-C 3 N 4 conrms the preserved graphitic nature of the carbon nitride phase in the G10 sample.Compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic peaks of the stretching modes of C-N heterocycles in the range from 1250 to 1650 cm A1 were observed to merge into a broad absorption band in the G10 sample, indicating the inuence of previously mentioned ZnO crystallization.A similar phenomenon of peak mergence was also reported in other literature studies. 47,48The appearance of new peaks at 2183 and 2056 cm A1 indicates the existence of dangling cyanide groups that should serve as intermediates during the polymerization of urea. 49The relative red-shis of cyanide groups compared with the normal wavenumber of 2250 cm A1 are due to the conjugation effect of the extended C-N aromatic system.The emergence of cyanide groups in G10 suggests that the simultaneous ZnO crystallization could interfere with the thermal polymerization of urea to generate a Fig. 6 Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of pure g-C 3 N 4 (black) and G10 (red). Fig. 7 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). well-dened g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion of XRD patterns, TGA curves and UV-vis spectra, such interference of ZnO crystallization can result in relatively poor crystallinity and give rise to more defect states within the g-C 3 N 4 phase. The photocatalytic activity of various samples for CO 2 reduction was evaluated under simulated solar irradiation in the anaerobic environment.Control experiments were performed in the absence of either light illumination or photocatalysts and no appreciable amounts of any hydrocarbon products were found, conrming that light irradiation and photocatalysts are the two essential factors for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions.In this work, the gaseous CO 2 introduced by the in situ reaction between sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloride aqueous solution serves as the only carbon source and the water vapor can also be generated by the reaction.The nal products of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 detected by gas chromatography (GC) are shown in Fig. 9.As seen in Fig. 9, CH 3 OH was the only product detected by the GC FID method for both the G10 sample and pure g-C 3 N 4 .Typically, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex multielectron transfer process, which has the potential to give rise to more than one reduced species including CH 4 , CH 3 OH, HCOOH and HCHO.However, no products other than CH 3 OH were observed for all the as-prepared samples, indicating that both the synthesized pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 samples exhibit good reaction selectivity to convert CO 2 directly into CH 3 OH under solar irradiation.Although the underlying mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction still remains ambiguous until now, there are three possible reasons regarding why CH 3 OH was the only product detected in our experiments: (1) as mentioned above, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction took place at the solid-gas interface and the products were determined by the extracted gas samples under our experimental conditions.If HCOOH and HCHO were indeed produced upon light irradiation, they were more likely to adsorb on the surfaces of samples than CH 3 OH, due to the stronger polarity of HCOOH and HCHO.Thus, only CH 3 OH could easily desorb into the gas phase aer the reaction and then be detected by the GC FID method; (2) as is well known, HCOOH and HCHO are relatively unstable molecules compared with CH 3 OH, which can be readily re-oxidized into CO 2 by the oxygen gas generated during the reaction process; (3) comparatively speaking, the production of CH 4 from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction requires more electrons (8e A ) and protons (8H ) in contrast to CH 3 OH (6e A and 6H ).In this regard, the specic reaction routes and the nal products can be closely associated with the intrinsic properties of the photocatalysts.It is worth mentioning that such good conversion selectivity of g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into CH 3 OH rather than CH 4 was also conrmed by results from other groups. 50,51As is well known, CH 3 OH is one of the most desirable value-added fuels that are easy to store and utilize, while the good selectivity of CH 3 OH generation can also effectively facilitate the subsequent product separation process. The specic CH 3 OH production rates of various samples were calculated from the GC spectra based on the integral area between each peak and baseline.Fig. 10 presents the comparison of CH 3 OH production rates of the commercial ZnO, the prepared pure ZnO, G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples.The CH 3 OH production rate of the obtained pure ZnO (0.37 mmol h A1 g A1 ) is comparable to that of the commercial ZnO (0.32 mmol h A1 g A1 ), showing the considerable photocatalytic activity of single-phase ZnO by utilizing UV light.Despite the high specic surface area and the large pore volume of g-C 3 N 4 , its CH 3 OH production rate (0.26 mmol h A1 g A1 ) still remains relatively low, mainly due to the high recombination rates of photogenerated electrons and holes.However, compared with both the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO, the obtained G10 sample exhibits the highest CH 3 OH production rate (0.6 mmol h A1 g A1 ).On the basis of the results in Table 1, the specic surface area of G10 (12.8 m 2 g A1 ) is drastically reduced in contrast to the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ), possibly because of the intercalated ZnO crystallization within the original pores in the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Although the specic surface area is critical for heterogenous catalysis, the higher production rate of the G10 sample with a lower specic surface area suggests highly efficient charge carrier separation occurring at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Combined with the previous analyses of surface area and microstructure observation, the Fig. 8 FT-IR spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). Fig. 9 GC spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). intimate interfacial contact between the two phases is benecial for the separation of excited charge carriers, the inhibition of unfavorable recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the further promotion of the photocatalytic activity.In this regard, by coupling ZnO with g-C 3 N 4 via a facile approach, we achieved an enhanced photocatalytic reduction rate of CO 2 into CH 3 OH for pure g-C 3 N 4 by a factor of 2.3, while preserving the original reaction selectivity to directly convert CO 2 into CH 3 OH. In general, there are two possible mechanisms accounting for the photocatalytic activity enhancement induced by spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers in binary photocatalytic systems: (1) conventional heterojunction-type and (2) direct Z-scheme type. 52In order to facilitate analyses, schematic comparison regarding band edge positions of g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO together with the standard potentials of relevant redox couples is presented in Fig. 11.As seen in Fig. 11, the energy potentials of conduction bands (CB) of g-C 3 N 4 (A1.12V vs. NHE) and ZnO (A0.2 V vs. NHE) are both more negative than the standard potential of the CO 2 /CH 3 OH redox couple (0.03 V vs. NHE), while the energy potentials of valence bands (VB) of g-C 3 N 4 (1.57V vs. NHE) and ZnO (3.0 V vs. NHE) are both more positive than the standard potential of the O 2 /H 2 O redox couple (1.23 V vs. NHE).In this regard, both the above two mechanisms can be possible in explaining the enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary photocatalytic system.Schematic diagrams illustrating the detailed processes of the above two possible mechanisms in the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system are demonstrated in Fig. 12.In the heterojunction-type photocatalytic system presented in Fig. 12a, the excited electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 with higher energy potentials to the CB of ZnO with lower energy potentials, resulting in the decrease of electron reducibility.Thus, in this case, it should be the electrons from the CB of ZnO reducing CO 2 into CH 3 OH.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes transfer from the VB of ZnO to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , which also results in the decrease of hole oxidizability.The other type is the direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system shown in Fig. 12b.Upon simultaneous light excitation, both g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO phases can generate excited electron-hole pairs.The excited electrons from the CB of ZnO with lower energy can transfer to combine with the photogenerated holes in g-C 3 N 4 , thus preserving the electrons with stronger reducibility in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and holes with stronger oxidizability in the VB of ZnO.Finally, the electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 can react with CO 2 and produce CH 3 OH.In this regard, it should be noted that the interfacial electron transfer actually occurs in opposite directions for the heterojunction-type (g-C 3 N 4 to ZnO) and direct Z-scheme type (ZnO to g-C 3 N 4 ) photocatalytic systems. 16n order to provide clues to understand the underlying mechanism responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G10, the photoluminescence (PL) analyses of the hydroxyl radicals (OH) produced on the surfaces of pure g-C 3 N 4 , G10 and pure ZnO upon light irradiation were rst carried out by using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule.The spectral changes of the G10 sample against irradiation time and the comparison of the PL peak intensity around 423 nm of the G10, pure ZnO and pure g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 13a andb, respectively.As shown in Fig. 13b ) can be produced, thus resulting in the subsequent absence of PL signals.However, if the G10 sample conforms to a direct Z-scheme mechanism (see Fig. 12b), the photogenerated electrons and holes will be respectively preserved in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and the VB of ZnO, maintaining enough reducibility and oxidizability to produce superoxide anion radicals (O 2 A ) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) respectively. The experimental measurement of hydroxyl radicals (OH) also showed that the PL signals of the G10 sample increased almost linearly with irradiation time, whose intensity is more comparable to that of pure ZnO.The presence of PL signals of the G10 samples conrmed that the hydroxyl radicals (OH) were indeed produced on the surface of G10 upon light illumination either in the direct or indirect pathway. 53On the basis of the above PL analyses, the binary g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO composite photocatalytic system is more likely to follow a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism, rather than the conventional heterojunction-type photocatalytic mechanism. To further investigate the specic mechanism accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the G10 sample, the transient photocurrent responses of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 were recorded by using typical switch on-off cycles of light irradiation.In this work, we adopted two light sources with different wavelengths (365 and 420 nm) to carry out the photocurrent measurements to probe the excitation, transfer, separation and recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.Typically, the value of photocurrent density corresponds to the charge collection efficiency and a higher value of the photocurrent response generally means higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.Fig. 14 shows the comparison of photocurrent-time (I-t) curves of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 upon switch on-off cycles of intermittent light irradiation with two different wavelengths.Interestingly, the pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 exhibit different photocurrent performances on the two occasions.For light illumination at a wavelength of 420 nm shown in Fig. 14a, the pure g-C 3 N 4 demonstrates a higher photocurrent density than G10.Because of the large band gap of ZnO (3.2 eV), only the g-C 3 N 4 phase can be effectively excited under this condition.The lower value of photocurrent of G10 can be mainly due to the limited amount of g-C 3 N 4 phase.In contrast, light irradiation at a wavelength of 365 nm on G10 shows drastically increased photocurrent density that is 7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 , as seen in Fig. 14b.On this occasion, the electrons of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 can be excited and contribute to the increase of photocurrent density.But considering the limited amount of ZnO and the overall enhancement of photocatalytic performances, it is highly possible that the excited electrons in the CB of the ZnO phase are critical to the efficient separation of charge carriers within g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion, such a high photocurrent of G10 is achieved via ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 electron transfer to quench the photogenerated holes and extend the lifetime of exited electrons within the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Thus, based on the comparison of the above two situations, the photocurrent measurements further conrmed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity for selective CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH of G10 can be attributed to a direct Z-scheme mechanism.Furthermore, since ZnO and TiO 2 have similar band gaps and band edge positions, the previous construction of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composite photocatalyst reported recently also provides strong support to the above explanation. 44n order to further conrm the direct Z-scheme mechanism proposed above, the electronic band structures of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were obtained using theoretical DFT calculation under the same conditions.The constructed crystal structures and the calculated electronic band structures of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 15 and 16, respectively.On the basis of the obtained band structures, the effective masses of photogenerated electrons and holes of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were calculated by parabolic tting to the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) based on eqn (1), respectively.Basically, the effective mass of a charge carrier is inversely proportional to its moving velocity according to the following eqn (2), where n and m represent the transfer rate and effective mass of a charge carrier, respectively.Thus, a smaller value of charge carrier effective mass corresponds to a faster transfer rate. 545556 m 14 2 (d 2 E/dk 2 ) A1 (1) In order to characterize the charge separation efficiency, we also adopted the concept of relative effective mass of photogenerated holes to electrons according to eqn (3).This concept was also used by other researchers to rationalize the reactivity of photocatalysts based on electronic band structures. 57In general, a higher D value means that the photogenerated electron-hole pairs will have a higher tendency to separate, thus resulting in slower recombination rates and better photocatalytic performance. The obtained results of charge carrier effective mass in both G-Z and G-F directions are shown in Table 2.As seen from Table 2, both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 generally belong to the intrinsic n-type semiconductors with light electrons and heavy holes.However, it should be noted that the D values of ZnO are much higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 in both G-Z and G-F directions, indicating ZnO possesses higher charge separation efficiency than g-C 3 N 4 .Consistent with literature reports, 34,35 the relatively low D values of g-C 3 N 4 in both directions correspond to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Moreover, the calculated electron effective mass (m e ) in the G-Z direction of ZnO (0.034) is far lighter than that of g-C 3 N 4 (3.9),suggesting that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-Z direction exhibit much faster moving rates and higher tendency to transfer than those of g-C 3 N 4 at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Although the absolute value of m e in the G-F direction of ZnO (0.9) is comparable to that of g-C 3 N 4 (0.41), the much higher D value of ZnO (11.5) than g-C 3 N 4 (1.6) still demonstrates that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-F direction have higher probability to transfer rather than to recombine compared with those of g-C 3 N 4 .In this regard, both the lighter photogenerated electrons and the higher charge separation efficiency of ZnO in contrast to g-C 3 N 4 indicate that the electron transfer at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface is more likely to occur in the ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 rather than the g-C 3 N 4 -to-ZnO direction.Thus, the comparison of theoretical effective mass calculations between ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 also strongly supports the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism proposed above."}, {"llm generation": "Monochromatic", "source": "Fig. 14 Transient photocurrent responses of G10 and g-C 3 N 4 under light irradiation at wavelength of (a) 420 nm and (b) 365 nm in 1 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution.", "context": "In summary, a direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary composite photocatalytic system was successfully constructed via a onestep facile calcination method utilizing affordable urea and zinc nitrate hexahydrate as precursors.The characterization results show that simultaneous ZnO crystallization takes place within the original pores of g-C 3 N 4 during urea polycondensation, thus leading to two separate phases with intimate interfacial contact.The g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system exhibits stronger and extended light absorption in the visible light range than pure g-C 3 N 4 , which is due to more defect states in the g-C 3 N 4 phase introduced by the interference of ZnO crystallization.Also, the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalyst demonstrates 2.3 times higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction into CH 3 OH with preserved reaction selectivity compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 .The overall enhancement of photoactivity of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary photocatalytic system is attributed to a direct Z-scheme mechanism rather than the conventional heterojunction-type mechanism, which is further conrmed by PL analyses of hydroxyl radicals, photocurrent measurements and DFT calculations of charge carrier effective mass.Considering the improved photoactivity and maintained reaction selectivity of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO system, this work will not only illustrate the coupling effect of ZnO on the enhanced photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 via a direct Z-scheme mechanism, but also provide unprecedented insights into the further construction of direct Z-scheme photocatalytic systems without an electron mediator for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions.

To investigate the thermostability and measure the g-C 3 N 4 contents in G10, TGA analyses were performed on both the obtained G10 and pure samples, from ambient temperature to 900 C at a heating rate of 10 C min A1 .The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2. For the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the rapid decay of the TGA curve from around 450 C to 600 C represents the typical thermal decomposition of g-C 3 N 4 , indicating its intrinsic thermal instability in this temperature range.No signicant weight loss is observed in the TGA curve of pure ZnO, con-rming the high thermal stability of ZnO.Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the TGA curve decay of the G10 sample starts and ends at lower temperatures, respectively.This suggests that the obtained G10 sample demonstrates lower thermal stability upon heating than the pure g-C 3 N 4 , which is mainly due to the disturbance of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards interlayer stacking motifs of g-C 3 N 4 or the catalyzing effect of ZnO over g-C 3 N 4 thermal decomposition.A similar phenomenon was also observed in other cases such as g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 coupling. 44he relative content of the ZnO phase in the G10 sample is determined to be 44.6,accounting for nearly half the weight composition of G10.Considering the original mass ratio of the precursors of g-C 3 N 4 (urea) and ZnO (zinc nitrate hexahydrate) to be around 10, a signicant amount of urea is estimated to undergo direct thermal decomposition into gases during polycondensation, 45 because the holding temperature of condensation is precisely within the above measured temperature range for pure g-C 3 N 4 decomposition. XPS analyses were performed to investigate the chemical composition and elucidate the elemental chemical states of all samples.As expected, there are four major elemental states detected in the prepared G10 samples, namely C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s.Fig. 3a-d present the comparison of the high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, Zn 2p and O 1s between G10 and pure samples, respectively.The C 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 has two obvious peaks at binding energies of 284.7 and 287.7 eV.The peak at a binding energy of 284.7 eV can be attributed to the adventitious carbon impurities, whereas the peak at 287.7 eV can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 .Two similar peaks were also observed in the spectra of G10 at binding energies of 284.5 and 287.4 eV, which shied towards the lower energy region by 0.2 and 0.3 eV, respectively.The N 1s spectrum of pure g-C 3 N 4 shows two clear peaks at binding energies of 398.3 and 400.2 eV, which can be ascribed to sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen atoms involved in triazine (CN-C) units and amino groups (C-N-H), respectively.Moreover, the weak shoulder peak at 404.2 eV accounts for p-excitations.Similar strong peaks at 398.0 and 400.3 eV were also observed in the N 1s spectra of G10, indicating the existence of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.The Zn 2p spectrum of the pure ZnO demonstrates a doublet at binding energies of 1021.3 and 1044.5 eV, assigned to Zn 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 states, respectively.The corresponding peaks of Zn 2p in the G10 spectra appear at 1020.9, 1023, 1044.1 and 1047.4 eV, showing that the original doublet peak splits up into a quartet peak in total.The doublet peak at 1020.9 and 1044.1 eV is attributed to Zn atoms within the ZnO phase, while the other doublet peak at 1023 and 1047.4 eV is ascribed to Zn atoms at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.The splitting of the original doublet peak indicates the possible interfacial hybridization between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase.Furthermore, compared with pure ZnO, the O 1s states of G10 were observed to shi into the higher energy region.Considering only the interfacial Zn atoms, the binding energy of Zn 2p states of G10 also increased in contrast to pure ZnO.Since the binding energy of C 1s and N 1s states of G10 generally decreased compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 phases of G10 exhibit opposite tendency of binding energy shis relative to the pure samples.This opposite tendency suggests that the total electron density shis from the ZnO phase to the g-C 3 N 4 phase and thus causes the formation of N-Zn-O covalent bonds between two phases, mainly due to the backbonding ability of the fully occupied Zn 3d orbitals and the electron dispersive capacity of C-N p-p conjugated structures.The formation of interfacial covalent bonds indicates the intimate contact between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which is also benecial for the formation of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary composite photocatalytic system, thus facilitating the transfer and separation of charge carriers and further promoting the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. 404 Microstructure observation SEM and TEM images were further used to investigate the microstructure and morphology of all the prepared samples.Fig. 4a presents the typical large ZnO microcrystals obtained under the above mentioned synthetic conditions whose sizes have reached tens of micrometers.These microcrystals generally demonstrate well-dened crystal facets, corresponding to their high crystallinity reected by XRD patterns.Fig. 4b andc show the representative highly porous structure of pure g-C 3 N 4 derived from urea, formed by considerable gas release during thermal condensation.45 Fig. 4d and e display the morphology of the obtained G10 sample, which has much more compact structures compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 .Such elimination of high porosity and the transformation into more compact structures are mainly due to the imbedded crystallization process of the ZnO phase within the original pores of the g-C 3 N 4 phase.This results in the formation of an intimate contact interface between the ZnO phase and g-C 3 N 4 phase, which enhances the charge transfer and separation between the two phases.Fig. 4f presents the HRTEM image of the interface between the two phases.The ZnO phase exists as relatively small nanoparticles surrounded by the g-C 3 N 4 phase, conrming the existence of the interfacial contact proposed above.The denoted lattice fringes with a d spacing of 0.26 nm can be assigned to the (002) crystal plane of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO.46 In order to further conrm the above interfacial contact, the EDX mapping of the prepared G10 sample was performed to investigate the distribution patterns of the component elements.As seen from Fig. 5, all of the four major elements (C, N, Zn, and O) were uniformly distributed in the G10 sample.Combined with previous discussion, the homogenous distribution of the component elements also suggests that the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase within G10 are indeed fully mixed and intimately contacted, rather than existing as separate aggregates in the G10 sample. The specic surface area and porous structure of all the asprepared samples were investigated by nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms.The calculated parameters of their physical properties including specic surface area, pore volume and pore diameter are displayed in Table 1.As seen from Table 1, the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ) has a greater specic surface area than the obtained G10 sample (12.8 m 2 g A1 ), which is due to the addition of the ZnO phase.The rather low specic surface area of pure ZnO can be ascribed to the formation of rather large ZnO microcrystals with high crystallinity under the above synthetic conditions, which can be conrmed by direct SEM observation presented in Fig. 4a.isotherms of both G10 and g-C 3 N 4 belong to type IV, indicating the existence of mesopores (2-50 nm). 18Further observations reveal that the adsorption-desorption isotherm of g-C 3 N 4 generally shis upward relative to G10 in the whole relative pressure range, suggesting a higher specic surface area and larger pore volume of pure g-C 3 N 4 .Comparison of pore size distributions also conrms that G10 has less mesopores and smaller pore volumes in contrast to pure g-C 3 N 4 .Also, the results presented in Table 1 calculated by the BJH method show that pure g-C 3 N 4 has a larger pore volume and larger pore diameter than G10.The isotherms and pore size distributions in Fig. 6 are both consistent with the calculated results shown in Table 1.Moreover, the shapes of hysteresis loops of pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 reect that both can be attributed to the type H3, indicating the presence of silt-like pores generated by particle aggregation.Based on the deduction that the crystallization of ZnO and the thermal condensation of g-C 3 N 4 occur simultaneously to form separate phases, the drastic decline of the specic surface area and pore volume of G10 implies that the crystallization of ZnO can ll up the original silt-like pores within the g-C 3 N 4 phase, which can further lead to a high degree of interfacial contact between the g-C 3 N 4 phase and ZnO phase. The electronic structures of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and the G10 sample were evaluated by UV-vis diffuse reectance spectroscopy.As seen in Fig. 7, for pure g-C 3 N 4 , a sharp increase of light absorption occurs at wavelengths shorter than 450 nm, which can be attributed to the intrinsic band gap of g-C 3 N 4 .As denoted by the dashed line, the absorption edge of g-C 3 N 4 at about 450 nm corresponds to a typical band gap of 2.7 eV, which is consistent with the values reported in other literature studies. 26ompared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the as-prepared G10 sample exhibits stronger light absorption in both ultraviolet and visible light regions.The increased absorption of ultraviolet light can be attributed to the existence of the ZnO phase in the sample.The enhancement of visible light absorption can stem from more defect states in the g-C 3 N 4 phase that are introduced by the interference of simultaneous ZnO crystallization towards g-C 3 N 4 condensation.Such extended absorption of visible light originated from the effect of introduced defect states is also observed in other reports. 33In general, the G10 sample has stronger absorption in the whole spectrum and can absorb more solar energy for photocatalytic reactions.Thus, it is not surprising that G10 has better sunlight utilization and higher photocatalytic activity than the pure g-C 3 N 4 . FT-IR spectra of the synthesized G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples are demonstrated in Fig. 8.The pure g-C 3 N 4 presents similar features with the previous reports. 18The peaks at 1632 and 1566 cm A1 can be attributed to the C-N stretching vibration modes, while the peaks at 1423, 1323 and 1254 cm A1 belong to aromatic C-N stretching.The representative peak at 810 cm A1 can be ascribed to the characteristic out-of-plane bending modes of triazine units, corresponding to the condensed C-N heterocycles.The broad absorption band at around 3400 cm A1 corresponds to the adsorbed H 2 O molecules and N-H vibrations of the uncondensed amine groups.The general resemblance of FT-IR spectra between the as-prepared G10 sample and the pure g-C 3 N 4 conrms the preserved graphitic nature of the carbon nitride phase in the G10 sample.Compared with the pure g-C 3 N 4 , the characteristic peaks of the stretching modes of C-N heterocycles in the range from 1250 to 1650 cm A1 were observed to merge into a broad absorption band in the G10 sample, indicating the inuence of previously mentioned ZnO crystallization.A similar phenomenon of peak mergence was also reported in other literature studies. 47,48The appearance of new peaks at 2183 and 2056 cm A1 indicates the existence of dangling cyanide groups that should serve as intermediates during the polymerization of urea. 49The relative red-shis of cyanide groups compared with the normal wavenumber of 2250 cm A1 are due to the conjugation effect of the extended C-N aromatic system.The emergence of cyanide groups in G10 suggests that the simultaneous ZnO crystallization could interfere with the thermal polymerization of urea to generate a Fig. 6 Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of pure g-C 3 N 4 (black) and G10 (red). Fig. 7 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). well-dened g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion of XRD patterns, TGA curves and UV-vis spectra, such interference of ZnO crystallization can result in relatively poor crystallinity and give rise to more defect states within the g-C 3 N 4 phase. The photocatalytic activity of various samples for CO 2 reduction was evaluated under simulated solar irradiation in the anaerobic environment.Control experiments were performed in the absence of either light illumination or photocatalysts and no appreciable amounts of any hydrocarbon products were found, conrming that light irradiation and photocatalysts are the two essential factors for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions.In this work, the gaseous CO 2 introduced by the in situ reaction between sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloride aqueous solution serves as the only carbon source and the water vapor can also be generated by the reaction.The nal products of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 detected by gas chromatography (GC) are shown in Fig. 9.As seen in Fig. 9, CH 3 OH was the only product detected by the GC FID method for both the G10 sample and pure g-C 3 N 4 .Typically, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a complex multielectron transfer process, which has the potential to give rise to more than one reduced species including CH 4 , CH 3 OH, HCOOH and HCHO.However, no products other than CH 3 OH were observed for all the as-prepared samples, indicating that both the synthesized pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 samples exhibit good reaction selectivity to convert CO 2 directly into CH 3 OH under solar irradiation.Although the underlying mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction still remains ambiguous until now, there are three possible reasons regarding why CH 3 OH was the only product detected in our experiments: (1) as mentioned above, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction took place at the solid-gas interface and the products were determined by the extracted gas samples under our experimental conditions.If HCOOH and HCHO were indeed produced upon light irradiation, they were more likely to adsorb on the surfaces of samples than CH 3 OH, due to the stronger polarity of HCOOH and HCHO.Thus, only CH 3 OH could easily desorb into the gas phase aer the reaction and then be detected by the GC FID method; (2) as is well known, HCOOH and HCHO are relatively unstable molecules compared with CH 3 OH, which can be readily re-oxidized into CO 2 by the oxygen gas generated during the reaction process; (3) comparatively speaking, the production of CH 4 from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction requires more electrons (8e A ) and protons (8H ) in contrast to CH 3 OH (6e A and 6H ).In this regard, the specic reaction routes and the nal products can be closely associated with the intrinsic properties of the photocatalysts.It is worth mentioning that such good conversion selectivity of g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into CH 3 OH rather than CH 4 was also conrmed by results from other groups. 50,51As is well known, CH 3 OH is one of the most desirable value-added fuels that are easy to store and utilize, while the good selectivity of CH 3 OH generation can also effectively facilitate the subsequent product separation process. The specic CH 3 OH production rates of various samples were calculated from the GC spectra based on the integral area between each peak and baseline.Fig. 10 presents the comparison of CH 3 OH production rates of the commercial ZnO, the prepared pure ZnO, G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 samples.The CH 3 OH production rate of the obtained pure ZnO (0.37 mmol h A1 g A1 ) is comparable to that of the commercial ZnO (0.32 mmol h A1 g A1 ), showing the considerable photocatalytic activity of single-phase ZnO by utilizing UV light.Despite the high specic surface area and the large pore volume of g-C 3 N 4 , its CH 3 OH production rate (0.26 mmol h A1 g A1 ) still remains relatively low, mainly due to the high recombination rates of photogenerated electrons and holes.However, compared with both the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pure ZnO, the obtained G10 sample exhibits the highest CH 3 OH production rate (0.6 mmol h A1 g A1 ).On the basis of the results in Table 1, the specic surface area of G10 (12.8 m 2 g A1 ) is drastically reduced in contrast to the pure g-C 3 N 4 (48.5 m 2 g A1 ), possibly because of the intercalated ZnO crystallization within the original pores in the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Although the specic surface area is critical for heterogenous catalysis, the higher production rate of the G10 sample with a lower specic surface area suggests highly efficient charge carrier separation occurring at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Combined with the previous analyses of surface area and microstructure observation, the Fig. 8 FT-IR spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). Fig. 9 GC spectra of G10 (red) and pure g-C 3 N 4 (black). intimate interfacial contact between the two phases is benecial for the separation of excited charge carriers, the inhibition of unfavorable recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the further promotion of the photocatalytic activity.In this regard, by coupling ZnO with g-C 3 N 4 via a facile approach, we achieved an enhanced photocatalytic reduction rate of CO 2 into CH 3 OH for pure g-C 3 N 4 by a factor of 2.3, while preserving the original reaction selectivity to directly convert CO 2 into CH 3 OH. In general, there are two possible mechanisms accounting for the photocatalytic activity enhancement induced by spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers in binary photocatalytic systems: (1) conventional heterojunction-type and (2) direct Z-scheme type. 52In order to facilitate analyses, schematic comparison regarding band edge positions of g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO together with the standard potentials of relevant redox couples is presented in Fig. 11.As seen in Fig. 11, the energy potentials of conduction bands (CB) of g-C 3 N 4 (A1.12V vs. NHE) and ZnO (A0.2 V vs. NHE) are both more negative than the standard potential of the CO 2 /CH 3 OH redox couple (0.03 V vs. NHE), while the energy potentials of valence bands (VB) of g-C 3 N 4 (1.57V vs. NHE) and ZnO (3.0 V vs. NHE) are both more positive than the standard potential of the O 2 /H 2 O redox couple (1.23 V vs. NHE).In this regard, both the above two mechanisms can be possible in explaining the enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO binary photocatalytic system.Schematic diagrams illustrating the detailed processes of the above two possible mechanisms in the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalytic system are demonstrated in Fig. 12.In the heterojunction-type photocatalytic system presented in Fig. 12a, the excited electrons transfer from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 with higher energy potentials to the CB of ZnO with lower energy potentials, resulting in the decrease of electron reducibility.Thus, in this case, it should be the electrons from the CB of ZnO reducing CO 2 into CH 3 OH.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes transfer from the VB of ZnO to the VB of g-C 3 N 4 , which also results in the decrease of hole oxidizability.The other type is the direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system shown in Fig. 12b.Upon simultaneous light excitation, both g-C 3 N 4 and ZnO phases can generate excited electron-hole pairs.The excited electrons from the CB of ZnO with lower energy can transfer to combine with the photogenerated holes in g-C 3 N 4 , thus preserving the electrons with stronger reducibility in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and holes with stronger oxidizability in the VB of ZnO.Finally, the electrons from the CB of g-C 3 N 4 can react with CO 2 and produce CH 3 OH.In this regard, it should be noted that the interfacial electron transfer actually occurs in opposite directions for the heterojunction-type (g-C 3 N 4 to ZnO) and direct Z-scheme type (ZnO to g-C 3 N 4 ) photocatalytic systems. 16n order to provide clues to understand the underlying mechanism responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of G10, the photoluminescence (PL) analyses of the hydroxyl radicals (OH) produced on the surfaces of pure g-C 3 N 4 , G10 and pure ZnO upon light irradiation were rst carried out by using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule.The spectral changes of the G10 sample against irradiation time and the comparison of the PL peak intensity around 423 nm of the G10, pure ZnO and pure g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 13a andb, respectively.As shown in Fig. 13b ) can be produced, thus resulting in the subsequent absence of PL signals.However, if the G10 sample conforms to a direct Z-scheme mechanism (see Fig. 12b), the photogenerated electrons and holes will be respectively preserved in the CB of g-C 3 N 4 and the VB of ZnO, maintaining enough reducibility and oxidizability to produce superoxide anion radicals (O 2 A ) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) respectively. The experimental measurement of hydroxyl radicals (OH) also showed that the PL signals of the G10 sample increased almost linearly with irradiation time, whose intensity is more comparable to that of pure ZnO.The presence of PL signals of the G10 samples conrmed that the hydroxyl radicals (OH) were indeed produced on the surface of G10 upon light illumination either in the direct or indirect pathway. 53On the basis of the above PL analyses, the binary g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO composite photocatalytic system is more likely to follow a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism, rather than the conventional heterojunction-type photocatalytic mechanism. To further investigate the specic mechanism accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the G10 sample, the transient photocurrent responses of both pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 were recorded by using typical switch on-off cycles of light irradiation.In this work, we adopted two light sources with different wavelengths (365 and 420 nm) to carry out the photocurrent measurements to probe the excitation, transfer, separation and recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.Typically, the value of photocurrent density corresponds to the charge collection efficiency and a higher value of the photocurrent response generally means higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.Fig. 14 shows the comparison of photocurrent-time (I-t) curves of G10 and pure g-C 3 N 4 upon switch on-off cycles of intermittent light irradiation with two different wavelengths.Interestingly, the pure g-C 3 N 4 and G10 exhibit different photocurrent performances on the two occasions.For light illumination at a wavelength of 420 nm shown in Fig. 14a, the pure g-C 3 N 4 demonstrates a higher photocurrent density than G10.Because of the large band gap of ZnO (3.2 eV), only the g-C 3 N 4 phase can be effectively excited under this condition.The lower value of photocurrent of G10 can be mainly due to the limited amount of g-C 3 N 4 phase.In contrast, light irradiation at a wavelength of 365 nm on G10 shows drastically increased photocurrent density that is 7 times higher than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 , as seen in Fig. 14b.On this occasion, the electrons of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 can be excited and contribute to the increase of photocurrent density.But considering the limited amount of ZnO and the overall enhancement of photocatalytic performances, it is highly possible that the excited electrons in the CB of the ZnO phase are critical to the efficient separation of charge carriers within g-C 3 N 4 phase.Combined with the previous discussion, such a high photocurrent of G10 is achieved via ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 electron transfer to quench the photogenerated holes and extend the lifetime of exited electrons within the g-C 3 N 4 phase.Thus, based on the comparison of the above two situations, the photocurrent measurements further conrmed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity for selective CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH of G10 can be attributed to a direct Z-scheme mechanism.Furthermore, since ZnO and TiO 2 have similar band gaps and band edge positions, the previous construction of the direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composite photocatalyst reported recently also provides strong support to the above explanation. 44n order to further conrm the direct Z-scheme mechanism proposed above, the electronic band structures of both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were obtained using theoretical DFT calculation under the same conditions.The constructed crystal structures and the calculated electronic band structures of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 are shown in Fig. 15 and 16, respectively.On the basis of the obtained band structures, the effective masses of photogenerated electrons and holes of ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 were calculated by parabolic tting to the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) based on eqn (1), respectively.Basically, the effective mass of a charge carrier is inversely proportional to its moving velocity according to the following eqn (2), where n and m represent the transfer rate and effective mass of a charge carrier, respectively.Thus, a smaller value of charge carrier effective mass corresponds to a faster transfer rate. 545556 m 14 2 (d 2 E/dk 2 ) A1 (1) In order to characterize the charge separation efficiency, we also adopted the concept of relative effective mass of photogenerated holes to electrons according to eqn (3).This concept was also used by other researchers to rationalize the reactivity of photocatalysts based on electronic band structures. 57In general, a higher D value means that the photogenerated electron-hole pairs will have a higher tendency to separate, thus resulting in slower recombination rates and better photocatalytic performance. The obtained results of charge carrier effective mass in both G-Z and G-F directions are shown in Table 2.As seen from Table 2, both ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 generally belong to the intrinsic n-type semiconductors with light electrons and heavy holes.However, it should be noted that the D values of ZnO are much higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 in both G-Z and G-F directions, indicating ZnO possesses higher charge separation efficiency than g-C 3 N 4 .Consistent with literature reports, 34,35 the relatively low D values of g-C 3 N 4 in both directions correspond to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Moreover, the calculated electron effective mass (m e ) in the G-Z direction of ZnO (0.034) is far lighter than that of g-C 3 N 4 (3.9),suggesting that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-Z direction exhibit much faster moving rates and higher tendency to transfer than those of g-C 3 N 4 at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface.Although the absolute value of m e in the G-F direction of ZnO (0.9) is comparable to that of g-C 3 N 4 (0.41), the much higher D value of ZnO (11.5) than g-C 3 N 4 (1.6) still demonstrates that the excited electrons of ZnO in the G-F direction have higher probability to transfer rather than to recombine compared with those of g-C 3 N 4 .In this regard, both the lighter photogenerated electrons and the higher charge separation efficiency of ZnO in contrast to g-C 3 N 4 indicate that the electron transfer at the g-C 3 N 4 /ZnO interface is more likely to occur in the ZnO-to-g-C 3 N 4 rather than the g-C 3 N 4 -to-ZnO direction.Thus, the comparison of theoretical effective mass calculations between ZnO and g-C 3 N 4 also strongly supports the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism proposed above."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
