The synthesis of the Cu 2 O-RGO nanocomposites involved two steps as in Scheme 1.In the first step, 120 mg of copper acetate (Cu(AC) 2 ) and 200 mg of GO were dispersed into 400 mL of absolute ethanol under sonication for 2 h.The mixture was magnetically stirred for 4 h, then centrifuged and washed copiously with ethanol.The obtained sample was dried at 60 C for 8 h, being labeled as GO-Cu(AC) 2 .In the second step, 100 mg of GO-Cu(AC) 2 composite was mixed with 100 mL of ethylene glycol under sonication in a 250 mL beaker for 0.5 h and the pH value was regulated to 8, then transferred to a 250 mL roundbottomed flask and heated to 140 C under vigorous magnetic stirring.Subsequently, 5 mL of distilled water was added, and the mixture was heated at 160 C for 2 h.After the system was cooled to room temperature, the suspension was centrifuged, washed with absolute ethanol for five times to remove the remaining ethylene glycol and soluble by-products, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 C for 6 h.The product was labeled as Cu 2 O-RGO.Additionally, Cu 2 O particles were synthesized by the same processes in absence of RGO for comparison. The photo-catalytic activity of the as-prepared catalysts was omeasured by the photo-degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) solution and the photo-reduction of CO 2 to methanol under the illumination of simulated solar light at ambient temperature. In a typical reaction, 100 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of a 10 mg/L RhB solution under ultrasonication for 1 min.Before illumination, the mixture was magnetically stirred for 30 min in the dark to establish adsorption-desorption equilibrium of the dye and the catalyst.A solar simulator with a 500 W Xe lamp was used as the light source.The experimental solution was placed in a quartz cuvette and placed at a distance of 200 mm from the light source.At given intervals, 3 mL of the suspension was withdrawn and centrifuged to remove the dispersed catalyst powder.The concentration of the clean transparent solution was determined by measuring the absorbance of RhB at 553 nm using a spectrophotometer (UV-5200PC, Shanghai Metash). The photo-reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in a homemade apparatus.The photo-catalytic reduction was carried out in a glass cell with the light source placed in the middle equipped with a water-cooled jacket.Cu 2 O-RGO catalyst concentration was 1 g/L in 100 mL of 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution.Prior to the illumination, CO 2 was bubbled with a constant flow through the stirred suspension for at least 30 min to purge the air and saturate the solution.The reactor was tightly closed.The samples of liquid reaction mixture were taken in different interval during the irradiation.A spot of the suspension were withdrawn by a syringe, filtered through a Millipore filter membrane and analyzed.The formation of methanol was determined by a gas chromatography equipped with FID using a 50 m long KB-FFAP column.Blank reactions were performed to ensure that the hydrocarbon production was due to the photo reduction of CO 2 and eliminate the surrounding interference.In the same experimental conditions, the first blank was illuminated without catalyst, the second was in the dark with catalyst and the third was illuminated with catalyst in absence of CO 2 .No hydrocarbons were detected in the above blank tests. The morphologies of the products were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM, H-800).The samples for TEM were prepared by dispersing the product in ethanol using a sonicator bath for 15 min and dropped on copper grid for observation.The dried products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a D/max 2500 VB2/PC Advance diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation at a slow scan rate of 0.021/s to determine the structure.The Raman spectra were recorded on a Laser Micro-Raman Spectrometer with an excitation of 514 nm laser light.FT-IR spectra were measured on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellets as the sample matrix.UV-Vis spectra (UV-Vis) of the solid samples were recorded on a UV-3600 spectrophotometer, and the solution samples were recorded on a UV-5200PC spectrophotometer.The photo-luminescence emission spectra were characterized on an F-7000 PL spectrometer.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on a CHI660E workstation using three-electrode cells.The working electrodes were prepared by mixing the Cu 2 O or Cu 2 O/RGO, carbon black (Super-P) and PTFE at a weight ratio of 85:10:5 to get the paste followed by the paste being pasted onto foamed nickel, pressed and dried under vacuum at 120 C for 12 h."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "In a typical reaction, 100 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of a 10 mg/L RhB solution under ultrasonication for 1 min.", "context": "Graphite flakes (325 mesh) was commercially obtained from XF NANO.N 2 H The synthesis of graphite oxide involved two steps.In the first step, 3 g of graphite flakes, 5 g of K 2 S 2 O 8 and 5 g of P 2 O 5 were dispersed into concentrated H 2 SO 4 and kept at 80 C for 4.5 h.The mixture was filtered, washed by deionized water and dried at ambient temperature to get pre-oxidized graphite.In the second step, graphite oxide was produced using a modified Hummers method from the pre-oxidized graphite.In brief, 3 g of pre-oxidized graphite was mixed with 1.5 g of NaNO 3 and 115 mL of H 2 SO 4 in an ice-bath, then 9 g of KMnO 4 was added to the suspension under vigorous agitation.The addition rate was controlled carefully to keep the temperature of the suspension below 20 C.Afterward, the mixture was stirred at 35 C for 2 h.Then 300 mL of distilled water was added while the temperature was kept at 98 C for 1 h.The suspension was further diluted to approximately 1 L with distilled water and treated with 30 wt. of H 2 O 2 to colorless aiming at reducing the residual permanganate and manganese dioxide.The mixture was filtered, washed with 5 wt.HCl aqueous solution and deionized water in turn until the pH value approached neutral.The graphite oxide was obtained after the filter being dried under vacuum at 40 C for 24 h.
