The surface morphologies of pCN, CNDs, and CND/ pCN-3 were investigated using TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 2).As shown in Fig. 2(a), delaminated pCN had 2D laminar and loose mesh morphologies with many in-plane pores several nanometers in diameter.Additionally, chiffon-like curled wrinkles were found at the edges of pCN nanosheets.These were formed because of decreases in the surface energy, due to the successful delamination of bulk g-C 3 N 4 into sheet- Nano Res.like structures.Additionally, the delaminated pCN suspension showed the Tyndall effect (inset of Fig. 2(a)), demonstrating the colloidal nature of highly dispersed pCN in water.The thinness of the pCN nanosheets reduces the distance for charge migration, and thus retards charge recombination.Their relatively large surface areas, of hundreds of nanometers in length, are favorable for the deposition of various compounds of different sizes and form effective heterointerfaces for charge transfer.Further evidence is provided in our previous studies, in which we hybridized conjugated g-C 3 N 4 with other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as 2D graphene, in pursuit of a highly efficient interfacial charge transfer process 18,44. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the CNDs were dispersed in a uniform manner, without significant agglomeration of the nanoparticles.The HRTEM image of the CNDs shows their amorphous outer surfaces and crystalline interiors.After a year of storage, the CND solution remained homogenous, light-brown, with no precipi-tation (Fig. 2(b1)).This indicates that the CNDs were efficiently dispersed in H 2 O, as a result of oxygen functional groups on their surfaces.This will be discussed further in the discussion of FTIR spectra.The presence of the Tyndall effect provided further evidence for the efficient dispersal of the CNDs.The Tyndall effect was observed when red laser light was passed through the CND solution (Fig. 2(b2)).Upon coupling with pCN, CNDs with an average diameter of 4.4 nm were uniformly deposited on the edges and surfaces of pCN nanosheets.This resulted in the formation of nanoislands with intact bonding, as shown in TEM and HRTEM images (Figs.2(c) and 2(d)).The HRTEM image (Fig. 2(d)) clearly shows lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (100) plane of graphitic carbon 54,55.These fringes confirm the successful development of interfacial contact between pCN and CNDs via electrostatic attraction, which is of fundamental importance for the migration of electrons in photocatalysis.56.This demonstrates that pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN possess comparable crystal structures, despite dissimilar surface charges.Meanwhile, CNDs showed a broad diffraction peak centered at ca. 23, which originated from a highly disordered graphitic carbon phase 57,58.The XRD spectra of all the CND/pCN samples showed patterns to those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.This indicates that the structural integrity of pCN remained intact when loaded with CNDs, allowing the modulation of its optical properties.No distinct characteristic CND peak was present in the spectra of any of the CND/pCN nanohybrids, owing to the comparatively low diffraction intensity and the fine dispersion of CNDs over the pCN substrates.This was in good agreement with other recent studies of CND/TiO 2 59 and CND/BiOBr 60. The chemical structure of the CND/pCN hybrid nanocomposites was determined by FTIR, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN (Fig. 3(a)).The FTIR spectrum of CNDs (Fig. 3(a1)) indicated the presence of various oxygen-containing functional groups: C-O (ca.1,000-1,400 cm -1 ), C-O-C (ca.1,200 cm -1 ), -COOH (ca.1,358 cm -1 ), and CO (ca.1,705 cm -1 ) 57,61,62.These groups were introduced at the basal planes and edges of the CNDs.By taking advantage of these abundant hydrophilic groups, the dispersibility and stability of CNDs in the water was enhanced, as previously discussed (Fig. 2(b1)).In addition to oxygen-containing groups, the stretching vibration of C-H bonds was evidenced by the absorption band at 2,915 cm -1 63.The absorption peak at ca. 1,610 cm -1 was assigned to CC vibration 61.No significant variations in these characteristic peaks were detected in any of the CND/pCN samples, in comparison to the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN samples (Figs.3(a2)-3(a7)).This suggests that there were no substantial changes to the basic framework of pCN when it was hybridized with CNDs.The broad absorption peak from 3,000-3,800 cm -1 was attributed to the vibrational modes of N-H and O-H groups 64.The presence of these functional groups is accounted for by the presence of adsorbed hydroxyl species and free amino groups in the samples.Additionally, the presence of aromatic C-N and CN heterocycles was confirmed by a number of strong absorption peaks from 1,200 to 1,700 cm -1 , located at 1,630, 1,565, 1,415, 1,330, and 1,250 cm -1 , assigned to their skeletal stretching modes 36,65.Furthermore, the breathing mode of tri-striazine was clearly visible at ca. 812 cm -1 in all g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and CND/pCN sample spectra 42.After the hybridization of pCN with CNDs, a slight shift toward a lower wavenumber was observed in the characteristic peaks of the CND/pCN samples, from 1,255 to 1,250 cm -1 and 812 to 806 cm -1 .This indicates that interactions between the \"nitrogen pots\" of pCN and CNDs were initiated by electrostatic attraction 66.These interactions weakened the C-N bonds, Nano Res.increasing their length, which was commensurate with the TEM results (Fig. 2).There were no additional bands evident in the FTIR spectra due to impurities in the CND/pCN nanocomposites.This was in agreement with the XRD results (Fig. S6 in the ESM), verifying that no impurities were added during the fabrication of CND/pCN. The degree of graphitization in CNDs was further evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3(b)).The Raman spectrum of the CNDs (Fig. 3(b1)) exhibited two characteristic bands, the D-band (ca.1,360 cm -1 ) and the G-band (ca.1,590 cm -1 ).These bands confirm the successful synthesis of CNDs from glucose.The intensity ratio of the D-band to the G-band, I D /I G , is used to characterize the disorder level in graphitic carbon.The I D /I G ratio of the CNDs synthesized in this study was calculated to be 0.62.These results indicated that the CNDs had a partially amorphous external surface along with crystallized, sp 2 , core characteristics, which was in agreement with the HRTEM image (Fig. 2(b)).In addition, no significant differences in the Raman peaks were evident between any of the CND/pCN samples.This demonstrates that the conjugation of pCN with CNDs had little effect on the chemical skeleton of pCN.The characteristic stretching vibrations of C-N at 461, 585, 710, 750, 975, 1,111, 1,150, 1,235, 1,462, and 1,625 cm -1 were concordant with the FTIR results (Fig. 3(a)), and matched closely with those reported in Refs.42,64,67. To gain insights into the elemental bonding configurations and chemical composition of the CND/ pCN-3 sample relative to pCN, XPS analysis was conducted (Fig. 4).As depicted in Fig. 4 Nano Res.incomplete condensation processes), and positively charged g-C 3 N 4 heterocycles (due to the protonation of HCl), respectively 18,66.The slight shifts in the deconvoluted peaks of the C 1s and N 1 s spectra strongly suggest that coupling interactions exist between CNDs and pCN in the hybrid nanostructures.Additionally, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of CND/pCN-3 can be divided into two dominant peaks, at 531.4 and 533.1 eV (Fig. 4(d)).These originate from the CO and HO-CO groups, respectively 63, signifying the deposition of CNDs onto the pCN substrate.In the pCN sample spectrum, the O 1s peak at 532.1 eV was assigned to the adsorbed CO 2 or H 2 O 18.Overall, the HRTEM, FTIR and XPS results imply that the electrostatic attraction of surface charges and - stacking interactions play pivotal roles in the self-assembly of CND/pCN nanohybrids, giving rise to an effective interfacial contact heterointerface. Figure 5 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples, obtained to investigate their optical properties.Pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN showed an absorption edge at around 440 nm with band gap energies of 2.8 eV, as determined in our previous work 18,43.Then the CNDs were incorporated, there was no significant shift in the onset of the absorption edge relative to that of pure pCN.This implies that the CNDs anchored to the pCN surface act as a conducting electron channel.Similar results have been reported in other studies of CND-based photocatalytic systems 69.The intrinsic charge generation of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction arises from the injection of The electronic band structures of the pCN and CND/pCN photocatalysts were determined by EPR analysis at ambient temperature (Fig. 6).Unlike the urea precursor, pure g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and all the CND/ pCN samples displayed a single Lorentzian line at ca. 3,508 G with a g value of ca.2.0045.This line confirms the presence of unpaired electrons on the carbon atoms of the -conjugated aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 56.The Lorentzian line of pCN was slightly enhanced, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 , after the introduction of protons into the g-C 3 N 4 framework (Fig. 6(a)).This was attributed to improved electron mobility and increased delocalization of the system 70.In addition, the intensity of the EPR signal of the CND/pCN samples increased significantly with increasing CND loading (Fig. 6(b)).This phenomenon was due to extensive - coupling between pCN and CNDs in the CND/pCN systems 69.Consequently, spin mobility and charge delocalization were improved in the CND/ pCN samples, resulting in a greater density of charge carriers 71.This will be discussed further in the Mott-Schottky section.Optimization of the electronic properties of the CND/pCN heterojunction interface, to accelerate charge transportation and separation, will be beneficial to the photocatalytic solar energy conversion process. Measurements of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O vapor were conducted under visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light Nano Res.illumination for a total reaction duration of 10 h (Fig. 7).For all the photocatalysts studied under visible light irradiation, there were two major products produced by the CO 2 reduction, namely CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a of CH 4 and CO, despite the incorporation of protons (H ) into the framework of g-C 3 N 4 .This clearly demonstrated that acidic protonation pretreatment to modify the surface charge of g-C 3 N 4 did not adversely affect the active sites, and thus its CO 2 reduction activity. The hybridization of CNDs had a significant effect on the photoactivity of CND/pCN toward CO 2 reduction.As the CND content increased from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt., a gradual rise in photocatalytic activity for the production of CH 4 and CO was observed (Figs.7(a Moreover, the total amounts of CH 4 and CO produced with CND/pCN-3 were 3.6-and 2.28-times greater than produced using pure pCN (Figs.7(a) and 7(b)).For both pCN and the CND/pCN samples, the total evolution of CO under visible light was greater than that of CH 4 by a factor of 2 to 3.2.Similar observations have also been reported by Wang et al. 66,72.This was attributed to the number of electrons and protons participating in the photoreaction, which kinetically determines the formation of the CO and CH 4 products 73.As shown in Eqs. ( 2) and ( 3), 2e -/2H and 8e -/8H are needed to produce CO and CH 4 , respectively.It is reasonable to infer that a larger quantity of CO was yielded than of CH 4 because fewer electrons and protons take part in the CO 2 reduction reaction that forms CO.Thus, we can conclude that the generation of CO or CH 4 is directly related to the number of free charge carriers present in the chemical reaction. (2) The significantly increased visible-light photoactivity of CND/pCN-3 heterojunction nanocomposites was attributed to the successful retardation of the electronhole recombination rate, in comparison to bare pCN.The AQE of CND/pCN-3 was calculated to be 0.076, using Eq. ( 4) and detailed in our previous reports 8,18,65.It is widely known that CNDs are superior electron-reservoir co-catalysts because of their beneficial electrical properties 47,747576.These properties are akin to other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes 16,22,77,78. In this study, when the concentration of CNDs CND/pCN was greater than 3 wt., the photocatalytic evolution of CO and CH 4 deteriorated markedly.This was evidenced in the CND/pCN-4 sample, despite its greater optical absorption (Fig. 5) relative to CND/pCN samples with a lower proportion of CNDs.This was because excessive CNDs on the pCN surface caused a reduction in the visible-light absorption of pCN, thus inhibiting the generation of charge carriers.This significantly reduced the quantity of photoinduced electrons transported from pCN to the CNDs.In addition, excessive CNDs deposited on the pCN surface hindered the formation of an efficient heterojunction interface between 0D CNDs and 2D pCN nanosheets, reducing electron transfer from pCN to the CNDs.Similar results have been observed by other research groups 49,52,60.These suggest that determining the optimum concentration of CNDs is vital for the formation of a synergistic heterojunction interface with pCN, and thus favorable photocatalytic performance.The detailed charge carrier dynamics of CND/pCN will be discussed in the later PEC, PL, and DFT sections, and compared with the photocatalytic results. The photoactivities of CNDs and the mechanically combined CND/pCN-3M sample were determined (Figs.7(a that the photocatalytic performance of CNDs was very low for the evolution of both CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)).This indicated that CNDs serve as effective co-catalysts for the CO 2 reduction reaction, rather than functioning as semiconductor photocatalysts themselves.Our results are in accordance with recent reports 69,79, which indicate that pure CNDs demonstrate no photocatalytic activity toward H 2 evolution or CO 2 fixation.Additionally, to emphasize the role of the hybrid heterojunction between CNDs and pCN, the visible-light catalytic activity of CND/ pCN-3M was determined for the evolution of CH 4 (Fig. S9 in the ESM).The experimental results showed that CND/pCN-3M (10.03 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ) had slightly higher activity than pCN (8.05 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), but its photoactivity was markedly lower than CND/pCN-3 (29.23 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), despite containing the same proportion of CNDs.This low activity was a result of the loosely connected heterojunctions in CND/ pCN-3M.This result demonstrates the importance of well-constructed heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs in the hybridized systems. In addition to measurement of the visible-light activities, the performance of the catalysts was measured when activated by simulated solar light.The simulated solar light was generated with a xenon lamp covered by an AM1.5 filter.An AM1.5 filter is the most reliable method to mimic natural sunlight, and hence to determine the feasibility of using the photocatalysts in CO 2 reduction processes under natural light 26.As illustrated in Figs.7(a) and 7(b), the proportion of CNDs is vital in determining the efficiency of the catalytic reactions.A similar trend of catalytic results to those obtained under visible light irradiation was obtained under simulated solar light.The optimum loading of CND was found to be 3 wt.,as in the CND/pCN-3 sample.In the CND/ pCN-3 experiment, 37.06 molg catalyst -1 of CH 4 and 68.80 molg catalyst -1 of CO were produced.These were 2.83-and 2.02-fold increases, respectively, over pure pCN.For all the catalysts tested, the total yields of each product were greater under simulated solar light than under visible light.This was because simulated sunlight contains a small fraction (4) of UV light, which has higher photon energies than visible light.These high-energy photons generate more free charge carriers to take part in the photochemical reactions, which increases the product yields.In summary, the highest CH 4 and CO productions were obtained using CND/pCN-3 (3 wt. of CNDs), under both visible light and simulated solar light illumination after 10 h of reaction. Recyclability, photostability and durability of photocatalysts are important factors in their prolonged utilization in large-scale applications.The time dependence of the rate of CH 4 production, using CND/pCN-3 as a representative photocatalyst, was measured over four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(a) and 8(b)).After four cycles (40 h) of CO 2 photoreduction experiments, the CND/pCN-3 sample retained its catalytic activity for CH 4 evolution.Additionally, there were no noticeable deviations in the chemical structure and phase composition of the CND/pCN-3 after four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(c) and 8(d)).These results demonstrate the excellent stability of the CND/pCN-3 catalyst. PEC analysis was performed to determine the significance of interfacial interactions, and charge transfer behavior, between pCN and CNDs, on the photoactivity of the CND/pCN hybrid systems.The charge transfer efficiencies of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, and CND/pCN samples were determined by photochronoamperometry measurements.Figure 9(a) shows the photocurrent-time curves for the samples studied, with several on-off cycles of visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Reproducible and uniform photocurrent responses were obtained for all the working electrodes after six irradiation cycles, indicating that the photocurrent response for each electrode was stable and reversible.For pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, a low photocurrent density was measured due to the rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs.The photocurrent density steadily increased with increasing CND content (from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt.).However, when the CND content exceeded 3 wt.(in the CND/pCN-4 sample) a slight decrease in the photocurrent density was observed.This was attributed to reduced visible-light activation of pCN as a result of increased CND coverage of the pCN surface.However, the CND/ pCN-4 sample still exhibited a higher photocurrent response than those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample demonstrated the highest Nano Res.photocurrent density of all the samples.We concluded that the recombination of charge carriers between pCN and the CND content was inhibited optimally, and thus the separation efficiency of charge carriers at the 0D/2D heterojunction interface was also optimized.The photocurrent in CND/pCN-3 sample showed a four-fold increase compared to the pure pCN sample.The inhibition of charge recombination implies that the 0D/2D heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs are well-formed, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity of CND/pCN-3. Furthermore, EIS analysis was conducted to provide further data on the charge transfer and separation processes, and to study the electrical conductivity of the photocatalysts 68.The charge transfer resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interface can, in general, be represented by the arc radius of the Nyquist impedance plots 17.Consistent with our transient photocurrent responses (Fig. 9(a)) and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results (Fig. 7), the lowest electron transfer resistance upon visible light irradiation was measured in the CND/pCN-3 sample; evidenced by it having the smallest arc radius in the EIS Nyquist diagram (Fig. S10 in the ESM).This demonstrates that the incorporation of an optimized proportion of CND significantly increases the electrical conductivity of pCN.Hence, this promotes effective interfacial electron transfer at the hetero-nanostructural interface of the CND/pCN-3 sample, by utilizing CNDs as electron storage co-catalysts to improve solar energy conversion. To determine the charge carrier density and band structures of the CND/pCN sample and improve our understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism, electrochemical Mott-Schottky analysis was conducted at frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz.As shown in Fig. 9(b), both the pCN and CND/pCN-3 samples produced positive slopes, thus demonstrating n-type semiconductor features despite the CND/pCN-3 sample being conjugated with CNDs.A descending gradient was present in the CND/pCN-3 Mott-Schottky plot, in contrast to the plot for pCN.This signifies a higher donor density in the CND/pCN-3 nanohybrids, which results from the improved -conjugation system of CNDs with pCN (as demonstrated by the EPR results in Fig. 6).For n-type semiconductors, the Mott-Schottky equation can be written as Eq. ( 5) 80 where C denotes the space charge capacitance, N D is the density of charge carriers, q is the electronic charge (1.602 10 -19 C), and o refer to the dielectric constant of g-C 3 N 4 (5.25) and permittivity in vacuum (8.85 10 -14 Fcm -2 ), respectively, E and E fb denote the applied potential and flat-band potential, respectively, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The value of E fb is determined by the x-intercept of the linear section of the Mott-Schottky curve.In this instance, the E fb of CND/pCN-3 showed a positive shift toward a smaller E fb value, in comparison with that of pCN.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were measured to be -1.1 and -1.4 V, respectively, vs. Ag/AgCl.The normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential was estimated from the potential relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode according to Eq. ( 6) 81 fb (vs.NHE) fb (pH0, vs. Ag/AgCl) AgCl where the pH of the electrolyte is ca.6.8 and E AgCl is 0.197 V.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were -0.50 and -0.80 V, respectively, vs. NHE.As an approximation, the CB minimum (CBM) of a typical n-type semiconductor is 0.3 V more negative than E fb 82, thus the CBM values of pCN and CND/pCN-3 are -1.1 and -0.8 V, respectively, vs. NHE.Based on the slopes of the Mott-Schottky plots, the density of charge carrier, N D can also be calculated from Eq. ( 7) 82 Using Eq. ( 7), the N D of CND/pCN-3 (1.37 10 22 cm -3 ) was found to be significantly greater than that of pCN (9.37 10 21 cm -3 ).The higher carrier density in the CND/pCN-3 sample was indicative of the greater spatial separation of electrons and holes in the presence of CNDs.This increased separation lowers the charge recombination rate, and increases the photocatalytic efficiency.This phenomenon gives rise to improved charge mobility and electrical conductivity and increases the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.This agrees well with the results of our photocurrent response tests (Fig. 9(a)) and EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. S10 in the ESM).Steady state PL spectroscopy is a powerful analysis tool for determining the nature of the radiative recombination process and charge kinetics of a photocatalyst (Fig. 10(a)) 42.For pCN, an intense, broad, PL emission peak was observed, indicating rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs, through band-band transitions.All of the CND/pCN hybrid photocatalysts showed significantly reduced PL intensities, relative to pCN.This was due to effective interfacial charge separation in the CND/pCN nanohybrids arising from well-formed 0D/2D heterojunction interfaces, which suppressed the charge recombination.Furthermore, the PL signal of CND/pCN-3 was the lowest in intensity, indicating the slowest charge recombination and that the CND concentration in the Nano Res.sample was optimal. TRPL was employed to acquire detailed insights into the lifetime of charge carrier dynamics (Fig. 10(b)).The fluorescence decay curves were fitted using the tri-exponential function: I(t) A 1 exp (-t/ 1 ) A 2 exp (-t/ 2 ) A 3 exp (-t/ 3 ), where A and denote the amplitudes and emission lifetimes of each component.The detailed kinetic parameters for all the photocatalyst used in this study are listed in Table 1.The average lifetime, ave , was calculated using Eq. ( 8), and describes the resultant TRPL features of each sample 83.As summarized in Table 1, when a small proportion (0.5 wt.) of CNDs was introduced onto the pCN surface, the emission lifetime was reduced from 6.72 ns (pCN) to 5.87 ns (CND/pCN-1).Incorporating an optimal concentration of CNDs (3 wt.) reduced the decay lifetime to 3.87 ns (CND/pCN-3); almost 1.7 times shorter than that of pure pCN.The significantly decreased emission lifetime of the CND/pCN-3 sample indicated that the interfacial electron injection from pCN to CNDs was rapid, due to the existence of non-radiative quenching routes.However, proportions CNDs greater that 3 wt.were detrimental to the photoactivity, as indicated by the longer decay lifetime (4.76 ns) of CND/pCN-4, because of the higher recombination rate of the charge carriers.Our TRPL results are in good agreement with the steady state PL analysis (Fig. 10(a)) and the photocatalytic results (Fig. 7). The dynamic charge carrier process was further evaluated by the determination of the electron transfer rate constant (k ET ) and the efficiency of electron transfer ( ET ), as expressed in Eqs. ( 9) and ( 10) 84.We found that the CND/pCN-3 sample had the largest k ET (1.10 10 8 s -1 ) and ET (42.4) of all the photocatalyst samples.This finding provides further evidence for the efficient transportation of photoexcited electrons from pCN to CNDs via an effective heterointerface between pCN and CNDs.This plays a pivotal role in increasing the probability of electrons participating in the photochemical reduction of CO 2 before electronhole recombination occurs.The PEC, steady state PL and TRPL results, all indicate that the CND/pCN-3 ave ET ave To This suggests that the photoexcitation of electrons was possible when the photon energy was sufficient to overcome the band gap between the HOMO and the LUMO.Using this information, we propose that the excitation process in a partially ionized system occurs as follows.Firstly, electrons in the pCN were photoexcited and moved into the LUMO, correspondingly, the generation of holes took place in the HOMO of pCN.The energy level of the HOMO in pCN was lower than that of the CND HOMO, so, in the second stage, the migration of the HOMO electron from the CND to the pCN occurred before combining with a hole (Fig. 11(c)).When this occurred, the net charge was shared across the carbon lattice, rather than being localized on the CND.Consequently, the net positive and negative charges induced an internal electric field, directed from pCN to CND.Furthermore, the internal electric field at the interface produced a force on the holes and electrons, in the opposite direction to the diffusion force.At thermal equilibrium, both the electric field force and the diffusion force are balanced.This was verified by density of state (DOS) and work function analyses, as discussed below. The total density of state (TDOS) and the partial density of state (PDOS) were calculated for the CND/ pCN heterojunction (Fig. 12).As shown in Fig. 12(a), the lower VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies ranging from -1 to -0.37 eV.The PDOS calculations of CND and pCN exhibited a similar shape, signifying successful bonding of pCN with CND.The upper VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies in the range of -0.37 to 0 eV.The CND bands made the greatest contribution to the VB maximum (VBM).Conversely, pCN mainly contributed to the sub-sharp closing of the VBM.The VBs of pCN were primarily composed of N 2p, N 2s, and C 2p orbitals, whereas the CBs of pCN were dominated by C 2p and N 2p orbitals (Fig. 12(b)).This agreed well with our previous work 18.Additionally, the DOS of CND consisted of discrete energy levels, which corresponded with the lack of symmetry in the CND structure (Fig. 12(c)).The C 2p and O 2p orbitals made the greatest contribution to the DOS, except in the energy range from 1.5 to 2 eV.From 1.5 to 2 eV, the DOS originated from C 2p and H 1s orbitals.On the basis of this analysis, we concluded that the CND/pCN heterojunction is a typical band alignment structure. The work function, , of a material is an important property, commonly employed as an intrinsic reference for band alignment.It can be defined as follows (Eq.( 11)) 85 E vac -E f (11) where E vac is the vacuum energy of a stationary electron near the surface of the material and E f denotes the ground state electronic structure calculation.The calculated electrostatic potentials for monolayer pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunctions are shown in 11(b).In addition, our first-principles DFT results were consistent with the photocatalytic and PEC experimental measurements. On the basis of the experimental and first-principles DFT computational results, a plausible photocatalytic mechanism of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO under visible light or simulated solar light was proposed (Fig. 14).When the CND/pCN photocatalyst was irradiated by visible light, holes and free electrons were generated in pCN.The electrons were photoexcited from the VB to the CB of pCN, thus leaving holes in the VB of pCN.As a result of the high electron storage capability and electronic conductivity of CNDs, the photoinduced electrons could be easily injected into the CNDs.The photogenerated holes can react with H 2 O to produce protons (H ).It is well established that delocalized -conjugated II 3 bonding is exhibited by CO 2 molecules, leading to the adsorption of CO 2 onto the surface of CNDs, through - conjugation 18.This adsorption causes the destabilization and activation of CO 2 .Thus, the electrons accumulated on the CND surface can successfully reduce CO 2 to CO (E (CO 2 /CO) -0.53V vs. NHE) and CH 4 (E (CO 2 / CH 4 ) -0.24V vs. NHE) via a two electron/two proton pathway and an eight electron/eight proton pathway, respectively 35.The photocatalytic mechanism with simulated solar light illumination is identical; the spatially separated photoinduced electrons and holes enhanced the reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H , to form CH"}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4", "source": "Unlike the urea precursor, pure g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and all the CND/ pCN samples displayed a single Lorentzian line at ca. 3,508 G with a g value of ca.2.0045.", "context": "The 0D/2D CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalysts were successfully synthesized using a surface charge-facilitated electrostatic interaction approach (Fig. 1).Initially, bulk g-C 3 N 4 was obtained by using urea as the precursor, as in our previously reported procedure (Fig. S3 in the ESM) 43,44.The bulk g-C 3 N 4 was subsequently delaminated into 2D g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets via an ultrasonication-assisted process.This was followed by the protonation of g-C 3 N 4 by HCl to alter its surface change from negative (-15.3 mV) to positive (14.0 mV), as confirmed by zeta potential analysis (Fig. S4 in the ESM).The negatively charged surface of the pure g-C 3 N 4 was ascribed to the -C-Nmotifs in the g-C 3 N 4 framework 18.The CNDs in solution, which was synthesized by the NaOH-assisted ultrasonic treatment of glucose, possessed a high negative charge (-40.4 mV) (Fig. S4 in the ESM).This was attributed to the abundance of oxygenated functional groups on the surfaces of CNDs.By considering the oppositely charged surfaces and - stacking interactions, we surmise that the CND/pCN catalysts were constructed through electrostatic selfassembly between the negatively charged CNDs and the positively charged pCN nanosheets.A series of CND/pCN samples were synthesized with different proportions of CNDs (0.5 wt., 1 wt., 3 wt.,and 5 wt.).The CND contents were confirmed by TGA analysis (Fig. S5 in the ESM). The surface morphologies of pCN, CNDs, and CND/ pCN-3 were investigated using TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 2).As shown in Fig. 2(a), delaminated pCN had 2D laminar and loose mesh morphologies with many in-plane pores several nanometers in diameter.Additionally, chiffon-like curled wrinkles were found at the edges of pCN nanosheets.These were formed because of decreases in the surface energy, due to the successful delamination of bulk g-C 3 N 4 into sheet- Nano Res.like structures.Additionally, the delaminated pCN suspension showed the Tyndall effect (inset of Fig. 2(a)), demonstrating the colloidal nature of highly dispersed pCN in water.The thinness of the pCN nanosheets reduces the distance for charge migration, and thus retards charge recombination.Their relatively large surface areas, of hundreds of nanometers in length, are favorable for the deposition of various compounds of different sizes and form effective heterointerfaces for charge transfer.Further evidence is provided in our previous studies, in which we hybridized conjugated g-C 3 N 4 with other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as 2D graphene, in pursuit of a highly efficient interfacial charge transfer process 18,44. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the CNDs were dispersed in a uniform manner, without significant agglomeration of the nanoparticles.The HRTEM image of the CNDs shows their amorphous outer surfaces and crystalline interiors.After a year of storage, the CND solution remained homogenous, light-brown, with no precipi-tation (Fig. 2(b1)).This indicates that the CNDs were efficiently dispersed in H 2 O, as a result of oxygen functional groups on their surfaces.This will be discussed further in the discussion of FTIR spectra.The presence of the Tyndall effect provided further evidence for the efficient dispersal of the CNDs.The Tyndall effect was observed when red laser light was passed through the CND solution (Fig. 2(b2)).Upon coupling with pCN, CNDs with an average diameter of 4.4 nm were uniformly deposited on the edges and surfaces of pCN nanosheets.This resulted in the formation of nanoislands with intact bonding, as shown in TEM and HRTEM images (Figs.2(c) and 2(d)).The HRTEM image (Fig. 2(d)) clearly shows lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (100) plane of graphitic carbon 54,55.These fringes confirm the successful development of interfacial contact between pCN and CNDs via electrostatic attraction, which is of fundamental importance for the migration of electrons in photocatalysis.56.This demonstrates that pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN possess comparable crystal structures, despite dissimilar surface charges.Meanwhile, CNDs showed a broad diffraction peak centered at ca. 23, which originated from a highly disordered graphitic carbon phase 57,58.The XRD spectra of all the CND/pCN samples showed patterns to those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.This indicates that the structural integrity of pCN remained intact when loaded with CNDs, allowing the modulation of its optical properties.No distinct characteristic CND peak was present in the spectra of any of the CND/pCN nanohybrids, owing to the comparatively low diffraction intensity and the fine dispersion of CNDs over the pCN substrates.This was in good agreement with other recent studies of CND/TiO 2 59 and CND/BiOBr 60. The chemical structure of the CND/pCN hybrid nanocomposites was determined by FTIR, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN (Fig. 3(a)).The FTIR spectrum of CNDs (Fig. 3(a1)) indicated the presence of various oxygen-containing functional groups: C-O (ca.1,000-1,400 cm -1 ), C-O-C (ca.1,200 cm -1 ), -COOH (ca.1,358 cm -1 ), and CO (ca.1,705 cm -1 ) 57,61,62.These groups were introduced at the basal planes and edges of the CNDs.By taking advantage of these abundant hydrophilic groups, the dispersibility and stability of CNDs in the water was enhanced, as previously discussed (Fig. 2(b1)).In addition to oxygen-containing groups, the stretching vibration of C-H bonds was evidenced by the absorption band at 2,915 cm -1 63.The absorption peak at ca. 1,610 cm -1 was assigned to CC vibration 61.No significant variations in these characteristic peaks were detected in any of the CND/pCN samples, in comparison to the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN samples (Figs.3(a2)-3(a7)).This suggests that there were no substantial changes to the basic framework of pCN when it was hybridized with CNDs.The broad absorption peak from 3,000-3,800 cm -1 was attributed to the vibrational modes of N-H and O-H groups 64.The presence of these functional groups is accounted for by the presence of adsorbed hydroxyl species and free amino groups in the samples.Additionally, the presence of aromatic C-N and CN heterocycles was confirmed by a number of strong absorption peaks from 1,200 to 1,700 cm -1 , located at 1,630, 1,565, 1,415, 1,330, and 1,250 cm -1 , assigned to their skeletal stretching modes 36,65.Furthermore, the breathing mode of tri-striazine was clearly visible at ca. 812 cm -1 in all g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and CND/pCN sample spectra 42.After the hybridization of pCN with CNDs, a slight shift toward a lower wavenumber was observed in the characteristic peaks of the CND/pCN samples, from 1,255 to 1,250 cm -1 and 812 to 806 cm -1 .This indicates that interactions between the \"nitrogen pots\" of pCN and CNDs were initiated by electrostatic attraction 66.These interactions weakened the C-N bonds, Nano Res.increasing their length, which was commensurate with the TEM results (Fig. 2).There were no additional bands evident in the FTIR spectra due to impurities in the CND/pCN nanocomposites.This was in agreement with the XRD results (Fig. S6 in the ESM), verifying that no impurities were added during the fabrication of CND/pCN. The degree of graphitization in CNDs was further evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3(b)).The Raman spectrum of the CNDs (Fig. 3(b1)) exhibited two characteristic bands, the D-band (ca.1,360 cm -1 ) and the G-band (ca.1,590 cm -1 ).These bands confirm the successful synthesis of CNDs from glucose.The intensity ratio of the D-band to the G-band, I D /I G , is used to characterize the disorder level in graphitic carbon.The I D /I G ratio of the CNDs synthesized in this study was calculated to be 0.62.These results indicated that the CNDs had a partially amorphous external surface along with crystallized, sp 2 , core characteristics, which was in agreement with the HRTEM image (Fig. 2(b)).In addition, no significant differences in the Raman peaks were evident between any of the CND/pCN samples.This demonstrates that the conjugation of pCN with CNDs had little effect on the chemical skeleton of pCN.The characteristic stretching vibrations of C-N at 461, 585, 710, 750, 975, 1,111, 1,150, 1,235, 1,462, and 1,625 cm -1 were concordant with the FTIR results (Fig. 3(a)), and matched closely with those reported in Refs.42,64,67. To gain insights into the elemental bonding configurations and chemical composition of the CND/ pCN-3 sample relative to pCN, XPS analysis was conducted (Fig. 4).As depicted in Fig. 4 Nano Res.incomplete condensation processes), and positively charged g-C 3 N 4 heterocycles (due to the protonation of HCl), respectively 18,66.The slight shifts in the deconvoluted peaks of the C 1s and N 1 s spectra strongly suggest that coupling interactions exist between CNDs and pCN in the hybrid nanostructures.Additionally, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of CND/pCN-3 can be divided into two dominant peaks, at 531.4 and 533.1 eV (Fig. 4(d)).These originate from the CO and HO-CO groups, respectively 63, signifying the deposition of CNDs onto the pCN substrate.In the pCN sample spectrum, the O 1s peak at 532.1 eV was assigned to the adsorbed CO 2 or H 2 O 18.Overall, the HRTEM, FTIR and XPS results imply that the electrostatic attraction of surface charges and - stacking interactions play pivotal roles in the self-assembly of CND/pCN nanohybrids, giving rise to an effective interfacial contact heterointerface. Figure 5 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples, obtained to investigate their optical properties.Pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN showed an absorption edge at around 440 nm with band gap energies of 2.8 eV, as determined in our previous work 18,43.Then the CNDs were incorporated, there was no significant shift in the onset of the absorption edge relative to that of pure pCN.This implies that the CNDs anchored to the pCN surface act as a conducting electron channel.Similar results have been reported in other studies of CND-based photocatalytic systems 69.The intrinsic charge generation of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction arises from the injection of The electronic band structures of the pCN and CND/pCN photocatalysts were determined by EPR analysis at ambient temperature (Fig. 6).Unlike the urea precursor, pure g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and all the CND/ pCN samples displayed a single Lorentzian line at ca. 3,508 G with a g value of ca.2.0045.This line confirms the presence of unpaired electrons on the carbon atoms of the -conjugated aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 56.The Lorentzian line of pCN was slightly enhanced, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 , after the introduction of protons into the g-C 3 N 4 framework (Fig. 6(a)).This was attributed to improved electron mobility and increased delocalization of the system 70.In addition, the intensity of the EPR signal of the CND/pCN samples increased significantly with increasing CND loading (Fig. 6(b)).This phenomenon was due to extensive - coupling between pCN and CNDs in the CND/pCN systems 69.Consequently, spin mobility and charge delocalization were improved in the CND/ pCN samples, resulting in a greater density of charge carriers 71.This will be discussed further in the Mott-Schottky section.Optimization of the electronic properties of the CND/pCN heterojunction interface, to accelerate charge transportation and separation, will be beneficial to the photocatalytic solar energy conversion process. Measurements of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O vapor were conducted under visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light Nano Res.illumination for a total reaction duration of 10 h (Fig. 7).For all the photocatalysts studied under visible light irradiation, there were two major products produced by the CO 2 reduction, namely CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a of CH 4 and CO, despite the incorporation of protons (H ) into the framework of g-C 3 N 4 .This clearly demonstrated that acidic protonation pretreatment to modify the surface charge of g-C 3 N 4 did not adversely affect the active sites, and thus its CO 2 reduction activity. The hybridization of CNDs had a significant effect on the photoactivity of CND/pCN toward CO 2 reduction.As the CND content increased from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt., a gradual rise in photocatalytic activity for the production of CH 4 and CO was observed (Figs.7(a Moreover, the total amounts of CH 4 and CO produced with CND/pCN-3 were 3.6-and 2.28-times greater than produced using pure pCN (Figs.7(a) and 7(b)).For both pCN and the CND/pCN samples, the total evolution of CO under visible light was greater than that of CH 4 by a factor of 2 to 3.2.Similar observations have also been reported by Wang et al. 66,72.This was attributed to the number of electrons and protons participating in the photoreaction, which kinetically determines the formation of the CO and CH 4 products 73.As shown in Eqs. ( 2) and ( 3), 2e -/2H and 8e -/8H are needed to produce CO and CH 4 , respectively.It is reasonable to infer that a larger quantity of CO was yielded than of CH 4 because fewer electrons and protons take part in the CO 2 reduction reaction that forms CO.Thus, we can conclude that the generation of CO or CH 4 is directly related to the number of free charge carriers present in the chemical reaction. (2) The significantly increased visible-light photoactivity of CND/pCN-3 heterojunction nanocomposites was attributed to the successful retardation of the electronhole recombination rate, in comparison to bare pCN.The AQE of CND/pCN-3 was calculated to be 0.076, using Eq. ( 4) and detailed in our previous reports 8,18,65.It is widely known that CNDs are superior electron-reservoir co-catalysts because of their beneficial electrical properties 47,747576.These properties are akin to other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes 16,22,77,78. In this study, when the concentration of CNDs CND/pCN was greater than 3 wt., the photocatalytic evolution of CO and CH 4 deteriorated markedly.This was evidenced in the CND/pCN-4 sample, despite its greater optical absorption (Fig. 5) relative to CND/pCN samples with a lower proportion of CNDs.This was because excessive CNDs on the pCN surface caused a reduction in the visible-light absorption of pCN, thus inhibiting the generation of charge carriers.This significantly reduced the quantity of photoinduced electrons transported from pCN to the CNDs.In addition, excessive CNDs deposited on the pCN surface hindered the formation of an efficient heterojunction interface between 0D CNDs and 2D pCN nanosheets, reducing electron transfer from pCN to the CNDs.Similar results have been observed by other research groups 49,52,60.These suggest that determining the optimum concentration of CNDs is vital for the formation of a synergistic heterojunction interface with pCN, and thus favorable photocatalytic performance.The detailed charge carrier dynamics of CND/pCN will be discussed in the later PEC, PL, and DFT sections, and compared with the photocatalytic results. The photoactivities of CNDs and the mechanically combined CND/pCN-3M sample were determined (Figs.7(a that the photocatalytic performance of CNDs was very low for the evolution of both CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)).This indicated that CNDs serve as effective co-catalysts for the CO 2 reduction reaction, rather than functioning as semiconductor photocatalysts themselves.Our results are in accordance with recent reports 69,79, which indicate that pure CNDs demonstrate no photocatalytic activity toward H 2 evolution or CO 2 fixation.Additionally, to emphasize the role of the hybrid heterojunction between CNDs and pCN, the visible-light catalytic activity of CND/ pCN-3M was determined for the evolution of CH 4 (Fig. S9 in the ESM).The experimental results showed that CND/pCN-3M (10.03 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ) had slightly higher activity than pCN (8.05 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), but its photoactivity was markedly lower than CND/pCN-3 (29.23 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), despite containing the same proportion of CNDs.This low activity was a result of the loosely connected heterojunctions in CND/ pCN-3M.This result demonstrates the importance of well-constructed heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs in the hybridized systems. In addition to measurement of the visible-light activities, the performance of the catalysts was measured when activated by simulated solar light.The simulated solar light was generated with a xenon lamp covered by an AM1.5 filter.An AM1.5 filter is the most reliable method to mimic natural sunlight, and hence to determine the feasibility of using the photocatalysts in CO 2 reduction processes under natural light 26.As illustrated in Figs.7(a) and 7(b), the proportion of CNDs is vital in determining the efficiency of the catalytic reactions.A similar trend of catalytic results to those obtained under visible light irradiation was obtained under simulated solar light.The optimum loading of CND was found to be 3 wt.,as in the CND/pCN-3 sample.In the CND/ pCN-3 experiment, 37.06 molg catalyst -1 of CH 4 and 68.80 molg catalyst -1 of CO were produced.These were 2.83-and 2.02-fold increases, respectively, over pure pCN.For all the catalysts tested, the total yields of each product were greater under simulated solar light than under visible light.This was because simulated sunlight contains a small fraction (4) of UV light, which has higher photon energies than visible light.These high-energy photons generate more free charge carriers to take part in the photochemical reactions, which increases the product yields.In summary, the highest CH 4 and CO productions were obtained using CND/pCN-3 (3 wt. of CNDs), under both visible light and simulated solar light illumination after 10 h of reaction. Recyclability, photostability and durability of photocatalysts are important factors in their prolonged utilization in large-scale applications.The time dependence of the rate of CH 4 production, using CND/pCN-3 as a representative photocatalyst, was measured over four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(a) and 8(b)).After four cycles (40 h) of CO 2 photoreduction experiments, the CND/pCN-3 sample retained its catalytic activity for CH 4 evolution.Additionally, there were no noticeable deviations in the chemical structure and phase composition of the CND/pCN-3 after four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(c) and 8(d)).These results demonstrate the excellent stability of the CND/pCN-3 catalyst. PEC analysis was performed to determine the significance of interfacial interactions, and charge transfer behavior, between pCN and CNDs, on the photoactivity of the CND/pCN hybrid systems.The charge transfer efficiencies of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, and CND/pCN samples were determined by photochronoamperometry measurements.Figure 9(a) shows the photocurrent-time curves for the samples studied, with several on-off cycles of visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Reproducible and uniform photocurrent responses were obtained for all the working electrodes after six irradiation cycles, indicating that the photocurrent response for each electrode was stable and reversible.For pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, a low photocurrent density was measured due to the rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs.The photocurrent density steadily increased with increasing CND content (from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt.).However, when the CND content exceeded 3 wt.(in the CND/pCN-4 sample) a slight decrease in the photocurrent density was observed.This was attributed to reduced visible-light activation of pCN as a result of increased CND coverage of the pCN surface.However, the CND/ pCN-4 sample still exhibited a higher photocurrent response than those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample demonstrated the highest Nano Res.photocurrent density of all the samples.We concluded that the recombination of charge carriers between pCN and the CND content was inhibited optimally, and thus the separation efficiency of charge carriers at the 0D/2D heterojunction interface was also optimized.The photocurrent in CND/pCN-3 sample showed a four-fold increase compared to the pure pCN sample.The inhibition of charge recombination implies that the 0D/2D heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs are well-formed, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity of CND/pCN-3. Furthermore, EIS analysis was conducted to provide further data on the charge transfer and separation processes, and to study the electrical conductivity of the photocatalysts 68.The charge transfer resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interface can, in general, be represented by the arc radius of the Nyquist impedance plots 17.Consistent with our transient photocurrent responses (Fig. 9(a)) and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results (Fig. 7), the lowest electron transfer resistance upon visible light irradiation was measured in the CND/pCN-3 sample; evidenced by it having the smallest arc radius in the EIS Nyquist diagram (Fig. S10 in the ESM).This demonstrates that the incorporation of an optimized proportion of CND significantly increases the electrical conductivity of pCN.Hence, this promotes effective interfacial electron transfer at the hetero-nanostructural interface of the CND/pCN-3 sample, by utilizing CNDs as electron storage co-catalysts to improve solar energy conversion. To determine the charge carrier density and band structures of the CND/pCN sample and improve our understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism, electrochemical Mott-Schottky analysis was conducted at frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz.As shown in Fig. 9(b), both the pCN and CND/pCN-3 samples produced positive slopes, thus demonstrating n-type semiconductor features despite the CND/pCN-3 sample being conjugated with CNDs.A descending gradient was present in the CND/pCN-3 Mott-Schottky plot, in contrast to the plot for pCN.This signifies a higher donor density in the CND/pCN-3 nanohybrids, which results from the improved -conjugation system of CNDs with pCN (as demonstrated by the EPR results in Fig. 6).For n-type semiconductors, the Mott-Schottky equation can be written as Eq. ( 5) 80 where C denotes the space charge capacitance, N D is the density of charge carriers, q is the electronic charge (1.602 10 -19 C), and o refer to the dielectric constant of g-C 3 N 4 (5.25) and permittivity in vacuum (8.85 10 -14 Fcm -2 ), respectively, E and E fb denote the applied potential and flat-band potential, respectively, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The value of E fb is determined by the x-intercept of the linear section of the Mott-Schottky curve.In this instance, the E fb of CND/pCN-3 showed a positive shift toward a smaller E fb value, in comparison with that of pCN.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were measured to be -1.1 and -1.4 V, respectively, vs. Ag/AgCl.The normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential was estimated from the potential relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode according to Eq. ( 6) 81 fb (vs.NHE) fb (pH0, vs. Ag/AgCl) AgCl where the pH of the electrolyte is ca.6.8 and E AgCl is 0.197 V.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were -0.50 and -0.80 V, respectively, vs. NHE.As an approximation, the CB minimum (CBM) of a typical n-type semiconductor is 0.3 V more negative than E fb 82, thus the CBM values of pCN and CND/pCN-3 are -1.1 and -0.8 V, respectively, vs. NHE.Based on the slopes of the Mott-Schottky plots, the density of charge carrier, N D can also be calculated from Eq. ( 7) 82 Using Eq. ( 7), the N D of CND/pCN-3 (1.37 10 22 cm -3 ) was found to be significantly greater than that of pCN (9.37 10 21 cm -3 ).The higher carrier density in the CND/pCN-3 sample was indicative of the greater spatial separation of electrons and holes in the presence of CNDs.This increased separation lowers the charge recombination rate, and increases the photocatalytic efficiency.This phenomenon gives rise to improved charge mobility and electrical conductivity and increases the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.This agrees well with the results of our photocurrent response tests (Fig. 9(a)) and EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. S10 in the ESM).Steady state PL spectroscopy is a powerful analysis tool for determining the nature of the radiative recombination process and charge kinetics of a photocatalyst (Fig. 10(a)) 42.For pCN, an intense, broad, PL emission peak was observed, indicating rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs, through band-band transitions.All of the CND/pCN hybrid photocatalysts showed significantly reduced PL intensities, relative to pCN.This was due to effective interfacial charge separation in the CND/pCN nanohybrids arising from well-formed 0D/2D heterojunction interfaces, which suppressed the charge recombination.Furthermore, the PL signal of CND/pCN-3 was the lowest in intensity, indicating the slowest charge recombination and that the CND concentration in the Nano Res.sample was optimal. TRPL was employed to acquire detailed insights into the lifetime of charge carrier dynamics (Fig. 10(b)).The fluorescence decay curves were fitted using the tri-exponential function: I(t) A 1 exp (-t/ 1 ) A 2 exp (-t/ 2 ) A 3 exp (-t/ 3 ), where A and denote the amplitudes and emission lifetimes of each component.The detailed kinetic parameters for all the photocatalyst used in this study are listed in Table 1.The average lifetime, ave , was calculated using Eq. ( 8), and describes the resultant TRPL features of each sample 83.As summarized in Table 1, when a small proportion (0.5 wt.) of CNDs was introduced onto the pCN surface, the emission lifetime was reduced from 6.72 ns (pCN) to 5.87 ns (CND/pCN-1).Incorporating an optimal concentration of CNDs (3 wt.) reduced the decay lifetime to 3.87 ns (CND/pCN-3); almost 1.7 times shorter than that of pure pCN.The significantly decreased emission lifetime of the CND/pCN-3 sample indicated that the interfacial electron injection from pCN to CNDs was rapid, due to the existence of non-radiative quenching routes.However, proportions CNDs greater that 3 wt.were detrimental to the photoactivity, as indicated by the longer decay lifetime (4.76 ns) of CND/pCN-4, because of the higher recombination rate of the charge carriers.Our TRPL results are in good agreement with the steady state PL analysis (Fig. 10(a)) and the photocatalytic results (Fig. 7). The dynamic charge carrier process was further evaluated by the determination of the electron transfer rate constant (k ET ) and the efficiency of electron transfer ( ET ), as expressed in Eqs. ( 9) and ( 10) 84.We found that the CND/pCN-3 sample had the largest k ET (1.10 10 8 s -1 ) and ET (42.4) of all the photocatalyst samples.This finding provides further evidence for the efficient transportation of photoexcited electrons from pCN to CNDs via an effective heterointerface between pCN and CNDs.This plays a pivotal role in increasing the probability of electrons participating in the photochemical reduction of CO 2 before electronhole recombination occurs.The PEC, steady state PL and TRPL results, all indicate that the CND/pCN-3 ave ET ave To This suggests that the photoexcitation of electrons was possible when the photon energy was sufficient to overcome the band gap between the HOMO and the LUMO.Using this information, we propose that the excitation process in a partially ionized system occurs as follows.Firstly, electrons in the pCN were photoexcited and moved into the LUMO, correspondingly, the generation of holes took place in the HOMO of pCN.The energy level of the HOMO in pCN was lower than that of the CND HOMO, so, in the second stage, the migration of the HOMO electron from the CND to the pCN occurred before combining with a hole (Fig. 11(c)).When this occurred, the net charge was shared across the carbon lattice, rather than being localized on the CND.Consequently, the net positive and negative charges induced an internal electric field, directed from pCN to CND.Furthermore, the internal electric field at the interface produced a force on the holes and electrons, in the opposite direction to the diffusion force.At thermal equilibrium, both the electric field force and the diffusion force are balanced.This was verified by density of state (DOS) and work function analyses, as discussed below. The total density of state (TDOS) and the partial density of state (PDOS) were calculated for the CND/ pCN heterojunction (Fig. 12).As shown in Fig. 12(a), the lower VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies ranging from -1 to -0.37 eV.The PDOS calculations of CND and pCN exhibited a similar shape, signifying successful bonding of pCN with CND.The upper VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies in the range of -0.37 to 0 eV.The CND bands made the greatest contribution to the VB maximum (VBM).Conversely, pCN mainly contributed to the sub-sharp closing of the VBM.The VBs of pCN were primarily composed of N 2p, N 2s, and C 2p orbitals, whereas the CBs of pCN were dominated by C 2p and N 2p orbitals (Fig. 12(b)).This agreed well with our previous work 18.Additionally, the DOS of CND consisted of discrete energy levels, which corresponded with the lack of symmetry in the CND structure (Fig. 12(c)).The C 2p and O 2p orbitals made the greatest contribution to the DOS, except in the energy range from 1.5 to 2 eV.From 1.5 to 2 eV, the DOS originated from C 2p and H 1s orbitals.On the basis of this analysis, we concluded that the CND/pCN heterojunction is a typical band alignment structure. The work function, , of a material is an important property, commonly employed as an intrinsic reference for band alignment.It can be defined as follows (Eq.( 11)) 85 E vac -E f (11) where E vac is the vacuum energy of a stationary electron near the surface of the material and E f denotes the ground state electronic structure calculation.The calculated electrostatic potentials for monolayer pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunctions are shown in 11(b).In addition, our first-principles DFT results were consistent with the photocatalytic and PEC experimental measurements. On the basis of the experimental and first-principles DFT computational results, a plausible photocatalytic mechanism of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO under visible light or simulated solar light was proposed (Fig. 14).When the CND/pCN photocatalyst was irradiated by visible light, holes and free electrons were generated in pCN.The electrons were photoexcited from the VB to the CB of pCN, thus leaving holes in the VB of pCN.As a result of the high electron storage capability and electronic conductivity of CNDs, the photoinduced electrons could be easily injected into the CNDs.The photogenerated holes can react with H 2 O to produce protons (H ).It is well established that delocalized -conjugated II 3 bonding is exhibited by CO 2 molecules, leading to the adsorption of CO 2 onto the surface of CNDs, through - conjugation 18.This adsorption causes the destabilization and activation of CO 2 .Thus, the electrons accumulated on the CND surface can successfully reduce CO 2 to CO (E (CO 2 /CO) -0.53V vs. NHE) and CH 4 (E (CO 2 / CH 4 ) -0.24V vs. NHE) via a two electron/two proton pathway and an eight electron/eight proton pathway, respectively 35.The photocatalytic mechanism with simulated solar light illumination is identical; the spatially separated photoinduced electrons and holes enhanced the reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H , to form CH"}, {"llm generation": "pCN", "source": "The electronic band structures of the pCN and CND/pCN photocatalysts were determined by EPR analysis at ambient temperature (Fig. 6).", "context": "The 0D/2D CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalysts were successfully synthesized using a surface charge-facilitated electrostatic interaction approach (Fig. 1).Initially, bulk g-C 3 N 4 was obtained by using urea as the precursor, as in our previously reported procedure (Fig. S3 in the ESM) 43,44.The bulk g-C 3 N 4 was subsequently delaminated into 2D g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets via an ultrasonication-assisted process.This was followed by the protonation of g-C 3 N 4 by HCl to alter its surface change from negative (-15.3 mV) to positive (14.0 mV), as confirmed by zeta potential analysis (Fig. S4 in the ESM).The negatively charged surface of the pure g-C 3 N 4 was ascribed to the -C-Nmotifs in the g-C 3 N 4 framework 18.The CNDs in solution, which was synthesized by the NaOH-assisted ultrasonic treatment of glucose, possessed a high negative charge (-40.4 mV) (Fig. S4 in the ESM).This was attributed to the abundance of oxygenated functional groups on the surfaces of CNDs.By considering the oppositely charged surfaces and - stacking interactions, we surmise that the CND/pCN catalysts were constructed through electrostatic selfassembly between the negatively charged CNDs and the positively charged pCN nanosheets.A series of CND/pCN samples were synthesized with different proportions of CNDs (0.5 wt., 1 wt., 3 wt.,and 5 wt.).The CND contents were confirmed by TGA analysis (Fig. S5 in the ESM). The surface morphologies of pCN, CNDs, and CND/ pCN-3 were investigated using TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 2).As shown in Fig. 2(a), delaminated pCN had 2D laminar and loose mesh morphologies with many in-plane pores several nanometers in diameter.Additionally, chiffon-like curled wrinkles were found at the edges of pCN nanosheets.These were formed because of decreases in the surface energy, due to the successful delamination of bulk g-C 3 N 4 into sheet- Nano Res.like structures.Additionally, the delaminated pCN suspension showed the Tyndall effect (inset of Fig. 2(a)), demonstrating the colloidal nature of highly dispersed pCN in water.The thinness of the pCN nanosheets reduces the distance for charge migration, and thus retards charge recombination.Their relatively large surface areas, of hundreds of nanometers in length, are favorable for the deposition of various compounds of different sizes and form effective heterointerfaces for charge transfer.Further evidence is provided in our previous studies, in which we hybridized conjugated g-C 3 N 4 with other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as 2D graphene, in pursuit of a highly efficient interfacial charge transfer process 18,44. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the CNDs were dispersed in a uniform manner, without significant agglomeration of the nanoparticles.The HRTEM image of the CNDs shows their amorphous outer surfaces and crystalline interiors.After a year of storage, the CND solution remained homogenous, light-brown, with no precipi-tation (Fig. 2(b1)).This indicates that the CNDs were efficiently dispersed in H 2 O, as a result of oxygen functional groups on their surfaces.This will be discussed further in the discussion of FTIR spectra.The presence of the Tyndall effect provided further evidence for the efficient dispersal of the CNDs.The Tyndall effect was observed when red laser light was passed through the CND solution (Fig. 2(b2)).Upon coupling with pCN, CNDs with an average diameter of 4.4 nm were uniformly deposited on the edges and surfaces of pCN nanosheets.This resulted in the formation of nanoislands with intact bonding, as shown in TEM and HRTEM images (Figs.2(c) and 2(d)).The HRTEM image (Fig. 2(d)) clearly shows lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (100) plane of graphitic carbon 54,55.These fringes confirm the successful development of interfacial contact between pCN and CNDs via electrostatic attraction, which is of fundamental importance for the migration of electrons in photocatalysis.56.This demonstrates that pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN possess comparable crystal structures, despite dissimilar surface charges.Meanwhile, CNDs showed a broad diffraction peak centered at ca. 23, which originated from a highly disordered graphitic carbon phase 57,58.The XRD spectra of all the CND/pCN samples showed patterns to those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.This indicates that the structural integrity of pCN remained intact when loaded with CNDs, allowing the modulation of its optical properties.No distinct characteristic CND peak was present in the spectra of any of the CND/pCN nanohybrids, owing to the comparatively low diffraction intensity and the fine dispersion of CNDs over the pCN substrates.This was in good agreement with other recent studies of CND/TiO 2 59 and CND/BiOBr 60. The chemical structure of the CND/pCN hybrid nanocomposites was determined by FTIR, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN (Fig. 3(a)).The FTIR spectrum of CNDs (Fig. 3(a1)) indicated the presence of various oxygen-containing functional groups: C-O (ca.1,000-1,400 cm -1 ), C-O-C (ca.1,200 cm -1 ), -COOH (ca.1,358 cm -1 ), and CO (ca.1,705 cm -1 ) 57,61,62.These groups were introduced at the basal planes and edges of the CNDs.By taking advantage of these abundant hydrophilic groups, the dispersibility and stability of CNDs in the water was enhanced, as previously discussed (Fig. 2(b1)).In addition to oxygen-containing groups, the stretching vibration of C-H bonds was evidenced by the absorption band at 2,915 cm -1 63.The absorption peak at ca. 1,610 cm -1 was assigned to CC vibration 61.No significant variations in these characteristic peaks were detected in any of the CND/pCN samples, in comparison to the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN samples (Figs.3(a2)-3(a7)).This suggests that there were no substantial changes to the basic framework of pCN when it was hybridized with CNDs.The broad absorption peak from 3,000-3,800 cm -1 was attributed to the vibrational modes of N-H and O-H groups 64.The presence of these functional groups is accounted for by the presence of adsorbed hydroxyl species and free amino groups in the samples.Additionally, the presence of aromatic C-N and CN heterocycles was confirmed by a number of strong absorption peaks from 1,200 to 1,700 cm -1 , located at 1,630, 1,565, 1,415, 1,330, and 1,250 cm -1 , assigned to their skeletal stretching modes 36,65.Furthermore, the breathing mode of tri-striazine was clearly visible at ca. 812 cm -1 in all g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and CND/pCN sample spectra 42.After the hybridization of pCN with CNDs, a slight shift toward a lower wavenumber was observed in the characteristic peaks of the CND/pCN samples, from 1,255 to 1,250 cm -1 and 812 to 806 cm -1 .This indicates that interactions between the \"nitrogen pots\" of pCN and CNDs were initiated by electrostatic attraction 66.These interactions weakened the C-N bonds, Nano Res.increasing their length, which was commensurate with the TEM results (Fig. 2).There were no additional bands evident in the FTIR spectra due to impurities in the CND/pCN nanocomposites.This was in agreement with the XRD results (Fig. S6 in the ESM), verifying that no impurities were added during the fabrication of CND/pCN. The degree of graphitization in CNDs was further evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3(b)).The Raman spectrum of the CNDs (Fig. 3(b1)) exhibited two characteristic bands, the D-band (ca.1,360 cm -1 ) and the G-band (ca.1,590 cm -1 ).These bands confirm the successful synthesis of CNDs from glucose.The intensity ratio of the D-band to the G-band, I D /I G , is used to characterize the disorder level in graphitic carbon.The I D /I G ratio of the CNDs synthesized in this study was calculated to be 0.62.These results indicated that the CNDs had a partially amorphous external surface along with crystallized, sp 2 , core characteristics, which was in agreement with the HRTEM image (Fig. 2(b)).In addition, no significant differences in the Raman peaks were evident between any of the CND/pCN samples.This demonstrates that the conjugation of pCN with CNDs had little effect on the chemical skeleton of pCN.The characteristic stretching vibrations of C-N at 461, 585, 710, 750, 975, 1,111, 1,150, 1,235, 1,462, and 1,625 cm -1 were concordant with the FTIR results (Fig. 3(a)), and matched closely with those reported in Refs.42,64,67. To gain insights into the elemental bonding configurations and chemical composition of the CND/ pCN-3 sample relative to pCN, XPS analysis was conducted (Fig. 4).As depicted in Fig. 4 Nano Res.incomplete condensation processes), and positively charged g-C 3 N 4 heterocycles (due to the protonation of HCl), respectively 18,66.The slight shifts in the deconvoluted peaks of the C 1s and N 1 s spectra strongly suggest that coupling interactions exist between CNDs and pCN in the hybrid nanostructures.Additionally, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of CND/pCN-3 can be divided into two dominant peaks, at 531.4 and 533.1 eV (Fig. 4(d)).These originate from the CO and HO-CO groups, respectively 63, signifying the deposition of CNDs onto the pCN substrate.In the pCN sample spectrum, the O 1s peak at 532.1 eV was assigned to the adsorbed CO 2 or H 2 O 18.Overall, the HRTEM, FTIR and XPS results imply that the electrostatic attraction of surface charges and - stacking interactions play pivotal roles in the self-assembly of CND/pCN nanohybrids, giving rise to an effective interfacial contact heterointerface. Figure 5 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples, obtained to investigate their optical properties.Pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN showed an absorption edge at around 440 nm with band gap energies of 2.8 eV, as determined in our previous work 18,43.Then the CNDs were incorporated, there was no significant shift in the onset of the absorption edge relative to that of pure pCN.This implies that the CNDs anchored to the pCN surface act as a conducting electron channel.Similar results have been reported in other studies of CND-based photocatalytic systems 69.The intrinsic charge generation of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction arises from the injection of The electronic band structures of the pCN and CND/pCN photocatalysts were determined by EPR analysis at ambient temperature (Fig. 6).Unlike the urea precursor, pure g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and all the CND/ pCN samples displayed a single Lorentzian line at ca. 3,508 G with a g value of ca.2.0045.This line confirms the presence of unpaired electrons on the carbon atoms of the -conjugated aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 56.The Lorentzian line of pCN was slightly enhanced, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 , after the introduction of protons into the g-C 3 N 4 framework (Fig. 6(a)).This was attributed to improved electron mobility and increased delocalization of the system 70.In addition, the intensity of the EPR signal of the CND/pCN samples increased significantly with increasing CND loading (Fig. 6(b)).This phenomenon was due to extensive - coupling between pCN and CNDs in the CND/pCN systems 69.Consequently, spin mobility and charge delocalization were improved in the CND/ pCN samples, resulting in a greater density of charge carriers 71.This will be discussed further in the Mott-Schottky section.Optimization of the electronic properties of the CND/pCN heterojunction interface, to accelerate charge transportation and separation, will be beneficial to the photocatalytic solar energy conversion process. Measurements of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O vapor were conducted under visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light Nano Res.illumination for a total reaction duration of 10 h (Fig. 7).For all the photocatalysts studied under visible light irradiation, there were two major products produced by the CO 2 reduction, namely CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a of CH 4 and CO, despite the incorporation of protons (H ) into the framework of g-C 3 N 4 .This clearly demonstrated that acidic protonation pretreatment to modify the surface charge of g-C 3 N 4 did not adversely affect the active sites, and thus its CO 2 reduction activity. The hybridization of CNDs had a significant effect on the photoactivity of CND/pCN toward CO 2 reduction.As the CND content increased from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt., a gradual rise in photocatalytic activity for the production of CH 4 and CO was observed (Figs.7(a Moreover, the total amounts of CH 4 and CO produced with CND/pCN-3 were 3.6-and 2.28-times greater than produced using pure pCN (Figs.7(a) and 7(b)).For both pCN and the CND/pCN samples, the total evolution of CO under visible light was greater than that of CH 4 by a factor of 2 to 3.2.Similar observations have also been reported by Wang et al. 66,72.This was attributed to the number of electrons and protons participating in the photoreaction, which kinetically determines the formation of the CO and CH 4 products 73.As shown in Eqs. ( 2) and ( 3), 2e -/2H and 8e -/8H are needed to produce CO and CH 4 , respectively.It is reasonable to infer that a larger quantity of CO was yielded than of CH 4 because fewer electrons and protons take part in the CO 2 reduction reaction that forms CO.Thus, we can conclude that the generation of CO or CH 4 is directly related to the number of free charge carriers present in the chemical reaction. (2) The significantly increased visible-light photoactivity of CND/pCN-3 heterojunction nanocomposites was attributed to the successful retardation of the electronhole recombination rate, in comparison to bare pCN.The AQE of CND/pCN-3 was calculated to be 0.076, using Eq. ( 4) and detailed in our previous reports 8,18,65.It is widely known that CNDs are superior electron-reservoir co-catalysts because of their beneficial electrical properties 47,747576.These properties are akin to other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes 16,22,77,78. In this study, when the concentration of CNDs CND/pCN was greater than 3 wt., the photocatalytic evolution of CO and CH 4 deteriorated markedly.This was evidenced in the CND/pCN-4 sample, despite its greater optical absorption (Fig. 5) relative to CND/pCN samples with a lower proportion of CNDs.This was because excessive CNDs on the pCN surface caused a reduction in the visible-light absorption of pCN, thus inhibiting the generation of charge carriers.This significantly reduced the quantity of photoinduced electrons transported from pCN to the CNDs.In addition, excessive CNDs deposited on the pCN surface hindered the formation of an efficient heterojunction interface between 0D CNDs and 2D pCN nanosheets, reducing electron transfer from pCN to the CNDs.Similar results have been observed by other research groups 49,52,60.These suggest that determining the optimum concentration of CNDs is vital for the formation of a synergistic heterojunction interface with pCN, and thus favorable photocatalytic performance.The detailed charge carrier dynamics of CND/pCN will be discussed in the later PEC, PL, and DFT sections, and compared with the photocatalytic results. The photoactivities of CNDs and the mechanically combined CND/pCN-3M sample were determined (Figs.7(a that the photocatalytic performance of CNDs was very low for the evolution of both CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)).This indicated that CNDs serve as effective co-catalysts for the CO 2 reduction reaction, rather than functioning as semiconductor photocatalysts themselves.Our results are in accordance with recent reports 69,79, which indicate that pure CNDs demonstrate no photocatalytic activity toward H 2 evolution or CO 2 fixation.Additionally, to emphasize the role of the hybrid heterojunction between CNDs and pCN, the visible-light catalytic activity of CND/ pCN-3M was determined for the evolution of CH 4 (Fig. S9 in the ESM).The experimental results showed that CND/pCN-3M (10.03 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ) had slightly higher activity than pCN (8.05 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), but its photoactivity was markedly lower than CND/pCN-3 (29.23 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), despite containing the same proportion of CNDs.This low activity was a result of the loosely connected heterojunctions in CND/ pCN-3M.This result demonstrates the importance of well-constructed heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs in the hybridized systems. In addition to measurement of the visible-light activities, the performance of the catalysts was measured when activated by simulated solar light.The simulated solar light was generated with a xenon lamp covered by an AM1.5 filter.An AM1.5 filter is the most reliable method to mimic natural sunlight, and hence to determine the feasibility of using the photocatalysts in CO 2 reduction processes under natural light 26.As illustrated in Figs.7(a) and 7(b), the proportion of CNDs is vital in determining the efficiency of the catalytic reactions.A similar trend of catalytic results to those obtained under visible light irradiation was obtained under simulated solar light.The optimum loading of CND was found to be 3 wt.,as in the CND/pCN-3 sample.In the CND/ pCN-3 experiment, 37.06 molg catalyst -1 of CH 4 and 68.80 molg catalyst -1 of CO were produced.These were 2.83-and 2.02-fold increases, respectively, over pure pCN.For all the catalysts tested, the total yields of each product were greater under simulated solar light than under visible light.This was because simulated sunlight contains a small fraction (4) of UV light, which has higher photon energies than visible light.These high-energy photons generate more free charge carriers to take part in the photochemical reactions, which increases the product yields.In summary, the highest CH 4 and CO productions were obtained using CND/pCN-3 (3 wt. of CNDs), under both visible light and simulated solar light illumination after 10 h of reaction. Recyclability, photostability and durability of photocatalysts are important factors in their prolonged utilization in large-scale applications.The time dependence of the rate of CH 4 production, using CND/pCN-3 as a representative photocatalyst, was measured over four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(a) and 8(b)).After four cycles (40 h) of CO 2 photoreduction experiments, the CND/pCN-3 sample retained its catalytic activity for CH 4 evolution.Additionally, there were no noticeable deviations in the chemical structure and phase composition of the CND/pCN-3 after four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(c) and 8(d)).These results demonstrate the excellent stability of the CND/pCN-3 catalyst. PEC analysis was performed to determine the significance of interfacial interactions, and charge transfer behavior, between pCN and CNDs, on the photoactivity of the CND/pCN hybrid systems.The charge transfer efficiencies of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, and CND/pCN samples were determined by photochronoamperometry measurements.Figure 9(a) shows the photocurrent-time curves for the samples studied, with several on-off cycles of visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Reproducible and uniform photocurrent responses were obtained for all the working electrodes after six irradiation cycles, indicating that the photocurrent response for each electrode was stable and reversible.For pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, a low photocurrent density was measured due to the rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs.The photocurrent density steadily increased with increasing CND content (from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt.).However, when the CND content exceeded 3 wt.(in the CND/pCN-4 sample) a slight decrease in the photocurrent density was observed.This was attributed to reduced visible-light activation of pCN as a result of increased CND coverage of the pCN surface.However, the CND/ pCN-4 sample still exhibited a higher photocurrent response than those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample demonstrated the highest Nano Res.photocurrent density of all the samples.We concluded that the recombination of charge carriers between pCN and the CND content was inhibited optimally, and thus the separation efficiency of charge carriers at the 0D/2D heterojunction interface was also optimized.The photocurrent in CND/pCN-3 sample showed a four-fold increase compared to the pure pCN sample.The inhibition of charge recombination implies that the 0D/2D heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs are well-formed, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity of CND/pCN-3. Furthermore, EIS analysis was conducted to provide further data on the charge transfer and separation processes, and to study the electrical conductivity of the photocatalysts 68.The charge transfer resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interface can, in general, be represented by the arc radius of the Nyquist impedance plots 17.Consistent with our transient photocurrent responses (Fig. 9(a)) and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results (Fig. 7), the lowest electron transfer resistance upon visible light irradiation was measured in the CND/pCN-3 sample; evidenced by it having the smallest arc radius in the EIS Nyquist diagram (Fig. S10 in the ESM).This demonstrates that the incorporation of an optimized proportion of CND significantly increases the electrical conductivity of pCN.Hence, this promotes effective interfacial electron transfer at the hetero-nanostructural interface of the CND/pCN-3 sample, by utilizing CNDs as electron storage co-catalysts to improve solar energy conversion. To determine the charge carrier density and band structures of the CND/pCN sample and improve our understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism, electrochemical Mott-Schottky analysis was conducted at frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz.As shown in Fig. 9(b), both the pCN and CND/pCN-3 samples produced positive slopes, thus demonstrating n-type semiconductor features despite the CND/pCN-3 sample being conjugated with CNDs.A descending gradient was present in the CND/pCN-3 Mott-Schottky plot, in contrast to the plot for pCN.This signifies a higher donor density in the CND/pCN-3 nanohybrids, which results from the improved -conjugation system of CNDs with pCN (as demonstrated by the EPR results in Fig. 6).For n-type semiconductors, the Mott-Schottky equation can be written as Eq. ( 5) 80 where C denotes the space charge capacitance, N D is the density of charge carriers, q is the electronic charge (1.602 10 -19 C), and o refer to the dielectric constant of g-C 3 N 4 (5.25) and permittivity in vacuum (8.85 10 -14 Fcm -2 ), respectively, E and E fb denote the applied potential and flat-band potential, respectively, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The value of E fb is determined by the x-intercept of the linear section of the Mott-Schottky curve.In this instance, the E fb of CND/pCN-3 showed a positive shift toward a smaller E fb value, in comparison with that of pCN.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were measured to be -1.1 and -1.4 V, respectively, vs. Ag/AgCl.The normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential was estimated from the potential relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode according to Eq. ( 6) 81 fb (vs.NHE) fb (pH0, vs. Ag/AgCl) AgCl where the pH of the electrolyte is ca.6.8 and E AgCl is 0.197 V.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were -0.50 and -0.80 V, respectively, vs. NHE.As an approximation, the CB minimum (CBM) of a typical n-type semiconductor is 0.3 V more negative than E fb 82, thus the CBM values of pCN and CND/pCN-3 are -1.1 and -0.8 V, respectively, vs. NHE.Based on the slopes of the Mott-Schottky plots, the density of charge carrier, N D can also be calculated from Eq. ( 7) 82 Using Eq. ( 7), the N D of CND/pCN-3 (1.37 10 22 cm -3 ) was found to be significantly greater than that of pCN (9.37 10 21 cm -3 ).The higher carrier density in the CND/pCN-3 sample was indicative of the greater spatial separation of electrons and holes in the presence of CNDs.This increased separation lowers the charge recombination rate, and increases the photocatalytic efficiency.This phenomenon gives rise to improved charge mobility and electrical conductivity and increases the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.This agrees well with the results of our photocurrent response tests (Fig. 9(a)) and EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. S10 in the ESM).Steady state PL spectroscopy is a powerful analysis tool for determining the nature of the radiative recombination process and charge kinetics of a photocatalyst (Fig. 10(a)) 42.For pCN, an intense, broad, PL emission peak was observed, indicating rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs, through band-band transitions.All of the CND/pCN hybrid photocatalysts showed significantly reduced PL intensities, relative to pCN.This was due to effective interfacial charge separation in the CND/pCN nanohybrids arising from well-formed 0D/2D heterojunction interfaces, which suppressed the charge recombination.Furthermore, the PL signal of CND/pCN-3 was the lowest in intensity, indicating the slowest charge recombination and that the CND concentration in the Nano Res.sample was optimal. TRPL was employed to acquire detailed insights into the lifetime of charge carrier dynamics (Fig. 10(b)).The fluorescence decay curves were fitted using the tri-exponential function: I(t) A 1 exp (-t/ 1 ) A 2 exp (-t/ 2 ) A 3 exp (-t/ 3 ), where A and denote the amplitudes and emission lifetimes of each component.The detailed kinetic parameters for all the photocatalyst used in this study are listed in Table 1.The average lifetime, ave , was calculated using Eq. ( 8), and describes the resultant TRPL features of each sample 83.As summarized in Table 1, when a small proportion (0.5 wt.) of CNDs was introduced onto the pCN surface, the emission lifetime was reduced from 6.72 ns (pCN) to 5.87 ns (CND/pCN-1).Incorporating an optimal concentration of CNDs (3 wt.) reduced the decay lifetime to 3.87 ns (CND/pCN-3); almost 1.7 times shorter than that of pure pCN.The significantly decreased emission lifetime of the CND/pCN-3 sample indicated that the interfacial electron injection from pCN to CNDs was rapid, due to the existence of non-radiative quenching routes.However, proportions CNDs greater that 3 wt.were detrimental to the photoactivity, as indicated by the longer decay lifetime (4.76 ns) of CND/pCN-4, because of the higher recombination rate of the charge carriers.Our TRPL results are in good agreement with the steady state PL analysis (Fig. 10(a)) and the photocatalytic results (Fig. 7). The dynamic charge carrier process was further evaluated by the determination of the electron transfer rate constant (k ET ) and the efficiency of electron transfer ( ET ), as expressed in Eqs. ( 9) and ( 10) 84.We found that the CND/pCN-3 sample had the largest k ET (1.10 10 8 s -1 ) and ET (42.4) of all the photocatalyst samples.This finding provides further evidence for the efficient transportation of photoexcited electrons from pCN to CNDs via an effective heterointerface between pCN and CNDs.This plays a pivotal role in increasing the probability of electrons participating in the photochemical reduction of CO 2 before electronhole recombination occurs.The PEC, steady state PL and TRPL results, all indicate that the CND/pCN-3 ave ET ave To This suggests that the photoexcitation of electrons was possible when the photon energy was sufficient to overcome the band gap between the HOMO and the LUMO.Using this information, we propose that the excitation process in a partially ionized system occurs as follows.Firstly, electrons in the pCN were photoexcited and moved into the LUMO, correspondingly, the generation of holes took place in the HOMO of pCN.The energy level of the HOMO in pCN was lower than that of the CND HOMO, so, in the second stage, the migration of the HOMO electron from the CND to the pCN occurred before combining with a hole (Fig. 11(c)).When this occurred, the net charge was shared across the carbon lattice, rather than being localized on the CND.Consequently, the net positive and negative charges induced an internal electric field, directed from pCN to CND.Furthermore, the internal electric field at the interface produced a force on the holes and electrons, in the opposite direction to the diffusion force.At thermal equilibrium, both the electric field force and the diffusion force are balanced.This was verified by density of state (DOS) and work function analyses, as discussed below. The total density of state (TDOS) and the partial density of state (PDOS) were calculated for the CND/ pCN heterojunction (Fig. 12).As shown in Fig. 12(a), the lower VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies ranging from -1 to -0.37 eV.The PDOS calculations of CND and pCN exhibited a similar shape, signifying successful bonding of pCN with CND.The upper VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies in the range of -0.37 to 0 eV.The CND bands made the greatest contribution to the VB maximum (VBM).Conversely, pCN mainly contributed to the sub-sharp closing of the VBM.The VBs of pCN were primarily composed of N 2p, N 2s, and C 2p orbitals, whereas the CBs of pCN were dominated by C 2p and N 2p orbitals (Fig. 12(b)).This agreed well with our previous work 18.Additionally, the DOS of CND consisted of discrete energy levels, which corresponded with the lack of symmetry in the CND structure (Fig. 12(c)).The C 2p and O 2p orbitals made the greatest contribution to the DOS, except in the energy range from 1.5 to 2 eV.From 1.5 to 2 eV, the DOS originated from C 2p and H 1s orbitals.On the basis of this analysis, we concluded that the CND/pCN heterojunction is a typical band alignment structure. The work function, , of a material is an important property, commonly employed as an intrinsic reference for band alignment.It can be defined as follows (Eq.( 11)) 85 E vac -E f (11) where E vac is the vacuum energy of a stationary electron near the surface of the material and E f denotes the ground state electronic structure calculation.The calculated electrostatic potentials for monolayer pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunctions are shown in 11(b).In addition, our first-principles DFT results were consistent with the photocatalytic and PEC experimental measurements. On the basis of the experimental and first-principles DFT computational results, a plausible photocatalytic mechanism of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO under visible light or simulated solar light was proposed (Fig. 14).When the CND/pCN photocatalyst was irradiated by visible light, holes and free electrons were generated in pCN.The electrons were photoexcited from the VB to the CB of pCN, thus leaving holes in the VB of pCN.As a result of the high electron storage capability and electronic conductivity of CNDs, the photoinduced electrons could be easily injected into the CNDs.The photogenerated holes can react with H 2 O to produce protons (H ).It is well established that delocalized -conjugated II 3 bonding is exhibited by CO 2 molecules, leading to the adsorption of CO 2 onto the surface of CNDs, through - conjugation 18.This adsorption causes the destabilization and activation of CO 2 .Thus, the electrons accumulated on the CND surface can successfully reduce CO 2 to CO (E (CO 2 /CO) -0.53V vs. NHE) and CH 4 (E (CO 2 / CH 4 ) -0.24V vs. NHE) via a two electron/two proton pathway and an eight electron/eight proton pathway, respectively 35.The photocatalytic mechanism with simulated solar light illumination is identical; the spatially separated photoinduced electrons and holes enhanced the reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H , to form CH"}, {"llm generation": "CND/pCN-3M", "source": "The experimental results showed that CND/pCN-3M (10.03 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ) had slightly higher activity than pCN (8.05 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), but its photoactivity was markedly lower than CND/pCN-3 (29.23 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), despite containing the same proportion of CNDs.", "context": "The 0D/2D CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalysts were successfully synthesized using a surface charge-facilitated electrostatic interaction approach (Fig. 1).Initially, bulk g-C 3 N 4 was obtained by using urea as the precursor, as in our previously reported procedure (Fig. S3 in the ESM) 43,44.The bulk g-C 3 N 4 was subsequently delaminated into 2D g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets via an ultrasonication-assisted process.This was followed by the protonation of g-C 3 N 4 by HCl to alter its surface change from negative (-15.3 mV) to positive (14.0 mV), as confirmed by zeta potential analysis (Fig. S4 in the ESM).The negatively charged surface of the pure g-C 3 N 4 was ascribed to the -C-Nmotifs in the g-C 3 N 4 framework 18.The CNDs in solution, which was synthesized by the NaOH-assisted ultrasonic treatment of glucose, possessed a high negative charge (-40.4 mV) (Fig. S4 in the ESM).This was attributed to the abundance of oxygenated functional groups on the surfaces of CNDs.By considering the oppositely charged surfaces and - stacking interactions, we surmise that the CND/pCN catalysts were constructed through electrostatic selfassembly between the negatively charged CNDs and the positively charged pCN nanosheets.A series of CND/pCN samples were synthesized with different proportions of CNDs (0.5 wt., 1 wt., 3 wt.,and 5 wt.).The CND contents were confirmed by TGA analysis (Fig. S5 in the ESM). The surface morphologies of pCN, CNDs, and CND/ pCN-3 were investigated using TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 2).As shown in Fig. 2(a), delaminated pCN had 2D laminar and loose mesh morphologies with many in-plane pores several nanometers in diameter.Additionally, chiffon-like curled wrinkles were found at the edges of pCN nanosheets.These were formed because of decreases in the surface energy, due to the successful delamination of bulk g-C 3 N 4 into sheet- Nano Res.like structures.Additionally, the delaminated pCN suspension showed the Tyndall effect (inset of Fig. 2(a)), demonstrating the colloidal nature of highly dispersed pCN in water.The thinness of the pCN nanosheets reduces the distance for charge migration, and thus retards charge recombination.Their relatively large surface areas, of hundreds of nanometers in length, are favorable for the deposition of various compounds of different sizes and form effective heterointerfaces for charge transfer.Further evidence is provided in our previous studies, in which we hybridized conjugated g-C 3 N 4 with other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as 2D graphene, in pursuit of a highly efficient interfacial charge transfer process 18,44. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the CNDs were dispersed in a uniform manner, without significant agglomeration of the nanoparticles.The HRTEM image of the CNDs shows their amorphous outer surfaces and crystalline interiors.After a year of storage, the CND solution remained homogenous, light-brown, with no precipi-tation (Fig. 2(b1)).This indicates that the CNDs were efficiently dispersed in H 2 O, as a result of oxygen functional groups on their surfaces.This will be discussed further in the discussion of FTIR spectra.The presence of the Tyndall effect provided further evidence for the efficient dispersal of the CNDs.The Tyndall effect was observed when red laser light was passed through the CND solution (Fig. 2(b2)).Upon coupling with pCN, CNDs with an average diameter of 4.4 nm were uniformly deposited on the edges and surfaces of pCN nanosheets.This resulted in the formation of nanoislands with intact bonding, as shown in TEM and HRTEM images (Figs.2(c) and 2(d)).The HRTEM image (Fig. 2(d)) clearly shows lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (100) plane of graphitic carbon 54,55.These fringes confirm the successful development of interfacial contact between pCN and CNDs via electrostatic attraction, which is of fundamental importance for the migration of electrons in photocatalysis.56.This demonstrates that pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN possess comparable crystal structures, despite dissimilar surface charges.Meanwhile, CNDs showed a broad diffraction peak centered at ca. 23, which originated from a highly disordered graphitic carbon phase 57,58.The XRD spectra of all the CND/pCN samples showed patterns to those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.This indicates that the structural integrity of pCN remained intact when loaded with CNDs, allowing the modulation of its optical properties.No distinct characteristic CND peak was present in the spectra of any of the CND/pCN nanohybrids, owing to the comparatively low diffraction intensity and the fine dispersion of CNDs over the pCN substrates.This was in good agreement with other recent studies of CND/TiO 2 59 and CND/BiOBr 60. The chemical structure of the CND/pCN hybrid nanocomposites was determined by FTIR, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN (Fig. 3(a)).The FTIR spectrum of CNDs (Fig. 3(a1)) indicated the presence of various oxygen-containing functional groups: C-O (ca.1,000-1,400 cm -1 ), C-O-C (ca.1,200 cm -1 ), -COOH (ca.1,358 cm -1 ), and CO (ca.1,705 cm -1 ) 57,61,62.These groups were introduced at the basal planes and edges of the CNDs.By taking advantage of these abundant hydrophilic groups, the dispersibility and stability of CNDs in the water was enhanced, as previously discussed (Fig. 2(b1)).In addition to oxygen-containing groups, the stretching vibration of C-H bonds was evidenced by the absorption band at 2,915 cm -1 63.The absorption peak at ca. 1,610 cm -1 was assigned to CC vibration 61.No significant variations in these characteristic peaks were detected in any of the CND/pCN samples, in comparison to the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN samples (Figs.3(a2)-3(a7)).This suggests that there were no substantial changes to the basic framework of pCN when it was hybridized with CNDs.The broad absorption peak from 3,000-3,800 cm -1 was attributed to the vibrational modes of N-H and O-H groups 64.The presence of these functional groups is accounted for by the presence of adsorbed hydroxyl species and free amino groups in the samples.Additionally, the presence of aromatic C-N and CN heterocycles was confirmed by a number of strong absorption peaks from 1,200 to 1,700 cm -1 , located at 1,630, 1,565, 1,415, 1,330, and 1,250 cm -1 , assigned to their skeletal stretching modes 36,65.Furthermore, the breathing mode of tri-striazine was clearly visible at ca. 812 cm -1 in all g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and CND/pCN sample spectra 42.After the hybridization of pCN with CNDs, a slight shift toward a lower wavenumber was observed in the characteristic peaks of the CND/pCN samples, from 1,255 to 1,250 cm -1 and 812 to 806 cm -1 .This indicates that interactions between the \"nitrogen pots\" of pCN and CNDs were initiated by electrostatic attraction 66.These interactions weakened the C-N bonds, Nano Res.increasing their length, which was commensurate with the TEM results (Fig. 2).There were no additional bands evident in the FTIR spectra due to impurities in the CND/pCN nanocomposites.This was in agreement with the XRD results (Fig. S6 in the ESM), verifying that no impurities were added during the fabrication of CND/pCN. The degree of graphitization in CNDs was further evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3(b)).The Raman spectrum of the CNDs (Fig. 3(b1)) exhibited two characteristic bands, the D-band (ca.1,360 cm -1 ) and the G-band (ca.1,590 cm -1 ).These bands confirm the successful synthesis of CNDs from glucose.The intensity ratio of the D-band to the G-band, I D /I G , is used to characterize the disorder level in graphitic carbon.The I D /I G ratio of the CNDs synthesized in this study was calculated to be 0.62.These results indicated that the CNDs had a partially amorphous external surface along with crystallized, sp 2 , core characteristics, which was in agreement with the HRTEM image (Fig. 2(b)).In addition, no significant differences in the Raman peaks were evident between any of the CND/pCN samples.This demonstrates that the conjugation of pCN with CNDs had little effect on the chemical skeleton of pCN.The characteristic stretching vibrations of C-N at 461, 585, 710, 750, 975, 1,111, 1,150, 1,235, 1,462, and 1,625 cm -1 were concordant with the FTIR results (Fig. 3(a)), and matched closely with those reported in Refs.42,64,67. To gain insights into the elemental bonding configurations and chemical composition of the CND/ pCN-3 sample relative to pCN, XPS analysis was conducted (Fig. 4).As depicted in Fig. 4 Nano Res.incomplete condensation processes), and positively charged g-C 3 N 4 heterocycles (due to the protonation of HCl), respectively 18,66.The slight shifts in the deconvoluted peaks of the C 1s and N 1 s spectra strongly suggest that coupling interactions exist between CNDs and pCN in the hybrid nanostructures.Additionally, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of CND/pCN-3 can be divided into two dominant peaks, at 531.4 and 533.1 eV (Fig. 4(d)).These originate from the CO and HO-CO groups, respectively 63, signifying the deposition of CNDs onto the pCN substrate.In the pCN sample spectrum, the O 1s peak at 532.1 eV was assigned to the adsorbed CO 2 or H 2 O 18.Overall, the HRTEM, FTIR and XPS results imply that the electrostatic attraction of surface charges and - stacking interactions play pivotal roles in the self-assembly of CND/pCN nanohybrids, giving rise to an effective interfacial contact heterointerface. Figure 5 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples, obtained to investigate their optical properties.Pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN showed an absorption edge at around 440 nm with band gap energies of 2.8 eV, as determined in our previous work 18,43.Then the CNDs were incorporated, there was no significant shift in the onset of the absorption edge relative to that of pure pCN.This implies that the CNDs anchored to the pCN surface act as a conducting electron channel.Similar results have been reported in other studies of CND-based photocatalytic systems 69.The intrinsic charge generation of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction arises from the injection of The electronic band structures of the pCN and CND/pCN photocatalysts were determined by EPR analysis at ambient temperature (Fig. 6).Unlike the urea precursor, pure g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and all the CND/ pCN samples displayed a single Lorentzian line at ca. 3,508 G with a g value of ca.2.0045.This line confirms the presence of unpaired electrons on the carbon atoms of the -conjugated aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 56.The Lorentzian line of pCN was slightly enhanced, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 , after the introduction of protons into the g-C 3 N 4 framework (Fig. 6(a)).This was attributed to improved electron mobility and increased delocalization of the system 70.In addition, the intensity of the EPR signal of the CND/pCN samples increased significantly with increasing CND loading (Fig. 6(b)).This phenomenon was due to extensive - coupling between pCN and CNDs in the CND/pCN systems 69.Consequently, spin mobility and charge delocalization were improved in the CND/ pCN samples, resulting in a greater density of charge carriers 71.This will be discussed further in the Mott-Schottky section.Optimization of the electronic properties of the CND/pCN heterojunction interface, to accelerate charge transportation and separation, will be beneficial to the photocatalytic solar energy conversion process. Measurements of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O vapor were conducted under visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light Nano Res.illumination for a total reaction duration of 10 h (Fig. 7).For all the photocatalysts studied under visible light irradiation, there were two major products produced by the CO 2 reduction, namely CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a of CH 4 and CO, despite the incorporation of protons (H ) into the framework of g-C 3 N 4 .This clearly demonstrated that acidic protonation pretreatment to modify the surface charge of g-C 3 N 4 did not adversely affect the active sites, and thus its CO 2 reduction activity. The hybridization of CNDs had a significant effect on the photoactivity of CND/pCN toward CO 2 reduction.As the CND content increased from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt., a gradual rise in photocatalytic activity for the production of CH 4 and CO was observed (Figs.7(a Moreover, the total amounts of CH 4 and CO produced with CND/pCN-3 were 3.6-and 2.28-times greater than produced using pure pCN (Figs.7(a) and 7(b)).For both pCN and the CND/pCN samples, the total evolution of CO under visible light was greater than that of CH 4 by a factor of 2 to 3.2.Similar observations have also been reported by Wang et al. 66,72.This was attributed to the number of electrons and protons participating in the photoreaction, which kinetically determines the formation of the CO and CH 4 products 73.As shown in Eqs. ( 2) and ( 3), 2e -/2H and 8e -/8H are needed to produce CO and CH 4 , respectively.It is reasonable to infer that a larger quantity of CO was yielded than of CH 4 because fewer electrons and protons take part in the CO 2 reduction reaction that forms CO.Thus, we can conclude that the generation of CO or CH 4 is directly related to the number of free charge carriers present in the chemical reaction. (2) The significantly increased visible-light photoactivity of CND/pCN-3 heterojunction nanocomposites was attributed to the successful retardation of the electronhole recombination rate, in comparison to bare pCN.The AQE of CND/pCN-3 was calculated to be 0.076, using Eq. ( 4) and detailed in our previous reports 8,18,65.It is widely known that CNDs are superior electron-reservoir co-catalysts because of their beneficial electrical properties 47,747576.These properties are akin to other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes 16,22,77,78. In this study, when the concentration of CNDs CND/pCN was greater than 3 wt., the photocatalytic evolution of CO and CH 4 deteriorated markedly.This was evidenced in the CND/pCN-4 sample, despite its greater optical absorption (Fig. 5) relative to CND/pCN samples with a lower proportion of CNDs.This was because excessive CNDs on the pCN surface caused a reduction in the visible-light absorption of pCN, thus inhibiting the generation of charge carriers.This significantly reduced the quantity of photoinduced electrons transported from pCN to the CNDs.In addition, excessive CNDs deposited on the pCN surface hindered the formation of an efficient heterojunction interface between 0D CNDs and 2D pCN nanosheets, reducing electron transfer from pCN to the CNDs.Similar results have been observed by other research groups 49,52,60.These suggest that determining the optimum concentration of CNDs is vital for the formation of a synergistic heterojunction interface with pCN, and thus favorable photocatalytic performance.The detailed charge carrier dynamics of CND/pCN will be discussed in the later PEC, PL, and DFT sections, and compared with the photocatalytic results. The photoactivities of CNDs and the mechanically combined CND/pCN-3M sample were determined (Figs.7(a that the photocatalytic performance of CNDs was very low for the evolution of both CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)).This indicated that CNDs serve as effective co-catalysts for the CO 2 reduction reaction, rather than functioning as semiconductor photocatalysts themselves.Our results are in accordance with recent reports 69,79, which indicate that pure CNDs demonstrate no photocatalytic activity toward H 2 evolution or CO 2 fixation.Additionally, to emphasize the role of the hybrid heterojunction between CNDs and pCN, the visible-light catalytic activity of CND/ pCN-3M was determined for the evolution of CH 4 (Fig. S9 in the ESM).The experimental results showed that CND/pCN-3M (10.03 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ) had slightly higher activity than pCN (8.05 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), but its photoactivity was markedly lower than CND/pCN-3 (29.23 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), despite containing the same proportion of CNDs.This low activity was a result of the loosely connected heterojunctions in CND/ pCN-3M.This result demonstrates the importance of well-constructed heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs in the hybridized systems. In addition to measurement of the visible-light activities, the performance of the catalysts was measured when activated by simulated solar light.The simulated solar light was generated with a xenon lamp covered by an AM1.5 filter.An AM1.5 filter is the most reliable method to mimic natural sunlight, and hence to determine the feasibility of using the photocatalysts in CO 2 reduction processes under natural light 26.As illustrated in Figs.7(a) and 7(b), the proportion of CNDs is vital in determining the efficiency of the catalytic reactions.A similar trend of catalytic results to those obtained under visible light irradiation was obtained under simulated solar light.The optimum loading of CND was found to be 3 wt.,as in the CND/pCN-3 sample.In the CND/ pCN-3 experiment, 37.06 molg catalyst -1 of CH 4 and 68.80 molg catalyst -1 of CO were produced.These were 2.83-and 2.02-fold increases, respectively, over pure pCN.For all the catalysts tested, the total yields of each product were greater under simulated solar light than under visible light.This was because simulated sunlight contains a small fraction (4) of UV light, which has higher photon energies than visible light.These high-energy photons generate more free charge carriers to take part in the photochemical reactions, which increases the product yields.In summary, the highest CH 4 and CO productions were obtained using CND/pCN-3 (3 wt. of CNDs), under both visible light and simulated solar light illumination after 10 h of reaction. Recyclability, photostability and durability of photocatalysts are important factors in their prolonged utilization in large-scale applications.The time dependence of the rate of CH 4 production, using CND/pCN-3 as a representative photocatalyst, was measured over four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(a) and 8(b)).After four cycles (40 h) of CO 2 photoreduction experiments, the CND/pCN-3 sample retained its catalytic activity for CH 4 evolution.Additionally, there were no noticeable deviations in the chemical structure and phase composition of the CND/pCN-3 after four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(c) and 8(d)).These results demonstrate the excellent stability of the CND/pCN-3 catalyst. PEC analysis was performed to determine the significance of interfacial interactions, and charge transfer behavior, between pCN and CNDs, on the photoactivity of the CND/pCN hybrid systems.The charge transfer efficiencies of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, and CND/pCN samples were determined by photochronoamperometry measurements.Figure 9(a) shows the photocurrent-time curves for the samples studied, with several on-off cycles of visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Reproducible and uniform photocurrent responses were obtained for all the working electrodes after six irradiation cycles, indicating that the photocurrent response for each electrode was stable and reversible.For pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, a low photocurrent density was measured due to the rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs.The photocurrent density steadily increased with increasing CND content (from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt.).However, when the CND content exceeded 3 wt.(in the CND/pCN-4 sample) a slight decrease in the photocurrent density was observed.This was attributed to reduced visible-light activation of pCN as a result of increased CND coverage of the pCN surface.However, the CND/ pCN-4 sample still exhibited a higher photocurrent response than those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample demonstrated the highest Nano Res.photocurrent density of all the samples.We concluded that the recombination of charge carriers between pCN and the CND content was inhibited optimally, and thus the separation efficiency of charge carriers at the 0D/2D heterojunction interface was also optimized.The photocurrent in CND/pCN-3 sample showed a four-fold increase compared to the pure pCN sample.The inhibition of charge recombination implies that the 0D/2D heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs are well-formed, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity of CND/pCN-3. Furthermore, EIS analysis was conducted to provide further data on the charge transfer and separation processes, and to study the electrical conductivity of the photocatalysts 68.The charge transfer resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interface can, in general, be represented by the arc radius of the Nyquist impedance plots 17.Consistent with our transient photocurrent responses (Fig. 9(a)) and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results (Fig. 7), the lowest electron transfer resistance upon visible light irradiation was measured in the CND/pCN-3 sample; evidenced by it having the smallest arc radius in the EIS Nyquist diagram (Fig. S10 in the ESM).This demonstrates that the incorporation of an optimized proportion of CND significantly increases the electrical conductivity of pCN.Hence, this promotes effective interfacial electron transfer at the hetero-nanostructural interface of the CND/pCN-3 sample, by utilizing CNDs as electron storage co-catalysts to improve solar energy conversion. To determine the charge carrier density and band structures of the CND/pCN sample and improve our understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism, electrochemical Mott-Schottky analysis was conducted at frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz.As shown in Fig. 9(b), both the pCN and CND/pCN-3 samples produced positive slopes, thus demonstrating n-type semiconductor features despite the CND/pCN-3 sample being conjugated with CNDs.A descending gradient was present in the CND/pCN-3 Mott-Schottky plot, in contrast to the plot for pCN.This signifies a higher donor density in the CND/pCN-3 nanohybrids, which results from the improved -conjugation system of CNDs with pCN (as demonstrated by the EPR results in Fig. 6).For n-type semiconductors, the Mott-Schottky equation can be written as Eq. ( 5) 80 where C denotes the space charge capacitance, N D is the density of charge carriers, q is the electronic charge (1.602 10 -19 C), and o refer to the dielectric constant of g-C 3 N 4 (5.25) and permittivity in vacuum (8.85 10 -14 Fcm -2 ), respectively, E and E fb denote the applied potential and flat-band potential, respectively, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The value of E fb is determined by the x-intercept of the linear section of the Mott-Schottky curve.In this instance, the E fb of CND/pCN-3 showed a positive shift toward a smaller E fb value, in comparison with that of pCN.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were measured to be -1.1 and -1.4 V, respectively, vs. Ag/AgCl.The normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential was estimated from the potential relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode according to Eq. ( 6) 81 fb (vs.NHE) fb (pH0, vs. Ag/AgCl) AgCl where the pH of the electrolyte is ca.6.8 and E AgCl is 0.197 V.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were -0.50 and -0.80 V, respectively, vs. NHE.As an approximation, the CB minimum (CBM) of a typical n-type semiconductor is 0.3 V more negative than E fb 82, thus the CBM values of pCN and CND/pCN-3 are -1.1 and -0.8 V, respectively, vs. NHE.Based on the slopes of the Mott-Schottky plots, the density of charge carrier, N D can also be calculated from Eq. ( 7) 82 Using Eq. ( 7), the N D of CND/pCN-3 (1.37 10 22 cm -3 ) was found to be significantly greater than that of pCN (9.37 10 21 cm -3 ).The higher carrier density in the CND/pCN-3 sample was indicative of the greater spatial separation of electrons and holes in the presence of CNDs.This increased separation lowers the charge recombination rate, and increases the photocatalytic efficiency.This phenomenon gives rise to improved charge mobility and electrical conductivity and increases the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.This agrees well with the results of our photocurrent response tests (Fig. 9(a)) and EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. S10 in the ESM).Steady state PL spectroscopy is a powerful analysis tool for determining the nature of the radiative recombination process and charge kinetics of a photocatalyst (Fig. 10(a)) 42.For pCN, an intense, broad, PL emission peak was observed, indicating rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs, through band-band transitions.All of the CND/pCN hybrid photocatalysts showed significantly reduced PL intensities, relative to pCN.This was due to effective interfacial charge separation in the CND/pCN nanohybrids arising from well-formed 0D/2D heterojunction interfaces, which suppressed the charge recombination.Furthermore, the PL signal of CND/pCN-3 was the lowest in intensity, indicating the slowest charge recombination and that the CND concentration in the Nano Res.sample was optimal. TRPL was employed to acquire detailed insights into the lifetime of charge carrier dynamics (Fig. 10(b)).The fluorescence decay curves were fitted using the tri-exponential function: I(t) A 1 exp (-t/ 1 ) A 2 exp (-t/ 2 ) A 3 exp (-t/ 3 ), where A and denote the amplitudes and emission lifetimes of each component.The detailed kinetic parameters for all the photocatalyst used in this study are listed in Table 1.The average lifetime, ave , was calculated using Eq. ( 8), and describes the resultant TRPL features of each sample 83.As summarized in Table 1, when a small proportion (0.5 wt.) of CNDs was introduced onto the pCN surface, the emission lifetime was reduced from 6.72 ns (pCN) to 5.87 ns (CND/pCN-1).Incorporating an optimal concentration of CNDs (3 wt.) reduced the decay lifetime to 3.87 ns (CND/pCN-3); almost 1.7 times shorter than that of pure pCN.The significantly decreased emission lifetime of the CND/pCN-3 sample indicated that the interfacial electron injection from pCN to CNDs was rapid, due to the existence of non-radiative quenching routes.However, proportions CNDs greater that 3 wt.were detrimental to the photoactivity, as indicated by the longer decay lifetime (4.76 ns) of CND/pCN-4, because of the higher recombination rate of the charge carriers.Our TRPL results are in good agreement with the steady state PL analysis (Fig. 10(a)) and the photocatalytic results (Fig. 7). The dynamic charge carrier process was further evaluated by the determination of the electron transfer rate constant (k ET ) and the efficiency of electron transfer ( ET ), as expressed in Eqs. ( 9) and ( 10) 84.We found that the CND/pCN-3 sample had the largest k ET (1.10 10 8 s -1 ) and ET (42.4) of all the photocatalyst samples.This finding provides further evidence for the efficient transportation of photoexcited electrons from pCN to CNDs via an effective heterointerface between pCN and CNDs.This plays a pivotal role in increasing the probability of electrons participating in the photochemical reduction of CO 2 before electronhole recombination occurs.The PEC, steady state PL and TRPL results, all indicate that the CND/pCN-3 ave ET ave To This suggests that the photoexcitation of electrons was possible when the photon energy was sufficient to overcome the band gap between the HOMO and the LUMO.Using this information, we propose that the excitation process in a partially ionized system occurs as follows.Firstly, electrons in the pCN were photoexcited and moved into the LUMO, correspondingly, the generation of holes took place in the HOMO of pCN.The energy level of the HOMO in pCN was lower than that of the CND HOMO, so, in the second stage, the migration of the HOMO electron from the CND to the pCN occurred before combining with a hole (Fig. 11(c)).When this occurred, the net charge was shared across the carbon lattice, rather than being localized on the CND.Consequently, the net positive and negative charges induced an internal electric field, directed from pCN to CND.Furthermore, the internal electric field at the interface produced a force on the holes and electrons, in the opposite direction to the diffusion force.At thermal equilibrium, both the electric field force and the diffusion force are balanced.This was verified by density of state (DOS) and work function analyses, as discussed below. The total density of state (TDOS) and the partial density of state (PDOS) were calculated for the CND/ pCN heterojunction (Fig. 12).As shown in Fig. 12(a), the lower VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies ranging from -1 to -0.37 eV.The PDOS calculations of CND and pCN exhibited a similar shape, signifying successful bonding of pCN with CND.The upper VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies in the range of -0.37 to 0 eV.The CND bands made the greatest contribution to the VB maximum (VBM).Conversely, pCN mainly contributed to the sub-sharp closing of the VBM.The VBs of pCN were primarily composed of N 2p, N 2s, and C 2p orbitals, whereas the CBs of pCN were dominated by C 2p and N 2p orbitals (Fig. 12(b)).This agreed well with our previous work 18.Additionally, the DOS of CND consisted of discrete energy levels, which corresponded with the lack of symmetry in the CND structure (Fig. 12(c)).The C 2p and O 2p orbitals made the greatest contribution to the DOS, except in the energy range from 1.5 to 2 eV.From 1.5 to 2 eV, the DOS originated from C 2p and H 1s orbitals.On the basis of this analysis, we concluded that the CND/pCN heterojunction is a typical band alignment structure. The work function, , of a material is an important property, commonly employed as an intrinsic reference for band alignment.It can be defined as follows (Eq.( 11)) 85 E vac -E f (11) where E vac is the vacuum energy of a stationary electron near the surface of the material and E f denotes the ground state electronic structure calculation.The calculated electrostatic potentials for monolayer pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunctions are shown in 11(b).In addition, our first-principles DFT results were consistent with the photocatalytic and PEC experimental measurements. On the basis of the experimental and first-principles DFT computational results, a plausible photocatalytic mechanism of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO under visible light or simulated solar light was proposed (Fig. 14).When the CND/pCN photocatalyst was irradiated by visible light, holes and free electrons were generated in pCN.The electrons were photoexcited from the VB to the CB of pCN, thus leaving holes in the VB of pCN.As a result of the high electron storage capability and electronic conductivity of CNDs, the photoinduced electrons could be easily injected into the CNDs.The photogenerated holes can react with H 2 O to produce protons (H ).It is well established that delocalized -conjugated II 3 bonding is exhibited by CO 2 molecules, leading to the adsorption of CO 2 onto the surface of CNDs, through - conjugation 18.This adsorption causes the destabilization and activation of CO 2 .Thus, the electrons accumulated on the CND surface can successfully reduce CO 2 to CO (E (CO 2 /CO) -0.53V vs. NHE) and CH 4 (E (CO 2 / CH 4 ) -0.24V vs. NHE) via a two electron/two proton pathway and an eight electron/eight proton pathway, respectively 35.The photocatalytic mechanism with simulated solar light illumination is identical; the spatially separated photoinduced electrons and holes enhanced the reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H , to form CH"}, {"llm generation": "CND/pCN-3", "source": "The experimental results showed that CND/pCN-3M (10.03 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ) had slightly higher activity than pCN (8.05 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), but its photoactivity was markedly lower than CND/pCN-3 (29.23 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), despite containing the same proportion of CNDs.", "context": "The 0D/2D CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalysts were successfully synthesized using a surface charge-facilitated electrostatic interaction approach (Fig. 1).Initially, bulk g-C 3 N 4 was obtained by using urea as the precursor, as in our previously reported procedure (Fig. S3 in the ESM) 43,44.The bulk g-C 3 N 4 was subsequently delaminated into 2D g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets via an ultrasonication-assisted process.This was followed by the protonation of g-C 3 N 4 by HCl to alter its surface change from negative (-15.3 mV) to positive (14.0 mV), as confirmed by zeta potential analysis (Fig. S4 in the ESM).The negatively charged surface of the pure g-C 3 N 4 was ascribed to the -C-Nmotifs in the g-C 3 N 4 framework 18.The CNDs in solution, which was synthesized by the NaOH-assisted ultrasonic treatment of glucose, possessed a high negative charge (-40.4 mV) (Fig. S4 in the ESM).This was attributed to the abundance of oxygenated functional groups on the surfaces of CNDs.By considering the oppositely charged surfaces and - stacking interactions, we surmise that the CND/pCN catalysts were constructed through electrostatic selfassembly between the negatively charged CNDs and the positively charged pCN nanosheets.A series of CND/pCN samples were synthesized with different proportions of CNDs (0.5 wt., 1 wt., 3 wt.,and 5 wt.).The CND contents were confirmed by TGA analysis (Fig. S5 in the ESM). The surface morphologies of pCN, CNDs, and CND/ pCN-3 were investigated using TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 2).As shown in Fig. 2(a), delaminated pCN had 2D laminar and loose mesh morphologies with many in-plane pores several nanometers in diameter.Additionally, chiffon-like curled wrinkles were found at the edges of pCN nanosheets.These were formed because of decreases in the surface energy, due to the successful delamination of bulk g-C 3 N 4 into sheet- Nano Res.like structures.Additionally, the delaminated pCN suspension showed the Tyndall effect (inset of Fig. 2(a)), demonstrating the colloidal nature of highly dispersed pCN in water.The thinness of the pCN nanosheets reduces the distance for charge migration, and thus retards charge recombination.Their relatively large surface areas, of hundreds of nanometers in length, are favorable for the deposition of various compounds of different sizes and form effective heterointerfaces for charge transfer.Further evidence is provided in our previous studies, in which we hybridized conjugated g-C 3 N 4 with other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as 2D graphene, in pursuit of a highly efficient interfacial charge transfer process 18,44. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the CNDs were dispersed in a uniform manner, without significant agglomeration of the nanoparticles.The HRTEM image of the CNDs shows their amorphous outer surfaces and crystalline interiors.After a year of storage, the CND solution remained homogenous, light-brown, with no precipi-tation (Fig. 2(b1)).This indicates that the CNDs were efficiently dispersed in H 2 O, as a result of oxygen functional groups on their surfaces.This will be discussed further in the discussion of FTIR spectra.The presence of the Tyndall effect provided further evidence for the efficient dispersal of the CNDs.The Tyndall effect was observed when red laser light was passed through the CND solution (Fig. 2(b2)).Upon coupling with pCN, CNDs with an average diameter of 4.4 nm were uniformly deposited on the edges and surfaces of pCN nanosheets.This resulted in the formation of nanoislands with intact bonding, as shown in TEM and HRTEM images (Figs.2(c) and 2(d)).The HRTEM image (Fig. 2(d)) clearly shows lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (100) plane of graphitic carbon 54,55.These fringes confirm the successful development of interfacial contact between pCN and CNDs via electrostatic attraction, which is of fundamental importance for the migration of electrons in photocatalysis.56.This demonstrates that pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN possess comparable crystal structures, despite dissimilar surface charges.Meanwhile, CNDs showed a broad diffraction peak centered at ca. 23, which originated from a highly disordered graphitic carbon phase 57,58.The XRD spectra of all the CND/pCN samples showed patterns to those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.This indicates that the structural integrity of pCN remained intact when loaded with CNDs, allowing the modulation of its optical properties.No distinct characteristic CND peak was present in the spectra of any of the CND/pCN nanohybrids, owing to the comparatively low diffraction intensity and the fine dispersion of CNDs over the pCN substrates.This was in good agreement with other recent studies of CND/TiO 2 59 and CND/BiOBr 60. The chemical structure of the CND/pCN hybrid nanocomposites was determined by FTIR, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN (Fig. 3(a)).The FTIR spectrum of CNDs (Fig. 3(a1)) indicated the presence of various oxygen-containing functional groups: C-O (ca.1,000-1,400 cm -1 ), C-O-C (ca.1,200 cm -1 ), -COOH (ca.1,358 cm -1 ), and CO (ca.1,705 cm -1 ) 57,61,62.These groups were introduced at the basal planes and edges of the CNDs.By taking advantage of these abundant hydrophilic groups, the dispersibility and stability of CNDs in the water was enhanced, as previously discussed (Fig. 2(b1)).In addition to oxygen-containing groups, the stretching vibration of C-H bonds was evidenced by the absorption band at 2,915 cm -1 63.The absorption peak at ca. 1,610 cm -1 was assigned to CC vibration 61.No significant variations in these characteristic peaks were detected in any of the CND/pCN samples, in comparison to the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN samples (Figs.3(a2)-3(a7)).This suggests that there were no substantial changes to the basic framework of pCN when it was hybridized with CNDs.The broad absorption peak from 3,000-3,800 cm -1 was attributed to the vibrational modes of N-H and O-H groups 64.The presence of these functional groups is accounted for by the presence of adsorbed hydroxyl species and free amino groups in the samples.Additionally, the presence of aromatic C-N and CN heterocycles was confirmed by a number of strong absorption peaks from 1,200 to 1,700 cm -1 , located at 1,630, 1,565, 1,415, 1,330, and 1,250 cm -1 , assigned to their skeletal stretching modes 36,65.Furthermore, the breathing mode of tri-striazine was clearly visible at ca. 812 cm -1 in all g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and CND/pCN sample spectra 42.After the hybridization of pCN with CNDs, a slight shift toward a lower wavenumber was observed in the characteristic peaks of the CND/pCN samples, from 1,255 to 1,250 cm -1 and 812 to 806 cm -1 .This indicates that interactions between the \"nitrogen pots\" of pCN and CNDs were initiated by electrostatic attraction 66.These interactions weakened the C-N bonds, Nano Res.increasing their length, which was commensurate with the TEM results (Fig. 2).There were no additional bands evident in the FTIR spectra due to impurities in the CND/pCN nanocomposites.This was in agreement with the XRD results (Fig. S6 in the ESM), verifying that no impurities were added during the fabrication of CND/pCN. The degree of graphitization in CNDs was further evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3(b)).The Raman spectrum of the CNDs (Fig. 3(b1)) exhibited two characteristic bands, the D-band (ca.1,360 cm -1 ) and the G-band (ca.1,590 cm -1 ).These bands confirm the successful synthesis of CNDs from glucose.The intensity ratio of the D-band to the G-band, I D /I G , is used to characterize the disorder level in graphitic carbon.The I D /I G ratio of the CNDs synthesized in this study was calculated to be 0.62.These results indicated that the CNDs had a partially amorphous external surface along with crystallized, sp 2 , core characteristics, which was in agreement with the HRTEM image (Fig. 2(b)).In addition, no significant differences in the Raman peaks were evident between any of the CND/pCN samples.This demonstrates that the conjugation of pCN with CNDs had little effect on the chemical skeleton of pCN.The characteristic stretching vibrations of C-N at 461, 585, 710, 750, 975, 1,111, 1,150, 1,235, 1,462, and 1,625 cm -1 were concordant with the FTIR results (Fig. 3(a)), and matched closely with those reported in Refs.42,64,67. To gain insights into the elemental bonding configurations and chemical composition of the CND/ pCN-3 sample relative to pCN, XPS analysis was conducted (Fig. 4).As depicted in Fig. 4 Nano Res.incomplete condensation processes), and positively charged g-C 3 N 4 heterocycles (due to the protonation of HCl), respectively 18,66.The slight shifts in the deconvoluted peaks of the C 1s and N 1 s spectra strongly suggest that coupling interactions exist between CNDs and pCN in the hybrid nanostructures.Additionally, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of CND/pCN-3 can be divided into two dominant peaks, at 531.4 and 533.1 eV (Fig. 4(d)).These originate from the CO and HO-CO groups, respectively 63, signifying the deposition of CNDs onto the pCN substrate.In the pCN sample spectrum, the O 1s peak at 532.1 eV was assigned to the adsorbed CO 2 or H 2 O 18.Overall, the HRTEM, FTIR and XPS results imply that the electrostatic attraction of surface charges and - stacking interactions play pivotal roles in the self-assembly of CND/pCN nanohybrids, giving rise to an effective interfacial contact heterointerface. Figure 5 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples, obtained to investigate their optical properties.Pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN showed an absorption edge at around 440 nm with band gap energies of 2.8 eV, as determined in our previous work 18,43.Then the CNDs were incorporated, there was no significant shift in the onset of the absorption edge relative to that of pure pCN.This implies that the CNDs anchored to the pCN surface act as a conducting electron channel.Similar results have been reported in other studies of CND-based photocatalytic systems 69.The intrinsic charge generation of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction arises from the injection of The electronic band structures of the pCN and CND/pCN photocatalysts were determined by EPR analysis at ambient temperature (Fig. 6).Unlike the urea precursor, pure g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and all the CND/ pCN samples displayed a single Lorentzian line at ca. 3,508 G with a g value of ca.2.0045.This line confirms the presence of unpaired electrons on the carbon atoms of the -conjugated aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 56.The Lorentzian line of pCN was slightly enhanced, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 , after the introduction of protons into the g-C 3 N 4 framework (Fig. 6(a)).This was attributed to improved electron mobility and increased delocalization of the system 70.In addition, the intensity of the EPR signal of the CND/pCN samples increased significantly with increasing CND loading (Fig. 6(b)).This phenomenon was due to extensive - coupling between pCN and CNDs in the CND/pCN systems 69.Consequently, spin mobility and charge delocalization were improved in the CND/ pCN samples, resulting in a greater density of charge carriers 71.This will be discussed further in the Mott-Schottky section.Optimization of the electronic properties of the CND/pCN heterojunction interface, to accelerate charge transportation and separation, will be beneficial to the photocatalytic solar energy conversion process. Measurements of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O vapor were conducted under visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light Nano Res.illumination for a total reaction duration of 10 h (Fig. 7).For all the photocatalysts studied under visible light irradiation, there were two major products produced by the CO 2 reduction, namely CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a of CH 4 and CO, despite the incorporation of protons (H ) into the framework of g-C 3 N 4 .This clearly demonstrated that acidic protonation pretreatment to modify the surface charge of g-C 3 N 4 did not adversely affect the active sites, and thus its CO 2 reduction activity. The hybridization of CNDs had a significant effect on the photoactivity of CND/pCN toward CO 2 reduction.As the CND content increased from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt., a gradual rise in photocatalytic activity for the production of CH 4 and CO was observed (Figs.7(a Moreover, the total amounts of CH 4 and CO produced with CND/pCN-3 were 3.6-and 2.28-times greater than produced using pure pCN (Figs.7(a) and 7(b)).For both pCN and the CND/pCN samples, the total evolution of CO under visible light was greater than that of CH 4 by a factor of 2 to 3.2.Similar observations have also been reported by Wang et al. 66,72.This was attributed to the number of electrons and protons participating in the photoreaction, which kinetically determines the formation of the CO and CH 4 products 73.As shown in Eqs. ( 2) and ( 3), 2e -/2H and 8e -/8H are needed to produce CO and CH 4 , respectively.It is reasonable to infer that a larger quantity of CO was yielded than of CH 4 because fewer electrons and protons take part in the CO 2 reduction reaction that forms CO.Thus, we can conclude that the generation of CO or CH 4 is directly related to the number of free charge carriers present in the chemical reaction. (2) The significantly increased visible-light photoactivity of CND/pCN-3 heterojunction nanocomposites was attributed to the successful retardation of the electronhole recombination rate, in comparison to bare pCN.The AQE of CND/pCN-3 was calculated to be 0.076, using Eq. ( 4) and detailed in our previous reports 8,18,65.It is widely known that CNDs are superior electron-reservoir co-catalysts because of their beneficial electrical properties 47,747576.These properties are akin to other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes 16,22,77,78. In this study, when the concentration of CNDs CND/pCN was greater than 3 wt., the photocatalytic evolution of CO and CH 4 deteriorated markedly.This was evidenced in the CND/pCN-4 sample, despite its greater optical absorption (Fig. 5) relative to CND/pCN samples with a lower proportion of CNDs.This was because excessive CNDs on the pCN surface caused a reduction in the visible-light absorption of pCN, thus inhibiting the generation of charge carriers.This significantly reduced the quantity of photoinduced electrons transported from pCN to the CNDs.In addition, excessive CNDs deposited on the pCN surface hindered the formation of an efficient heterojunction interface between 0D CNDs and 2D pCN nanosheets, reducing electron transfer from pCN to the CNDs.Similar results have been observed by other research groups 49,52,60.These suggest that determining the optimum concentration of CNDs is vital for the formation of a synergistic heterojunction interface with pCN, and thus favorable photocatalytic performance.The detailed charge carrier dynamics of CND/pCN will be discussed in the later PEC, PL, and DFT sections, and compared with the photocatalytic results. The photoactivities of CNDs and the mechanically combined CND/pCN-3M sample were determined (Figs.7(a that the photocatalytic performance of CNDs was very low for the evolution of both CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)).This indicated that CNDs serve as effective co-catalysts for the CO 2 reduction reaction, rather than functioning as semiconductor photocatalysts themselves.Our results are in accordance with recent reports 69,79, which indicate that pure CNDs demonstrate no photocatalytic activity toward H 2 evolution or CO 2 fixation.Additionally, to emphasize the role of the hybrid heterojunction between CNDs and pCN, the visible-light catalytic activity of CND/ pCN-3M was determined for the evolution of CH 4 (Fig. S9 in the ESM).The experimental results showed that CND/pCN-3M (10.03 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ) had slightly higher activity than pCN (8.05 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), but its photoactivity was markedly lower than CND/pCN-3 (29.23 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), despite containing the same proportion of CNDs.This low activity was a result of the loosely connected heterojunctions in CND/ pCN-3M.This result demonstrates the importance of well-constructed heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs in the hybridized systems. In addition to measurement of the visible-light activities, the performance of the catalysts was measured when activated by simulated solar light.The simulated solar light was generated with a xenon lamp covered by an AM1.5 filter.An AM1.5 filter is the most reliable method to mimic natural sunlight, and hence to determine the feasibility of using the photocatalysts in CO 2 reduction processes under natural light 26.As illustrated in Figs.7(a) and 7(b), the proportion of CNDs is vital in determining the efficiency of the catalytic reactions.A similar trend of catalytic results to those obtained under visible light irradiation was obtained under simulated solar light.The optimum loading of CND was found to be 3 wt.,as in the CND/pCN-3 sample.In the CND/ pCN-3 experiment, 37.06 molg catalyst -1 of CH 4 and 68.80 molg catalyst -1 of CO were produced.These were 2.83-and 2.02-fold increases, respectively, over pure pCN.For all the catalysts tested, the total yields of each product were greater under simulated solar light than under visible light.This was because simulated sunlight contains a small fraction (4) of UV light, which has higher photon energies than visible light.These high-energy photons generate more free charge carriers to take part in the photochemical reactions, which increases the product yields.In summary, the highest CH 4 and CO productions were obtained using CND/pCN-3 (3 wt. of CNDs), under both visible light and simulated solar light illumination after 10 h of reaction. Recyclability, photostability and durability of photocatalysts are important factors in their prolonged utilization in large-scale applications.The time dependence of the rate of CH 4 production, using CND/pCN-3 as a representative photocatalyst, was measured over four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(a) and 8(b)).After four cycles (40 h) of CO 2 photoreduction experiments, the CND/pCN-3 sample retained its catalytic activity for CH 4 evolution.Additionally, there were no noticeable deviations in the chemical structure and phase composition of the CND/pCN-3 after four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(c) and 8(d)).These results demonstrate the excellent stability of the CND/pCN-3 catalyst. PEC analysis was performed to determine the significance of interfacial interactions, and charge transfer behavior, between pCN and CNDs, on the photoactivity of the CND/pCN hybrid systems.The charge transfer efficiencies of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, and CND/pCN samples were determined by photochronoamperometry measurements.Figure 9(a) shows the photocurrent-time curves for the samples studied, with several on-off cycles of visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Reproducible and uniform photocurrent responses were obtained for all the working electrodes after six irradiation cycles, indicating that the photocurrent response for each electrode was stable and reversible.For pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, a low photocurrent density was measured due to the rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs.The photocurrent density steadily increased with increasing CND content (from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt.).However, when the CND content exceeded 3 wt.(in the CND/pCN-4 sample) a slight decrease in the photocurrent density was observed.This was attributed to reduced visible-light activation of pCN as a result of increased CND coverage of the pCN surface.However, the CND/ pCN-4 sample still exhibited a higher photocurrent response than those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample demonstrated the highest Nano Res.photocurrent density of all the samples.We concluded that the recombination of charge carriers between pCN and the CND content was inhibited optimally, and thus the separation efficiency of charge carriers at the 0D/2D heterojunction interface was also optimized.The photocurrent in CND/pCN-3 sample showed a four-fold increase compared to the pure pCN sample.The inhibition of charge recombination implies that the 0D/2D heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs are well-formed, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity of CND/pCN-3. Furthermore, EIS analysis was conducted to provide further data on the charge transfer and separation processes, and to study the electrical conductivity of the photocatalysts 68.The charge transfer resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interface can, in general, be represented by the arc radius of the Nyquist impedance plots 17.Consistent with our transient photocurrent responses (Fig. 9(a)) and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results (Fig. 7), the lowest electron transfer resistance upon visible light irradiation was measured in the CND/pCN-3 sample; evidenced by it having the smallest arc radius in the EIS Nyquist diagram (Fig. S10 in the ESM).This demonstrates that the incorporation of an optimized proportion of CND significantly increases the electrical conductivity of pCN.Hence, this promotes effective interfacial electron transfer at the hetero-nanostructural interface of the CND/pCN-3 sample, by utilizing CNDs as electron storage co-catalysts to improve solar energy conversion. To determine the charge carrier density and band structures of the CND/pCN sample and improve our understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism, electrochemical Mott-Schottky analysis was conducted at frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz.As shown in Fig. 9(b), both the pCN and CND/pCN-3 samples produced positive slopes, thus demonstrating n-type semiconductor features despite the CND/pCN-3 sample being conjugated with CNDs.A descending gradient was present in the CND/pCN-3 Mott-Schottky plot, in contrast to the plot for pCN.This signifies a higher donor density in the CND/pCN-3 nanohybrids, which results from the improved -conjugation system of CNDs with pCN (as demonstrated by the EPR results in Fig. 6).For n-type semiconductors, the Mott-Schottky equation can be written as Eq.

The value of E fb is determined by the x-intercept of the linear section of the Mott-Schottky curve.In this instance, the E fb of CND/pCN-3 showed a positive shift toward a smaller E fb value, in comparison with that of pCN.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were measured to be -1.1 and -1.4 V, respectively, vs. Ag/AgCl.The normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential was estimated from the potential relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode according to Eq. ( 6) 81 fb (vs.NHE) fb (pH0, vs. Ag/AgCl) AgCl where the pH of the electrolyte is ca.6.8 and E AgCl is 0.197 V.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were -0.50 and -0.80 V, respectively, vs. NHE.As an approximation, the CB minimum (CBM) of a typical n-type semiconductor is 0.3 V more negative than E fb 82, thus the CBM values of pCN and CND/pCN-3 are -1.1 and -0.8 V, respectively, vs. NHE.Based on the slopes of the Mott-Schottky plots, the density of charge carrier, N D can also be calculated from Eq. ( 7) 82 Using Eq. ( 7), the N D of CND/pCN-3 (1.37 10 22 cm -3 ) was found to be significantly greater than that of pCN (9.37 10 21 cm -3 ).The higher carrier density in the CND/pCN-3 sample was indicative of the greater spatial separation of electrons and holes in the presence of CNDs.This increased separation lowers the charge recombination rate, and increases the photocatalytic efficiency.This phenomenon gives rise to improved charge mobility and electrical conductivity and increases the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.This agrees well with the results of our photocurrent response tests (Fig. 9(a)) and EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. S10 in the ESM).Steady state PL spectroscopy is a powerful analysis tool for determining the nature of the radiative recombination process and charge kinetics of a photocatalyst (Fig. 10(a)) 42.For pCN, an intense, broad, PL emission peak was observed, indicating rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs, through band-band transitions.All of the CND/pCN hybrid photocatalysts showed significantly reduced PL intensities, relative to pCN.This was due to effective interfacial charge separation in the CND/pCN nanohybrids arising from well-formed 0D/2D heterojunction interfaces, which suppressed the charge recombination.Furthermore, the PL signal of CND/pCN-3 was the lowest in intensity, indicating the slowest charge recombination and that the CND concentration in the Nano Res.sample was optimal. TRPL was employed to acquire detailed insights into the lifetime of charge carrier dynamics (Fig. 10(b)).The fluorescence decay curves were fitted using the tri-exponential function: I(t) A 1 exp (-t/ 1 ) A 2 exp (-t/ 2 ) A 3 exp (-t/ 3 ), where A and denote the amplitudes and emission lifetimes of each component.The detailed kinetic parameters for all the photocatalyst used in this study are listed in Table 1.The average lifetime, ave , was calculated using Eq. ( 8), and describes the resultant TRPL features of each sample 83.As summarized in Table 1, when a small proportion (0.5 wt.) of CNDs was introduced onto the pCN surface, the emission lifetime was reduced from 6.72 ns (pCN) to 5.87 ns (CND/pCN-1).Incorporating an optimal concentration of CNDs (3 wt.) reduced the decay lifetime to 3.87 ns (CND/pCN-3); almost 1.7 times shorter than that of pure pCN.The significantly decreased emission lifetime of the CND/pCN-3 sample indicated that the interfacial electron injection from pCN to CNDs was rapid, due to the existence of non-radiative quenching routes.However, proportions CNDs greater that 3 wt.were detrimental to the photoactivity, as indicated by the longer decay lifetime (4.76 ns) of CND/pCN-4, because of the higher recombination rate of the charge carriers.Our TRPL results are in good agreement with the steady state PL analysis (Fig. 10(a)) and the photocatalytic results (Fig. 7). The dynamic charge carrier process was further evaluated by the determination of the electron transfer rate constant (k ET ) and the efficiency of electron transfer ( ET ), as expressed in Eqs. ( 9) and ( 10) 84.We found that the CND/pCN-3 sample had the largest k ET (1.10 10 8 s -1 ) and ET (42.4) of all the photocatalyst samples.This finding provides further evidence for the efficient transportation of photoexcited electrons from pCN to CNDs via an effective heterointerface between pCN and CNDs.This plays a pivotal role in increasing the probability of electrons participating in the photochemical reduction of CO 2 before electronhole recombination occurs.The PEC, steady state PL and TRPL results, all indicate that the CND/pCN-3 ave ET ave To This suggests that the photoexcitation of electrons was possible when the photon energy was sufficient to overcome the band gap between the HOMO and the LUMO.Using this information, we propose that the excitation process in a partially ionized system occurs as follows.Firstly, electrons in the pCN were photoexcited and moved into the LUMO, correspondingly, the generation of holes took place in the HOMO of pCN.The energy level of the HOMO in pCN was lower than that of the CND HOMO, so, in the second stage, the migration of the HOMO electron from the CND to the pCN occurred before combining with a hole (Fig. 11(c)).When this occurred, the net charge was shared across the carbon lattice, rather than being localized on the CND.Consequently, the net positive and negative charges induced an internal electric field, directed from pCN to CND.Furthermore, the internal electric field at the interface produced a force on the holes and electrons, in the opposite direction to the diffusion force.At thermal equilibrium, both the electric field force and the diffusion force are balanced.This was verified by density of state (DOS) and work function analyses, as discussed below. The total density of state (TDOS) and the partial density of state (PDOS) were calculated for the CND/ pCN heterojunction (Fig. 12).As shown in Fig. 12(a), the lower VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies ranging from -1 to -0.37 eV.The PDOS calculations of CND and pCN exhibited a similar shape, signifying successful bonding of pCN with CND.The upper VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies in the range of -0.37 to 0 eV.The CND bands made the greatest contribution to the VB maximum (VBM).Conversely, pCN mainly contributed to the sub-sharp closing of the VBM.The VBs of pCN were primarily composed of N 2p, N 2s, and C 2p orbitals, whereas the CBs of pCN were dominated by C 2p and N 2p orbitals (Fig. 12(b)).This agreed well with our previous work 18.Additionally, the DOS of CND consisted of discrete energy levels, which corresponded with the lack of symmetry in the CND structure (Fig. 12(c)).The C 2p and O 2p orbitals made the greatest contribution to the DOS, except in the energy range from 1.5 to 2 eV.From 1.5 to 2 eV, the DOS originated from C 2p and H 1s orbitals.On the basis of this analysis, we concluded that the CND/pCN heterojunction is a typical band alignment structure. The work function, , of a material is an important property, commonly employed as an intrinsic reference for band alignment.It can be defined as follows (Eq.( 11)) 85 E vac -E f (11) where E vac is the vacuum energy of a stationary electron near the surface of the material and E f denotes the ground state electronic structure calculation.The calculated electrostatic potentials for monolayer pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunctions are shown in 11(b).In addition, our first-principles DFT results were consistent with the photocatalytic and PEC experimental measurements. On the basis of the experimental and first-principles DFT computational results, a plausible photocatalytic mechanism of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO under visible light or simulated solar light was proposed (Fig. 14).When the CND/pCN photocatalyst was irradiated by visible light, holes and free electrons were generated in pCN.The electrons were photoexcited from the VB to the CB of pCN, thus leaving holes in the VB of pCN.As a result of the high electron storage capability and electronic conductivity of CNDs, the photoinduced electrons could be easily injected into the CNDs.The photogenerated holes can react with H 2 O to produce protons (H ).It is well established that delocalized -conjugated II 3 bonding is exhibited by CO 2 molecules, leading to the adsorption of CO 2 onto the surface of CNDs, through - conjugation 18.This adsorption causes the destabilization and activation of CO 2 .Thus, the electrons accumulated on the CND surface can successfully reduce CO 2 to CO (E (CO 2 /CO) -0.53V vs. NHE) and CH 4 (E (CO 2 / CH 4 ) -0.24V vs. NHE) via a two electron/two proton pathway and an eight electron/eight proton pathway, respectively 35.The photocatalytic mechanism with simulated solar light illumination is identical; the spatially separated photoinduced electrons and holes enhanced the reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H , to form CH"}, {"llm generation": "g-C 3 N 4 -based semiconductor photocatalysts", "source": "Overall, the use of metal-free CNDs as effective co-catalysts provides a crucial foundation for interface engineering of g-C 3 N 4 -based semiconductor photocatalysts for diverse applications.", "context": "In summary, we have designed a metal-free 0D/2D CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalyst, for Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the synthesis of 0D/2D CND/pCN samples by means of electrostatic attraction.

Figures S6 and S7 (in the ESM) show the XRD patterns of pure g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, CNDs, and CND/pCN samples.Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the pCN sample maintained two characteristic peaks, situated at ca. 13.2 (d 0.670 nm) and 27.3 (d 0.326 nm) (JCPDS Card No. 87-1526)56.This demonstrates that pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN possess comparable crystal structures, despite dissimilar surface charges.Meanwhile, CNDs showed a broad diffraction peak centered at ca. 23, which originated from a highly disordered graphitic carbon phase57,58.The XRD spectra of all the CND/pCN samples showed patterns to those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.This indicates that the structural integrity of pCN remained intact when loaded with CNDs, allowing the modulation of its optical properties.No distinct characteristic CND peak was present in the spectra of any of the CND/pCN nanohybrids, owing to the comparatively low diffraction intensity and the fine dispersion of CNDs over the pCN substrates.This was in good agreement with other recent studies of CND/TiO 259 and CND/BiOBr60.The chemical structure of the CND/pCN hybrid nanocomposites was determined by FTIR, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN (Fig.3(a)).The FTIR spectrum of CNDs (Fig.3(a1)) indicated the presence of various oxygen-containing functional groups: C-O (ca.1,000-1,400 cm -1 ), C-O-C (ca.1,200 cm -1 ), -COOH (ca.1,358 cm -1 ), and CO (ca.1,705 cm -1 ) 57, 61, 62.These groups were introduced at the basal planes and edges of the CNDs.By taking advantage of these abundant hydrophilic groups, the dispersibility Figure 3 (a) FTIR and (b) Raman spectra of (1) CNDs, (2) pure g-C 3 N 4 , (3) pCN, (4) CND/pCN-1, (5) CND/pCN-2, (6) CND/pCN-3, and (7) CND/pCN-4 samples.

From Eq.(11), the work functions of pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunction were calculated to be 4.66, 5.56, and 5.29 eV, respectively.The difference in work functions between pCN and CND confirmed that the photoinduced electrons were shuttled from pCN to CND when pCN came into contact with CND.The work function of CND (5.56 eV) was higher than that of pCN (4.66 eV), which accounted for the transfer of electrons from pCN to CND until the Fermi energies of the two phases were aligned.As a result, the work function of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction (5.29 eV) was calculated to lie between the work functions of CND and pCN.Hence, the CND accumulated negative charges (electrons), whereas the pCN layer accumulated positive charges (holes).This allowed efficient electron migration and separation across the heterointerface of CND/pCN nanohybrids, which inhibited the electron-hole recombination.This increased the efficiency of the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 via 2-electron and 8-electron processes, respectively.Overall, the electrostatic potential results were in good agreement with the frontier electron orbital analyses presented in Figs.11(a) and Nano Res. 4 and CO.The detailed reaction equations are given in Eqs.(12)-(15) CND/pCN h CND (e -) pCN (h ) -) CO 2 2H CND CO H 2 O (14) CND (8e -) CO 2 8H CND CH 4 2H 2 O (15) Figure 14 Charge transfer and separation in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 using CND/pCN samples under visible-light or simulated solar irradiation.

Nano Res. the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO in the presence of H 2 O vapor.The photocatalyst was synthesized via the electrostatically driven assembly of negatively charged CNDs and positively charged pCN.Our investigations revealed that the integration of pCN with highly conductive CNDs significantly influenced the photocatalytic performance, compared to that of pure pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample (3 wt. of CNDs) gave the highest total evolutions of CH 4 (29.23 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (58.82 molg catalyst -1 ) under visible light irradiation after 10 h of reaction.These amounts were ca.3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than those generated with pCN.Similarly, the maximum total productions of CH 4 (37.06 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (68.80 molg catalyst -1 ), under simulated solar light irradiation for 10 h, were also achieved by CND/pCN-3.Of all the samples tested, the CND/pCN-3 had the lowest PL decay lifetime (3.87 ns) and the highest electron transfer rate constant (1.10 10 8 s -1 ), which agreed well with our photocatalytic results.The significantly increased photoactivity of CND/pCN-3, relative to pure pCN, was attributed to (1) improved electrical conductivity, (2) rapid interfacial electron transfer from pCN to CNDs via a well-formed heterointerface, and (3) a reduction in the electron-hole recombination rate.This was determined through a combination of experimental results (e.g., transient photocurrent responses, EIS Nyquist diagrams, Mott-Schottky plots, steady state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy) and DFT computational calculations.Based on the DFT results, we determined that the photogenerated electrons promptly migrated from pCN to a CND, which functioned as an electron reservoir, as shown by the comparatively smaller work function of pCN (4.66 eV) than of CNDs (5.56 eV).Overall, the use of metal-free CNDs as effective co-catalysts provides a crucial foundation for interface engineering of g-C 3 N 4 -based semiconductor photocatalysts for diverse applications.We anticipate that this study opens up an interesting area of research in materials science, and demonstrates a new paradigm for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and environmental improvement.

Firstly, 1 g of pCN was dispersed in 90 mL of deionized water.Ultrasonication was then applied to the suspension for 30 min.Next, a measured mass of the solid CND sample was dispersed in 10 mL of deionized water and sonicated for 15 min, before being added to the pCN suspension.The resulting mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 30 min to produce a uniform suspension.The mixture was then subjected to hydrothermal treatment in a Teflon-sealed autoclave with stirring at 120 C for 4 h.Once cooled to room temperature, the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm.The solid sample was collected and washed several times with deionized water, then dried at 70 C for 12 h.Using this synthesis route, a series of CND/pCN samples were successfully fabricated with various mass loadings of CNDs (0.5 wt., 1 wt., 3 wt.,and 5 wt.).These samples were labeled as CND/pCN-1, CND/pCN-2, CND/pCN-3, and CND/ pCN-4, respectively.For comparison, a mechanically combined pCN and CND sample, having the same CND content as the CND/pCN-3 sample, was produced by mixing the pCN and CNDs in an agate mortar for 10 min.This sample was designated as CND/pCN-3M. Measurements of zeta potentials were conducted using a particle analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS; Malvern Instruments).Specifically, a 25 mg sample was dispersed in 25 mL of deionized water and sonicated at room temperature for 15 min to improve dispersion.The surface morphologies and lattice spacing of the composites were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Phillips CM200 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV).The sample was suspended in ethanol, and a drop of the suspension was placed onto a lacey-film-coated copper grid.Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of bulk g-C 3 N 4 were obtained with a Hitachi SU8010.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using a TA Instruments Q50, with a heating rate of 10 Cmin -1 from room temperature to 800 C under N 2 flow.Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Bruker D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu-K radiation ( 0.154056 nm) at a scan rate of 0.02 s -1 .The accelerating voltage used was 40 kV, and the applied current was 40 mA.Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were acquired by a Thermo-Nicolet iS10, using a standard KBr pellet technique.Each spectrum was generated with a resolution of 4 cm -1 from the average of 32 scans between 4,000 and 600 cm -1 .An Agilent Cary 100 ultraviolet-visible light (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer was used to measure the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples from 200 to 800 nm.The absorbance was measured relative to BaSO 4 as the blank sample.Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer LS55 spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 300 nm, a scanning speed of 500 nmmin -1 , and excitation and emission slit widths of 10 nm.X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were measured in a vacuum chamber (2 10 -9 mbar) by a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using a monochromated Al-K source at 13 kV and 150 W. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was conducted at ambient temperature on a Bruker EMX-plus X-Band EPR spectrometer.The EPR spectrum was measured at 9.842 GHz with a microwave power of 0.6325 mW and a modulation amplitude of 1 G. Raman spectra were obtained using a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer at ambient temperature using UV laser excitation (325 nm).To identify the fluorescence lifetimes of each sample, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded using a timecorrelated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) system (Picoquant Microtime-200) with a laser excitation wavelength of 405 nm.Nano Res. To examine the photocatalytic performance of the catalysts, the photoreduction of CO 2 was performed as described in our previous reports.The reaction was performed in a custom-built continuous gasphase photoreactor at ambient temperature (25 5 C) and atmospheric pressure (1 atm) 8,18,26,43,44.Three quartz column reactors were linked in series, and then placed in a black box to prevent interference from ambient light.The photocatalytic reactions were initiated using a xenon arc lamp (CHF-XM500W) equipped with various filters (including a UV cut-off filter ( 400 nm) and an air mass (AM1.5)filter).The UV cut-off filter was attached to remove UV light and ensure the photocatalysts were activated only by visible light.The mean light intensity of the visible light was determined by an Avantes fiber optic spectrometer (AvaSpec-128) coupled to a cosine corrector.The photocatalyst samples (50 mg) were coated onto glass rods using double-sided tape which were then fixed into quartz tubes.High-purity CO 2 (99.99) was bubbled through water before reaching the reactor, forming a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor in the reactor.The photoreactor was continuously purged for half-an-hour with wet CO 2 , to ensure that the air in the reactor was totally removed and that complete adsorption of gas molecules was achieved.The reactions were then initiated by the xenon light source and the flow rate of CO 2 was held constant at 5 mLmin -1 using a mass flow controller (Brooks 0254 Series).During the photoreactions, the gaseous products were collected downstream, hourly, for a total reaction duration of 10 h and their compositions were analyzed using an inline gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Measuring the gas compositions allowed the measurement of the rates of CH 4 and CO production.The photocatalytic experiments were repeated using an AM1.5 filter attached to the xenon lamp to simulate solar light.The spectra of the visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light are shown in Figs.S1 andS2 in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM).The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at least twice under identical reaction conditions, to ascertain the reproducibility of the results.In all cases, results were consistent; with errors of less than 5.The rate of evolution of CH 4 or CO over 10 h of a lightactivated reaction is shown in Eq. ( 1 C initial and C final denote the initial and final concentrations of CO or CH 4 in the product gas, respectively, V represents the volumetric flow rate of the gaseous products, and m is the mass of photocatalyst used. Photoelectrochemical measurements of the photocatalysts were taken with an Autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT302N), using a standard three-electrode electrochemical workstation system.This system comprises a carbon fiber working electrode, with samples covering an active area of 2 cm 2 , a platinum foil as a counter electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode.For the preparation of the working electrodes, 20 mg of the photocatalyst to be studied was sonicated with 5 mL of ethanol for 5 min to improve the dispersal and homogeneity.The suspension was then drop-cast onto the active area (2 cm 2 ) of the carbon fiber electrode.The fiber was then heated at 150 C for 2 h in an oven, to increase the adhesion of the sample onto the carbon fiber.Meanwhile, a 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution was purged with N 2 for 30 min prior to the PEC measurements, and continuously purged with N 2 during the PEC analyses to eliminate any dissolved O 2 .A water jacket was positioned between the PEC cell system and the xenon arc lamp, to lessen the effects of heat on the Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution during irradiation.For the amperometric measurements, the working electrode was illuminated with a 300 W xenon arc lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter attached to remove UV radiation.The transient photocurrent response results were measured with the lamp on and off, under a constant applied bias of 0.5 V. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured over a frequency range of 10 -2 Nano Res. to 10 5 Hz at an applied potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl with an alternating current perturbation signal of 0.01 V under visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Mott-Schottky plots were acquired over a potential range from -1.7 to 0.6 V, with a potential step of 10 mV at the frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz. We employed a well-established DFT-based ab initio method; the plane-wave projector-augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP).For structural relaxation calculations, the potential with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form, as supplied in the CASTEP was used.For geometry optimization, all forces on the atoms were converged to less than 0.01 eV -1 , the maximum ionic displacement was within 0.001 A and the total stress tensor was reduced to 0.02 GPa.The electronic structures were calculated with a basis set, consisting of the atomic orbitals of C, O, N, and H atoms with a 3 3 1 k-mesh."}, {"llm generation": "natural light", "source": "An AM1.5 filter is the most reliable method to mimic natural sunlight, and hence to determine the feasibility of using the photocatalysts in CO 2 reduction processes under natural light 26.", "context": "The 0D/2D CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalysts were successfully synthesized using a surface charge-facilitated electrostatic interaction approach (Fig. 1).Initially, bulk g-C 3 N 4 was obtained by using urea as the precursor, as in our previously reported procedure (Fig. S3 in the ESM) 43,44.The bulk g-C 3 N 4 was subsequently delaminated into 2D g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets via an ultrasonication-assisted process.This was followed by the protonation of g-C 3 N 4 by HCl to alter its surface change from negative (-15.3 mV) to positive (14.0 mV), as confirmed by zeta potential analysis (Fig. S4 in the ESM).The negatively charged surface of the pure g-C 3 N 4 was ascribed to the -C-Nmotifs in the g-C 3 N 4 framework 18.The CNDs in solution, which was synthesized by the NaOH-assisted ultrasonic treatment of glucose, possessed a high negative charge (-40.4 mV) (Fig. S4 in the ESM).This was attributed to the abundance of oxygenated functional groups on the surfaces of CNDs.By considering the oppositely charged surfaces and - stacking interactions, we surmise that the CND/pCN catalysts were constructed through electrostatic selfassembly between the negatively charged CNDs and the positively charged pCN nanosheets.A series of CND/pCN samples were synthesized with different proportions of CNDs (0.5 wt., 1 wt., 3 wt.,and 5 wt.).The CND contents were confirmed by TGA analysis (Fig. S5 in the ESM). The surface morphologies of pCN, CNDs, and CND/ pCN-3 were investigated using TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 2).As shown in Fig. 2(a), delaminated pCN had 2D laminar and loose mesh morphologies with many in-plane pores several nanometers in diameter.Additionally, chiffon-like curled wrinkles were found at the edges of pCN nanosheets.These were formed because of decreases in the surface energy, due to the successful delamination of bulk g-C 3 N 4 into sheet- Nano Res.like structures.Additionally, the delaminated pCN suspension showed the Tyndall effect (inset of Fig. 2(a)), demonstrating the colloidal nature of highly dispersed pCN in water.The thinness of the pCN nanosheets reduces the distance for charge migration, and thus retards charge recombination.Their relatively large surface areas, of hundreds of nanometers in length, are favorable for the deposition of various compounds of different sizes and form effective heterointerfaces for charge transfer.Further evidence is provided in our previous studies, in which we hybridized conjugated g-C 3 N 4 with other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as 2D graphene, in pursuit of a highly efficient interfacial charge transfer process 18,44. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the CNDs were dispersed in a uniform manner, without significant agglomeration of the nanoparticles.The HRTEM image of the CNDs shows their amorphous outer surfaces and crystalline interiors.After a year of storage, the CND solution remained homogenous, light-brown, with no precipi-tation (Fig. 2(b1)).This indicates that the CNDs were efficiently dispersed in H 2 O, as a result of oxygen functional groups on their surfaces.This will be discussed further in the discussion of FTIR spectra.The presence of the Tyndall effect provided further evidence for the efficient dispersal of the CNDs.The Tyndall effect was observed when red laser light was passed through the CND solution (Fig. 2(b2)).Upon coupling with pCN, CNDs with an average diameter of 4.4 nm were uniformly deposited on the edges and surfaces of pCN nanosheets.This resulted in the formation of nanoislands with intact bonding, as shown in TEM and HRTEM images (Figs.2(c) and 2(d)).The HRTEM image (Fig. 2(d)) clearly shows lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (100) plane of graphitic carbon 54,55.These fringes confirm the successful development of interfacial contact between pCN and CNDs via electrostatic attraction, which is of fundamental importance for the migration of electrons in photocatalysis.56.This demonstrates that pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN possess comparable crystal structures, despite dissimilar surface charges.Meanwhile, CNDs showed a broad diffraction peak centered at ca. 23, which originated from a highly disordered graphitic carbon phase 57,58.The XRD spectra of all the CND/pCN samples showed patterns to those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.This indicates that the structural integrity of pCN remained intact when loaded with CNDs, allowing the modulation of its optical properties.No distinct characteristic CND peak was present in the spectra of any of the CND/pCN nanohybrids, owing to the comparatively low diffraction intensity and the fine dispersion of CNDs over the pCN substrates.This was in good agreement with other recent studies of CND/TiO 2 59 and CND/BiOBr 60. The chemical structure of the CND/pCN hybrid nanocomposites was determined by FTIR, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN (Fig. 3(a)).The FTIR spectrum of CNDs (Fig. 3(a1)) indicated the presence of various oxygen-containing functional groups: C-O (ca.1,000-1,400 cm -1 ), C-O-C (ca.1,200 cm -1 ), -COOH (ca.1,358 cm -1 ), and CO (ca.1,705 cm -1 ) 57,61,62.These groups were introduced at the basal planes and edges of the CNDs.By taking advantage of these abundant hydrophilic groups, the dispersibility and stability of CNDs in the water was enhanced, as previously discussed (Fig. 2(b1)).In addition to oxygen-containing groups, the stretching vibration of C-H bonds was evidenced by the absorption band at 2,915 cm -1 63.The absorption peak at ca. 1,610 cm -1 was assigned to CC vibration 61.No significant variations in these characteristic peaks were detected in any of the CND/pCN samples, in comparison to the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN samples (Figs.3(a2)-3(a7)).This suggests that there were no substantial changes to the basic framework of pCN when it was hybridized with CNDs.The broad absorption peak from 3,000-3,800 cm -1 was attributed to the vibrational modes of N-H and O-H groups 64.The presence of these functional groups is accounted for by the presence of adsorbed hydroxyl species and free amino groups in the samples.Additionally, the presence of aromatic C-N and CN heterocycles was confirmed by a number of strong absorption peaks from 1,200 to 1,700 cm -1 , located at 1,630, 1,565, 1,415, 1,330, and 1,250 cm -1 , assigned to their skeletal stretching modes 36,65.Furthermore, the breathing mode of tri-striazine was clearly visible at ca. 812 cm -1 in all g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and CND/pCN sample spectra 42.After the hybridization of pCN with CNDs, a slight shift toward a lower wavenumber was observed in the characteristic peaks of the CND/pCN samples, from 1,255 to 1,250 cm -1 and 812 to 806 cm -1 .This indicates that interactions between the \"nitrogen pots\" of pCN and CNDs were initiated by electrostatic attraction 66.These interactions weakened the C-N bonds, Nano Res.increasing their length, which was commensurate with the TEM results (Fig. 2).There were no additional bands evident in the FTIR spectra due to impurities in the CND/pCN nanocomposites.This was in agreement with the XRD results (Fig. S6 in the ESM), verifying that no impurities were added during the fabrication of CND/pCN. The degree of graphitization in CNDs was further evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3(b)).The Raman spectrum of the CNDs (Fig. 3(b1)) exhibited two characteristic bands, the D-band (ca.1,360 cm -1 ) and the G-band (ca.1,590 cm -1 ).These bands confirm the successful synthesis of CNDs from glucose.The intensity ratio of the D-band to the G-band, I D /I G , is used to characterize the disorder level in graphitic carbon.The I D /I G ratio of the CNDs synthesized in this study was calculated to be 0.62.These results indicated that the CNDs had a partially amorphous external surface along with crystallized, sp 2 , core characteristics, which was in agreement with the HRTEM image (Fig. 2(b)).In addition, no significant differences in the Raman peaks were evident between any of the CND/pCN samples.This demonstrates that the conjugation of pCN with CNDs had little effect on the chemical skeleton of pCN.The characteristic stretching vibrations of C-N at 461, 585, 710, 750, 975, 1,111, 1,150, 1,235, 1,462, and 1,625 cm -1 were concordant with the FTIR results (Fig. 3(a)), and matched closely with those reported in Refs.42,64,67. To gain insights into the elemental bonding configurations and chemical composition of the CND/ pCN-3 sample relative to pCN, XPS analysis was conducted (Fig. 4).As depicted in Fig. 4 Nano Res.incomplete condensation processes), and positively charged g-C 3 N 4 heterocycles (due to the protonation of HCl), respectively 18,66.The slight shifts in the deconvoluted peaks of the C 1s and N 1 s spectra strongly suggest that coupling interactions exist between CNDs and pCN in the hybrid nanostructures.Additionally, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of CND/pCN-3 can be divided into two dominant peaks, at 531.4 and 533.1 eV (Fig. 4(d)).These originate from the CO and HO-CO groups, respectively 63, signifying the deposition of CNDs onto the pCN substrate.In the pCN sample spectrum, the O 1s peak at 532.1 eV was assigned to the adsorbed CO 2 or H 2 O 18.Overall, the HRTEM, FTIR and XPS results imply that the electrostatic attraction of surface charges and - stacking interactions play pivotal roles in the self-assembly of CND/pCN nanohybrids, giving rise to an effective interfacial contact heterointerface. Figure 5 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples, obtained to investigate their optical properties.Pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN showed an absorption edge at around 440 nm with band gap energies of 2.8 eV, as determined in our previous work 18,43.Then the CNDs were incorporated, there was no significant shift in the onset of the absorption edge relative to that of pure pCN.This implies that the CNDs anchored to the pCN surface act as a conducting electron channel.Similar results have been reported in other studies of CND-based photocatalytic systems 69.The intrinsic charge generation of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction arises from the injection of The electronic band structures of the pCN and CND/pCN photocatalysts were determined by EPR analysis at ambient temperature (Fig. 6).Unlike the urea precursor, pure g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and all the CND/ pCN samples displayed a single Lorentzian line at ca. 3,508 G with a g value of ca.2.0045.This line confirms the presence of unpaired electrons on the carbon atoms of the -conjugated aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 56.The Lorentzian line of pCN was slightly enhanced, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 , after the introduction of protons into the g-C 3 N 4 framework (Fig. 6(a)).This was attributed to improved electron mobility and increased delocalization of the system 70.In addition, the intensity of the EPR signal of the CND/pCN samples increased significantly with increasing CND loading (Fig. 6(b)).This phenomenon was due to extensive - coupling between pCN and CNDs in the CND/pCN systems 69.Consequently, spin mobility and charge delocalization were improved in the CND/ pCN samples, resulting in a greater density of charge carriers 71.This will be discussed further in the Mott-Schottky section.Optimization of the electronic properties of the CND/pCN heterojunction interface, to accelerate charge transportation and separation, will be beneficial to the photocatalytic solar energy conversion process. Measurements of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O vapor were conducted under visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light Nano Res.illumination for a total reaction duration of 10 h (Fig. 7).For all the photocatalysts studied under visible light irradiation, there were two major products produced by the CO 2 reduction, namely CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a of CH 4 and CO, despite the incorporation of protons (H ) into the framework of g-C 3 N 4 .This clearly demonstrated that acidic protonation pretreatment to modify the surface charge of g-C 3 N 4 did not adversely affect the active sites, and thus its CO 2 reduction activity. The hybridization of CNDs had a significant effect on the photoactivity of CND/pCN toward CO 2 reduction.As the CND content increased from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt., a gradual rise in photocatalytic activity for the production of CH 4 and CO was observed (Figs.7(a Moreover, the total amounts of CH 4 and CO produced with CND/pCN-3 were 3.6-and 2.28-times greater than produced using pure pCN (Figs.7(a) and 7(b)).For both pCN and the CND/pCN samples, the total evolution of CO under visible light was greater than that of CH 4 by a factor of 2 to 3.2.Similar observations have also been reported by Wang et al. 66,72.This was attributed to the number of electrons and protons participating in the photoreaction, which kinetically determines the formation of the CO and CH 4 products 73.As shown in Eqs. ( 2) and ( 3), 2e -/2H and 8e -/8H are needed to produce CO and CH 4 , respectively.It is reasonable to infer that a larger quantity of CO was yielded than of CH 4 because fewer electrons and protons take part in the CO 2 reduction reaction that forms CO.Thus, we can conclude that the generation of CO or CH 4 is directly related to the number of free charge carriers present in the chemical reaction. (2) The significantly increased visible-light photoactivity of CND/pCN-3 heterojunction nanocomposites was attributed to the successful retardation of the electronhole recombination rate, in comparison to bare pCN.The AQE of CND/pCN-3 was calculated to be 0.076, using Eq. ( 4) and detailed in our previous reports 8,18,65.It is widely known that CNDs are superior electron-reservoir co-catalysts because of their beneficial electrical properties 47,747576.These properties are akin to other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes 16,22,77,78. In this study, when the concentration of CNDs CND/pCN was greater than 3 wt., the photocatalytic evolution of CO and CH 4 deteriorated markedly.This was evidenced in the CND/pCN-4 sample, despite its greater optical absorption (Fig. 5) relative to CND/pCN samples with a lower proportion of CNDs.This was because excessive CNDs on the pCN surface caused a reduction in the visible-light absorption of pCN, thus inhibiting the generation of charge carriers.This significantly reduced the quantity of photoinduced electrons transported from pCN to the CNDs.In addition, excessive CNDs deposited on the pCN surface hindered the formation of an efficient heterojunction interface between 0D CNDs and 2D pCN nanosheets, reducing electron transfer from pCN to the CNDs.Similar results have been observed by other research groups 49,52,60.These suggest that determining the optimum concentration of CNDs is vital for the formation of a synergistic heterojunction interface with pCN, and thus favorable photocatalytic performance.The detailed charge carrier dynamics of CND/pCN will be discussed in the later PEC, PL, and DFT sections, and compared with the photocatalytic results. The photoactivities of CNDs and the mechanically combined CND/pCN-3M sample were determined (Figs.7(a that the photocatalytic performance of CNDs was very low for the evolution of both CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)).This indicated that CNDs serve as effective co-catalysts for the CO 2 reduction reaction, rather than functioning as semiconductor photocatalysts themselves.Our results are in accordance with recent reports 69,79, which indicate that pure CNDs demonstrate no photocatalytic activity toward H 2 evolution or CO 2 fixation.Additionally, to emphasize the role of the hybrid heterojunction between CNDs and pCN, the visible-light catalytic activity of CND/ pCN-3M was determined for the evolution of CH 4 (Fig. S9 in the ESM).The experimental results showed that CND/pCN-3M (10.03 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ) had slightly higher activity than pCN (8.05 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), but its photoactivity was markedly lower than CND/pCN-3 (29.23 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), despite containing the same proportion of CNDs.This low activity was a result of the loosely connected heterojunctions in CND/ pCN-3M.This result demonstrates the importance of well-constructed heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs in the hybridized systems. In addition to measurement of the visible-light activities, the performance of the catalysts was measured when activated by simulated solar light.The simulated solar light was generated with a xenon lamp covered by an AM1.5 filter.An AM1.5 filter is the most reliable method to mimic natural sunlight, and hence to determine the feasibility of using the photocatalysts in CO 2 reduction processes under natural light 26.As illustrated in Figs.7(a) and 7(b), the proportion of CNDs is vital in determining the efficiency of the catalytic reactions.A similar trend of catalytic results to those obtained under visible light irradiation was obtained under simulated solar light.The optimum loading of CND was found to be 3 wt.,as in the CND/pCN-3 sample.In the CND/ pCN-3 experiment, 37.06 molg catalyst -1 of CH 4 and 68.80 molg catalyst -1 of CO were produced.These were 2.83-and 2.02-fold increases, respectively, over pure pCN.For all the catalysts tested, the total yields of each product were greater under simulated solar light than under visible light.This was because simulated sunlight contains a small fraction (4) of UV light, which has higher photon energies than visible light.These high-energy photons generate more free charge carriers to take part in the photochemical reactions, which increases the product yields.In summary, the highest CH 4 and CO productions were obtained using CND/pCN-3 (3 wt. of CNDs), under both visible light and simulated solar light illumination after 10 h of reaction. Recyclability, photostability and durability of photocatalysts are important factors in their prolonged utilization in large-scale applications.The time dependence of the rate of CH 4 production, using CND/pCN-3 as a representative photocatalyst, was measured over four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(a) and 8(b)).After four cycles (40 h) of CO 2 photoreduction experiments, the CND/pCN-3 sample retained its catalytic activity for CH 4 evolution.Additionally, there were no noticeable deviations in the chemical structure and phase composition of the CND/pCN-3 after four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(c) and 8(d)).These results demonstrate the excellent stability of the CND/pCN-3 catalyst. PEC analysis was performed to determine the significance of interfacial interactions, and charge transfer behavior, between pCN and CNDs, on the photoactivity of the CND/pCN hybrid systems.The charge transfer efficiencies of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, and CND/pCN samples were determined by photochronoamperometry measurements.Figure 9(a) shows the photocurrent-time curves for the samples studied, with several on-off cycles of visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Reproducible and uniform photocurrent responses were obtained for all the working electrodes after six irradiation cycles, indicating that the photocurrent response for each electrode was stable and reversible.For pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, a low photocurrent density was measured due to the rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs.The photocurrent density steadily increased with increasing CND content (from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt.).However, when the CND content exceeded 3 wt.(in the CND/pCN-4 sample) a slight decrease in the photocurrent density was observed.This was attributed to reduced visible-light activation of pCN as a result of increased CND coverage of the pCN surface.However, the CND/ pCN-4 sample still exhibited a higher photocurrent response than those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample demonstrated the highest Nano Res.photocurrent density of all the samples.We concluded that the recombination of charge carriers between pCN and the CND content was inhibited optimally, and thus the separation efficiency of charge carriers at the 0D/2D heterojunction interface was also optimized.The photocurrent in CND/pCN-3 sample showed a four-fold increase compared to the pure pCN sample.The inhibition of charge recombination implies that the 0D/2D heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs are well-formed, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity of CND/pCN-3. Furthermore, EIS analysis was conducted to provide further data on the charge transfer and separation processes, and to study the electrical conductivity of the photocatalysts 68.The charge transfer resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interface can, in general, be represented by the arc radius of the Nyquist impedance plots 17.Consistent with our transient photocurrent responses (Fig. 9(a)) and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results (Fig. 7), the lowest electron transfer resistance upon visible light irradiation was measured in the CND/pCN-3 sample; evidenced by it having the smallest arc radius in the EIS Nyquist diagram (Fig. S10 in the ESM).This demonstrates that the incorporation of an optimized proportion of CND significantly increases the electrical conductivity of pCN.Hence, this promotes effective interfacial electron transfer at the hetero-nanostructural interface of the CND/pCN-3 sample, by utilizing CNDs as electron storage co-catalysts to improve solar energy conversion. To determine the charge carrier density and band structures of the CND/pCN sample and improve our understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism, electrochemical Mott-Schottky analysis was conducted at frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz.As shown in Fig. 9(b), both the pCN and CND/pCN-3 samples produced positive slopes, thus demonstrating n-type semiconductor features despite the CND/pCN-3 sample being conjugated with CNDs.A descending gradient was present in the CND/pCN-3 Mott-Schottky plot, in contrast to the plot for pCN.This signifies a higher donor density in the CND/pCN-3 nanohybrids, which results from the improved -conjugation system of CNDs with pCN (as demonstrated by the EPR results in Fig. 6).For n-type semiconductors, the Mott-Schottky equation can be written as Eq. ( 5) 80 where C denotes the space charge capacitance, N D is the density of charge carriers, q is the electronic charge (1.602 10 -19 C), and o refer to the dielectric constant of g-C 3 N 4 (5.25) and permittivity in vacuum (8.85 10 -14 Fcm -2 ), respectively, E and E fb denote the applied potential and flat-band potential, respectively, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The value of E fb is determined by the x-intercept of the linear section of the Mott-Schottky curve.In this instance, the E fb of CND/pCN-3 showed a positive shift toward a smaller E fb value, in comparison with that of pCN.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were measured to be -1.1 and -1.4 V, respectively, vs. Ag/AgCl.The normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential was estimated from the potential relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode according to Eq. ( 6) 81 fb (vs.NHE) fb (pH0, vs. Ag/AgCl) AgCl where the pH of the electrolyte is ca.6.8 and E AgCl is 0.197 V.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were -0.50 and -0.80 V, respectively, vs. NHE.As an approximation, the CB minimum (CBM) of a typical n-type semiconductor is 0.3 V more negative than E fb 82, thus the CBM values of pCN and CND/pCN-3 are -1.1 and -0.8 V, respectively, vs. NHE.Based on the slopes of the Mott-Schottky plots, the density of charge carrier, N D can also be calculated from Eq. ( 7) 82 Using Eq. ( 7), the N D of CND/pCN-3 (1.37 10 22 cm -3 ) was found to be significantly greater than that of pCN (9.37 10 21 cm -3 ).The higher carrier density in the CND/pCN-3 sample was indicative of the greater spatial separation of electrons and holes in the presence of CNDs.This increased separation lowers the charge recombination rate, and increases the photocatalytic efficiency.This phenomenon gives rise to improved charge mobility and electrical conductivity and increases the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.This agrees well with the results of our photocurrent response tests (Fig. 9(a)) and EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. S10 in the ESM).Steady state PL spectroscopy is a powerful analysis tool for determining the nature of the radiative recombination process and charge kinetics of a photocatalyst (Fig. 10(a)) 42.For pCN, an intense, broad, PL emission peak was observed, indicating rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs, through band-band transitions.All of the CND/pCN hybrid photocatalysts showed significantly reduced PL intensities, relative to pCN.This was due to effective interfacial charge separation in the CND/pCN nanohybrids arising from well-formed 0D/2D heterojunction interfaces, which suppressed the charge recombination.Furthermore, the PL signal of CND/pCN-3 was the lowest in intensity, indicating the slowest charge recombination and that the CND concentration in the Nano Res.sample was optimal. TRPL was employed to acquire detailed insights into the lifetime of charge carrier dynamics (Fig. 10(b)).The fluorescence decay curves were fitted using the tri-exponential function: I(t) A 1 exp (-t/ 1 ) A 2 exp (-t/ 2 ) A 3 exp (-t/ 3 ), where A and denote the amplitudes and emission lifetimes of each component.The detailed kinetic parameters for all the photocatalyst used in this study are listed in Table 1.The average lifetime, ave , was calculated using Eq. ( 8), and describes the resultant TRPL features of each sample 83.As summarized in Table 1, when a small proportion (0.5 wt.) of CNDs was introduced onto the pCN surface, the emission lifetime was reduced from 6.72 ns (pCN) to 5.87 ns (CND/pCN-1).Incorporating an optimal concentration of CNDs (3 wt.) reduced the decay lifetime to 3.87 ns (CND/pCN-3); almost 1.7 times shorter than that of pure pCN.The significantly decreased emission lifetime of the CND/pCN-3 sample indicated that the interfacial electron injection from pCN to CNDs was rapid, due to the existence of non-radiative quenching routes.However, proportions CNDs greater that 3 wt.were detrimental to the photoactivity, as indicated by the longer decay lifetime (4.76 ns) of CND/pCN-4, because of the higher recombination rate of the charge carriers.Our TRPL results are in good agreement with the steady state PL analysis (Fig. 10(a)) and the photocatalytic results (Fig. 7). The dynamic charge carrier process was further evaluated by the determination of the electron transfer rate constant (k ET ) and the efficiency of electron transfer ( ET ), as expressed in Eqs. ( 9) and ( 10) 84.We found that the CND/pCN-3 sample had the largest k ET (1.10 10 8 s -1 ) and ET (42.4) of all the photocatalyst samples.This finding provides further evidence for the efficient transportation of photoexcited electrons from pCN to CNDs via an effective heterointerface between pCN and CNDs.This plays a pivotal role in increasing the probability of electrons participating in the photochemical reduction of CO 2 before electronhole recombination occurs.The PEC, steady state PL and TRPL results, all indicate that the CND/pCN-3 ave ET ave To This suggests that the photoexcitation of electrons was possible when the photon energy was sufficient to overcome the band gap between the HOMO and the LUMO.Using this information, we propose that the excitation process in a partially ionized system occurs as follows.Firstly, electrons in the pCN were photoexcited and moved into the LUMO, correspondingly, the generation of holes took place in the HOMO of pCN.The energy level of the HOMO in pCN was lower than that of the CND HOMO, so, in the second stage, the migration of the HOMO electron from the CND to the pCN occurred before combining with a hole (Fig. 11(c)).When this occurred, the net charge was shared across the carbon lattice, rather than being localized on the CND.Consequently, the net positive and negative charges induced an internal electric field, directed from pCN to CND.Furthermore, the internal electric field at the interface produced a force on the holes and electrons, in the opposite direction to the diffusion force.At thermal equilibrium, both the electric field force and the diffusion force are balanced.This was verified by density of state (DOS) and work function analyses, as discussed below. The total density of state (TDOS) and the partial density of state (PDOS) were calculated for the CND/ pCN heterojunction (Fig. 12).As shown in Fig. 12(a), the lower VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies ranging from -1 to -0.37 eV.The PDOS calculations of CND and pCN exhibited a similar shape, signifying successful bonding of pCN with CND.The upper VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies in the range of -0.37 to 0 eV.The CND bands made the greatest contribution to the VB maximum (VBM).Conversely, pCN mainly contributed to the sub-sharp closing of the VBM.The VBs of pCN were primarily composed of N 2p, N 2s, and C 2p orbitals, whereas the CBs of pCN were dominated by C 2p and N 2p orbitals (Fig. 12(b)).This agreed well with our previous work 18.Additionally, the DOS of CND consisted of discrete energy levels, which corresponded with the lack of symmetry in the CND structure (Fig. 12(c)).The C 2p and O 2p orbitals made the greatest contribution to the DOS, except in the energy range from 1.5 to 2 eV.From 1.5 to 2 eV, the DOS originated from C 2p and H 1s orbitals.On the basis of this analysis, we concluded that the CND/pCN heterojunction is a typical band alignment structure. The work function, , of a material is an important property, commonly employed as an intrinsic reference for band alignment.It can be defined as follows (Eq.( 11)) 85 E vac -E f (11) where E vac is the vacuum energy of a stationary electron near the surface of the material and E f denotes the ground state electronic structure calculation.The calculated electrostatic potentials for monolayer pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunctions are shown in 11(b).In addition, our first-principles DFT results were consistent with the photocatalytic and PEC experimental measurements. On the basis of the experimental and first-principles DFT computational results, a plausible photocatalytic mechanism of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO under visible light or simulated solar light was proposed (Fig. 14).When the CND/pCN photocatalyst was irradiated by visible light, holes and free electrons were generated in pCN.The electrons were photoexcited from the VB to the CB of pCN, thus leaving holes in the VB of pCN.As a result of the high electron storage capability and electronic conductivity of CNDs, the photoinduced electrons could be easily injected into the CNDs.The photogenerated holes can react with H 2 O to produce protons (H ).It is well established that delocalized -conjugated II 3 bonding is exhibited by CO 2 molecules, leading to the adsorption of CO 2 onto the surface of CNDs, through - conjugation 18.This adsorption causes the destabilization and activation of CO 2 .Thus, the electrons accumulated on the CND surface can successfully reduce CO 2 to CO (E (CO 2 /CO) -0.53V vs. NHE) and CH 4 (E (CO 2 / CH 4 ) -0.24V vs. NHE) via a two electron/two proton pathway and an eight electron/eight proton pathway, respectively 35.The photocatalytic mechanism with simulated solar light illumination is identical; the spatially separated photoinduced electrons and holes enhanced the reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H , to form CH"}, {"llm generation": "UV light", "source": "This was because simulated sunlight contains a small fraction (4) of UV light, which has higher photon energies than visible light.", "context": "The 0D/2D CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalysts were successfully synthesized using a surface charge-facilitated electrostatic interaction approach (Fig. 1).Initially, bulk g-C 3 N 4 was obtained by using urea as the precursor, as in our previously reported procedure (Fig. S3 in the ESM) 43,44.The bulk g-C 3 N 4 was subsequently delaminated into 2D g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets via an ultrasonication-assisted process.This was followed by the protonation of g-C 3 N 4 by HCl to alter its surface change from negative (-15.3 mV) to positive (14.0 mV), as confirmed by zeta potential analysis (Fig. S4 in the ESM).The negatively charged surface of the pure g-C 3 N 4 was ascribed to the -C-Nmotifs in the g-C 3 N 4 framework 18.The CNDs in solution, which was synthesized by the NaOH-assisted ultrasonic treatment of glucose, possessed a high negative charge (-40.4 mV) (Fig. S4 in the ESM).This was attributed to the abundance of oxygenated functional groups on the surfaces of CNDs.By considering the oppositely charged surfaces and - stacking interactions, we surmise that the CND/pCN catalysts were constructed through electrostatic selfassembly between the negatively charged CNDs and the positively charged pCN nanosheets.A series of CND/pCN samples were synthesized with different proportions of CNDs (0.5 wt., 1 wt., 3 wt.,and 5 wt.).The CND contents were confirmed by TGA analysis (Fig. S5 in the ESM). The surface morphologies of pCN, CNDs, and CND/ pCN-3 were investigated using TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 2).As shown in Fig. 2(a), delaminated pCN had 2D laminar and loose mesh morphologies with many in-plane pores several nanometers in diameter.Additionally, chiffon-like curled wrinkles were found at the edges of pCN nanosheets.These were formed because of decreases in the surface energy, due to the successful delamination of bulk g-C 3 N 4 into sheet- Nano Res.like structures.Additionally, the delaminated pCN suspension showed the Tyndall effect (inset of Fig. 2(a)), demonstrating the colloidal nature of highly dispersed pCN in water.The thinness of the pCN nanosheets reduces the distance for charge migration, and thus retards charge recombination.Their relatively large surface areas, of hundreds of nanometers in length, are favorable for the deposition of various compounds of different sizes and form effective heterointerfaces for charge transfer.Further evidence is provided in our previous studies, in which we hybridized conjugated g-C 3 N 4 with other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as 2D graphene, in pursuit of a highly efficient interfacial charge transfer process 18,44. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the CNDs were dispersed in a uniform manner, without significant agglomeration of the nanoparticles.The HRTEM image of the CNDs shows their amorphous outer surfaces and crystalline interiors.After a year of storage, the CND solution remained homogenous, light-brown, with no precipi-tation (Fig. 2(b1)).This indicates that the CNDs were efficiently dispersed in H 2 O, as a result of oxygen functional groups on their surfaces.This will be discussed further in the discussion of FTIR spectra.The presence of the Tyndall effect provided further evidence for the efficient dispersal of the CNDs.The Tyndall effect was observed when red laser light was passed through the CND solution (Fig. 2(b2)).Upon coupling with pCN, CNDs with an average diameter of 4.4 nm were uniformly deposited on the edges and surfaces of pCN nanosheets.This resulted in the formation of nanoislands with intact bonding, as shown in TEM and HRTEM images (Figs.2(c) and 2(d)).The HRTEM image (Fig. 2(d)) clearly shows lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (100) plane of graphitic carbon 54,55.These fringes confirm the successful development of interfacial contact between pCN and CNDs via electrostatic attraction, which is of fundamental importance for the migration of electrons in photocatalysis.56.This demonstrates that pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN possess comparable crystal structures, despite dissimilar surface charges.Meanwhile, CNDs showed a broad diffraction peak centered at ca. 23, which originated from a highly disordered graphitic carbon phase 57,58.The XRD spectra of all the CND/pCN samples showed patterns to those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.This indicates that the structural integrity of pCN remained intact when loaded with CNDs, allowing the modulation of its optical properties.No distinct characteristic CND peak was present in the spectra of any of the CND/pCN nanohybrids, owing to the comparatively low diffraction intensity and the fine dispersion of CNDs over the pCN substrates.This was in good agreement with other recent studies of CND/TiO 2 59 and CND/BiOBr 60. The chemical structure of the CND/pCN hybrid nanocomposites was determined by FTIR, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN (Fig. 3(a)).The FTIR spectrum of CNDs (Fig. 3(a1)) indicated the presence of various oxygen-containing functional groups: C-O (ca.1,000-1,400 cm -1 ), C-O-C (ca.1,200 cm -1 ), -COOH (ca.1,358 cm -1 ), and CO (ca.1,705 cm -1 ) 57,61,62.These groups were introduced at the basal planes and edges of the CNDs.By taking advantage of these abundant hydrophilic groups, the dispersibility and stability of CNDs in the water was enhanced, as previously discussed (Fig. 2(b1)).In addition to oxygen-containing groups, the stretching vibration of C-H bonds was evidenced by the absorption band at 2,915 cm -1 63.The absorption peak at ca. 1,610 cm -1 was assigned to CC vibration 61.No significant variations in these characteristic peaks were detected in any of the CND/pCN samples, in comparison to the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN samples (Figs.3(a2)-3(a7)).This suggests that there were no substantial changes to the basic framework of pCN when it was hybridized with CNDs.The broad absorption peak from 3,000-3,800 cm -1 was attributed to the vibrational modes of N-H and O-H groups 64.The presence of these functional groups is accounted for by the presence of adsorbed hydroxyl species and free amino groups in the samples.Additionally, the presence of aromatic C-N and CN heterocycles was confirmed by a number of strong absorption peaks from 1,200 to 1,700 cm -1 , located at 1,630, 1,565, 1,415, 1,330, and 1,250 cm -1 , assigned to their skeletal stretching modes 36,65.Furthermore, the breathing mode of tri-striazine was clearly visible at ca. 812 cm -1 in all g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and CND/pCN sample spectra 42.After the hybridization of pCN with CNDs, a slight shift toward a lower wavenumber was observed in the characteristic peaks of the CND/pCN samples, from 1,255 to 1,250 cm -1 and 812 to 806 cm -1 .This indicates that interactions between the \"nitrogen pots\" of pCN and CNDs were initiated by electrostatic attraction 66.These interactions weakened the C-N bonds, Nano Res.increasing their length, which was commensurate with the TEM results (Fig. 2).There were no additional bands evident in the FTIR spectra due to impurities in the CND/pCN nanocomposites.This was in agreement with the XRD results (Fig. S6 in the ESM), verifying that no impurities were added during the fabrication of CND/pCN. The degree of graphitization in CNDs was further evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3(b)).The Raman spectrum of the CNDs (Fig. 3(b1)) exhibited two characteristic bands, the D-band (ca.1,360 cm -1 ) and the G-band (ca.1,590 cm -1 ).These bands confirm the successful synthesis of CNDs from glucose.The intensity ratio of the D-band to the G-band, I D /I G , is used to characterize the disorder level in graphitic carbon.The I D /I G ratio of the CNDs synthesized in this study was calculated to be 0.62.These results indicated that the CNDs had a partially amorphous external surface along with crystallized, sp 2 , core characteristics, which was in agreement with the HRTEM image (Fig. 2(b)).In addition, no significant differences in the Raman peaks were evident between any of the CND/pCN samples.This demonstrates that the conjugation of pCN with CNDs had little effect on the chemical skeleton of pCN.The characteristic stretching vibrations of C-N at 461, 585, 710, 750, 975, 1,111, 1,150, 1,235, 1,462, and 1,625 cm -1 were concordant with the FTIR results (Fig. 3(a)), and matched closely with those reported in Refs.42,64,67. To gain insights into the elemental bonding configurations and chemical composition of the CND/ pCN-3 sample relative to pCN, XPS analysis was conducted (Fig. 4).As depicted in Fig. 4 Nano Res.incomplete condensation processes), and positively charged g-C 3 N 4 heterocycles (due to the protonation of HCl), respectively 18,66.The slight shifts in the deconvoluted peaks of the C 1s and N 1 s spectra strongly suggest that coupling interactions exist between CNDs and pCN in the hybrid nanostructures.Additionally, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of CND/pCN-3 can be divided into two dominant peaks, at 531.4 and 533.1 eV (Fig. 4(d)).These originate from the CO and HO-CO groups, respectively 63, signifying the deposition of CNDs onto the pCN substrate.In the pCN sample spectrum, the O 1s peak at 532.1 eV was assigned to the adsorbed CO 2 or H 2 O 18.Overall, the HRTEM, FTIR and XPS results imply that the electrostatic attraction of surface charges and - stacking interactions play pivotal roles in the self-assembly of CND/pCN nanohybrids, giving rise to an effective interfacial contact heterointerface. Figure 5 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples, obtained to investigate their optical properties.Pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN showed an absorption edge at around 440 nm with band gap energies of 2.8 eV, as determined in our previous work 18,43.Then the CNDs were incorporated, there was no significant shift in the onset of the absorption edge relative to that of pure pCN.This implies that the CNDs anchored to the pCN surface act as a conducting electron channel.Similar results have been reported in other studies of CND-based photocatalytic systems 69.The intrinsic charge generation of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction arises from the injection of The electronic band structures of the pCN and CND/pCN photocatalysts were determined by EPR analysis at ambient temperature (Fig. 6).Unlike the urea precursor, pure g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and all the CND/ pCN samples displayed a single Lorentzian line at ca. 3,508 G with a g value of ca.2.0045.This line confirms the presence of unpaired electrons on the carbon atoms of the -conjugated aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 56.The Lorentzian line of pCN was slightly enhanced, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 , after the introduction of protons into the g-C 3 N 4 framework (Fig. 6(a)).This was attributed to improved electron mobility and increased delocalization of the system 70.In addition, the intensity of the EPR signal of the CND/pCN samples increased significantly with increasing CND loading (Fig. 6(b)).This phenomenon was due to extensive - coupling between pCN and CNDs in the CND/pCN systems 69.Consequently, spin mobility and charge delocalization were improved in the CND/ pCN samples, resulting in a greater density of charge carriers 71.This will be discussed further in the Mott-Schottky section.Optimization of the electronic properties of the CND/pCN heterojunction interface, to accelerate charge transportation and separation, will be beneficial to the photocatalytic solar energy conversion process. Measurements of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O vapor were conducted under visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light Nano Res.illumination for a total reaction duration of 10 h (Fig. 7).For all the photocatalysts studied under visible light irradiation, there were two major products produced by the CO 2 reduction, namely CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a of CH 4 and CO, despite the incorporation of protons (H ) into the framework of g-C 3 N 4 .This clearly demonstrated that acidic protonation pretreatment to modify the surface charge of g-C 3 N 4 did not adversely affect the active sites, and thus its CO 2 reduction activity. The hybridization of CNDs had a significant effect on the photoactivity of CND/pCN toward CO 2 reduction.As the CND content increased from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt., a gradual rise in photocatalytic activity for the production of CH 4 and CO was observed (Figs.7(a Moreover, the total amounts of CH 4 and CO produced with CND/pCN-3 were 3.6-and 2.28-times greater than produced using pure pCN (Figs.7(a) and 7(b)).For both pCN and the CND/pCN samples, the total evolution of CO under visible light was greater than that of CH 4 by a factor of 2 to 3.2.Similar observations have also been reported by Wang et al. 66,72.This was attributed to the number of electrons and protons participating in the photoreaction, which kinetically determines the formation of the CO and CH 4 products 73.As shown in Eqs. ( 2) and ( 3), 2e -/2H and 8e -/8H are needed to produce CO and CH 4 , respectively.It is reasonable to infer that a larger quantity of CO was yielded than of CH 4 because fewer electrons and protons take part in the CO 2 reduction reaction that forms CO.Thus, we can conclude that the generation of CO or CH 4 is directly related to the number of free charge carriers present in the chemical reaction. (2) The significantly increased visible-light photoactivity of CND/pCN-3 heterojunction nanocomposites was attributed to the successful retardation of the electronhole recombination rate, in comparison to bare pCN.The AQE of CND/pCN-3 was calculated to be 0.076, using Eq. ( 4) and detailed in our previous reports 8,18,65.It is widely known that CNDs are superior electron-reservoir co-catalysts because of their beneficial electrical properties 47,747576.These properties are akin to other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes 16,22,77,78. In this study, when the concentration of CNDs CND/pCN was greater than 3 wt., the photocatalytic evolution of CO and CH 4 deteriorated markedly.This was evidenced in the CND/pCN-4 sample, despite its greater optical absorption (Fig. 5) relative to CND/pCN samples with a lower proportion of CNDs.This was because excessive CNDs on the pCN surface caused a reduction in the visible-light absorption of pCN, thus inhibiting the generation of charge carriers.This significantly reduced the quantity of photoinduced electrons transported from pCN to the CNDs.In addition, excessive CNDs deposited on the pCN surface hindered the formation of an efficient heterojunction interface between 0D CNDs and 2D pCN nanosheets, reducing electron transfer from pCN to the CNDs.Similar results have been observed by other research groups 49,52,60.These suggest that determining the optimum concentration of CNDs is vital for the formation of a synergistic heterojunction interface with pCN, and thus favorable photocatalytic performance.The detailed charge carrier dynamics of CND/pCN will be discussed in the later PEC, PL, and DFT sections, and compared with the photocatalytic results. The photoactivities of CNDs and the mechanically combined CND/pCN-3M sample were determined (Figs.7(a that the photocatalytic performance of CNDs was very low for the evolution of both CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)).This indicated that CNDs serve as effective co-catalysts for the CO 2 reduction reaction, rather than functioning as semiconductor photocatalysts themselves.Our results are in accordance with recent reports 69,79, which indicate that pure CNDs demonstrate no photocatalytic activity toward H 2 evolution or CO 2 fixation.Additionally, to emphasize the role of the hybrid heterojunction between CNDs and pCN, the visible-light catalytic activity of CND/ pCN-3M was determined for the evolution of CH 4 (Fig. S9 in the ESM).The experimental results showed that CND/pCN-3M (10.03 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ) had slightly higher activity than pCN (8.05 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), but its photoactivity was markedly lower than CND/pCN-3 (29.23 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), despite containing the same proportion of CNDs.This low activity was a result of the loosely connected heterojunctions in CND/ pCN-3M.This result demonstrates the importance of well-constructed heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs in the hybridized systems. In addition to measurement of the visible-light activities, the performance of the catalysts was measured when activated by simulated solar light.The simulated solar light was generated with a xenon lamp covered by an AM1.5 filter.An AM1.5 filter is the most reliable method to mimic natural sunlight, and hence to determine the feasibility of using the photocatalysts in CO 2 reduction processes under natural light 26.As illustrated in Figs.7(a) and 7(b), the proportion of CNDs is vital in determining the efficiency of the catalytic reactions.A similar trend of catalytic results to those obtained under visible light irradiation was obtained under simulated solar light.The optimum loading of CND was found to be 3 wt.,as in the CND/pCN-3 sample.In the CND/ pCN-3 experiment, 37.06 molg catalyst -1 of CH 4 and 68.80 molg catalyst -1 of CO were produced.These were 2.83-and 2.02-fold increases, respectively, over pure pCN.For all the catalysts tested, the total yields of each product were greater under simulated solar light than under visible light.This was because simulated sunlight contains a small fraction (4) of UV light, which has higher photon energies than visible light.These high-energy photons generate more free charge carriers to take part in the photochemical reactions, which increases the product yields.In summary, the highest CH 4 and CO productions were obtained using CND/pCN-3 (3 wt. of CNDs), under both visible light and simulated solar light illumination after 10 h of reaction. Recyclability, photostability and durability of photocatalysts are important factors in their prolonged utilization in large-scale applications.The time dependence of the rate of CH 4 production, using CND/pCN-3 as a representative photocatalyst, was measured over four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(a) and 8(b)).After four cycles (40 h) of CO 2 photoreduction experiments, the CND/pCN-3 sample retained its catalytic activity for CH 4 evolution.Additionally, there were no noticeable deviations in the chemical structure and phase composition of the CND/pCN-3 after four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(c) and 8(d)).These results demonstrate the excellent stability of the CND/pCN-3 catalyst. PEC analysis was performed to determine the significance of interfacial interactions, and charge transfer behavior, between pCN and CNDs, on the photoactivity of the CND/pCN hybrid systems.The charge transfer efficiencies of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, and CND/pCN samples were determined by photochronoamperometry measurements.Figure 9(a) shows the photocurrent-time curves for the samples studied, with several on-off cycles of visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Reproducible and uniform photocurrent responses were obtained for all the working electrodes after six irradiation cycles, indicating that the photocurrent response for each electrode was stable and reversible.For pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, a low photocurrent density was measured due to the rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs.The photocurrent density steadily increased with increasing CND content (from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt.).However, when the CND content exceeded 3 wt.(in the CND/pCN-4 sample) a slight decrease in the photocurrent density was observed.This was attributed to reduced visible-light activation of pCN as a result of increased CND coverage of the pCN surface.However, the CND/ pCN-4 sample still exhibited a higher photocurrent response than those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample demonstrated the highest Nano Res.photocurrent density of all the samples.We concluded that the recombination of charge carriers between pCN and the CND content was inhibited optimally, and thus the separation efficiency of charge carriers at the 0D/2D heterojunction interface was also optimized.The photocurrent in CND/pCN-3 sample showed a four-fold increase compared to the pure pCN sample.The inhibition of charge recombination implies that the 0D/2D heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs are well-formed, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity of CND/pCN-3. Furthermore, EIS analysis was conducted to provide further data on the charge transfer and separation processes, and to study the electrical conductivity of the photocatalysts 68.The charge transfer resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interface can, in general, be represented by the arc radius of the Nyquist impedance plots 17.Consistent with our transient photocurrent responses (Fig. 9(a)) and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results (Fig. 7), the lowest electron transfer resistance upon visible light irradiation was measured in the CND/pCN-3 sample; evidenced by it having the smallest arc radius in the EIS Nyquist diagram (Fig. S10 in the ESM).This demonstrates that the incorporation of an optimized proportion of CND significantly increases the electrical conductivity of pCN.Hence, this promotes effective interfacial electron transfer at the hetero-nanostructural interface of the CND/pCN-3 sample, by utilizing CNDs as electron storage co-catalysts to improve solar energy conversion. To determine the charge carrier density and band structures of the CND/pCN sample and improve our understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism, electrochemical Mott-Schottky analysis was conducted at frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz.As shown in Fig. 9(b), both the pCN and CND/pCN-3 samples produced positive slopes, thus demonstrating n-type semiconductor features despite the CND/pCN-3 sample being conjugated with CNDs.A descending gradient was present in the CND/pCN-3 Mott-Schottky plot, in contrast to the plot for pCN.This signifies a higher donor density in the CND/pCN-3 nanohybrids, which results from the improved -conjugation system of CNDs with pCN (as demonstrated by the EPR results in Fig. 6).For n-type semiconductors, the Mott-Schottky equation can be written as Eq. ( 5) 80 where C denotes the space charge capacitance, N D is the density of charge carriers, q is the electronic charge (1.602 10 -19 C), and o refer to the dielectric constant of g-C 3 N 4 (5.25) and permittivity in vacuum (8.85 10 -14 Fcm -2 ), respectively, E and E fb denote the applied potential and flat-band potential, respectively, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The value of E fb is determined by the x-intercept of the linear section of the Mott-Schottky curve.In this instance, the E fb of CND/pCN-3 showed a positive shift toward a smaller E fb value, in comparison with that of pCN.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were measured to be -1.1 and -1.4 V, respectively, vs. Ag/AgCl.The normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential was estimated from the potential relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode according to Eq. ( 6) 81 fb (vs.NHE) fb (pH0, vs. Ag/AgCl) AgCl where the pH of the electrolyte is ca.6.8 and E AgCl is 0.197 V.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were -0.50 and -0.80 V, respectively, vs. NHE.As an approximation, the CB minimum (CBM) of a typical n-type semiconductor is 0.3 V more negative than E fb 82, thus the CBM values of pCN and CND/pCN-3 are -1.1 and -0.8 V, respectively, vs. NHE.Based on the slopes of the Mott-Schottky plots, the density of charge carrier, N D can also be calculated from Eq. ( 7) 82 Using Eq. ( 7), the N D of CND/pCN-3 (1.37 10 22 cm -3 ) was found to be significantly greater than that of pCN (9.37 10 21 cm -3 ).The higher carrier density in the CND/pCN-3 sample was indicative of the greater spatial separation of electrons and holes in the presence of CNDs.This increased separation lowers the charge recombination rate, and increases the photocatalytic efficiency.This phenomenon gives rise to improved charge mobility and electrical conductivity and increases the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.This agrees well with the results of our photocurrent response tests (Fig. 9(a)) and EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. S10 in the ESM).Steady state PL spectroscopy is a powerful analysis tool for determining the nature of the radiative recombination process and charge kinetics of a photocatalyst (Fig. 10(a)) 42.For pCN, an intense, broad, PL emission peak was observed, indicating rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs, through band-band transitions.All of the CND/pCN hybrid photocatalysts showed significantly reduced PL intensities, relative to pCN.This was due to effective interfacial charge separation in the CND/pCN nanohybrids arising from well-formed 0D/2D heterojunction interfaces, which suppressed the charge recombination.Furthermore, the PL signal of CND/pCN-3 was the lowest in intensity, indicating the slowest charge recombination and that the CND concentration in the Nano Res.sample was optimal. TRPL was employed to acquire detailed insights into the lifetime of charge carrier dynamics (Fig. 10(b)).The fluorescence decay curves were fitted using the tri-exponential function: I(t) A 1 exp (-t/ 1 ) A 2 exp (-t/ 2 ) A 3 exp (-t/ 3 ), where A and denote the amplitudes and emission lifetimes of each component.The detailed kinetic parameters for all the photocatalyst used in this study are listed in Table 1.The average lifetime, ave , was calculated using Eq. ( 8), and describes the resultant TRPL features of each sample 83.As summarized in Table 1, when a small proportion (0.5 wt.) of CNDs was introduced onto the pCN surface, the emission lifetime was reduced from 6.72 ns (pCN) to 5.87 ns (CND/pCN-1).Incorporating an optimal concentration of CNDs (3 wt.) reduced the decay lifetime to 3.87 ns (CND/pCN-3); almost 1.7 times shorter than that of pure pCN.The significantly decreased emission lifetime of the CND/pCN-3 sample indicated that the interfacial electron injection from pCN to CNDs was rapid, due to the existence of non-radiative quenching routes.However, proportions CNDs greater that 3 wt.were detrimental to the photoactivity, as indicated by the longer decay lifetime (4.76 ns) of CND/pCN-4, because of the higher recombination rate of the charge carriers.Our TRPL results are in good agreement with the steady state PL analysis (Fig. 10(a)) and the photocatalytic results (Fig. 7). The dynamic charge carrier process was further evaluated by the determination of the electron transfer rate constant (k ET ) and the efficiency of electron transfer ( ET ), as expressed in Eqs. ( 9) and ( 10) 84.We found that the CND/pCN-3 sample had the largest k ET (1.10 10 8 s -1 ) and ET (42.4) of all the photocatalyst samples.This finding provides further evidence for the efficient transportation of photoexcited electrons from pCN to CNDs via an effective heterointerface between pCN and CNDs.This plays a pivotal role in increasing the probability of electrons participating in the photochemical reduction of CO 2 before electronhole recombination occurs.The PEC, steady state PL and TRPL results, all indicate that the CND/pCN-3 ave ET ave To This suggests that the photoexcitation of electrons was possible when the photon energy was sufficient to overcome the band gap between the HOMO and the LUMO.Using this information, we propose that the excitation process in a partially ionized system occurs as follows.Firstly, electrons in the pCN were photoexcited and moved into the LUMO, correspondingly, the generation of holes took place in the HOMO of pCN.The energy level of the HOMO in pCN was lower than that of the CND HOMO, so, in the second stage, the migration of the HOMO electron from the CND to the pCN occurred before combining with a hole (Fig. 11(c)).When this occurred, the net charge was shared across the carbon lattice, rather than being localized on the CND.Consequently, the net positive and negative charges induced an internal electric field, directed from pCN to CND.Furthermore, the internal electric field at the interface produced a force on the holes and electrons, in the opposite direction to the diffusion force.At thermal equilibrium, both the electric field force and the diffusion force are balanced.This was verified by density of state (DOS) and work function analyses, as discussed below. The total density of state (TDOS) and the partial density of state (PDOS) were calculated for the CND/ pCN heterojunction (Fig. 12).As shown in Fig. 12(a), the lower VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies ranging from -1 to -0.37 eV.The PDOS calculations of CND and pCN exhibited a similar shape, signifying successful bonding of pCN with CND.The upper VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies in the range of -0.37 to 0 eV.The CND bands made the greatest contribution to the VB maximum (VBM).Conversely, pCN mainly contributed to the sub-sharp closing of the VBM.The VBs of pCN were primarily composed of N 2p, N 2s, and C 2p orbitals, whereas the CBs of pCN were dominated by C 2p and N 2p orbitals (Fig. 12(b)).This agreed well with our previous work 18.Additionally, the DOS of CND consisted of discrete energy levels, which corresponded with the lack of symmetry in the CND structure (Fig. 12(c)).The C 2p and O 2p orbitals made the greatest contribution to the DOS, except in the energy range from 1.5 to 2 eV.From 1.5 to 2 eV, the DOS originated from C 2p and H 1s orbitals.On the basis of this analysis, we concluded that the CND/pCN heterojunction is a typical band alignment structure. The work function, , of a material is an important property, commonly employed as an intrinsic reference for band alignment.It can be defined as follows (Eq.( 11)) 85 E vac -E f (11) where E vac is the vacuum energy of a stationary electron near the surface of the material and E f denotes the ground state electronic structure calculation.The calculated electrostatic potentials for monolayer pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunctions are shown in 11(b).In addition, our first-principles DFT results were consistent with the photocatalytic and PEC experimental measurements. On the basis of the experimental and first-principles DFT computational results, a plausible photocatalytic mechanism of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO under visible light or simulated solar light was proposed (Fig. 14).When the CND/pCN photocatalyst was irradiated by visible light, holes and free electrons were generated in pCN.The electrons were photoexcited from the VB to the CB of pCN, thus leaving holes in the VB of pCN.As a result of the high electron storage capability and electronic conductivity of CNDs, the photoinduced electrons could be easily injected into the CNDs.The photogenerated holes can react with H 2 O to produce protons (H ).It is well established that delocalized -conjugated II 3 bonding is exhibited by CO 2 molecules, leading to the adsorption of CO 2 onto the surface of CNDs, through - conjugation 18.This adsorption causes the destabilization and activation of CO 2 .Thus, the electrons accumulated on the CND surface can successfully reduce CO 2 to CO (E (CO 2 /CO) -0.53V vs. NHE) and CH 4 (E (CO 2 / CH 4 ) -0.24V vs. NHE) via a two electron/two proton pathway and an eight electron/eight proton pathway, respectively 35.The photocatalytic mechanism with simulated solar light illumination is identical; the spatially separated photoinduced electrons and holes enhanced the reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H , to form CH"}, {"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "Figure 7 Total evolution of (a) CH 4 and (b) CO with pure g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, CNDs, and CND/pCN samples over 10 h of reaction under visible light and simulated solar light illumination.", "context": "In summary, we have designed a metal-free 0D/2D CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction photocatalyst, for Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the synthesis of 0D/2D CND/pCN samples by means of electrostatic attraction.

From Eq.(11), the work functions of pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunction were calculated to be 4.66, 5.56, and 5.29 eV, respectively.The difference in work functions between pCN and CND confirmed that the photoinduced electrons were shuttled from pCN to CND when pCN came into contact with CND.The work function of CND (5.56 eV) was higher than that of pCN (4.66 eV), which accounted for the transfer of electrons from pCN to CND until the Fermi energies of the two phases were aligned.As a result, the work function of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction (5.29 eV) was calculated to lie between the work functions of CND and pCN.Hence, the CND accumulated negative charges (electrons), whereas the pCN layer accumulated positive charges (holes).This allowed efficient electron migration and separation across the heterointerface of CND/pCN nanohybrids, which inhibited the electron-hole recombination.This increased the efficiency of the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 via 2-electron and 8-electron processes, respectively.Overall, the electrostatic potential results were in good agreement with the frontier electron orbital analyses presented in Figs.11(a) and Nano Res. 4 and CO.The detailed reaction equations are given in Eqs.(12)-(15) CND/pCN h CND (e -) pCN (h ) -) CO 2 2H CND CO H 2 O (14) CND (8e -) CO 2 8H CND CH 4 2H 2 O (15) Figure 14 Charge transfer and separation in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 using CND/pCN samples under visible-light or simulated solar irradiation.

Nano Res. the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO in the presence of H 2 O vapor.The photocatalyst was synthesized via the electrostatically driven assembly of negatively charged CNDs and positively charged pCN.Our investigations revealed that the integration of pCN with highly conductive CNDs significantly influenced the photocatalytic performance, compared to that of pure pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample (3 wt. of CNDs) gave the highest total evolutions of CH 4 (29.23 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (58.82 molg catalyst -1 ) under visible light irradiation after 10 h of reaction.These amounts were ca.3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than those generated with pCN.Similarly, the maximum total productions of CH 4 (37.06 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (68.80 molg catalyst -1 ), under simulated solar light irradiation for 10 h, were also achieved by CND/pCN-3.Of all the samples tested, the CND/pCN-3 had the lowest PL decay lifetime (3.87 ns) and the highest electron transfer rate constant (1.10 10 8 s -1 ), which agreed well with our photocatalytic results.The significantly increased photoactivity of CND/pCN-3, relative to pure pCN, was attributed to (1) improved electrical conductivity, (2) rapid interfacial electron transfer from pCN to CNDs via a well-formed heterointerface, and (3) a reduction in the electron-hole recombination rate.This was determined through a combination of experimental results (e.g., transient photocurrent responses, EIS Nyquist diagrams, Mott-Schottky plots, steady state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy) and DFT computational calculations.Based on the DFT results, we determined that the photogenerated electrons promptly migrated from pCN to a CND, which functioned as an electron reservoir, as shown by the comparatively smaller work function of pCN (4.66 eV) than of CNDs (5.56 eV).Overall, the use of metal-free CNDs as effective co-catalysts provides a crucial foundation for interface engineering of g-C 3 N 4 -based semiconductor photocatalysts for diverse applications.We anticipate that this study opens up an interesting area of research in materials science, and demonstrates a new paradigm for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and environmental improvement.

From Eq.(11), the work functions of pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunction were calculated to be 4.66, 5.56, and 5.29 eV, respectively.The difference in work functions between pCN and CND confirmed that the photoinduced electrons were shuttled from pCN to CND when pCN came into contact with CND.The work function of CND (5.56 eV) was higher than that of pCN (4.66 eV), which accounted for the transfer of electrons from pCN to CND until the Fermi energies of the two phases were aligned.As a result, the work function of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction (5.29 eV) was calculated to lie between the work functions of CND and pCN.Hence, the CND accumulated negative charges (electrons), whereas the pCN layer accumulated positive charges (holes).This allowed efficient electron migration and separation across the heterointerface of CND/pCN nanohybrids, which inhibited the electron-hole recombination.This increased the efficiency of the photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 via 2-electron and 8-electron processes, respectively.Overall, the electrostatic potential results were in good agreement with the frontier electron orbital analyses presented in Figs.11(a) and Nano Res. 4 and CO.The detailed reaction equations are given in Eqs.(12)-(15) CND/pCN h CND (e -) pCN (h ) -) CO 2 2H CND CO H 2 O (14) CND (8e -) CO 2 8H CND CH 4 2H 2 O (15) Figure 14 Charge transfer and separation in the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 using CND/pCN samples under visible-light or simulated solar irradiation.

Nano Res. the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO in the presence of H 2 O vapor.The photocatalyst was synthesized via the electrostatically driven assembly of negatively charged CNDs and positively charged pCN.Our investigations revealed that the integration of pCN with highly conductive CNDs significantly influenced the photocatalytic performance, compared to that of pure pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample (3 wt. of CNDs) gave the highest total evolutions of CH 4 (29.23 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (58.82 molg catalyst -1 ) under visible light irradiation after 10 h of reaction.These amounts were ca.3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than those generated with pCN.Similarly, the maximum total productions of CH 4 (37.06 molg catalyst -1 ) and CO (68.80 molg catalyst -1 ), under simulated solar light irradiation for 10 h, were also achieved by CND/pCN-3.Of all the samples tested, the CND/pCN-3 had the lowest PL decay lifetime (3.87 ns) and the highest electron transfer rate constant (1.10 10 8 s -1 ), which agreed well with our photocatalytic results.The significantly increased photoactivity of CND/pCN-3, relative to pure pCN, was attributed to (1) improved electrical conductivity, (2) rapid interfacial electron transfer from pCN to CNDs via a well-formed heterointerface, and (3) a reduction in the electron-hole recombination rate.This was determined through a combination of experimental results (e.g., transient photocurrent responses, EIS Nyquist diagrams, Mott-Schottky plots, steady state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy) and DFT computational calculations.Based on the DFT results, we determined that the photogenerated electrons promptly migrated from pCN to a CND, which functioned as an electron reservoir, as shown by the comparatively smaller work function of pCN (4.66 eV) than of CNDs (5.56 eV).Overall, the use of metal-free CNDs as effective co-catalysts provides a crucial foundation for interface engineering of g-C 3 N 4 -based semiconductor photocatalysts for diverse applications.We anticipate that this study opens up an interesting area of research in materials science, and demonstrates a new paradigm for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and environmental improvement.

The surface morphologies of pCN, CNDs, and CND/ pCN-3 were investigated using TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 2).As shown in Fig. 2(a), delaminated pCN had 2D laminar and loose mesh morphologies with many in-plane pores several nanometers in diameter.Additionally, chiffon-like curled wrinkles were found at the edges of pCN nanosheets.These were formed because of decreases in the surface energy, due to the successful delamination of bulk g-C 3 N 4 into sheet- Nano Res.like structures.Additionally, the delaminated pCN suspension showed the Tyndall effect (inset of Fig. 2(a)), demonstrating the colloidal nature of highly dispersed pCN in water.The thinness of the pCN nanosheets reduces the distance for charge migration, and thus retards charge recombination.Their relatively large surface areas, of hundreds of nanometers in length, are favorable for the deposition of various compounds of different sizes and form effective heterointerfaces for charge transfer.Further evidence is provided in our previous studies, in which we hybridized conjugated g-C 3 N 4 with other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as 2D graphene, in pursuit of a highly efficient interfacial charge transfer process 18,44. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the CNDs were dispersed in a uniform manner, without significant agglomeration of the nanoparticles.The HRTEM image of the CNDs shows their amorphous outer surfaces and crystalline interiors.After a year of storage, the CND solution remained homogenous, light-brown, with no precipi-tation (Fig. 2(b1)).This indicates that the CNDs were efficiently dispersed in H 2 O, as a result of oxygen functional groups on their surfaces.This will be discussed further in the discussion of FTIR spectra.The presence of the Tyndall effect provided further evidence for the efficient dispersal of the CNDs.The Tyndall effect was observed when red laser light was passed through the CND solution (Fig. 2(b2)).Upon coupling with pCN, CNDs with an average diameter of 4.4 nm were uniformly deposited on the edges and surfaces of pCN nanosheets.This resulted in the formation of nanoislands with intact bonding, as shown in TEM and HRTEM images (Figs.2(c) and 2(d)).The HRTEM image (Fig. 2(d)) clearly shows lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (100) plane of graphitic carbon 54,55.These fringes confirm the successful development of interfacial contact between pCN and CNDs via electrostatic attraction, which is of fundamental importance for the migration of electrons in photocatalysis.56.This demonstrates that pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN possess comparable crystal structures, despite dissimilar surface charges.Meanwhile, CNDs showed a broad diffraction peak centered at ca. 23, which originated from a highly disordered graphitic carbon phase 57,58.The XRD spectra of all the CND/pCN samples showed patterns to those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.This indicates that the structural integrity of pCN remained intact when loaded with CNDs, allowing the modulation of its optical properties.No distinct characteristic CND peak was present in the spectra of any of the CND/pCN nanohybrids, owing to the comparatively low diffraction intensity and the fine dispersion of CNDs over the pCN substrates.This was in good agreement with other recent studies of CND/TiO 2 59 and CND/BiOBr 60. The chemical structure of the CND/pCN hybrid nanocomposites was determined by FTIR, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN (Fig. 3(a)).The FTIR spectrum of CNDs (Fig. 3(a1)) indicated the presence of various oxygen-containing functional groups: C-O (ca.1,000-1,400 cm -1 ), C-O-C (ca.1,200 cm -1 ), -COOH (ca.1,358 cm -1 ), and CO (ca.1,705 cm -1 ) 57,61,62.These groups were introduced at the basal planes and edges of the CNDs.By taking advantage of these abundant hydrophilic groups, the dispersibility and stability of CNDs in the water was enhanced, as previously discussed (Fig. 2(b1)).In addition to oxygen-containing groups, the stretching vibration of C-H bonds was evidenced by the absorption band at 2,915 cm -1 63.The absorption peak at ca. 1,610 cm -1 was assigned to CC vibration 61.No significant variations in these characteristic peaks were detected in any of the CND/pCN samples, in comparison to the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN samples (Figs.3(a2)-3(a7)).This suggests that there were no substantial changes to the basic framework of pCN when it was hybridized with CNDs.The broad absorption peak from 3,000-3,800 cm -1 was attributed to the vibrational modes of N-H and O-H groups 64.The presence of these functional groups is accounted for by the presence of adsorbed hydroxyl species and free amino groups in the samples.Additionally, the presence of aromatic C-N and CN heterocycles was confirmed by a number of strong absorption peaks from 1,200 to 1,700 cm -1 , located at 1,630, 1,565, 1,415, 1,330, and 1,250 cm -1 , assigned to their skeletal stretching modes 36,65.Furthermore, the breathing mode of tri-striazine was clearly visible at ca. 812 cm -1 in all g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and CND/pCN sample spectra 42.After the hybridization of pCN with CNDs, a slight shift toward a lower wavenumber was observed in the characteristic peaks of the CND/pCN samples, from 1,255 to 1,250 cm -1 and 812 to 806 cm -1 .This indicates that interactions between the \"nitrogen pots\" of pCN and CNDs were initiated by electrostatic attraction 66.These interactions weakened the C-N bonds, Nano Res.increasing their length, which was commensurate with the TEM results (Fig. 2).There were no additional bands evident in the FTIR spectra due to impurities in the CND/pCN nanocomposites.This was in agreement with the XRD results (Fig. S6 in the ESM), verifying that no impurities were added during the fabrication of CND/pCN. The degree of graphitization in CNDs was further evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3(b)).The Raman spectrum of the CNDs (Fig. 3(b1)) exhibited two characteristic bands, the D-band (ca.1,360 cm -1 ) and the G-band (ca.1,590 cm -1 ).These bands confirm the successful synthesis of CNDs from glucose.The intensity ratio of the D-band to the G-band, I D /I G , is used to characterize the disorder level in graphitic carbon.The I D /I G ratio of the CNDs synthesized in this study was calculated to be 0.62.These results indicated that the CNDs had a partially amorphous external surface along with crystallized, sp 2 , core characteristics, which was in agreement with the HRTEM image (Fig. 2(b)).In addition, no significant differences in the Raman peaks were evident between any of the CND/pCN samples.This demonstrates that the conjugation of pCN with CNDs had little effect on the chemical skeleton of pCN.The characteristic stretching vibrations of C-N at 461, 585, 710, 750, 975, 1,111, 1,150, 1,235, 1,462, and 1,625 cm -1 were concordant with the FTIR results (Fig. 3(a)), and matched closely with those reported in Refs.42,64,67. To gain insights into the elemental bonding configurations and chemical composition of the CND/ pCN-3 sample relative to pCN, XPS analysis was conducted (Fig. 4).As depicted in Fig. 4 Nano Res.incomplete condensation processes), and positively charged g-C 3 N 4 heterocycles (due to the protonation of HCl), respectively 18,66.The slight shifts in the deconvoluted peaks of the C 1s and N 1 s spectra strongly suggest that coupling interactions exist between CNDs and pCN in the hybrid nanostructures.Additionally, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of CND/pCN-3 can be divided into two dominant peaks, at 531.4 and 533.1 eV (Fig. 4(d)).These originate from the CO and HO-CO groups, respectively 63, signifying the deposition of CNDs onto the pCN substrate.In the pCN sample spectrum, the O 1s peak at 532.1 eV was assigned to the adsorbed CO 2 or H 2 O 18.Overall, the HRTEM, FTIR and XPS results imply that the electrostatic attraction of surface charges and - stacking interactions play pivotal roles in the self-assembly of CND/pCN nanohybrids, giving rise to an effective interfacial contact heterointerface. Figure 5 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples, obtained to investigate their optical properties.Pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN showed an absorption edge at around 440 nm with band gap energies of 2.8 eV, as determined in our previous work 18,43.Then the CNDs were incorporated, there was no significant shift in the onset of the absorption edge relative to that of pure pCN.This implies that the CNDs anchored to the pCN surface act as a conducting electron channel.Similar results have been reported in other studies of CND-based photocatalytic systems 69.The intrinsic charge generation of the CND/pCN hybrid heterojunction arises from the injection of The electronic band structures of the pCN and CND/pCN photocatalysts were determined by EPR analysis at ambient temperature (Fig. 6).Unlike the urea precursor, pure g-C 3 N 4 , pCN, and all the CND/ pCN samples displayed a single Lorentzian line at ca. 3,508 G with a g value of ca.2.0045.This line confirms the presence of unpaired electrons on the carbon atoms of the -conjugated aromatic rings of g-C 3 N 4 56.The Lorentzian line of pCN was slightly enhanced, in comparison with pure g-C 3 N 4 , after the introduction of protons into the g-C 3 N 4 framework (Fig. 6(a)).This was attributed to improved electron mobility and increased delocalization of the system 70.In addition, the intensity of the EPR signal of the CND/pCN samples increased significantly with increasing CND loading (Fig. 6(b)).This phenomenon was due to extensive - coupling between pCN and CNDs in the CND/pCN systems 69.Consequently, spin mobility and charge delocalization were improved in the CND/ pCN samples, resulting in a greater density of charge carriers 71.This will be discussed further in the Mott-Schottky section.Optimization of the electronic properties of the CND/pCN heterojunction interface, to accelerate charge transportation and separation, will be beneficial to the photocatalytic solar energy conversion process. Measurements of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 O vapor were conducted under visible light ( 400 nm) and simulated solar light Nano Res.illumination for a total reaction duration of 10 h (Fig. 7).For all the photocatalysts studied under visible light irradiation, there were two major products produced by the CO 2 reduction, namely CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a of CH 4 and CO, despite the incorporation of protons (H ) into the framework of g-C 3 N 4 .This clearly demonstrated that acidic protonation pretreatment to modify the surface charge of g-C 3 N 4 did not adversely affect the active sites, and thus its CO 2 reduction activity. The hybridization of CNDs had a significant effect on the photoactivity of CND/pCN toward CO 2 reduction.As the CND content increased from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt., a gradual rise in photocatalytic activity for the production of CH 4 and CO was observed (Figs.7(a Moreover, the total amounts of CH 4 and CO produced with CND/pCN-3 were 3.6-and 2.28-times greater than produced using pure pCN (Figs.7(a) and 7(b)).For both pCN and the CND/pCN samples, the total evolution of CO under visible light was greater than that of CH 4 by a factor of 2 to 3.2.Similar observations have also been reported by Wang et al. 66,72.This was attributed to the number of electrons and protons participating in the photoreaction, which kinetically determines the formation of the CO and CH 4 products 73.As shown in Eqs. ( 2) and ( 3), 2e -/2H and 8e -/8H are needed to produce CO and CH 4 , respectively.It is reasonable to infer that a larger quantity of CO was yielded than of CH 4 because fewer electrons and protons take part in the CO 2 reduction reaction that forms CO.Thus, we can conclude that the generation of CO or CH 4 is directly related to the number of free charge carriers present in the chemical reaction. (2) The significantly increased visible-light photoactivity of CND/pCN-3 heterojunction nanocomposites was attributed to the successful retardation of the electronhole recombination rate, in comparison to bare pCN.The AQE of CND/pCN-3 was calculated to be 0.076, using Eq. ( 4) and detailed in our previous reports 8,18,65.It is widely known that CNDs are superior electron-reservoir co-catalysts because of their beneficial electrical properties 47,747576.These properties are akin to other carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes 16,22,77,78. In this study, when the concentration of CNDs CND/pCN was greater than 3 wt., the photocatalytic evolution of CO and CH 4 deteriorated markedly.This was evidenced in the CND/pCN-4 sample, despite its greater optical absorption (Fig. 5) relative to CND/pCN samples with a lower proportion of CNDs.This was because excessive CNDs on the pCN surface caused a reduction in the visible-light absorption of pCN, thus inhibiting the generation of charge carriers.This significantly reduced the quantity of photoinduced electrons transported from pCN to the CNDs.In addition, excessive CNDs deposited on the pCN surface hindered the formation of an efficient heterojunction interface between 0D CNDs and 2D pCN nanosheets, reducing electron transfer from pCN to the CNDs.Similar results have been observed by other research groups 49,52,60.These suggest that determining the optimum concentration of CNDs is vital for the formation of a synergistic heterojunction interface with pCN, and thus favorable photocatalytic performance.The detailed charge carrier dynamics of CND/pCN will be discussed in the later PEC, PL, and DFT sections, and compared with the photocatalytic results. The photoactivities of CNDs and the mechanically combined CND/pCN-3M sample were determined (Figs.7(a that the photocatalytic performance of CNDs was very low for the evolution of both CH 4 and CO (Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)).This indicated that CNDs serve as effective co-catalysts for the CO 2 reduction reaction, rather than functioning as semiconductor photocatalysts themselves.Our results are in accordance with recent reports 69,79, which indicate that pure CNDs demonstrate no photocatalytic activity toward H 2 evolution or CO 2 fixation.Additionally, to emphasize the role of the hybrid heterojunction between CNDs and pCN, the visible-light catalytic activity of CND/ pCN-3M was determined for the evolution of CH 4 (Fig. S9 in the ESM).The experimental results showed that CND/pCN-3M (10.03 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ) had slightly higher activity than pCN (8.05 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), but its photoactivity was markedly lower than CND/pCN-3 (29.23 mol CH 4 g catalyst -1 ), despite containing the same proportion of CNDs.This low activity was a result of the loosely connected heterojunctions in CND/ pCN-3M.This result demonstrates the importance of well-constructed heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs in the hybridized systems. In addition to measurement of the visible-light activities, the performance of the catalysts was measured when activated by simulated solar light.The simulated solar light was generated with a xenon lamp covered by an AM1.5 filter.An AM1.5 filter is the most reliable method to mimic natural sunlight, and hence to determine the feasibility of using the photocatalysts in CO 2 reduction processes under natural light 26.As illustrated in Figs.7(a) and 7(b), the proportion of CNDs is vital in determining the efficiency of the catalytic reactions.A similar trend of catalytic results to those obtained under visible light irradiation was obtained under simulated solar light.The optimum loading of CND was found to be 3 wt.,as in the CND/pCN-3 sample.In the CND/ pCN-3 experiment, 37.06 molg catalyst -1 of CH 4 and 68.80 molg catalyst -1 of CO were produced.These were 2.83-and 2.02-fold increases, respectively, over pure pCN.For all the catalysts tested, the total yields of each product were greater under simulated solar light than under visible light.This was because simulated sunlight contains a small fraction (4) of UV light, which has higher photon energies than visible light.These high-energy photons generate more free charge carriers to take part in the photochemical reactions, which increases the product yields.In summary, the highest CH 4 and CO productions were obtained using CND/pCN-3 (3 wt. of CNDs), under both visible light and simulated solar light illumination after 10 h of reaction. Recyclability, photostability and durability of photocatalysts are important factors in their prolonged utilization in large-scale applications.The time dependence of the rate of CH 4 production, using CND/pCN-3 as a representative photocatalyst, was measured over four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(a) and 8(b)).After four cycles (40 h) of CO 2 photoreduction experiments, the CND/pCN-3 sample retained its catalytic activity for CH 4 evolution.Additionally, there were no noticeable deviations in the chemical structure and phase composition of the CND/pCN-3 after four photoreaction cycles (Figs.8(c) and 8(d)).These results demonstrate the excellent stability of the CND/pCN-3 catalyst. PEC analysis was performed to determine the significance of interfacial interactions, and charge transfer behavior, between pCN and CNDs, on the photoactivity of the CND/pCN hybrid systems.The charge transfer efficiencies of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, and CND/pCN samples were determined by photochronoamperometry measurements.Figure 9(a) shows the photocurrent-time curves for the samples studied, with several on-off cycles of visible light irradiation ( 400 nm).Reproducible and uniform photocurrent responses were obtained for all the working electrodes after six irradiation cycles, indicating that the photocurrent response for each electrode was stable and reversible.For pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN, a low photocurrent density was measured due to the rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs.The photocurrent density steadily increased with increasing CND content (from 0.5 wt. to 3 wt.).However, when the CND content exceeded 3 wt.(in the CND/pCN-4 sample) a slight decrease in the photocurrent density was observed.This was attributed to reduced visible-light activation of pCN as a result of increased CND coverage of the pCN surface.However, the CND/ pCN-4 sample still exhibited a higher photocurrent response than those of pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.The CND/pCN-3 sample demonstrated the highest Nano Res.photocurrent density of all the samples.We concluded that the recombination of charge carriers between pCN and the CND content was inhibited optimally, and thus the separation efficiency of charge carriers at the 0D/2D heterojunction interface was also optimized.The photocurrent in CND/pCN-3 sample showed a four-fold increase compared to the pure pCN sample.The inhibition of charge recombination implies that the 0D/2D heterointerfaces between pCN and CNDs are well-formed, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity of CND/pCN-3. Furthermore, EIS analysis was conducted to provide further data on the charge transfer and separation processes, and to study the electrical conductivity of the photocatalysts 68.The charge transfer resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interface can, in general, be represented by the arc radius of the Nyquist impedance plots 17.Consistent with our transient photocurrent responses (Fig. 9(a)) and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results (Fig. 7), the lowest electron transfer resistance upon visible light irradiation was measured in the CND/pCN-3 sample; evidenced by it having the smallest arc radius in the EIS Nyquist diagram (Fig. S10 in the ESM).This demonstrates that the incorporation of an optimized proportion of CND significantly increases the electrical conductivity of pCN.Hence, this promotes effective interfacial electron transfer at the hetero-nanostructural interface of the CND/pCN-3 sample, by utilizing CNDs as electron storage co-catalysts to improve solar energy conversion. To determine the charge carrier density and band structures of the CND/pCN sample and improve our understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism, electrochemical Mott-Schottky analysis was conducted at frequencies of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 Hz.As shown in Fig. 9(b), both the pCN and CND/pCN-3 samples produced positive slopes, thus demonstrating n-type semiconductor features despite the CND/pCN-3 sample being conjugated with CNDs.A descending gradient was present in the CND/pCN-3 Mott-Schottky plot, in contrast to the plot for pCN.This signifies a higher donor density in the CND/pCN-3 nanohybrids, which results from the improved -conjugation system of CNDs with pCN (as demonstrated by the EPR results in Fig. 6).For n-type semiconductors, the Mott-Schottky equation can be written as Eq. ( 5) 80 where C denotes the space charge capacitance, N D is the density of charge carriers, q is the electronic charge (1.602 10 -19 C), and o refer to the dielectric constant of g-C 3 N 4 (5.25) and permittivity in vacuum (8.85 10 -14 Fcm -2 ), respectively, E and E fb denote the applied potential and flat-band potential, respectively, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The value of E fb is determined by the x-intercept of the linear section of the Mott-Schottky curve.In this instance, the E fb of CND/pCN-3 showed a positive shift toward a smaller E fb value, in comparison with that of pCN.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were measured to be -1.1 and -1.4 V, respectively, vs. Ag/AgCl.The normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential was estimated from the potential relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode according to Eq. ( 6) 81 fb (vs.NHE) fb (pH0, vs. Ag/AgCl) AgCl where the pH of the electrolyte is ca.6.8 and E AgCl is 0.197 V.The E fb values of CND/pCN-3 and pCN were -0.50 and -0.80 V, respectively, vs. NHE.As an approximation, the CB minimum (CBM) of a typical n-type semiconductor is 0.3 V more negative than E fb 82, thus the CBM values of pCN and CND/pCN-3 are -1.1 and -0.8 V, respectively, vs. NHE.Based on the slopes of the Mott-Schottky plots, the density of charge carrier, N D can also be calculated from Eq. ( 7) 82 Using Eq. ( 7), the N D of CND/pCN-3 (1.37 10 22 cm -3 ) was found to be significantly greater than that of pCN (9.37 10 21 cm -3 ).The higher carrier density in the CND/pCN-3 sample was indicative of the greater spatial separation of electrons and holes in the presence of CNDs.This increased separation lowers the charge recombination rate, and increases the photocatalytic efficiency.This phenomenon gives rise to improved charge mobility and electrical conductivity and increases the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.This agrees well with the results of our photocurrent response tests (Fig. 9(a)) and EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. S10 in the ESM).Steady state PL spectroscopy is a powerful analysis tool for determining the nature of the radiative recombination process and charge kinetics of a photocatalyst (Fig. 10(a)) 42.For pCN, an intense, broad, PL emission peak was observed, indicating rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs, through band-band transitions.All of the CND/pCN hybrid photocatalysts showed significantly reduced PL intensities, relative to pCN.This was due to effective interfacial charge separation in the CND/pCN nanohybrids arising from well-formed 0D/2D heterojunction interfaces, which suppressed the charge recombination.Furthermore, the PL signal of CND/pCN-3 was the lowest in intensity, indicating the slowest charge recombination and that the CND concentration in the Nano Res.sample was optimal. TRPL was employed to acquire detailed insights into the lifetime of charge carrier dynamics (Fig. 10(b)).The fluorescence decay curves were fitted using the tri-exponential function: I(t) A 1 exp (-t/ 1 ) A 2 exp (-t/ 2 ) A 3 exp (-t/ 3 ), where A and denote the amplitudes and emission lifetimes of each component.The detailed kinetic parameters for all the photocatalyst used in this study are listed in Table 1.The average lifetime, ave , was calculated using Eq. ( 8), and describes the resultant TRPL features of each sample 83.As summarized in Table 1, when a small proportion (0.5 wt.) of CNDs was introduced onto the pCN surface, the emission lifetime was reduced from 6.72 ns (pCN) to 5.87 ns (CND/pCN-1).Incorporating an optimal concentration of CNDs (3 wt.) reduced the decay lifetime to 3.87 ns (CND/pCN-3); almost 1.7 times shorter than that of pure pCN.The significantly decreased emission lifetime of the CND/pCN-3 sample indicated that the interfacial electron injection from pCN to CNDs was rapid, due to the existence of non-radiative quenching routes.However, proportions CNDs greater that 3 wt.were detrimental to the photoactivity, as indicated by the longer decay lifetime (4.76 ns) of CND/pCN-4, because of the higher recombination rate of the charge carriers.Our TRPL results are in good agreement with the steady state PL analysis (Fig. 10(a)) and the photocatalytic results (Fig. 7). The dynamic charge carrier process was further evaluated by the determination of the electron transfer rate constant (k ET ) and the efficiency of electron transfer ( ET ), as expressed in Eqs. ( 9) and ( 10) 84.We found that the CND/pCN-3 sample had the largest k ET (1.10 10 8 s -1 ) and ET (42.4) of all the photocatalyst samples.This finding provides further evidence for the efficient transportation of photoexcited electrons from pCN to CNDs via an effective heterointerface between pCN and CNDs.This plays a pivotal role in increasing the probability of electrons participating in the photochemical reduction of CO 2 before electronhole recombination occurs.The PEC, steady state PL and TRPL results, all indicate that the CND/pCN-3 ave ET ave To This suggests that the photoexcitation of electrons was possible when the photon energy was sufficient to overcome the band gap between the HOMO and the LUMO.Using this information, we propose that the excitation process in a partially ionized system occurs as follows.Firstly, electrons in the pCN were photoexcited and moved into the LUMO, correspondingly, the generation of holes took place in the HOMO of pCN.The energy level of the HOMO in pCN was lower than that of the CND HOMO, so, in the second stage, the migration of the HOMO electron from the CND to the pCN occurred before combining with a hole (Fig. 11(c)).When this occurred, the net charge was shared across the carbon lattice, rather than being localized on the CND.Consequently, the net positive and negative charges induced an internal electric field, directed from pCN to CND.Furthermore, the internal electric field at the interface produced a force on the holes and electrons, in the opposite direction to the diffusion force.At thermal equilibrium, both the electric field force and the diffusion force are balanced.This was verified by density of state (DOS) and work function analyses, as discussed below. The total density of state (TDOS) and the partial density of state (PDOS) were calculated for the CND/ pCN heterojunction (Fig. 12).As shown in Fig. 12(a), the lower VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies ranging from -1 to -0.37 eV.The PDOS calculations of CND and pCN exhibited a similar shape, signifying successful bonding of pCN with CND.The upper VBs of the CND/pCN heterojunction had energies in the range of -0.37 to 0 eV.The CND bands made the greatest contribution to the VB maximum (VBM).Conversely, pCN mainly contributed to the sub-sharp closing of the VBM.The VBs of pCN were primarily composed of N 2p, N 2s, and C 2p orbitals, whereas the CBs of pCN were dominated by C 2p and N 2p orbitals (Fig. 12(b)).This agreed well with our previous work 18.Additionally, the DOS of CND consisted of discrete energy levels, which corresponded with the lack of symmetry in the CND structure (Fig. 12(c)).The C 2p and O 2p orbitals made the greatest contribution to the DOS, except in the energy range from 1.5 to 2 eV.From 1.5 to 2 eV, the DOS originated from C 2p and H 1s orbitals.On the basis of this analysis, we concluded that the CND/pCN heterojunction is a typical band alignment structure. The work function, , of a material is an important property, commonly employed as an intrinsic reference for band alignment.It can be defined as follows (Eq.( 11)) 85 E vac -E f (11) where E vac is the vacuum energy of a stationary electron near the surface of the material and E f denotes the ground state electronic structure calculation.The calculated electrostatic potentials for monolayer pCN, CND, and CND/pCN heterojunctions are shown in 11(b).In addition, our first-principles DFT results were consistent with the photocatalytic and PEC experimental measurements. On the basis of the experimental and first-principles DFT computational results, a plausible photocatalytic mechanism of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 and CO under visible light or simulated solar light was proposed (Fig. 14).When the CND/pCN photocatalyst was irradiated by visible light, holes and free electrons were generated in pCN.The electrons were photoexcited from the VB to the CB of pCN, thus leaving holes in the VB of pCN.As a result of the high electron storage capability and electronic conductivity of CNDs, the photoinduced electrons could be easily injected into the CNDs.The photogenerated holes can react with H 2 O to produce protons (H ).It is well established that delocalized -conjugated II 3 bonding is exhibited by CO 2 molecules, leading to the adsorption of CO 2 onto the surface of CNDs, through - conjugation 18.This adsorption causes the destabilization and activation of CO 2 .Thus, the electrons accumulated on the CND surface can successfully reduce CO 2 to CO (E (CO 2 /CO) -0.53V vs. NHE) and CH 4 (E (CO 2 / CH 4 ) -0.24V vs. NHE) via a two electron/two proton pathway and an eight electron/eight proton pathway, respectively 35.The photocatalytic mechanism with simulated solar light illumination is identical; the spatially separated photoinduced electrons and holes enhanced the reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H , to form CH"}], "reaction medium": [], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
