A standard electrodeposition approach was utilized to synthesize BiOI nanoflakes.The detailed experimental procedures referred to the method were reported previously 28 .A 25 mL electroplating solution includes 40 mmol/L Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O (Aldrich), 400 mmol/L KI (Aldrich), and 30 mmol/L lactic acid (Alfa).The pH of the solution was adjusted to 1.7 by using HNO 3 (Aldrich).Then, 10 mL of anhydrous ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) with 0.23 mol/L pbenzoquinone was added into this solution slowly with continuous stirring for a few minutes until reaching a stable pH value.Finally, the pH value of the electroplating solution reached 3.5 with the dropwise addition of HNO 3 . In a typical electrodeposition process, a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate was used as a working electrode (WE), a platinum plate as a counter electrode (CE), and Ag/AgCl (Saturated KCl) electrode as a reference electrode (RE).A two-step cathodic potentiostatic deposition was used to build BiOI.First, BiI 4 -was reduced to Bi during the nucleation step, in which the potential was set to -0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl at room temperature for 15 s.The Bi nanoparticles deposited in the first step were used as the nucleation sites of BiOI.Second, the deposition step was carried out with potential at -0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl at room temperature for 300 s.Under this potential, p-benzoquinone was reduced to hydroquinone, and the local pH value on the WE was increased.The BiOI nanoflakes were deposited on the WE.All these samples were rinsed with DI water and dried at 60 C for 12 h. The BiOI nanoflakes were converted into Bi 2 O 2.33 by an annealing process.The influences of annealing temperature and conversion time have been investigated in previous work 28 .A typical series of temperatures 550, 600, and 650 C (ramp rate 10 C/min) with a fixed time of 20 min were adopted, followed by natural cooling to room temperature within the oven. The CdS nanostructure grew on the Bi 2 O 2.33 using an aqueous solution of 0.02 mol/L CdCl 2 and 0.06 mol/L NH 2 CSNH 2 .The adequate NH 4 Cl aqueous solution was served as an agent to react with CdCl 2 to form Cd(NH 3 ) 4 2 .The pH value of the aqueous solution, placed in a 70 C water bath, was adjusted to 10 using an NH 3 aqueous solution.Then, NH 2 CSNH 2 aqueous solution and as-grown Bi 2 O 2.33 nanoflakes were added into the reaction system.The Cd(NH 3 ) 4 2 slowly released Cd ions, which homogenously covered Bi 2 O 2.33 nanoflakes.The deposition was performed for 15 min under continuous stirring in a beaker to obtain the samples (Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS), cleaned using DI water, and then drying the N 2 followed.In addition, the Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS-0.08heterojunction was prepared by using 0.08 mol/L CdCl 2 in the initial solution without any changes during other steps.The Bi 2 O 2.33 treated in a water bath without any reagent was also prepared and named Bi 2 O 2.33 -70. The grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) was used to characterize the structure of the samples with an incident angle of 1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were measured in the 2 range of 20 -80 by a Philips X' Pert-PRO diffractometer (Cu K 0.154056 nm), operated at 40 kV and 100 mA. The morphologies evolution in various cases was investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM 2100F).The instrument employed for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies was a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD XPS instrument with Al K radiation operated at h 1486.6eV.The energy levels were evaluated by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD).A gas discharge lamp was used for UPS, with helium gas admitted and the He (I) ( hv 21.22 eV) emission line employed.Optical absorption spectra of the samples were performed by a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (HITACHI, U-3900H, Japan) with the FTO substrate as the reference.The hydroxyl radical ( OH) was measured by Photoluminescence (PL, ZLX-PL-I).Typically, a sample piece was dispersed into 20 mL mixed solutions (5 10 4 mol/L terephthalic acid and 0.01 mol/L p-benzoquinone in 3 10 3 mol/L NaOH solution).Then, this system was exposed to a 300 W Xe light for 60 min.Before, during, and after the illumination, the PL spectrum of the solution was recorded every 30 min.The PL intensity can reflect the number of hydroxyl radicals.Additionally, the electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of radicals spin-trapped by reagent 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were examined via a Bruker EMXPLUS spectrometer under 300 W Xe light irradiation with a 420 nm filter. The PEC properties were measured in a three-electrode system equipped with a quartz window to illuminate the sample surface effectively.The electrolyte was 50 mL of 0.25 mol/L Na 2 S and 0.35 mol/L Na 2 SO 3 with a pH of approximately 13.In the PEC characterization step, a 550 W Xenon lamp with an AM 1.5 G filter simulated solar illumination.The incident light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW/cm 2 via a standard silicon solar cell.Moreover, the heterojunction thin-film served as the working electrode.A platinum gauze and an Ag/AgCl (Saturated KCl) were worked as counter and reference electrodes, respectively.The working electrode was exposed to an electrolyte with an actual geometric area of approximately 0.4 cm 2 .All the electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature using an electrochemical workstation (RST5200, Zhengzhou Shiruisi Instrument Technology Co. Ltd., China).The photocurrent was measured with a scan ranging from -0.8 V to 0.8 V (vs.Ag/AgCl).During the electrochemical impedance (EIS) measurements, the amplitude and applied bias were 10 mV and 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively.Incident photonto-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were made in a threeelectrode setup with Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt counter electrode at 10 mV (vs.Ag/AgCl). The photocatalytic sample performance was investigated by reducing CO 2 with H 2 O using a 300 W Xe lamp as an irradiation source under ambient temperature and pressure.A PerfectLight Labsolar-IIIAG was used to characterize the photocatalytic performance.For a typical photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 process, four pieces of as-prepared film samples (0.8 cm 2 /sample) and an appropriate amount of water (5 mL) was added into the quartz glass tube reactor with a diameter of 5 cm.Prior to light irradiation, the reactor was vacuumed for half an hour, with the solution stirred simultaneously.Then, high-purity carbon dioxide gas was inlet to the reactor for half an hour to ensure a pure carbon dioxide environment.This reactor system was laid aside for an hour to obtain an adsorption and desorption equilibrium, and then it was illuminated by using a 300 W Xe lamp for 4 h.Reacted gas (0.25 mL) was withdrawn to check products using GC-9700 every hour before, during, and after the reactions."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction property of BiOI-500, Bi 2 O 2.33 , Bi 2 O 2.33 -70, CdS, and Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS as a function of irradiation time under the illumination of a fullspectrum Xe lamp.", "context": "In conclusion, a direct Z-scheme heterojunction (Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS) was fabricated by synthesis of CdS on the nonstoichiometric Bi 2 O 2.33 nanoflakes rich in oxygen defects.In this work, we performed systematical investigations on the crystal structure, morphology, energy band structure, and photocatalytic performance of Bi 2 O 2.33 , CdS and Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS.Bi 2 O 2.33 exhibited no significant performance of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.CdS showed poor CO 2 reduction ability with a CO yield rate of ca. 0.9 mol/(cm 2 h).In contrast, the photocatalytic ability of Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS was significantly enhanced with a CO yield rate of ca.2.9 mol/(cm 2 h).The reduction selectivity of CO 2 to CO was 94.0.The results suggested that this Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS direct Z-scheme heterojunction exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction, primarily attributed to the excellent photoinduced charge separation and transport efficiency in a direct Z-scheme heterojunction.Moreover, the enhanced photocatalytic performance was associated with the rich oxygen defects caused by nonstoichiometric Bi 2 O 2.33 nanoflakes.

O 2.33 -CdS photocatalytic system were traced by an ESR spin-trapping technique with DMPO under Xe light irradiation.All the experiments were operated in darkness and also in Xe light irradiation duration of 30 min.As shown in Fig. 14 , the intensity of the DMPO- OH and DMPO- O 2 -adducts was negligible in the dark.The intensity of the DMPO- OH and DMPO- O adducts rises with the increase in Xe light illumination duration.ESR signals of DMPO- O 2 -with pure Bi 2 O 2.33 are negligible under the Xe light irradiation.Moreover, ESR signals of DMPO- OH with pure CdS are weak under the Xe light irradiation, which is associated with the VB potential of CdS (1.90 V) and the CB potential of Bi 2 O 2.33 (0.16 V).The OH -/ OH potential (2.80 V) is more positive than the VB potential of CdS (1.90 V).The O 2 / O 2 -potential ( -0.046 V) is more negative than the CB potential of Bi 2 O 2.33 (0.16 V).However, the ESR signals of DMPO- OH and DMPO- O with Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS were enhanced under the Xe light irradiation.

V /O L ratios of Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS and BiOI nanosheets annealed at different temperatures (550, 600 and 650 C).The presence and behaviors of oxygen defects were analyzed by XPS.The O 1 s XPS spectra presented in Fig.7show an asymmetry peak at around 530 eV, which indicates that the O 1 s XPS spectra contain two binding energy components.The binding energy peaks at around 529.5 and 530.7 eV are attributed to lattice oxygen (O L ) Bi-O bonds and the oxygen vacancies (O V ), respectively 27 , 29 , 35 , 36 .The O V /O L sample ratios listed in Table1were calculated based on the peak area.In order to extract the peak area more accurately, two Gaussian peaks were used to fit the experimental data of O 1 s XPS spectra.The ratio O V /O L increases with the increase of annealing temperature.It reaches its maximum of 1.79 at 600 C, then decreases with temperature further increasing to 650 C, implying that the Bi 2 O 2.33 has the highest oxygen vacancy content.The 37ht shift in binding energy for samples can be attributed to heat treatment temperature, substantially influencing the creation of defect levels at O 1 s37.Additionally, the peak attributed to oxygen vacancies of Bi 2 O 2.33 moves to the low bonding energy, which may associate with the produced Bi 2 resulting in the variation of coordination environment of the metal cations.As a result, part of the oxygen vacancies (electrons) are bound by Bi cations, (b) represents the linear extrapolation of Tauc plots for Bi 2 O 2.33 , CdS, and Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS to calculate the optical band gap.The optical band gaps of Bi 2 O 2.33 and CdS were determined to be 2.54 and 2.24 eV, respectively.The reduction of CO 2 was used to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the samples.Fig. 10 gives the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of BiOI-500, Bi 2 O 2.33 , Bi 2 O 2.33 -70, CdS, and Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS under Xe lamp irradiation.BiOI-550 is a composite with Bi 2 O 2.33 and Bi 2 O 3 (as shown in Fig. 502.33 is 6.06.Furthermore, the E CB and E VB values for Bi 2 O 2.33 were estimated to be 0.16 V and 2.96 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).The value of for CdS is 5.19, and the E CB and E VB values for CdS were estimated to be -0.52V and 1.90 V versus NHE.The OH -/ OH position is about 2.80 V50.Therefore, it is impossible to produce OH for CdS since the VB position of CdS is higher than the OH -/ OH position.The generation of OH was used to identify the direct Z-scheme mechanism of Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS heterojunction.The OH -/ OH potential (2.80 V) is more positive than the VB potential of CdS (1.90 V).If the Type-II heterojunction mechanism is correct, the Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS heterojunction cannot produce OH.On the contrary, if the direct Z-scheme mechanism is valid, OH can be detected.Evidently, PL signals of pure Bi 2 O 2.33 and Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS are apparent under the irradiation of Xe light, while that of the pure CdS is relatively weak (as shown in Fig.13 (a)).Moreover, the PL signals of Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS rise rapidly as the illumination time increases (as shown in Fig.13 (b)).Consequently, the weak PL signal in CdS is due to the OH not being produced directly.However, it is derived conversion of O 2 -produced on the conduction band of CdS 51 , 52 .Therefore, the direct Z-scheme mechanism is indirectly supported by the OH probe.In order to evaluate the mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the active superoxide ( O 2 -) and OH radicals in the Bi 2 O 2.33 , CdS, and Bi 2 21ulated electronic parameters from Mott-Schottky plots.ElectrodeSlope(10 10) Electron density, N d ( 10 18 cm -3 ) Flat band, V fb (V vs Ag/AgCl) Bi 2 O 2.33 , and Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS electrodes are all n-type semiconductors54.Furthermore, V fb could be estimated from the X -axis intercept of the linear region in the M-S plot.The V fb values of the CdS, Bi 2 O 2.33 , and Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS electrodes are at approximately -0.83 V, -0.75 V, and -0.87 V (vs.Ag/AgCl at pH 13), respectively.An internal electric field from CdS to Bi 2 O 2.33 is formed at the interface, which is helpful for electrons transfer and the formation of a direct Z-scheme heterojunction.The free electrons flow from Bi 2 O 2.33 to CdS until their flat band potentials are aligned at the same level, when CdS and Bi 2 O 2.33 are in contact21.This result is in agreement with UPS results.In addition, Table2lists the N d value, which can be determined by the slope of the M-S plot using Eq.(6) .Compared with the CdS electrode, a smaller Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS electrode slope suggests a higher carrier concentration and lower charge recombination.

In a typical electrodeposition process, a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate was used as a working electrode (WE), a platinum plate as a counter electrode (CE), and Ag/AgCl (Saturated KCl) electrode as a reference electrode (RE).A two-step cathodic potentiostatic deposition was used to build BiOI.First, BiI 4 -was reduced to Bi during the nucleation step, in which the potential was set to -0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl at room temperature for 15 s.The Bi nanoparticles deposited in the first step were used as the nucleation sites of BiOI.Second, the deposition step was carried out with potential at -0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl at room temperature for 300 s.Under this potential, p-benzoquinone was reduced to hydroquinone, and the local pH value on the WE was increased.The BiOI nanoflakes were deposited on the WE.All these samples were rinsed with DI water and dried at 60 C for 12 h. The BiOI nanoflakes were converted into Bi 2 O 2.33 by an annealing process.The influences of annealing temperature and conversion time have been investigated in previous work 28 .A typical series of temperatures 550, 600, and 650 C (ramp rate 10 C/min) with a fixed time of 20 min were adopted, followed by natural cooling to room temperature within the oven.

The grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) was used to characterize the structure of the samples with an incident angle of 1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were measured in the 2 range of 20 -80 by a Philips X' Pert-PRO diffractometer (Cu K 0.154056 nm), operated at 40 kV and 100 mA. The morphologies evolution in various cases was investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM 2100F).The instrument employed for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies was a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD XPS instrument with Al K radiation operated at h 1486.6eV.The energy levels were evaluated by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD).A gas discharge lamp was used for UPS, with helium gas admitted and the He (I) ( hv 21.22 eV) emission line employed.Optical absorption spectra of the samples were performed by a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (HITACHI, U-3900H, Japan) with the FTO substrate as the reference.The hydroxyl radical ( OH) was measured by Photoluminescence (PL, ZLX-PL-I).Typically, a sample piece was dispersed into 20 mL mixed solutions (5 10 4 mol/L terephthalic acid and 0.01 mol/L p-benzoquinone in 3 10 3 mol/L NaOH solution).Then, this system was exposed to a 300 W Xe light for 60 min.Before, during, and after the illumination, the PL spectrum of the solution was recorded every 30 min.The PL intensity can reflect the number of hydroxyl radicals.Additionally, the electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of radicals spin-trapped by reagent 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were examined via a Bruker EMXPLUS spectrometer under 300 W Xe light irradiation with a 420 nm filter. The PEC properties were measured in a three-electrode system equipped with a quartz window to illuminate the sample surface effectively.The electrolyte was 50 mL of 0.25 mol/L Na 2 S and 0.35 mol/L Na 2 SO 3 with a pH of approximately 13.In the PEC characterization step, a 550 W Xenon lamp with an AM 1.5 G filter simulated solar illumination.The incident light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW/cm 2 via a standard silicon solar cell.Moreover, the heterojunction thin-film served as the working electrode.A platinum gauze and an Ag/AgCl (Saturated KCl) were worked as counter and reference electrodes, respectively.The working electrode was exposed to an electrolyte with an actual geometric area of approximately 0.4 cm 2 .All the electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature using an electrochemical workstation (RST5200, Zhengzhou Shiruisi Instrument Technology Co. Ltd., China).The photocurrent was measured with a scan ranging from -0.8 V to 0.8 V (vs.Ag/AgCl).During the electrochemical impedance (EIS) measurements, the amplitude and applied bias were 10 mV and 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively.Incident photonto-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were made in a threeelectrode setup with Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt counter electrode at 10 mV (vs.Ag/AgCl). The photocatalytic sample performance was investigated by reducing CO 2 with H 2 O using a 300 W Xe lamp as an irradiation source under ambient temperature and pressure.A PerfectLight Labsolar-IIIAG was used to characterize the photocatalytic performance.For a typical photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 process, four pieces of as-prepared film samples (0.8 cm 2 /sample) and an appropriate amount of water (5 mL) was added into the quartz glass tube reactor with a diameter of 5 cm.Prior to light irradiation, the reactor was vacuumed for half an hour, with the solution stirred simultaneously.Then, high-purity carbon dioxide gas was inlet to the reactor for half an hour to ensure a pure carbon dioxide environment.This reactor system was laid aside for an hour to obtain an adsorption and desorption equilibrium, and then it was illuminated by using a 300 W Xe lamp for 4 h.Reacted gas (0.25 mL) was withdrawn to check products using GC-9700 every hour before, during, and after the reactions."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "In order to evaluate the ability of photoinduced carriers, the PEC performance was studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in a three-electrode system.", "context": "The morphology of the as-prepared BiOI nanoflakes is shown in Fig. S1 in Supplementary Information.The nanoflakes were vertically aligned on the FTO glass with tens of nanometers in thickness (as seen in Fig. S1(b)) and a few micrometers in height, as shown in Fig. S1(c).SEM images in Figs.S2,3(a) and 3(b) demonstrated that the sample morphology significantly changed after the annealing process.The annealing temperature influenced this morphology change.The samples maintained the nanoflakes morphology after BiOI nanoflakes were annealed at 550 Cfor 20 min (BiOI-550).However, a higher temperature (650 C) annealing led to the collapse of the nanoflakes.In the annealing procedure, the BiOI is pyrolyzed into Bi 2 O 3 and I 2 , but I 2 immediately sublimates.Furthermore, Bi 2 O 3 decomposes to form nonstoichiometric Bi 2 O 2.33 when BiOI is annealed at an appropriate temperature (600 C) 28 , 29 .After annealing at 600 C, the morphology evolved from nanoflakes into worm-like Bi 2 O 2.33 ( Fig. 3 (a)).The thickness of nanostructure increased from tens of nanometers to a few hundreds of nanometers ( Fig. 3 The nonstoichiometric Bi 2 O 2.33 has higher photocatalytic activity than stoichiometric Bi 2 O 3 because oxygen vacancies greatly affect the PEC properties and play a key role in adjusting the PEC in Fig. S5.The peaks at approximately 160.8 and 162.0 eV are associated with S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 of CdS, respectively 28 , 39 .Moreover, the weak shift of Bi 4f and O 1 s peaks towards lower binding energy for Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS than that of Bi 2 O 2.33 can be associated with the electronic migration and the \"bond\" (oxygen vacancies).The peak shift of S 2p is opposite to those of Bi 4f and O 1 s.The light-harvesting ability of the samples was investigated by UV-visible absorption spectra ( Fig. 9 (a)).As seen in Fig. 9 (a), the absorption band edge of as-prepared Bi 2 O 2.33 is about 450 nm, signifying poor absorption due to the large band gap 28 , 29 .After CdS coating, the Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS composite shows an enhanced absorption.The optical band gap of semiconductor materials can be estimated by Kubelka-Munk function as follows: where is the absorption coefficient, hv is the incident photon energy, n is the power factor of the transition mode, A is a constant called the band tailing parameter, and E g is the optical band gap.The value of n is 2 when both Bi 2 O 2.33 and CdS are the direct band gap semiconductor.Thus, Fig. 9 S6) 28 .The XRD pattern of BiOI nanoflakes annealed at 50 0 C (BiOI-50 0) is shown in Fig. S6.The XRD pattern of BiOI-500 mainly shows the diffraction peaks of Bi 2 O 3 (JCPDS No. 27-0050) with weak diffraction peaks.In order to confirm Bi 2 O 2.33 showing higher photocatalytic activity than that of stoichiometric Bi 2 O 3 , the photocatalytic performance of BiOI-500 was characterized.Evidently, BiOI-500, Bi 2 O 2.33 -70, and Bi 2 O 2.33 presented no significant photocatalytic performance, especially BiOI-500.For CdS, it shows a weaker CO 2 reduction ability with a CO yield rate of ca.0.90 mol/(cm 2 h) (as shown in Fig. 10 (a)).Interestingly, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction ability of Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS heterojunction (CO yield rate of ca. 2.90 mol/(cm 2 h)) was significantly enhanced.The samples showed high selectivity (Bi 2 O 2.33 : 85.8, CdS: 90.1, and Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS: 94.0) for CO 2 reduction to CO (as shown in Fig. S7).As shown in Fig. 10 (b), the CH 4 yield rate is ca.0.02, 0.10, and 0.18 mol/(cm 2 h) for Bi 2 O 2.33 , CdS, and Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS, respectively.The Bi 2 O 2.33 , CdS, and Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS all exhibit high conversion for CO 2 to CO.However, there is still a small difference that the reduction selectivity of CO 2 to CO for Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS demonstrated a slightly stronger than that of Bi 2 O 2.33 and CdS (Fig. S7).As shown in Fig. 11 , there is noticeable activity loss (around 12) in the second recycling step due to the photocorrosion of the CdS shell 43 .The photocorrosion of CdS during the photocatalytic reactions has been pointed out to be a major problem for metal sulfide photocatalysts.Significantly, the CO 2 reduction rate remains constant after the second recycling step, signifying that the composite could partially suppress photocorrosion of CdS, thus exhibiting its stability.The XPS analysis was performed after reducing photocatalytic CO 2 to prove the photocorrosion of CdS and Bi 2 O 2.33 .Fig. S8 displays the high-resolution spectra of Bi 4f and O 1 s of Bi 2 O 2.33 , and Cd 3d and S 2p of CdS before and after photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , respectively.Apparently, the binding energy of S shifts to high binding energy, which can be ascribed to the photocorrosion.The binding energy of Bi and O also shifts to the high binding energy since the photogenerated electrons of the catalyst are consumed for CO 2 reduction, while the holes oxidize the catalyst (especially CdS) during the photocatalytic reaction 43 , 44 . As for CO 2 reduction, assuming that the reaction from CO 2 to CO or CH 4 proceeds: In order to evaluate the charge separation ability of Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS heterojunction, the energy band structures of Bi 2 O 2.33 and CdS were detected by using UPS spectra, as shown in Fig. 12 (a).The Fermi levels ( E F s) of Bi 2 O 2.33 and CdS were found to be 0.75 and 1.88 eV, respectively.The maximum energy level values of the valence band ( E VB ) for Bi 2 O 2.33 and CdS have been determined to be 2.79 and 3.88 eV, respectively.The work functions of Bi 2 O 2.33 and CdS were deduced to be at around 5.05 and 4.02 eV, respectively.It is illustrated by the UV-visible absorption spectra that the band gaps of Bi 2 O 2.33 and CdS are 2.54 and 2.27 eV, respectively.Fig. 12 (b) shows the energy level diagrams of Bi 2 O 2.33 and CdS.Due to the difference in Fermi level, free electrons constantly transfer from one semiconductor to the other until they align at the same level when two types of semiconductors are in contact 21 , 28 .This drives the energy band levels up or down, accompanied by the bent energy band at the interface ( Fig. 12 (c)) 8 , 45 .A space charge region and an internal electric field from CdS ( ) to Bi 2 O 2.33 ( -) are formed at the interface due to the higher E F and E VB of CdS compared with Bi 2 O 2.33 .It is acknowledged that the downward bent band facilitates photoinduced electrons to flow out but suppresses the outflow of photoinduced holes.Conversely, photoinduced holes move along the upward bent band while photoinduced electrons are forbidden 46 .Under illumination, band bending is expected to drive direct recombination between the photoinduced electrons at the Bi 2 O 2.33 conduction band (CB) and the photoinduced holes of the CdS valence band (VB).Therefore, a direct Z-scheme charge transfer process is formed, demonstrating that the effective charge separation ability of Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS heterojunction is beyond other samples. In addition, the energy levels of semiconductors can be calculated by empirical equations as follows 47 : where E CB is the potential of the conduction band (CB), E VB is the potential of the valence band (VB), is the electronegativity of semiconductor, E e is the energy of free electrons vs. hydrogen (4.5 V) 48 , and E g is the optical bandgap.Moreover, can be calculated using the following equation: where a , b , and c are the relative amount of the semiconductor 49 .The value of for Bi These results also agree with that of OH measured by PL, confirming the direct Z-scheme mechanism of the Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS heterojunction. In order to evaluate the ability of photoinduced carriers, the PEC performance was studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in a three-electrode system.Fig. 15 (a) displays the LSV characteristics of CdS, Bi 2 O 2.33 and Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS electrodes in the dark and under simulated sunlight with AM 1.5 G.As expected, the Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS electrode displays the best optoelectronic performance (as seen in Fig. 15 (a)).The bare Bi 2 O 2.33 electrode has a very low photocurrent 0.32 mA/cm 2 at 0.2 V vs .Ag/AgCl.The CdS electrode exhibits a photocurrent of 1.25 mA/cm 2 .The photocur- where e 0 is the elemental charge (1.6 10 -19 C), 0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.85 10 -12 F m -1 ), r is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor (CdS: 11.6, Bi 2 O 2.33 : 18.2).The plots of C S -2 vs. the potential for CdS and Bi 2 O 2.33 -CdS demonstrate that M-S curves are not straight lines ( Fig. 15 (d)), meaning that there is more than one space charge region 53 .The positive slope reveals"}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
