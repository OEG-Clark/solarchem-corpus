The morphology of the samples is investigated in Figs. 3 and4.It is like a carpet with a rough surface, which consists of a large number of TiO 2 nano-wires with high length/diameter ratio.These nano-wires aggregate and intertwine to form a nest-like (or black hole) structure (Figs.3(f) and Fig. 4(b)).The formation of above nano-wire structure depends on the existence of ethylene glycol.It can be regulated by the initial concentration of NaOH employed.As shown in Fig. 3 the diameter of the nest increases with the increasing NaOH concentration, but their stability decreases.The film prepared in 1.0 mol L A 1 NaOH exhibits the best stability, and it is hard to detect from the Ti substrate during the reaction.That is why we choose the film prepared in 1.0 mol L A 1 NaOH for further investigations.In our previous research, TiO 2 nano-sheet film was prepared using Ti sheet at 180 1C in pure NaOH solution 5.In this work, Ti sheet was employed to fabricate TiO 2 nano-wire film with the assistance of ethylene glycol.Tao et al. 28 investigated the reaction between Ti sheet and NaOH; the results showed that Na 2 Ti 2 O 4 (OH) 2 was obtained after the hydrothermal reaction, and H 2 Ti 2 O 5 A H 2 O was formed after the acid-treated process.Finally, TiO 2 was obtained after the heat treatment.Here, ethylene glycol plays an important role in the formation process of TiO 2 nano-wire structure.However, the clear formation process about the nano-wire is not clear yet.The investigations on preparation conditions are underway. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 4(d) that Ag NPs are dispersed uniformly with spherical morphology on the surface of nano-wires, indicating that the microwave-assisted chemical reduction process is an appropriate way to deposit Ag NPs with the help of PVP and DEG.The size of Ag NPs changes from 20 to 50 nm, leading to a broad visible light absorption (see Fig. 7 below).Besides, the existence of Ag is confirmed based on the energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectrum in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 presents the photographs of the samples under natural sunlight.It is apparent that the color of the film changes from gray to dark-brown as the Ag concentration increases.This is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples in Fig. 7(a).All the samples exhibit strong absorption in the ultraviolet region and possess clear absorption edges at around 410 nm.This is attributed to the band-band electron transition absorption of rutile TiO 2 (3.0 eV).Moreover they also show visible light harvesting property, which is different from the absorption of the widely used commercial P25 TiO 2 photocatalyst without visible light response (Fig. 7(b)).The visible light harvesting property of TiO 2 film may be related to its unique nano-wire structures.The incident light can be confined to the space formed by nano-wires and absorbed during the internal transmission processes (Fig. 3(f)), and the nest structures function as 'black holes' to harvest incident light very efficiently.Further investigations are needed to reveal the specific reason. It is worth noting that the visible light absorption of TiO 2 film is remarkably enhanced by deposition of Ag NPs in Fig. 7(a).Ag/TiO 2 composites show a broad absorption in the visible region arising from the SPR-absorption of Ag NPs, indicating that metallic Ag exists in the samples too.The visible light absorption of Ag/TiO 2 NWFs increases with increasing initial concentration of AgNO 3 employed, which should be attributed to the increasing amounts of Ag NPs in the composite films.The absorption of Ag NPs on the films is obtained through subtracting the contribution of pure TiO 2 from that of the corresponding Ag/TiO 2 composites.As shown in Fig. 7(c) the absorption of Ag NPs exhibits a broad response ranging from 400 nm to 500 nm, which is possibly due to the wide size distribution of Ag NPs in Fig. 4(d).It is different from the narrow SPR-absorption of Ag NPs in the solution (Fig. 7(d)), because the SPR-absorption is determined by the nanoparticle size and shape, etc. 17,293031.Thus, it is clear that Ag NPs and TiO 2 NWF are responsive to visible light simultaneously, this overlapped visible light harvesting phenomenon suggests a strong interaction between Ag NPs and TiO 2 NWF and implies that they can work as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst. Fig. 8 presents the PL emission spectra of the samples under excitation at 220 nm.It can be observed that the emission spectra of Ag modified samples appear to be similar to that of pure TiO 2 NWF; the emission peaks around 467 nm and below 400 nm are due to charge transfer transition from Ti 3 to the oxygen anion in a TiO 6 octahedral complex and the free excitation emission of the band gap according to the literatures 32.Fluorescence quenching is observed in the composite film, the signals obviously decreased after Ag deposition, indicating that charge separation is improved effectively.Because the metal work function of Ag (4.6 eV) is higher than that of TiO 2 (4.2 eV) 2, the photoexcited electrons can transfer from TiO 2 to Ag NPs until the Fermi level equilibrium is achieved by forming a Schottky barrier on their contact surface.This electron transfer will reduce the recombination chance of the charge carriers, leading to lower emission intensity 33.Further observations indicate that the emission peak around 377 nm exhibits a blue-shift after Ag deposition, because Ag NPs can adversely work as recombination centers for the electrons and holes 5, inducing new emission, which can affect the emission peak around 377 nm. Photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was firstly conducted on the samples under UV and visible light (4 420 nm).As shown in Fig. 9, pure TiO 2 film has a very low activity with CH 3 OH yield of 0.83 mol cm A 2 after 3 h reaction.Loading of Ag NPs could significantly improve the performance.Ag/TiO 2 NFFs exhibit much higher activities for CO 2 NWF has good visible light absorption (in Fig. 7) and electron transfer abilities (in Fig. 8), the adsorption-desorption of the reactants and the products may be the rate controlling process at the end of the reaction.Further analysis shows that CH 3 OH yield over 0.7 Ag/TiO 2 film is about 8.3 mol cm A 2 after 3 h reaction, which is 10 times higher than that of pure TiO 2 film and the energy efficiency is about 0.012 on the 0.7 Ag/TiO 2 composite. To understand the role of Ag NPs, CO 2 reduction was conducted using pure TiO 2 and 0.7 Ag/TiO 2 composite under UV or visible light irradiation ( 4 420 nm) for 3 h.As shown in Table 1, under UV light irradiation, the CH 3 OH yield over 0.7 Ag/TiO 2 film is 3.8 times higher than that of pure TiO 2 after 3 h reaction, and the corresponding CH 3 OH yield is 2.8 and 0.74 mol cm A 2 , respectively.The electrons of TiO 2 excited under UV light can transfer to the Ag NPs and promote the reaction process, which has been proven by the PL emission spectra in Fig. 8.Under visible light ( 4420 nm) irradiation, CH 3 OH is not observed over pure TiO 2 film because it is inactive under visible light irradiation.However 0.7 Ag/TiO 2 film is active under visible light, and the corresponding CH 3 OH yield can reach 3.0 mol cm A 2 .It results from SPR induced photoexcited electrons in Ag NPs; the above electrons can transfer to the conduction band of TiO 2 , and then react with the adsorbed CO 2 species to form CH 3 OH.The SPR-induced visible light photocatalysis has been proved in the literature too 4,7.The visible light harvesting property of nano-wire structure can enhance the SPR absorption of Ag NPs by capturing the visible light and accelerate the CO 2 reduction process by promoting the SPR induced electrons in Ag NPs. Based on the above analysis the photocatalytic activity enhancement of TiO 2 film should be ascribed to the role of the charge transfer of Ag NPs and visible-light-harvesting ability of Ag/TiO 2 compsite, especially the overlapped visible-lightabsorption between Ag NPs and TiO 2 NWF for its unique nanostructure.The CH 3 OH yield is 2.8 mol cm A 2 after 3 h irradiation under UV light, it can reach 8.3 mol cm A 2 when visible light is added, indicating that visible light irradiation can greatly enhance the activity of TiO 2 due to their overlapped visible-light-harvesting nanostructure.CH 3 OH obtained under UV and visible light irradiations is higher than the sum of CH 3 OH obtained when UV and visible light irradiations are employed separately, indicating the synergetic effect between charge transfer property and overlapped visible light harvesting achieved under UV and visible light irradiation.The overlapped visible light harvesting can provide an energy transfer channel, light captured by TiO 2 can be reused by Ag NPs and SPR effect can be enhanced. A synergetic photocatalytic mechanism is proposed in Fig. 10 and Eqs. ( 3)- (7) to understand the reaction process.First, conduction band electrons in TiO 2 are generated under UV light followed by transferring to Ag NPs.Then the energy of trapped electrons is enhanced by Ag NPs through the SPR effect, making them react with CO 2 more easily.The active valence band holes in TiO 2 can oxidize H 2 O or OH A to form hydroxyl radicals which can release O 2 and H 34.H and active electrons can reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH 35363738.Six e A SPR and four H are required to convert the C 4 in CO 2 to C 2 A in CH 3 OH according to Eq. ( 7): where h vb is the hole in the valance band of TiO 2 ; e A cb is the electron in the conduction band of TiO 2; e A Ag is the electron trapped by Ag NPs and e A SPR is the electron enhanced by SPR effect."}, {"llm generation": "Ag/TiO 2 nano-wire film", "source": "Ag/TiO 2 nano-wire film was prepared by a facile strategy that combines a hydrothermal method and a microwave assisted chemical reduction method.", "context": "Ag/TiO 2 nano-wire film was prepared by a facile strategy that combines a hydrothermal method and a microwave assisted chemical reduction method.The prepared Ag/TiO 2 NWFs exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for photoreduction of CO 2 .The CH 3 OH yield over 0.7 Ag /TiO 2 NWF was much higher than that This study suggests a simple strategy to develop plamonic filmshaped photocatalysts with high efficiency for the utilization of solar light.

The morphology of the samples is investigated in Figs. 3 and4.It is like a carpet with a rough surface, which consists of a large number of TiO 2 nano-wires with high length/diameter ratio.These nano-wires aggregate and intertwine to form a nest-like (or black hole) structure (Figs.3(f) and Fig. 4(b)).The formation of above nano-wire structure depends on the existence of ethylene glycol.It can be regulated by the initial concentration of NaOH employed.As shown in Fig. 3 the diameter of the nest increases with the increasing NaOH concentration, but their stability decreases.The film prepared in 1.0 mol L A 1 NaOH exhibits the best stability, and it is hard to detect from the Ti substrate during the reaction.That is why we choose the film prepared in 1.0 mol L A 1 NaOH for further investigations.In our previous research, TiO 2 nano-sheet film was prepared using Ti sheet at 180 1C in pure NaOH solution 5.In this work, Ti sheet was employed to fabricate TiO 2 nano-wire film with the assistance of ethylene glycol.Tao et al. 28 investigated the reaction between Ti sheet and NaOH; the results showed that Na 2 Ti 2 O 4 (OH) 2 was obtained after the hydrothermal reaction, and H 2 Ti 2 O 5 A H 2 O was formed after the acid-treated process.Finally, TiO 2 was obtained after the heat treatment.Here, ethylene glycol plays an important role in the formation process of TiO 2 nano-wire structure.However, the clear formation process about the nano-wire is not clear yet.The investigations on preparation conditions are underway. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 4(d) that Ag NPs are dispersed uniformly with spherical morphology on the surface of nano-wires, indicating that the microwave-assisted chemical reduction process is an appropriate way to deposit Ag NPs with the help of PVP and DEG.The size of Ag NPs changes from 20 to 50 nm, leading to a broad visible light absorption (see Fig. 7 below).Besides, the existence of Ag is confirmed based on the energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectrum in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 presents the photographs of the samples under natural sunlight.It is apparent that the color of the film changes from gray to dark-brown as the Ag concentration increases.This is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples in Fig. 7(a).All the samples exhibit strong absorption in the ultraviolet region and possess clear absorption edges at around 410 nm.This is attributed to the band-band electron transition absorption of rutile TiO 2 (3.0 eV).Moreover they also show visible light harvesting property, which is different from the absorption of the widely used commercial P25 TiO 2 photocatalyst without visible light response (Fig. 7(b)).The visible light harvesting property of TiO 2 film may be related to its unique nano-wire structures.The incident light can be confined to the space formed by nano-wires and absorbed during the internal transmission processes (Fig. 3(f)), and the nest structures function as 'black holes' to harvest incident light very efficiently.Further investigations are needed to reveal the specific reason. It is worth noting that the visible light absorption of TiO 2 film is remarkably enhanced by deposition of Ag NPs in Fig. 7(a).Ag/TiO 2 composites show a broad absorption in the visible region arising from the SPR-absorption of Ag NPs, indicating that metallic Ag exists in the samples too.The visible light absorption of Ag/TiO 2 NWFs increases with increasing initial concentration of AgNO 3 employed, which should be attributed to the increasing amounts of Ag NPs in the composite films.The absorption of Ag NPs on the films is obtained through subtracting the contribution of pure TiO 2 from that of the corresponding Ag/TiO 2 composites.As shown in Fig. 7(c) the absorption of Ag NPs exhibits a broad response ranging from 400 nm to 500 nm, which is possibly due to the wide size distribution of Ag NPs in Fig. 4(d).It is different from the narrow SPR-absorption of Ag NPs in the solution (Fig. 7(d)), because the SPR-absorption is determined by the nanoparticle size and shape, etc. 17,293031.Thus, it is clear that Ag NPs and TiO 2 NWF are responsive to visible light simultaneously, this overlapped visible light harvesting phenomenon suggests a strong interaction between Ag NPs and TiO 2 NWF and implies that they can work as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst. Fig. 8 presents the PL emission spectra of the samples under excitation at 220 nm.It can be observed that the emission spectra of Ag modified samples appear to be similar to that of pure TiO 2 NWF; the emission peaks around 467 nm and below 400 nm are due to charge transfer transition from Ti 3 to the oxygen anion in a TiO 6 octahedral complex and the free excitation emission of the band gap according to the literatures 32.Fluorescence quenching is observed in the composite film, the signals obviously decreased after Ag deposition, indicating that charge separation is improved effectively.Because the metal work function of Ag (4.6 eV) is higher than that of TiO 2 (4.2 eV) 2, the photoexcited electrons can transfer from TiO 2 to Ag NPs until the Fermi level equilibrium is achieved by forming a Schottky barrier on their contact surface.This electron transfer will reduce the recombination chance of the charge carriers, leading to lower emission intensity 33.Further observations indicate that the emission peak around 377 nm exhibits a blue-shift after Ag deposition, because Ag NPs can adversely work as recombination centers for the electrons and holes 5, inducing new emission, which can affect the emission peak around 377 nm. Photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was firstly conducted on the samples under UV and visible light (4 420 nm).As shown in Fig. 9, pure TiO 2 film has a very low activity with CH 3 OH yield of 0.83 mol cm A 2 after 3 h reaction.Loading of Ag NPs could significantly improve the performance.Ag/TiO 2 NFFs exhibit much higher activities for CO 2 NWF has good visible light absorption (in Fig. 7) and electron transfer abilities (in Fig. 8), the adsorption-desorption of the reactants and the products may be the rate controlling process at the end of the reaction.Further analysis shows that CH 3 OH yield over 0.7 Ag/TiO 2 film is about 8.3 mol cm A 2 after 3 h reaction, which is 10 times higher than that of pure TiO 2 film and the energy efficiency is about 0.012 on the 0.7 Ag/TiO 2 composite. To understand the role of Ag NPs, CO 2 reduction was conducted using pure TiO 2 and 0.7 Ag/TiO 2 composite under UV or visible light irradiation ( 4 420 nm) for 3 h.As shown in Table 1, under UV light irradiation, the CH 3 OH yield over 0.7 Ag/TiO 2 film is 3.8 times higher than that of pure TiO 2 after 3 h reaction, and the corresponding CH 3 OH yield is 2.8 and 0.74 mol cm A 2 , respectively.The electrons of TiO 2 excited under UV light can transfer to the Ag NPs and promote the reaction process, which has been proven by the PL emission spectra in Fig. 8.Under visible light ( 4420 nm) irradiation, CH 3 OH is not observed over pure TiO 2 film because it is inactive under visible light irradiation.However 0.7 Ag/TiO 2 film is active under visible light, and the corresponding CH 3 OH yield can reach 3.0 mol cm A 2 .It results from SPR induced photoexcited electrons in Ag NPs; the above electrons can transfer to the conduction band of TiO 2 , and then react with the adsorbed CO 2 species to form CH 3 OH.The SPR-induced visible light photocatalysis has been proved in the literature too 4,7.The visible light harvesting property of nano-wire structure can enhance the SPR absorption of Ag NPs by capturing the visible light and accelerate the CO 2 reduction process by promoting the SPR induced electrons in Ag NPs. Based on the above analysis the photocatalytic activity enhancement of TiO 2 film should be ascribed to the role of the charge transfer of Ag NPs and visible-light-harvesting ability of Ag/TiO 2 compsite, especially the overlapped visible-lightabsorption between Ag NPs and TiO 2 NWF for its unique nanostructure.The CH 3 OH yield is 2.8 mol cm A 2 after 3 h irradiation under UV light, it can reach 8.3 mol cm A 2 when visible light is added, indicating that visible light irradiation can greatly enhance the activity of TiO 2 due to their overlapped visible-light-harvesting nanostructure.CH 3 OH obtained under UV and visible light irradiations is higher than the sum of CH 3 OH obtained when UV and visible light irradiations are employed separately, indicating the synergetic effect between charge transfer property and overlapped visible light harvesting achieved under UV and visible light irradiation.The overlapped visible light harvesting can provide an energy transfer channel, light captured by TiO 2 can be reused by Ag NPs and SPR effect can be enhanced. A synergetic photocatalytic mechanism is proposed in Fig. 10 and Eqs. ( 3)- (7) to understand the reaction process.First, conduction band electrons in TiO 2 are generated under UV light followed by transferring to Ag NPs.Then the energy of trapped electrons is enhanced by Ag NPs through the SPR effect, making them react with CO 2 more easily.The active valence band holes in TiO 2 can oxidize H 2 O or OH A to form hydroxyl radicals which can release O 2 and H 34.H and active electrons can reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH 35363738.Six e A SPR and four H are required to convert the C 4 in CO 2 to C 2 A in CH 3 OH according to Eq. ( 7): where h vb is the hole in the valance band of TiO 2 ; e A cb is the electron in the conduction band of TiO 2; e A Ag is the electron trapped by Ag NPs and e A SPR is the electron enhanced by SPR effect."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Table 1 CH 3 OH yield under UV irradiation and visible light ( 4 420 nm) irradiation for 3 h respectively.", "context": "Ag/TiO 2 nano-wire film was prepared by a facile strategy that combines a hydrothermal method and a microwave assisted chemical reduction method.The prepared Ag/TiO 2 NWFs exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for photoreduction of CO 2 .The CH 3 OH yield over 0.7 Ag /TiO 2 NWF was much higher than that This study suggests a simple strategy to develop plamonic filmshaped photocatalysts with high efficiency for the utilization of solar light.

nano-wire film (TiO 2 NWF) TiO 2 NWF was obtained via a one-step hydrothermal route using ethylene glycol as the morphology-controlling agent.In detail, titanium sheet (2.1 A 4.2 A 0.5 mm 3 , 99.9 purity) was polished in a mixture solution (HF-HNO 3 -H 2 O14 1:4:5 in v/v) for 15 min followed by ultrasound in water to remove residues.Subsequently, it was sealed in a Teflon vessel containing 25 mL of water, 25 mL of ethylene glycol, and NaOH (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 g) at 180 1C for 24 h.Thereafter it was cleaned with water and acid-treated by immerging in 0.25 wt HCl aqueous solution for 24 h, and then washed with water again.Finally, TiO 2 NWF was obtained by heating the dried sheet at 400 1C for 2 h.Ag/TiO 2 NWFs were obtained by a microwave assisted chemical reduction process inspired by Moon et al. 27.The experimental process is shown in Fig. 1.First, Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30) and NaH 2 PO 2 A H 2 O were dispersed in diethylene glycol (DEG) and stirred vigorously for 4 h to give a transparent solution (solution A).At the same time, AgNO 3 was dissolved in water and kept stirring in dark for use (solution B).Subsequently, appropriate amount of pure H 2 O was added into y mL of solution B (y14 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14) to form 20 mL of solution C and kept stirring for 10 min.Thereafter it was poured into 20 mL of solution A and kept stirring for 20 min to obtain solution D, followed by putting TiO 2 NWF into the above mixture solution.Then, they were exposed to microwave irradiation for 5 min at 140 1C.Finally, Ag/TiO 2 NWF was obtained after washing the sheet with ethanol and water several times.PVP and NaH 2 -PO 2 A H 2 O are used as a capping molecule and reducing agent respectively.The obtained samples were denoted as x Ag/TiO 2 NWF, with x representing the millimolar concentration of Ag in reaction solution.They were labeled as 0.1 Ag/TiO 2 NWF, 0.2 Ag/TiO 2 NWF, 0.3 Ag/TiO 2 NWF, 0.4 Ag/TiO 2 NWF, 0.5 Ag/TiO 2 NWF, 0.6 Ag/TiO 2 NWF and 0.7 Ag/TiO 2 NWF.The detailed information of characterization for the samples is presented in our previous study 5.
