The morphology and macroporous structure of all the samples were investigated by the means of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the typical samples obtained via the GBMR method.All the catalysts possess well-defined 3DOM structures, which are highly ordered and interconnected with one another by small pore windows.The average diameters of 3DOM TiO 2 supports were 300-350 nm, which corresponds to a shrinkage of 22-30 compared with the initial size (450 nm) of PMMA microspheres.The melting of the polymer templates and the sintering of metal oxides might generate this shrinkage.Besides, the next layer was highly visible and three small windows (average open window of 90 5 nm in diameter) in the macropores could be clearly seen.In addition, the crystallite size of 3DOM TiO 2 oxide is about 19.3 nm according to the Scherrer equation and the wall thickness of the 3DOM TiO 2 support is 35 5 nm which is corresponding to ca. 2-3 crystallites.And that the macroporous structure of Au n /TiO 2 materials is similar to that of the 3DOM TiO 2 support.It indicates that the synthesis process of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts via the GBMR method less destroys the 3DOM structure. Fig. 3 shows the TEM and HRTEM images of 3DOM Au 4 /TiO 2 catalysts.The 3DOM structure with overlapped pores can be clearly observed after loading Au nanoparticles.The pore sizes of 3DOM Au 4 /TiO 2 catalysts are 320 20 nm, and the voids are interconnected through open windows of 90 5 nm in diameter, which is in agreement with their SEM observations.The walls of the macroporous samples are crystalline by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (inset in Fig. 3A), which the characteristic SAED rings of the TiO 2 support from inside to outside are indexed as (101), (004), and (200) planes of a tetragonal structure, respectively.It is in accordance with the result of XRD characterization.As shown in Fig. 3B, the Au nanoparticles precipitated on the inner wall of the 3DOM TiO 2 support can also be clearly observed in the HRTEM image, on which all Au particles are highly dispersed and uniform in size.The magnification of Au particles in the inset image of Fig. 3B shows that the spherical gold particles locate on the surface of the TiO 2 support, and the clear lattice fringes were measured to be 2.3 and 1. Fig. 4 shows the representative nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of 3DOM TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 catalysts.It can be noted that a nearly linear correlation between the absorbed volume and relative pressure is observed under the low pressure in the relative pressure (p/p o ) range of 0-0.4,which is attributed to unrestricted monolayer-multilayer adsorption.The isotherms of the samples exhibited a type III isotherm with a type H3 hysteresis loop in the relative pressure p/p o range of 0.8-1.0, a small type H2 hysteresis loop in the relative pressure p/p o range of 0.4-0.8,suggesting the existence of macropores and textural mesopores within the skeletons of macropores.Surface areas and pore volumes of 3DOM TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 catalysts were in the ranges of 36-45 m 2 g -1 and 0.122-0.164cm 3 /g, respectively.In addition, the average size of textural mesopore estimated according to the BJH pore sizes of the samples were in the range of 8-10 nm. XPS analyses were conducted to understand the surface chemical state of Ti, O, and Au in Au/TiO 2 oxides.Fig. 5 shows the Ti 2p, O 1s, and Au 4f XPS spectra of the 3DOM TiO 2 and Au 4 /TiO 2 samples.As shown in Fig. 5A, the binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 in both TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 are about 464.4 and 458.3 eV, respectively.Meanwhile, the presence of Au nanoparticles in composites shows no significant influence on the Ti 2p binding energies.These values, along with the sharp features of Ti 2p XPS spectra, indicate that the cations in pure TiO 2 are all in the Ti 4 state 22.Fig. 5B shows the O 1s XPS spectra and the deconvolution results of all samples.The XPS spectra of O 1s are wide and asymmetric, indicating that at least two kinds of oxygen species are present on the surface, which can be recognized by resolving XPS curves.The O 1s binding energies are located at 529.5, 531.1, and 532.7 eV.The peak with lower binding energy is assigned to lattice oxygen (O 2-) in the metal oxides, the next is ascribed to chemisorbed oxygen or/and bonded oxygen species (O 2 2-or O -), and the third peak at the highest binding energy is due to surface oxygen by hydroxyl species and/or weakly adsorbed oxygen species (O 2 -) on the surface 23,24.When Au NPs were loaded on TiO 2 , the O ads /O latt molar ratio increased remarkably, and the highest O ads /O latt molar ratio was achieved on Au 8 /3DOM TiO 2 .The highest concentration of chemisorbed oxygen for 3DOM Au 8 /TiO 2 catalysts can be attributed to the increasing density of oxygen vacancy.The XPS spectra in the Au 4f region of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 5C.Deconvolution of the Au spectra indicates that both metallic (Au 0 ) and ionic gold species (Au and Au 3 ) are present in supported Au nanoparticle catalysts 25,26.It is deduced that the appearance of ionic gold species (Au and Au 3 ) may be derived from the increased amount of surface active oxygen species (O 2 2-, O -), which is in accordance with results from the O 1s XPS spectra.The chemical state or structural order may be responsible for the catalytic activity of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under visible illumination. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements were performed on 3DOM TiO 2 and Au/TiO 2 catalysts and the results are shown in Fig. 6.For comparison, a commercial titania powers P25 was also measured and plotted in same figure.The spectra (Fig. 6) revealed that the 3DOM TiO 2 catalyst displays a slight red shift of light absorption compared with the commercial P25.The phenomenon may ascribed to its ordered macroporous structure, enlarged surface area, and multiple scattering which enable it to harvest light more efficiently.A shift in the 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalyst, a broad band centered at around 550 nm, caused by the presence of gold nanoparticles, is attributed to Au SPR 27.These bands are the result of collective oscillations of free conduction-band electrons induced by interaction with incident electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength is much higher than the size of the particles.With the increasing of Au loading, the absorbance for visible light enhanced remarkably.This indicates that the photoreduction application might cover the UV and visible light range.The band energy gap of above samples could be calculated by using ( h ) n A(h -E g ), where is the absorption coefficient, A is the parameter that is related to the effective masses associated with the valence and conduction bands, n is 1/2 for a direct transition, h is the absorption energy, and E g is the band gap energy 28.Plotting ( h ) 1/2 versus h based on the spectral response gives the extrapolated intercept corresponding to the E g value, and the results are listed in Table 1.As shown in Table 1, the E g value (2.90 eV) of 3DOM TiO 2 catalysts is smaller than that of commercial P25 (3.10 eV) 29.And with the increasing Au content, the E g value of 3DOM Au n /TiO 2 catalysts decreases, monotonically.The results of this study indicate that 3DOM Au n /TiO 2 catalysts are likely to be a promising photocatalyst for the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under visible illumination. The SPV measurement is a non-destructive and contactless characterization technique, which has been universally applied for the characterization of different semiconductors and the study of charge transfer involved in photo-stimulated surface interactions 30.As we all know, the photovoltaic properties of TiO 2 semiconductor photocatalysts depend on their properties of surface and surface states, which seem to be strongly influenced by metal deposition and surface modification 31.Fig. 7 shows the surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) of all samples.It is obvious that each sample gives a pronounced SPV response band in the range of 300-400 nm, which is assigned to band-band transition of TiO 2 .And after deposition of Au nanoparticles, the SPV response increased, indicating that the introduction of Au nanoparticles are beneficial for the effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs under the UV-light irradiation.Moreover, the enhanced photo-generated charge separation efficiency is conducive to improving the catalytic activity of photoreduction of CO 2 . In order to confirm the photogenerated electron-hole separation and recombination behaviors, the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of different samples excitation at 300 nm were examined, as shown in Fig. 8.It can be observed that all the samples exhibited obvious PL signals with a similar curve shape, suggesting Please cite this article in press as: J.

Fig. 9 shows the production amount (in unit of mol g -1 ) of CH 4 as a function of irradiation time for CO 2 photoreduction.Commercial P25 was selected as the reference catalyst in photoreduction of CO 2 .The products of CO 2 conversion were not detected in the cases without irradiation or photocatalyst, suggesting that hydrocarbon was produced by photocatalytic reactions on the photocatalyst under irradiation.In addition, another background test was also performed using a mixture of pure N 2 and H 2 O vapor as the feed gas with catalysts in the reactor under visible irradiation, and again, no formation of carbon-containing products were observed.It indicates that the conversion products were derived from CO 2 in the As shown in Fig. 9, the CH 4 production amount over the commercial P25 is 8.85 mol g -1 after 480 min light irradiation, while CH 4 production amount of 3DOM TiO 2 catalyst is 11.39 mol g -1 .The photocatalytic performance of 3DOM TiO 2 is slightly better than that of the commercial P25 which could be attributed that the slow photon effect of 3DOM catalysts can improve the lightharvesting efficiency.Furthermore, with an increase in Au content, the photocatalytic activities increased significantly.Among all the studied samples, the 3DOM Au 8 /TiO 2 catalyst presents the highest CH 4 production amount (23.10 mol g -1 ) during 480 min light irradiation, which is the double of the evolution of pure 3DOM TiO 2 .The apparent difference between TiO 2 and Au/TiO 2 can be attributed to a decrease in the recombination ability of the photogenerated charge carriers and an extension of the absorption to visible light caused by the surface plasmons of the Au nanoparticles. In order to understand the reaction process, a synergetic photocatalytic mechanism of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 is proposed and shown in Scheme 1. The photogenerated electrons are generated by the SPR excitation of Au nanoparticles and will be excited to the CB of TiO 2 , leaving positive charges (h ) on Au nanoparticles.The electrons assembled on the CB of TiO 2 would be used for the activation of CO 2 by a one-electron transfer and formation of surface-bound Based on the above analysis the enhanced photocatalytic activity of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts can be ascribed to their unique structure, the role of the charge transfer and visible-lightharvesting ability of Au nanoparticles.Firstly, the slow photon enhancement plays an important role in improving photocatalytic activity 33.The 3DOM nanostructure with a large surface area and porosity makes the reactant diffusion facile into the bulk of catalyst and hence provide fast intraparticle molecular transfer.Secondly, the introduction of Au nanoparticles in composites can effectively extend the spectral response from UV to visible area owing to Au SPR 34,35.At last, the electrons assembled on the CB of TiO 2 and positive charges (h ) gathered on Au nanoparticles.Improved charge separation translates into slower recombination rates and thus increases the efficiency of the process.In conclusion, 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts, which are the combination of both the efficient light harvesting via the 3DOM structure and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes via the gradient potential and heterojunction between TiO 2 and Au nanoparticles, showed excellent performance for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "3D ordered macroporous TiO2-supported Au nanoparticle photocatalysts", "source": "The average crystallite sizes of all the Please cite this article in press as: J.

Fig. 9 shows the production amount (in unit of mol g -1 ) of CH 4 as a function of irradiation time for CO 2 photoreduction.Commercial P25 was selected as the reference catalyst in photoreduction of CO 2 .The products of CO 2 conversion were not detected in the cases without irradiation or photocatalyst, suggesting that hydrocarbon was produced by photocatalytic reactions on the photocatalyst under irradiation.In addition, another background test was also performed using a mixture of pure N 2 and H 2 O vapor as the feed gas with catalysts in the reactor under visible irradiation, and again, no formation of carbon-containing products were observed.It indicates that the conversion products were derived from CO 2 in the As shown in Fig. 9, the CH 4 production amount over the commercial P25 is 8.85 mol g -1 after 480 min light irradiation, while CH 4 production amount of 3DOM TiO 2 catalyst is 11.39 mol g -1 .The photocatalytic performance of 3DOM TiO 2 is slightly better than that of the commercial P25 which could be attributed that the slow photon effect of 3DOM catalysts can improve the lightharvesting efficiency.Furthermore, with an increase in Au content, the photocatalytic activities increased significantly.Among all the studied samples, the 3DOM Au 8 /TiO 2 catalyst presents the highest CH 4 production amount (23.10 mol g -1 ) during 480 min light irradiation, which is the double of the evolution of pure 3DOM TiO 2 .The apparent difference between TiO 2 and Au/TiO 2 can be attributed to a decrease in the recombination ability of the photogenerated charge carriers and an extension of the absorption to visible light caused by the surface plasmons of the Au nanoparticles. In order to understand the reaction process, a synergetic photocatalytic mechanism of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 is proposed and shown in Scheme 1. The photogenerated electrons are generated by the SPR excitation of Au nanoparticles and will be excited to the CB of TiO 2 , leaving positive charges (h ) on Au nanoparticles.The electrons assembled on the CB of TiO 2 would be used for the activation of CO 2 by a one-electron transfer and formation of surface-bound Based on the above analysis the enhanced photocatalytic activity of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts can be ascribed to their unique structure, the role of the charge transfer and visible-lightharvesting ability of Au nanoparticles.Firstly, the slow photon enhancement plays an important role in improving photocatalytic activity 33.The 3DOM nanostructure with a large surface area and porosity makes the reactant diffusion facile into the bulk of catalyst and hence provide fast intraparticle molecular transfer.Secondly, the introduction of Au nanoparticles in composites can effectively extend the spectral response from UV to visible area owing to Au SPR 34,35.At last, the electrons assembled on the CB of TiO 2 and positive charges (h ) gathered on Au nanoparticles.Improved charge separation translates into slower recombination rates and thus increases the efficiency of the process.In conclusion, 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts, which are the combination of both the efficient light harvesting via the 3DOM structure and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes via the gradient potential and heterojunction between TiO 2 and Au nanoparticles, showed excellent performance for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "3DOM Au4/TiO2 catalysts", "source": "Fig. 3 shows the TEM and HRTEM images of 3DOM Au 4 /TiO 2 catalysts.", "context": "To confirm the formation and phase structures of 3DOM TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 catalysts, XRD measurements were carried out and the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1.The diffraction peaks (2) at 25.3, 37.8, 47.9, 53.8, 55.3, and 62.8 can be indexed to the (101), (004), ( 200), (105), (211), and (204) crystal faces of 3DOM TiO 2 with a tetragonal anatase structure (PDF 21-1272), respectively.And the weak diffraction peaks (2) at 27.4 and 36.3 can be indexed to the (110) and (101) crystal faces of 3DOM TiO 2 with a tetragonal rutile structure (PDF 65-0191).It indicates the co-presence of anatase and rutile crystallites for the 3DOM TiO 2 support, which is similar to the phase structure of P25 20.It demonstrates that the presence of Au on the 3DOM TiO 2 surface has not resulted in the change in the crystalline structure of the TiO 2 support.The characteristic diffraction peaks belonging to Au nanoparticles were not detected, which indicates the high dispersion and small size of Au particles on the carriers.The average crystallite sizes of all the Please cite this article in press as: J.

The morphology and macroporous structure of all the samples were investigated by the means of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the typical samples obtained via the GBMR method.All the catalysts possess well-defined 3DOM structures, which are highly ordered and interconnected with one another by small pore windows.The average diameters of 3DOM TiO 2 supports were 300-350 nm, which corresponds to a shrinkage of 22-30 compared with the initial size (450 nm) of PMMA microspheres.The melting of the polymer templates and the sintering of metal oxides might generate this shrinkage.Besides, the next layer was highly visible and three small windows (average open window of 90 5 nm in diameter) in the macropores could be clearly seen.In addition, the crystallite size of 3DOM TiO 2 oxide is about 19.3 nm according to the Scherrer equation and the wall thickness of the 3DOM TiO 2 support is 35 5 nm which is corresponding to ca. 2-3 crystallites.And that the macroporous structure of Au n /TiO 2 materials is similar to that of the 3DOM TiO 2 support.It indicates that the synthesis process of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts via the GBMR method less destroys the 3DOM structure. Fig. 3 shows the TEM and HRTEM images of 3DOM Au 4 /TiO 2 catalysts.The 3DOM structure with overlapped pores can be clearly observed after loading Au nanoparticles.The pore sizes of 3DOM Au 4 /TiO 2 catalysts are 320 20 nm, and the voids are interconnected through open windows of 90 5 nm in diameter, which is in agreement with their SEM observations.The walls of the macroporous samples are crystalline by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (inset in Fig. 3A), which the characteristic SAED rings of the TiO 2 support from inside to outside are indexed as (101), (004), and (200) planes of a tetragonal structure, respectively.It is in accordance with the result of XRD characterization.As shown in Fig. 3B, the Au nanoparticles precipitated on the inner wall of the 3DOM TiO 2 support can also be clearly observed in the HRTEM image, on which all Au particles are highly dispersed and uniform in size.The magnification of Au particles in the inset image of Fig. 3B shows that the spherical gold particles locate on the surface of the TiO 2 support, and the clear lattice fringes were measured to be 2.3 and 1. Fig. 4 shows the representative nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of 3DOM TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 catalysts.It can be noted that a nearly linear correlation between the absorbed volume and relative pressure is observed under the low pressure in the relative pressure (p/p o ) range of 0-0.4,which is attributed to unrestricted monolayer-multilayer adsorption.The isotherms of the samples exhibited a type III isotherm with a type H3 hysteresis loop in the relative pressure p/p o range of 0.8-1.0, a small type H2 hysteresis loop in the relative pressure p/p o range of 0.4-0.8,suggesting the existence of macropores and textural mesopores within the skeletons of macropores.Surface areas and pore volumes of 3DOM TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 catalysts were in the ranges of 36-45 m 2 g -1 and 0.122-0.164cm 3 /g, respectively.In addition, the average size of textural mesopore estimated according to the BJH pore sizes of the samples were in the range of 8-10 nm.

UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements were performed on 3DOM TiO 2 and Au/TiO 2 catalysts and the results are shown in Fig. 6.For comparison, a commercial titania powers P25 was also measured and plotted in same figure.The spectra (Fig. 6) revealed that the 3DOM TiO 2 catalyst displays a slight red shift of light absorption compared with the commercial P25.The phenomenon may ascribed to its ordered macroporous structure, enlarged surface area, and multiple scattering which enable it to harvest light more efficiently.A shift in the 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalyst, a broad band centered at around 550 nm, caused by the presence of gold nanoparticles, is attributed to Au SPR 27.These bands are the result of collective oscillations of free conduction-band electrons induced by interaction with incident electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength is much higher than the size of the particles.With the increasing of Au loading, the absorbance for visible light enhanced remarkably.This indicates that the photoreduction application might cover the UV and visible light range.The band energy gap of above samples could be calculated by using ( h ) n A(h -E g ), where is the absorption coefficient, A is the parameter that is related to the effective masses associated with the valence and conduction bands, n is 1/2 for a direct transition, h is the absorption energy, and E g is the band gap energy 28.Plotting ( h ) 1/2 versus h based on the spectral response gives the extrapolated intercept corresponding to the E g value, and the results are listed in Table 1.As shown in Table 1, the E g value (2.90 eV) of 3DOM TiO 2 catalysts is smaller than that of commercial P25 (3.10 eV) 29.And with the increasing Au content, the E g value of 3DOM Au n /TiO 2 catalysts decreases, monotonically.The results of this study indicate that 3DOM Au n /TiO 2 catalysts are likely to be a promising photocatalyst for the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under visible illumination. The SPV measurement is a non-destructive and contactless characterization technique, which has been universally applied for the characterization of different semiconductors and the study of charge transfer involved in photo-stimulated surface interactions 30.As we all know, the photovoltaic properties of TiO 2 semiconductor photocatalysts depend on their properties of surface and surface states, which seem to be strongly influenced by metal deposition and surface modification 31.Fig. 7 shows the surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) of all samples.It is obvious that each sample gives a pronounced SPV response band in the range of 300-400 nm, which is assigned to band-band transition of TiO 2 .And after deposition of Au nanoparticles, the SPV response increased, indicating that the introduction of Au nanoparticles are beneficial for the effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs under the UV-light irradiation.Moreover, the enhanced photo-generated charge separation efficiency is conducive to improving the catalytic activity of photoreduction of CO 2 .

The photogenerated electrons are generated by the SPR excitation of Au nanoparticles and will be excited to the CB of TiO 2 , leaving positive charges (h ) on Au nanoparticles.The electrons assembled on the CB of TiO 2 would be used for the activation of CO 2 by a one-electron transfer and formation of surface-bound Based on the above analysis the enhanced photocatalytic activity of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts can be ascribed to their unique structure, the role of the charge transfer and visible-lightharvesting ability of Au nanoparticles.Firstly, the slow photon enhancement plays an important role in improving photocatalytic activity 33.The 3DOM nanostructure with a large surface area and porosity makes the reactant diffusion facile into the bulk of catalyst and hence provide fast intraparticle molecular transfer.Secondly, the introduction of Au nanoparticles in composites can effectively extend the spectral response from UV to visible area owing to Au SPR 34,35.At last, the electrons assembled on the CB of TiO 2 and positive charges (h ) gathered on Au nanoparticles.Improved charge separation translates into slower recombination rates and thus increases the efficiency of the process.In conclusion, 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts, which are the combination of both the efficient light harvesting via the 3DOM structure and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes via the gradient potential and heterojunction between TiO 2 and Au nanoparticles, showed excellent performance for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "3DOM Au/TiO2 catalyst", "source": "A shift in the 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalyst, a broad band centered at around 550 nm, caused by the presence of gold nanoparticles, is attributed to Au SPR 27.", "context": "To confirm the formation and phase structures of 3DOM TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 catalysts, XRD measurements were carried out and the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1.The diffraction peaks (2) at 25.3, 37.8, 47.9, 53.8, 55.3, and 62.8 can be indexed to the (101), (004), ( 200), (105), (211), and (204) crystal faces of 3DOM TiO 2 with a tetragonal anatase structure (PDF 21-1272), respectively.And the weak diffraction peaks (2) at 27.4 and 36.3 can be indexed to the (110) and (101) crystal faces of 3DOM TiO 2 with a tetragonal rutile structure (PDF 65-0191).It indicates the co-presence of anatase and rutile crystallites for the 3DOM TiO 2 support, which is similar to the phase structure of P25 20.It demonstrates that the presence of Au on the 3DOM TiO 2 surface has not resulted in the change in the crystalline structure of the TiO 2 support.The characteristic diffraction peaks belonging to Au nanoparticles were not detected, which indicates the high dispersion and small size of Au particles on the carriers.The average crystallite sizes of all the Please cite this article in press as: J.

The morphology and macroporous structure of all the samples were investigated by the means of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the typical samples obtained via the GBMR method.All the catalysts possess well-defined 3DOM structures, which are highly ordered and interconnected with one another by small pore windows.The average diameters of 3DOM TiO 2 supports were 300-350 nm, which corresponds to a shrinkage of 22-30 compared with the initial size (450 nm) of PMMA microspheres.The melting of the polymer templates and the sintering of metal oxides might generate this shrinkage.Besides, the next layer was highly visible and three small windows (average open window of 90 5 nm in diameter) in the macropores could be clearly seen.In addition, the crystallite size of 3DOM TiO 2 oxide is about 19.3 nm according to the Scherrer equation and the wall thickness of the 3DOM TiO 2 support is 35 5 nm which is corresponding to ca. 2-3 crystallites.And that the macroporous structure of Au n /TiO 2 materials is similar to that of the 3DOM TiO 2 support.It indicates that the synthesis process of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts via the GBMR method less destroys the 3DOM structure. Fig. 3 shows the TEM and HRTEM images of 3DOM Au 4 /TiO 2 catalysts.The 3DOM structure with overlapped pores can be clearly observed after loading Au nanoparticles.The pore sizes of 3DOM Au 4 /TiO 2 catalysts are 320 20 nm, and the voids are interconnected through open windows of 90 5 nm in diameter, which is in agreement with their SEM observations.The walls of the macroporous samples are crystalline by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (inset in Fig. 3A), which the characteristic SAED rings of the TiO 2 support from inside to outside are indexed as (101), (004), and (200) planes of a tetragonal structure, respectively.It is in accordance with the result of XRD characterization.As shown in Fig. 3B, the Au nanoparticles precipitated on the inner wall of the 3DOM TiO 2 support can also be clearly observed in the HRTEM image, on which all Au particles are highly dispersed and uniform in size.The magnification of Au particles in the inset image of Fig. 3B shows that the spherical gold particles locate on the surface of the TiO 2 support, and the clear lattice fringes were measured to be 2.3 and 1. Fig. 4 shows the representative nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of 3DOM TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 catalysts.It can be noted that a nearly linear correlation between the absorbed volume and relative pressure is observed under the low pressure in the relative pressure (p/p o ) range of 0-0.4,which is attributed to unrestricted monolayer-multilayer adsorption.The isotherms of the samples exhibited a type III isotherm with a type H3 hysteresis loop in the relative pressure p/p o range of 0.8-1.0, a small type H2 hysteresis loop in the relative pressure p/p o range of 0.4-0.8,suggesting the existence of macropores and textural mesopores within the skeletons of macropores.Surface areas and pore volumes of 3DOM TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 catalysts were in the ranges of 36-45 m 2 g -1 and 0.122-0.164cm 3 /g, respectively.In addition, the average size of textural mesopore estimated according to the BJH pore sizes of the samples were in the range of 8-10 nm. XPS analyses were conducted to understand the surface chemical state of Ti, O, and Au in Au/TiO 2 oxides.Fig. 5 shows the Ti 2p, O 1s, and Au 4f XPS spectra of the 3DOM TiO 2 and Au 4 /TiO 2 samples.As shown in Fig. 5A, the binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 in both TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 are about 464.4 and 458.3 eV, respectively.Meanwhile, the presence of Au nanoparticles in composites shows no significant influence on the Ti 2p binding energies.These values, along with the sharp features of Ti 2p XPS spectra, indicate that the cations in pure TiO 2 are all in the Ti 4 state 22.Fig. 5B shows the O 1s XPS spectra and the deconvolution results of all samples.The XPS spectra of O 1s are wide and asymmetric, indicating that at least two kinds of oxygen species are present on the surface, which can be recognized by resolving XPS curves.The O 1s binding energies are located at 529.5, 531.1, and 532.7 eV.The peak with lower binding energy is assigned to lattice oxygen (O 2-) in the metal oxides, the next is ascribed to chemisorbed oxygen or/and bonded oxygen species (O 2 2-or O -), and the third peak at the highest binding energy is due to surface oxygen by hydroxyl species and/or weakly adsorbed oxygen species (O 2 -) on the surface 23,24.When Au NPs were loaded on TiO 2 , the O ads /O latt molar ratio increased remarkably, and the highest O ads /O latt molar ratio was achieved on Au 8 /3DOM TiO 2 .The highest concentration of chemisorbed oxygen for 3DOM Au 8 /TiO 2 catalysts can be attributed to the increasing density of oxygen vacancy.The XPS spectra in the Au 4f region of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 5C.Deconvolution of the Au spectra indicates that both metallic (Au 0 ) and ionic gold species (Au and Au 3 ) are present in supported Au nanoparticle catalysts 25,26.It is deduced that the appearance of ionic gold species (Au and Au 3 ) may be derived from the increased amount of surface active oxygen species (O 2 2-, O -), which is in accordance with results from the O 1s XPS spectra.The chemical state or structural order may be responsible for the catalytic activity of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under visible illumination. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements were performed on 3DOM TiO 2 and Au/TiO 2 catalysts and the results are shown in Fig. 6.For comparison, a commercial titania powers P25 was also measured and plotted in same figure.The spectra (Fig. 6) revealed that the 3DOM TiO 2 catalyst displays a slight red shift of light absorption compared with the commercial P25.The phenomenon may ascribed to its ordered macroporous structure, enlarged surface area, and multiple scattering which enable it to harvest light more efficiently.A shift in the 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalyst, a broad band centered at around 550 nm, caused by the presence of gold nanoparticles, is attributed to Au SPR 27.These bands are the result of collective oscillations of free conduction-band electrons induced by interaction with incident electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength is much higher than the size of the particles.With the increasing of Au loading, the absorbance for visible light enhanced remarkably.This indicates that the photoreduction application might cover the UV and visible light range.The band energy gap of above samples could be calculated by using ( h ) n A(h -E g ), where is the absorption coefficient, A is the parameter that is related to the effective masses associated with the valence and conduction bands, n is 1/2 for a direct transition, h is the absorption energy, and E g is the band gap energy 28.Plotting ( h ) 1/2 versus h based on the spectral response gives the extrapolated intercept corresponding to the E g value, and the results are listed in Table 1.As shown in Table 1, the E g value (2.90 eV) of 3DOM TiO 2 catalysts is smaller than that of commercial P25 (3.10 eV) 29.And with the increasing Au content, the E g value of 3DOM Au n /TiO 2 catalysts decreases, monotonically.The results of this study indicate that 3DOM Au n /TiO 2 catalysts are likely to be a promising photocatalyst for the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under visible illumination. The SPV measurement is a non-destructive and contactless characterization technique, which has been universally applied for the characterization of different semiconductors and the study of charge transfer involved in photo-stimulated surface interactions 30.As we all know, the photovoltaic properties of TiO 2 semiconductor photocatalysts depend on their properties of surface and surface states, which seem to be strongly influenced by metal deposition and surface modification 31.Fig. 7 shows the surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) of all samples.It is obvious that each sample gives a pronounced SPV response band in the range of 300-400 nm, which is assigned to band-band transition of TiO 2 .And after deposition of Au nanoparticles, the SPV response increased, indicating that the introduction of Au nanoparticles are beneficial for the effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs under the UV-light irradiation.Moreover, the enhanced photo-generated charge separation efficiency is conducive to improving the catalytic activity of photoreduction of CO 2 . In order to confirm the photogenerated electron-hole separation and recombination behaviors, the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of different samples excitation at 300 nm were examined, as shown in Fig. 8.It can be observed that all the samples exhibited obvious PL signals with a similar curve shape, suggesting Please cite this article in press as: J.

The photogenerated electrons are generated by the SPR excitation of Au nanoparticles and will be excited to the CB of TiO 2 , leaving positive charges (h ) on Au nanoparticles.The electrons assembled on the CB of TiO 2 would be used for the activation of CO 2 by a one-electron transfer and formation of surface-bound Based on the above analysis the enhanced photocatalytic activity of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts can be ascribed to their unique structure, the role of the charge transfer and visible-lightharvesting ability of Au nanoparticles.Firstly, the slow photon enhancement plays an important role in improving photocatalytic activity 33.The 3DOM nanostructure with a large surface area and porosity makes the reactant diffusion facile into the bulk of catalyst and hence provide fast intraparticle molecular transfer.Secondly, the introduction of Au nanoparticles in composites can effectively extend the spectral response from UV to visible area owing to Au SPR 34,35.At last, the electrons assembled on the CB of TiO 2 and positive charges (h ) gathered on Au nanoparticles.Improved charge separation translates into slower recombination rates and thus increases the efficiency of the process.In conclusion, 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts, which are the combination of both the efficient light harvesting via the 3DOM structure and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes via the gradient potential and heterojunction between TiO 2 and Au nanoparticles, showed excellent performance for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2 semiconductor photocatalysts", "source": "As we all know, the photovoltaic properties of TiO 2 semiconductor photocatalysts depend on their properties of surface and surface states, which seem to be strongly influenced by metal deposition and surface modification 31.", "context": "To confirm the formation and phase structures of 3DOM TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 catalysts, XRD measurements were carried out and the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1.The diffraction peaks (2) at 25.3, 37.8, 47.9, 53.8, 55.3, and 62.8 can be indexed to the (101), (004), ( 200), (105), (211), and (204) crystal faces of 3DOM TiO 2 with a tetragonal anatase structure (PDF 21-1272), respectively.And the weak diffraction peaks (2) at 27.4 and 36.3 can be indexed to the (110) and (101) crystal faces of 3DOM TiO 2 with a tetragonal rutile structure (PDF 65-0191).It indicates the co-presence of anatase and rutile crystallites for the 3DOM TiO 2 support, which is similar to the phase structure of P25 20.It demonstrates that the presence of Au on the 3DOM TiO 2 surface has not resulted in the change in the crystalline structure of the TiO 2 support.The characteristic diffraction peaks belonging to Au nanoparticles were not detected, which indicates the high dispersion and small size of Au particles on the carriers.The average crystallite sizes of all the Please cite this article in press as: J.

The morphology and macroporous structure of all the samples were investigated by the means of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the typical samples obtained via the GBMR method.All the catalysts possess well-defined 3DOM structures, which are highly ordered and interconnected with one another by small pore windows.The average diameters of 3DOM TiO 2 supports were 300-350 nm, which corresponds to a shrinkage of 22-30 compared with the initial size (450 nm) of PMMA microspheres.The melting of the polymer templates and the sintering of metal oxides might generate this shrinkage.Besides, the next layer was highly visible and three small windows (average open window of 90 5 nm in diameter) in the macropores could be clearly seen.In addition, the crystallite size of 3DOM TiO 2 oxide is about 19.3 nm according to the Scherrer equation and the wall thickness of the 3DOM TiO 2 support is 35 5 nm which is corresponding to ca. 2-3 crystallites.And that the macroporous structure of Au n /TiO 2 materials is similar to that of the 3DOM TiO 2 support.It indicates that the synthesis process of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts via the GBMR method less destroys the 3DOM structure. Fig. 3 shows the TEM and HRTEM images of 3DOM Au 4 /TiO 2 catalysts.The 3DOM structure with overlapped pores can be clearly observed after loading Au nanoparticles.The pore sizes of 3DOM Au 4 /TiO 2 catalysts are 320 20 nm, and the voids are interconnected through open windows of 90 5 nm in diameter, which is in agreement with their SEM observations.The walls of the macroporous samples are crystalline by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (inset in Fig. 3A), which the characteristic SAED rings of the TiO 2 support from inside to outside are indexed as (101), (004), and (200) planes of a tetragonal structure, respectively.It is in accordance with the result of XRD characterization.As shown in Fig. 3B, the Au nanoparticles precipitated on the inner wall of the 3DOM TiO 2 support can also be clearly observed in the HRTEM image, on which all Au particles are highly dispersed and uniform in size.The magnification of Au particles in the inset image of Fig. 3B shows that the spherical gold particles locate on the surface of the TiO 2 support, and the clear lattice fringes were measured to be 2.3 and 1. Fig. 4 shows the representative nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of 3DOM TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 catalysts.It can be noted that a nearly linear correlation between the absorbed volume and relative pressure is observed under the low pressure in the relative pressure (p/p o ) range of 0-0.4,which is attributed to unrestricted monolayer-multilayer adsorption.The isotherms of the samples exhibited a type III isotherm with a type H3 hysteresis loop in the relative pressure p/p o range of 0.8-1.0, a small type H2 hysteresis loop in the relative pressure p/p o range of 0.4-0.8,suggesting the existence of macropores and textural mesopores within the skeletons of macropores.Surface areas and pore volumes of 3DOM TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 catalysts were in the ranges of 36-45 m 2 g -1 and 0.122-0.164cm 3 /g, respectively.In addition, the average size of textural mesopore estimated according to the BJH pore sizes of the samples were in the range of 8-10 nm. XPS analyses were conducted to understand the surface chemical state of Ti, O, and Au in Au/TiO 2 oxides.Fig. 5 shows the Ti 2p, O 1s, and Au 4f XPS spectra of the 3DOM TiO 2 and Au 4 /TiO 2 samples.As shown in Fig. 5A, the binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 in both TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 are about 464.4 and 458.3 eV, respectively.Meanwhile, the presence of Au nanoparticles in composites shows no significant influence on the Ti 2p binding energies.These values, along with the sharp features of Ti 2p XPS spectra, indicate that the cations in pure TiO 2 are all in the Ti 4 state 22.Fig. 5B shows the O 1s XPS spectra and the deconvolution results of all samples.The XPS spectra of O 1s are wide and asymmetric, indicating that at least two kinds of oxygen species are present on the surface, which can be recognized by resolving XPS curves.The O 1s binding energies are located at 529.5, 531.1, and 532.7 eV.The peak with lower binding energy is assigned to lattice oxygen (O 2-) in the metal oxides, the next is ascribed to chemisorbed oxygen or/and bonded oxygen species (O 2 2-or O -), and the third peak at the highest binding energy is due to surface oxygen by hydroxyl species and/or weakly adsorbed oxygen species (O 2 -) on the surface 23,24.When Au NPs were loaded on TiO 2 , the O ads /O latt molar ratio increased remarkably, and the highest O ads /O latt molar ratio was achieved on Au 8 /3DOM TiO 2 .The highest concentration of chemisorbed oxygen for 3DOM Au 8 /TiO 2 catalysts can be attributed to the increasing density of oxygen vacancy.The XPS spectra in the Au 4f region of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 5C.Deconvolution of the Au spectra indicates that both metallic (Au 0 ) and ionic gold species (Au and Au 3 ) are present in supported Au nanoparticle catalysts 25,26.It is deduced that the appearance of ionic gold species (Au and Au 3 ) may be derived from the increased amount of surface active oxygen species (O 2 2-, O -), which is in accordance with results from the O 1s XPS spectra.The chemical state or structural order may be responsible for the catalytic activity of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under visible illumination. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements were performed on 3DOM TiO 2 and Au/TiO 2 catalysts and the results are shown in Fig. 6.For comparison, a commercial titania powers P25 was also measured and plotted in same figure.The spectra (Fig. 6) revealed that the 3DOM TiO 2 catalyst displays a slight red shift of light absorption compared with the commercial P25.The phenomenon may ascribed to its ordered macroporous structure, enlarged surface area, and multiple scattering which enable it to harvest light more efficiently.A shift in the 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalyst, a broad band centered at around 550 nm, caused by the presence of gold nanoparticles, is attributed to Au SPR 27.These bands are the result of collective oscillations of free conduction-band electrons induced by interaction with incident electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength is much higher than the size of the particles.With the increasing of Au loading, the absorbance for visible light enhanced remarkably.This indicates that the photoreduction application might cover the UV and visible light range.The band energy gap of above samples could be calculated by using ( h ) n A(h -E g ), where is the absorption coefficient, A is the parameter that is related to the effective masses associated with the valence and conduction bands, n is 1/2 for a direct transition, h is the absorption energy, and E g is the band gap energy 28.Plotting ( h ) 1/2 versus h based on the spectral response gives the extrapolated intercept corresponding to the E g value, and the results are listed in Table 1.As shown in Table 1, the E g value (2.90 eV) of 3DOM TiO 2 catalysts is smaller than that of commercial P25 (3.10 eV) 29.And with the increasing Au content, the E g value of 3DOM Au n /TiO 2 catalysts decreases, monotonically.The results of this study indicate that 3DOM Au n /TiO 2 catalysts are likely to be a promising photocatalyst for the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under visible illumination. The SPV measurement is a non-destructive and contactless characterization technique, which has been universally applied for the characterization of different semiconductors and the study of charge transfer involved in photo-stimulated surface interactions 30.As we all know, the photovoltaic properties of TiO 2 semiconductor photocatalysts depend on their properties of surface and surface states, which seem to be strongly influenced by metal deposition and surface modification 31.Fig. 7 shows the surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) of all samples.It is obvious that each sample gives a pronounced SPV response band in the range of 300-400 nm, which is assigned to band-band transition of TiO 2 .And after deposition of Au nanoparticles, the SPV response increased, indicating that the introduction of Au nanoparticles are beneficial for the effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs under the UV-light irradiation.Moreover, the enhanced photo-generated charge separation efficiency is conducive to improving the catalytic activity of photoreduction of CO 2 . In order to confirm the photogenerated electron-hole separation and recombination behaviors, the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of different samples excitation at 300 nm were examined, as shown in Fig. 8.It can be observed that all the samples exhibited obvious PL signals with a similar curve shape, suggesting Please cite this article in press as: J.

XPS analyses were conducted to understand the surface chemical state of Ti, O, and Au in Au/TiO 2 oxides.Fig. 5 shows the Ti 2p, O 1s, and Au 4f XPS spectra of the 3DOM TiO 2 and Au 4 /TiO 2 samples.As shown in Fig. 5A, the binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 in both TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 are about 464.4 and 458.3 eV, respectively.Meanwhile, the presence of Au nanoparticles in composites shows no significant influence on the Ti 2p binding energies.These values, along with the sharp features of Ti 2p XPS spectra, indicate that the cations in pure TiO 2 are all in the Ti 4 state 22.Fig. 5B shows the O 1s XPS spectra and the deconvolution results of all samples.The XPS spectra of O 1s are wide and asymmetric, indicating that at least two kinds of oxygen species are present on the surface, which can be recognized by resolving XPS curves.The O 1s binding energies are located at 529.5, 531.1, and 532.7 eV.The peak with lower binding energy is assigned to lattice oxygen (O 2-) in the metal oxides, the next is ascribed to chemisorbed oxygen or/and bonded oxygen species (O 2 2-or O -), and the third peak at the highest binding energy is due to surface oxygen by hydroxyl species and/or weakly adsorbed oxygen species (O 2 -) on the surface 23,24.When Au NPs were loaded on TiO 2 , the O ads /O latt molar ratio increased remarkably, and the highest O ads /O latt molar ratio was achieved on Au 8 /3DOM TiO 2 .The highest concentration of chemisorbed oxygen for 3DOM Au 8 /TiO 2 catalysts can be attributed to the increasing density of oxygen vacancy.The XPS spectra in the Au 4f region of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 5C.Deconvolution of the Au spectra indicates that both metallic (Au 0 ) and ionic gold species (Au and Au 3 ) are present in supported Au nanoparticle catalysts 25,26.It is deduced that the appearance of ionic gold species (Au and Au 3 ) may be derived from the increased amount of surface active oxygen species (O 2 2-, O -), which is in accordance with results from the O 1s XPS spectra.The chemical state or structural order may be responsible for the catalytic activity of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under visible illumination. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements were performed on 3DOM TiO 2 and Au/TiO 2 catalysts and the results are shown in Fig. 6.For comparison, a commercial titania powers P25 was also measured and plotted in same figure.The spectra (Fig. 6) revealed that the 3DOM TiO 2 catalyst displays a slight red shift of light absorption compared with the commercial P25.The phenomenon may ascribed to its ordered macroporous structure, enlarged surface area, and multiple scattering which enable it to harvest light more efficiently.A shift in the 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalyst, a broad band centered at around 550 nm, caused by the presence of gold nanoparticles, is attributed to Au SPR 27.These bands are the result of collective oscillations of free conduction-band electrons induced by interaction with incident electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength is much higher than the size of the particles.With the increasing of Au loading, the absorbance for visible light enhanced remarkably.This indicates that the photoreduction application might cover the UV and visible light range.The band energy gap of above samples could be calculated by using ( h ) n A(h -E g ), where is the absorption coefficient, A is the parameter that is related to the effective masses associated with the valence and conduction bands, n is 1/2 for a direct transition, h is the absorption energy, and E g is the band gap energy 28.Plotting ( h ) 1/2 versus h based on the spectral response gives the extrapolated intercept corresponding to the E g value, and the results are listed in Table 1.As shown in Table 1, the E g value (2.90 eV) of 3DOM TiO 2 catalysts is smaller than that of commercial P25 (3.10 eV) 29.And with the increasing Au content, the E g value of 3DOM Au n /TiO 2 catalysts decreases, monotonically.The results of this study indicate that 3DOM Au n /TiO 2 catalysts are likely to be a promising photocatalyst for the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under visible illumination. The SPV measurement is a non-destructive and contactless characterization technique, which has been universally applied for the characterization of different semiconductors and the study of charge transfer involved in photo-stimulated surface interactions 30.As we all know, the photovoltaic properties of TiO 2 semiconductor photocatalysts depend on their properties of surface and surface states, which seem to be strongly influenced by metal deposition and surface modification 31.Fig. 7 shows the surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) of all samples.It is obvious that each sample gives a pronounced SPV response band in the range of 300-400 nm, which is assigned to band-band transition of TiO 2 .And after deposition of Au nanoparticles, the SPV response increased, indicating that the introduction of Au nanoparticles are beneficial for the effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs under the UV-light irradiation.Moreover, the enhanced photo-generated charge separation efficiency is conducive to improving the catalytic activity of photoreduction of CO 2 . In order to confirm the photogenerated electron-hole separation and recombination behaviors, the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of different samples excitation at 300 nm were examined, as shown in Fig. 8.It can be observed that all the samples exhibited obvious PL signals with a similar curve shape, suggesting Please cite this article in press as: J.

Fig. 9 shows the production amount (in unit of mol g -1 ) of CH 4 as a function of irradiation time for CO 2 photoreduction.Commercial P25 was selected as the reference catalyst in photoreduction of CO 2 .The products of CO 2 conversion were not detected in the cases without irradiation or photocatalyst, suggesting that hydrocarbon was produced by photocatalytic reactions on the photocatalyst under irradiation.In addition, another background test was also performed using a mixture of pure N 2 and H 2 O vapor as the feed gas with catalysts in the reactor under visible irradiation, and again, no formation of carbon-containing products were observed.It indicates that the conversion products were derived from CO 2 in the As shown in Fig. 9, the CH 4 production amount over the commercial P25 is 8.85 mol g -1 after 480 min light irradiation, while CH 4 production amount of 3DOM TiO 2 catalyst is 11.39 mol g -1 .The photocatalytic performance of 3DOM TiO 2 is slightly better than that of the commercial P25 which could be attributed that the slow photon effect of 3DOM catalysts can improve the lightharvesting efficiency.Furthermore, with an increase in Au content, the photocatalytic activities increased significantly.Among all the studied samples, the 3DOM Au 8 /TiO 2 catalyst presents the highest CH 4 production amount (23.10 mol g -1 ) during 480 min light irradiation, which is the double of the evolution of pure 3DOM TiO 2 .The apparent difference between TiO 2 and Au/TiO 2 can be attributed to a decrease in the recombination ability of the photogenerated charge carriers and an extension of the absorption to visible light caused by the surface plasmons of the Au nanoparticles. In order to understand the reaction process, a synergetic photocatalytic mechanism of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 is proposed and shown in Scheme 1. The photogenerated electrons are generated by the SPR excitation of Au nanoparticles and will be excited to the CB of TiO 2 , leaving positive charges (h ) on Au nanoparticles.The electrons assembled on the CB of TiO 2 would be used for the activation of CO 2 by a one-electron transfer and formation of surface-bound Based on the above analysis the enhanced photocatalytic activity of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts can be ascribed to their unique structure, the role of the charge transfer and visible-lightharvesting ability of Au nanoparticles.Firstly, the slow photon enhancement plays an important role in improving photocatalytic activity 33.The 3DOM nanostructure with a large surface area and porosity makes the reactant diffusion facile into the bulk of catalyst and hence provide fast intraparticle molecular transfer.Secondly, the introduction of Au nanoparticles in composites can effectively extend the spectral response from UV to visible area owing to Au SPR 34,35.At last, the electrons assembled on the CB of TiO 2 and positive charges (h ) gathered on Au nanoparticles.Improved charge separation translates into slower recombination rates and thus increases the efficiency of the process.In conclusion, 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts, which are the combination of both the efficient light harvesting via the 3DOM structure and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes via the gradient potential and heterojunction between TiO 2 and Au nanoparticles, showed excellent performance for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "UV, Visible", "source": "Secondly, the introduction of Au nanoparticles in composites can effectively extend the spectral response from UV to visible area owing to Au SPR 34,35.", "context": "To confirm the formation and phase structures of 3DOM TiO 2 and Au n /TiO 2 catalysts, XRD measurements were carried out and the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1.The diffraction peaks (2) at 25.3, 37.8, 47.9, 53.8, 55.3, and 62.8 can be indexed to the (101), (004), ( 200), (105), (211), and (204) crystal faces of 3DOM TiO 2 with a tetragonal anatase structure (PDF 21-1272), respectively.And the weak diffraction peaks (2) at 27.4 and 36.3 can be indexed to the (110) and (101) crystal faces of 3DOM TiO 2 with a tetragonal rutile structure (PDF 65-0191).It indicates the co-presence of anatase and rutile crystallites for the 3DOM TiO 2 support, which is similar to the phase structure of P25 20.It demonstrates that the presence of Au on the 3DOM TiO 2 surface has not resulted in the change in the crystalline structure of the TiO 2 support.The characteristic diffraction peaks belonging to Au nanoparticles were not detected, which indicates the high dispersion and small size of Au particles on the carriers.The average crystallite sizes of all the Please cite this article in press as: J.

The morphology and macroporous structure of all the samples were investigated by the means of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the typical samples obtained via the GBMR method.All the catalysts possess well-defined 3DOM structures, which are highly ordered and interconnected with one another by small pore windows.The average diameters of 3DOM TiO 2 supports were 300-350 nm, which corresponds to a shrinkage of 22-30 compared with the initial size (450 nm) of PMMA microspheres.The melting of the polymer templates and the sintering of metal oxides might generate this shrinkage.Besides, the next layer was highly visible and three small windows (average open window of 90 5 nm in diameter) in the macropores could be clearly seen.In addition, the crystallite size of 3DOM TiO 2 oxide is about 19.3 nm according to the Scherrer equation and the wall thickness of the 3DOM TiO 2 support is 35 5 nm which is corresponding to ca. 2-3 crystallites.And that the macroporous structure of Au n /TiO 2 materials is similar to that of the 3DOM TiO 2 support.It indicates that the synthesis process of 3DOM Au/TiO 2 catalysts via the GBMR method less destroys the 3DOM structure.
