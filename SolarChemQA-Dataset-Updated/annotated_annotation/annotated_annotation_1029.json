The chemical composition and electronic states of the elements in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).The presence of Cd, Zn, S, and Pt was observed in the XPS survey spectrum (Figure 1b).In the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cd (Figure 1c), the spin-orbit states of Cd 3d (3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 ) were located at 404.8 and 411.59 eV, respectively, indicating the presence of divalent Cd. 41 In the Zn 2p spectrum (Figure 1d), the peaks at 1022.3 and 1045.4 eV were ascribed to the spin-orbit states of 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 , respectively, while those at 160.9 and 162.08 eV were ascribed to the spin-orbit states of S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 (Figure 1e), respectively. 42However, the small amount of Pt in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 prevented the clear analysis of the spin-orbit states of Pt (Figure 1f).Nevertheless, the peak for Pt 4f 7/2 at 69.1 eV indicated that Pt retained its metallic nature and thus its high ability to trap photogenerated electrons. 43,44he XPS spectrum of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was compared with those of CdS and CdS/ZnS (Figure S3), indicating the slight red shift in the binding energies.This shift indicated the presence of ZnS and Pt on CdS, because the different electronegativities of Cd, Zn, and Pt influenced the binding energies of Cd and S, 45 which indicated strong interactions between CdS, ZnS, and Pt in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.On the other hand, the binding energy of the Cd 3d peak in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which was lower than CdS and CdS/ZnS, implied that electron transfer processes can be easily activated at the interfaces between CdS/ZnS and Pt.In addition, we performed the XPS analysis of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 after photocatalytic processes for 40 h (Figure S4), which revealed the stability of the catalyst for long-time practical applications under solar light. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 revealed the structure of the CdS nanorod, ZnS shell, and Pt nanoparticles.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image suggested that the nanohybrids were composed of a uniform deposition of Pt nanoparticles on a CdS/ZnS core-shell structure (Figure 2a).Lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 3.36 and 2.25 A were observed (Figure 2b), which could be ascribed to the (002) plane of CdS and the (111) plane of Pt, respectively.In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed the uniform elemental distribution of Cd (Figure 2c), Zn (Figure 2d), S (Figure 2e), and Pt (Figure 2f).We also obtained the TEM image of CdS/ZnS core-shell structure (Figure S5), which clearly showed the formation of uniform ZnS shells around the core of CdS nanorods. The optical absorption of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was investigated using UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).The absorption of the CdS nanorods revealed a steep slope at 520 nm, indicating the direct optical transition of CdS (Figure 3a).The absorption edge of CdS/ZnS slightly shifted to a longer wavelength indicated the reduced band gap and the change in the electronic structure due to the interactions between CdS and ZnS. 35,46However, the absorption edge of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was similar to that of CdS/ZnS, which specified that the incorporation of Pt did not significantly influence the intrinsic electronic structure of CdS/ ZnS.However, the shorter edge of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 than CdS and CdS/ZnS was observed, which evidenced the enhanced light absorption feature of nanohybrid.On the other hand, CdS/ZnS exhibited higher visible light absorption (520 nm) compared to bare CdS, suggesting the sensitization of ZnS for better photoabsorption.Furthermore, CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 exhibited the highest visible light absorption, which could enhance light harvesting and increase photocatalytic efficiency.The direct band gap energies of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 were estimated using Tauc plot (Figure S6), which indicated that band gap energies of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 are 2.39, 2.37, and 2.37 eV, respectively.A slightly reduced band gap was observed with ZnS shells on CdS, indicating changes in the electronic structure of CdS.When CdS/ZnS was further sensitized with Pt, the change in the band gap was not observed.However, the strong sensitization between nanocomposites in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 can lead to the enhanced visible light absorption of the nanocomposite.In addition, we measured UV-vis DRS of ZnS nanocomposite (Figure S7), which indicated the band gap energy of ZnS was 3.43 eV. The dynamics of the photogenerated charge carriers, such as charge separation and recombination, were investigated for CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy upon excitation of 380 nm (Figure 3b).The band gap emission was observed at 520 nm for CdS, with a small Stokes shift.The slightly red-shifted peak at 540 nm was observed with a higher emission intensity for the core-shell structure of CdS/ZnS, which was in line with the slight shift of absorption edge.The type I band alignment between CdS and ZnS enhanced the emission intensity of CdS/ZnS, 35,47 which indicated that the ZnS shell confined the photogenerated charge carriers within CdS.In addition, the ZnS shell passivated nonradiative recombination sites on the surface of CdS.However, the emission intensity was reduced in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which suggested that the incorporation of Pt suppressed the recombination of charge carriers in CdS/ ZnS.Furthermore, the emission peak of ZnS at 420 nm in CdS/ZnS disappeared with the loading of Pt, which confirmed that the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS were efficiently transferred to Pt. 48Thus, the modification of CdS/ZnS core-shell structure with Pt could lead to an enhanced photocatalytic activity under solar light. To further investigate the dynamics of the charge carriers, time profiles of the band gap emission were examined using time-resolved PL spectroscopy (Figure S8).The time profiles could not be fitted by a single-exponential model, indicating the complex relaxation process even in CdS.Indeed, the time profile of CdS was fitted by a triple-exponential model with the average lifetime of 0.19 ns, indicating the rapid deactivation of the charge carriers, although the origin of each component remained for further investigation.The time profile of CdS/ ZnS was also fitted by a triple-exponential model with the slightly longer average lifetime of 0.23 ns.The increased lifetime of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS indicated that the shell structures suppressed nonradiative decay centers, which coincided with the increase in emission intensity.On the other hand, the time profile of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 fitted by a tripleexponential model showed the reduced average lifetime of 0.14 ns, which suggested that charge transfer took place from CdS/ ZnS to Pt.Despite the shorter lifetime, the transferred charge carriers could delay the recombination of electron-hole pairs in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which could enhance the photocatalytic activity of the nanohybrid.In other words, the decrease in the emission intensity, in addition to the shorter lifetime, was indicative of the charge transfer from CdS to Pt, rather than the emissive recombination of the charge carriers in CdS.The efficiency of charge separation was investigated for CdS, CdS/ ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 using photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements.The transient photocurrent of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was higher than that of CdS and CdS/ZnS (Figure 3c), which evidenced the enhanced mobility of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.Moreover, the semicircle diameter in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was the smallest for CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 (Figure 3d), indicating the presence of rapid interfacial charge transfer in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10. 49The impedance results further supported the fast dynamics of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which would be beneficial for the photoreduction of CO 2 into carbon fuel. To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, the reduction reaction of CO 2 was conducted in a Pyrex glass reactor (150 mL) filled with a water-TEOA (2:1) mixture under a solar simulator. 50Carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH 4 ) were the main gaseous products of the CO 2 reduction reaction.The bare CdS nanorods did not effectively reduce CO 2 (Figure 4a), mainly due to the fast recombination of the charges carriers, which led to trace amounts of CO (2.1 molg -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (0.7 molg -1 h -1 ).On the other hand, the reduction rate of CO 2 was enhanced for CdS/ZnS, with the major product of CO.The suppression of nonradiative recombination of the charge carriers in core-shell structures led to the improved photocatalytic activity and stability.However, the CO and CH 4 production rates did not increase with a higher content of ZnS.At the optimal condition of the core-shell structure, the CO and CH 4 production rates with CdS/ZnS were 20 and 10 times higher than bare CdS, respectively.The confinement effect and suppression of defect states in photocatalysts led to the enhanced catalytic activity compared to bare CdS. The deposition of Pt onto CdS/ZnS substantially enhanced the reduction rate of CO 2 (Figure 4b), which was also influenced by the amount of Pt loading. 51Notably, the CO and CH 4 production rates were highest for CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, suggesting that the effective separation of charge carriers to co-catalyst, as revealed by optical properties, led to a higher photocatalytic efficiency.Moreover, enhanced selectivity to CH 4 was observed compared to CdS and CdS/ZnS with Pt loading. 34,525335455 At an optimal Pt loading, the CO and CH 4 production rates with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 were 45 and 47 times higher than the bare CdS, respectively, and 2 and 4 times higher than CdS/ZnS, respectively (Figure 4c).The generation rates of CO and CH 4 with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 for the first 5 h were 82 and 37 molg -1 h -1 , respectively.Indeed, the selectivity of the individual products (H 2 , CO, and CH 4 ) during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes of CdS/ZnS/ Pt-10 changed with irradiation time (Figure 4d).Under the optimized Pt loading, the generation of CO became enhanced under long-time run (20 h).In most of photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction, the photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction often exhibited the selective CO production as a major product by two-electron process, rather than CH 4 formation by eightelectron process. 525335455 In the case of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, the H 2 production rate of 299 molg -1 h -1 was observed for the first 5 h and subsequently suppressed under long-time run (20 h), as shown in Figure S9.The accumulation of intermediates on the surface inhibited the adsorption of water with increasing irradiation time, leading to the suppression of H 2 production process. 54oreover, CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 exhibited long-term stability for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in aqueous conditions.The CO production was maintained to be stable for 42 h, and then a slow decay was observed due to the adsorption of reaction products onto the photocatalytic surface under continuous irradiation (Figure S10).The photocatalytic nature of CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 was additionally evidenced by the control experiments, which were conducted in the absence of light, scavenger, and photocatalyst (Figure S11).The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process was inactive in all control experiments, which confirmed the photocatalytic activity of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.Overall, the noble-metal catalyst Pt effectively extracted the photogenerated electrons confined in CdS and enhanced the photocatalytic process.The quantum efficiency of the CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 is calculated to be 3.5 ( 425 nm). To elucidate the mechanism underlying the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 nanocomposite, the conduction band (CB) potentials were evaluated by Mott-Schottky (MS) analysis (Figure S7).The CB potentials of CdS and ZnS were estimated to be -1.03 and -1.11V (vs E Ag/AgCl ), respectively, which were transformed to the scale of normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) using the equation E NHE E Ag/AgCl 0.197 at pH 7. 55 The CB potentials (vs E NHE ) were calculated to be -0.840 and -0.913 V for CdS and ZnS, respectively, indicating the type I band structure in CdS/ZnS/ Pt-10 nanocomposite.Hence, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction catalyzed by CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 nanohybrid structures is proposed in Scheme 2. Upon absorption of solar light, the electrons are produced in CB of CdS, which is located in the potential level of -0.840 V.The holes are formed in the valence band (VB) of CdS, which is in the potential level of 1.550 V.The reduction of CO 2 to CO requires two electrons with a potential level more negative than -0.53 V, while the reduction to CH 4 needs eight electrons with a potential level of -0.24 V. Thus, the reduction of CO 2 into CO and CH 4 proceeds in CB of CdS, although the efficiency is very low due to the fast recombination of the electron-hole pairs.In a CdS/ ZnS core-shell structure, the ZnS shell suppresses the surfacerelated nonradiative recombination sites of CdS.In addition, the photogenerated electrons in CB of ZnS are transferred to CB of CdS due to the type I band structures in CdS/ZnS, while the holes in VB of ZnS are transferred to VB of CdS.In this regard, the ZnS shell supplies additional charge carriers.Accordingly, the optimal ZnS shell is beneficial to the photocatalytic reduction reaction, with CO and CH 4 production rates using CdS/ZnS being 20 and 10 times higher than bare CdS, respectively. The incorporation of Pt allows efficient electron transfer from CB of CdS to the Fermi level of Pt.Due to the metallic nature of Pt nanoparticles, the transferred electrons can be accumulated in Pt by the Schottky barrier, which are then involved in the reduction reaction of the adsorbed CO 2 species into carbon fuels.Because the potential of Pt is suitable for the reduction potential of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 after Fermi-level equilibration, multiple reduction processes can take place on the Pt nanoparticles.Accordingly, the rates of CO and CH 4 production with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 are enhanced by 50 times compared to bare CdS.Notably, the CO and CH 4 production rates are more than 2-fold higher compared to CdS/ZnS when Pt is incorporated.The holes in VB of CdS, which also include the transferred holes from VB of ZnS, are quenched by TEOA, completing the photocatalytic cycle of CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "CdS/ZnS/Pt-10", "source": "To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, the reduction reaction of CO 2 was conducted in a Pyrex glass reactor (150 mL) filled with a water-TEOA (2:1) mixture under a solar simulator.", "context": "The crystal structures and phases of the nanohybrid composites were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD).The XRD pattern for pristine CdS (Figure 1a) showed lattice planes of (100), ( 002), ( 101), ( 102), ( 110), ( 103), ( 112 (201), ( 202), ( 203), (211), and (105), which were clearly indexed to the crystal planes of hexagonal CdS (JCPDS No. 89-2944).The broad peaks were attributed to the finite size of CdS. 3637738 After modification with ZnS, the diffraction maxima were slightly shifted toward larger angles (Figure S1), which was typically observed in core-shell-like structures. 39,40Only diffraction peaks ascribed to CdS were observed in CdS/ZnS and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, indicating that large domains of ZnS or Pt were not formed.In addition, there was little change in the peak intensity, indicating that the basic structure of CdS was well maintained in CdS/ZnS and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10. 41We also synthesized ZnS with the same method except the addition of CdS to confirm the formation of ZnS without forming ZnO intermediates.The XRD patterns of synthesized ZnS were compared to those of commercially available ZnS and ZnO (Figure S2), which indicated that the peaks related to ZnO were not observed, suggesting that CdS was covered with ZnS.

The deposition of Pt onto CdS/ZnS substantially enhanced the reduction rate of CO 2 (Figure 4b), which was also influenced by the amount of Pt loading. 51Notably, the CO and CH 4 production rates were highest for CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, suggesting that the effective separation of charge carriers to co-catalyst, as revealed by optical properties, led to a higher photocatalytic efficiency.Moreover, enhanced selectivity to CH 4 was observed compared to CdS and CdS/ZnS with Pt loading. 34,525335455 At an optimal Pt loading, the CO and CH 4 production rates with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 were 45 and 47 times higher than the bare CdS, respectively, and 2 and 4 times higher than CdS/ZnS, respectively (Figure 4c).The generation rates of CO and CH 4 with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 for the first 5 h were 82 and 37 molg -1 h -1 , respectively.Indeed, the selectivity of the individual products (H 2 , CO, and CH 4 ) during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes of CdS/ZnS/ Pt-10 changed with irradiation time (Figure 4d).Under the optimized Pt loading, the generation of CO became enhanced under long-time run (20 h).In most of photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction, the photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction often exhibited the selective CO production as a major product by two-electron process, rather than CH 4 formation by eightelectron process. 525335455 In the case of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, the H 2 production rate of 299 molg -1 h -1 was observed for the first 5 h and subsequently suppressed under long-time run (20 h), as shown in Figure S9.The accumulation of intermediates on the surface inhibited the adsorption of water with increasing irradiation time, leading to the suppression of H 2 production process. 54oreover, CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 exhibited long-term stability for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in aqueous conditions.The CO production was maintained to be stable for 42 h, and then a slow decay was observed due to the adsorption of reaction products onto the photocatalytic surface under continuous irradiation (Figure S10).The photocatalytic nature of CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 was additionally evidenced by the control experiments, which were conducted in the absence of light, scavenger, and photocatalyst (Figure S11).The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process was inactive in all control experiments, which confirmed the photocatalytic activity of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.Overall, the noble-metal catalyst Pt effectively extracted the photogenerated electrons confined in CdS and enhanced the photocatalytic process.The quantum efficiency of the CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 is calculated to be 3.5 ( 425 nm). To elucidate the mechanism underlying the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 nanocomposite, the conduction band (CB) potentials were evaluated by Mott-Schottky (MS) analysis (Figure S7).The CB potentials of CdS and ZnS were estimated to be -1.03 and -1.11V (vs E Ag/AgCl ), respectively, which were transformed to the scale of normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) using the equation E NHE E Ag/AgCl 0.197 at pH 7. 55 The CB potentials (vs E NHE ) were calculated to be -0.840 and -0.913 V for CdS and ZnS, respectively, indicating the type I band structure in CdS/ZnS/ Pt-10 nanocomposite.Hence, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction catalyzed by CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 nanohybrid structures is proposed in Scheme 2. Upon absorption of solar light, the electrons are produced in CB of CdS, which is located in the potential level of -0.840 V.The holes are formed in the valence band (VB) of CdS, which is in the potential level of 1.550 V.The reduction of CO 2 to CO requires two electrons with a potential level more negative than -0.53 V, while the reduction to CH 4 needs eight electrons with a potential level of -0.24 V. Thus, the reduction of CO 2 into CO and CH 4 proceeds in CB of CdS, although the efficiency is very low due to the fast recombination of the electron-hole pairs.In a CdS/ ZnS core-shell structure, the ZnS shell suppresses the surfacerelated nonradiative recombination sites of CdS.In addition, the photogenerated electrons in CB of ZnS are transferred to CB of CdS due to the type I band structures in CdS/ZnS, while the holes in VB of ZnS are transferred to VB of CdS.In this regard, the ZnS shell supplies additional charge carriers.Accordingly, the optimal ZnS shell is beneficial to the photocatalytic reduction reaction, with CO and CH 4 production rates using CdS/ZnS being 20 and 10 times higher than bare CdS, respectively. The incorporation of Pt allows efficient electron transfer from CB of CdS to the Fermi level of Pt.Due to the metallic nature of Pt nanoparticles, the transferred electrons can be accumulated in Pt by the Schottky barrier, which are then involved in the reduction reaction of the adsorbed CO 2 species into carbon fuels.Because the potential of Pt is suitable for the reduction potential of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 after Fermi-level equilibration, multiple reduction processes can take place on the Pt nanoparticles.Accordingly, the rates of CO and CH 4 production with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 are enhanced by 50 times compared to bare CdS.Notably, the CO and CH 4 production rates are more than 2-fold higher compared to CdS/ZnS when Pt is incorporated.The holes in VB of CdS, which also include the transferred holes from VB of ZnS, are quenched by TEOA, completing the photocatalytic cycle of CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "CdS", "source": "The bare CdS nanorods did not effectively reduce CO 2 (Figure 4a), mainly due to the fast recombination of the charges carriers, which led to trace amounts of CO (2.1 molg -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (0.7 molg -1 h -1 ).", "context": "The crystal structures and phases of the nanohybrid composites were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD).The XRD pattern for pristine CdS (Figure 1a) showed lattice planes of (100), ( 002), ( 101), ( 102), ( 110), ( 103), ( 112 (201), ( 202), ( 203), (211), and (105), which were clearly indexed to the crystal planes of hexagonal CdS (JCPDS No. 89-2944).The broad peaks were attributed to the finite size of CdS. 3637738 After modification with ZnS, the diffraction maxima were slightly shifted toward larger angles (Figure S1), which was typically observed in core-shell-like structures. 39,40Only diffraction peaks ascribed to CdS were observed in CdS/ZnS and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, indicating that large domains of ZnS or Pt were not formed.In addition, there was little change in the peak intensity, indicating that the basic structure of CdS was well maintained in CdS/ZnS and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10. 41We also synthesized ZnS with the same method except the addition of CdS to confirm the formation of ZnS without forming ZnO intermediates.The XRD patterns of synthesized ZnS were compared to those of commercially available ZnS and ZnO (Figure S2), which indicated that the peaks related to ZnO were not observed, suggesting that CdS was covered with ZnS. The chemical composition and electronic states of the elements in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).The presence of Cd, Zn, S, and Pt was observed in the XPS survey spectrum (Figure 1b).In the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cd (Figure 1c), the spin-orbit states of Cd 3d (3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 ) were located at 404.8 and 411.59 eV, respectively, indicating the presence of divalent Cd. 41 In the Zn 2p spectrum (Figure 1d), the peaks at 1022.3 and 1045.4 eV were ascribed to the spin-orbit states of 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 , respectively, while those at 160.9 and 162.08 eV were ascribed to the spin-orbit states of S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 (Figure 1e), respectively. 42However, the small amount of Pt in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 prevented the clear analysis of the spin-orbit states of Pt (Figure 1f).Nevertheless, the peak for Pt 4f 7/2 at 69.1 eV indicated that Pt retained its metallic nature and thus its high ability to trap photogenerated electrons. 43,44he XPS spectrum of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was compared with those of CdS and CdS/ZnS (Figure S3), indicating the slight red shift in the binding energies.This shift indicated the presence of ZnS and Pt on CdS, because the different electronegativities of Cd, Zn, and Pt influenced the binding energies of Cd and S, 45 which indicated strong interactions between CdS, ZnS, and Pt in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.On the other hand, the binding energy of the Cd 3d peak in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which was lower than CdS and CdS/ZnS, implied that electron transfer processes can be easily activated at the interfaces between CdS/ZnS and Pt.In addition, we performed the XPS analysis of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 after photocatalytic processes for 40 h (Figure S4), which revealed the stability of the catalyst for long-time practical applications under solar light. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 revealed the structure of the CdS nanorod, ZnS shell, and Pt nanoparticles.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image suggested that the nanohybrids were composed of a uniform deposition of Pt nanoparticles on a CdS/ZnS core-shell structure (Figure 2a).Lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 3.36 and 2.25 A were observed (Figure 2b), which could be ascribed to the (002) plane of CdS and the (111) plane of Pt, respectively.In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed the uniform elemental distribution of Cd (Figure 2c), Zn (Figure 2d), S (Figure 2e), and Pt (Figure 2f).We also obtained the TEM image of CdS/ZnS core-shell structure (Figure S5), which clearly showed the formation of uniform ZnS shells around the core of CdS nanorods. The optical absorption of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was investigated using UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).The absorption of the CdS nanorods revealed a steep slope at 520 nm, indicating the direct optical transition of CdS (Figure 3a).The absorption edge of CdS/ZnS slightly shifted to a longer wavelength indicated the reduced band gap and the change in the electronic structure due to the interactions between CdS and ZnS. 35,46However, the absorption edge of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was similar to that of CdS/ZnS, which specified that the incorporation of Pt did not significantly influence the intrinsic electronic structure of CdS/ ZnS.However, the shorter edge of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 than CdS and CdS/ZnS was observed, which evidenced the enhanced light absorption feature of nanohybrid.On the other hand, CdS/ZnS exhibited higher visible light absorption (520 nm) compared to bare CdS, suggesting the sensitization of ZnS for better photoabsorption.Furthermore, CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 exhibited the highest visible light absorption, which could enhance light harvesting and increase photocatalytic efficiency.The direct band gap energies of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 were estimated using Tauc plot (Figure S6), which indicated that band gap energies of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 are 2.39, 2.37, and 2.37 eV, respectively.A slightly reduced band gap was observed with ZnS shells on CdS, indicating changes in the electronic structure of CdS.When CdS/ZnS was further sensitized with Pt, the change in the band gap was not observed.However, the strong sensitization between nanocomposites in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 can lead to the enhanced visible light absorption of the nanocomposite.In addition, we measured UV-vis DRS of ZnS nanocomposite (Figure S7), which indicated the band gap energy of ZnS was 3.43 eV. The dynamics of the photogenerated charge carriers, such as charge separation and recombination, were investigated for CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy upon excitation of 380 nm (Figure 3b).The band gap emission was observed at 520 nm for CdS, with a small Stokes shift.The slightly red-shifted peak at 540 nm was observed with a higher emission intensity for the core-shell structure of CdS/ZnS, which was in line with the slight shift of absorption edge.The type I band alignment between CdS and ZnS enhanced the emission intensity of CdS/ZnS, 35,47 which indicated that the ZnS shell confined the photogenerated charge carriers within CdS.In addition, the ZnS shell passivated nonradiative recombination sites on the surface of CdS.However, the emission intensity was reduced in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which suggested that the incorporation of Pt suppressed the recombination of charge carriers in CdS/ ZnS.Furthermore, the emission peak of ZnS at 420 nm in CdS/ZnS disappeared with the loading of Pt, which confirmed that the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS were efficiently transferred to Pt. 48Thus, the modification of CdS/ZnS core-shell structure with Pt could lead to an enhanced photocatalytic activity under solar light. To further investigate the dynamics of the charge carriers, time profiles of the band gap emission were examined using time-resolved PL spectroscopy (Figure S8).The time profiles could not be fitted by a single-exponential model, indicating the complex relaxation process even in CdS.Indeed, the time profile of CdS was fitted by a triple-exponential model with the average lifetime of 0.19 ns, indicating the rapid deactivation of the charge carriers, although the origin of each component remained for further investigation.The time profile of CdS/ ZnS was also fitted by a triple-exponential model with the slightly longer average lifetime of 0.23 ns.The increased lifetime of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS indicated that the shell structures suppressed nonradiative decay centers, which coincided with the increase in emission intensity.On the other hand, the time profile of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 fitted by a tripleexponential model showed the reduced average lifetime of 0.14 ns, which suggested that charge transfer took place from CdS/ ZnS to Pt.Despite the shorter lifetime, the transferred charge carriers could delay the recombination of electron-hole pairs in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which could enhance the photocatalytic activity of the nanohybrid.In other words, the decrease in the emission intensity, in addition to the shorter lifetime, was indicative of the charge transfer from CdS to Pt, rather than the emissive recombination of the charge carriers in CdS.The efficiency of charge separation was investigated for CdS, CdS/ ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 using photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements.The transient photocurrent of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was higher than that of CdS and CdS/ZnS (Figure 3c), which evidenced the enhanced mobility of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.Moreover, the semicircle diameter in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was the smallest for CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 (Figure 3d), indicating the presence of rapid interfacial charge transfer in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10. 49The impedance results further supported the fast dynamics of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which would be beneficial for the photoreduction of CO 2 into carbon fuel.

The dynamics of the photogenerated charge carriers, such as charge separation and recombination, were investigated for CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy upon excitation of 380 nm (Figure 3b).The band gap emission was observed at 520 nm for CdS, with a small Stokes shift.The slightly red-shifted peak at 540 nm was observed with a higher emission intensity for the core-shell structure of CdS/ZnS, which was in line with the slight shift of absorption edge.The type I band alignment between CdS and ZnS enhanced the emission intensity of CdS/ZnS, 35,47 which indicated that the ZnS shell confined the photogenerated charge carriers within CdS.In addition, the ZnS shell passivated nonradiative recombination sites on the surface of CdS.However, the emission intensity was reduced in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which suggested that the incorporation of Pt suppressed the recombination of charge carriers in CdS/ ZnS.Furthermore, the emission peak of ZnS at 420 nm in CdS/ZnS disappeared with the loading of Pt, which confirmed that the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS were efficiently transferred to Pt. 48Thus, the modification of CdS/ZnS core-shell structure with Pt could lead to an enhanced photocatalytic activity under solar light. To further investigate the dynamics of the charge carriers, time profiles of the band gap emission were examined using time-resolved PL spectroscopy (Figure S8).The time profiles could not be fitted by a single-exponential model, indicating the complex relaxation process even in CdS.Indeed, the time profile of CdS was fitted by a triple-exponential model with the average lifetime of 0.19 ns, indicating the rapid deactivation of the charge carriers, although the origin of each component remained for further investigation.The time profile of CdS/ ZnS was also fitted by a triple-exponential model with the slightly longer average lifetime of 0.23 ns.The increased lifetime of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS indicated that the shell structures suppressed nonradiative decay centers, which coincided with the increase in emission intensity.On the other hand, the time profile of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 fitted by a tripleexponential model showed the reduced average lifetime of 0.14 ns, which suggested that charge transfer took place from CdS/ ZnS to Pt.Despite the shorter lifetime, the transferred charge carriers could delay the recombination of electron-hole pairs in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which could enhance the photocatalytic activity of the nanohybrid.In other words, the decrease in the emission intensity, in addition to the shorter lifetime, was indicative of the charge transfer from CdS to Pt, rather than the emissive recombination of the charge carriers in CdS.The efficiency of charge separation was investigated for CdS, CdS/ ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 using photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements.The transient photocurrent of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was higher than that of CdS and CdS/ZnS (Figure 3c), which evidenced the enhanced mobility of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.Moreover, the semicircle diameter in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was the smallest for CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 (Figure 3d), indicating the presence of rapid interfacial charge transfer in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10. 49The impedance results further supported the fast dynamics of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which would be beneficial for the photoreduction of CO 2 into carbon fuel. To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, the reduction reaction of CO 2 was conducted in a Pyrex glass reactor (150 mL) filled with a water-TEOA (2:1) mixture under a solar simulator. 50Carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH 4 ) were the main gaseous products of the CO 2 reduction reaction.The bare CdS nanorods did not effectively reduce CO 2 (Figure 4a), mainly due to the fast recombination of the charges carriers, which led to trace amounts of CO (2.1 molg -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (0.7 molg -1 h -1 ).On the other hand, the reduction rate of CO 2 was enhanced for CdS/ZnS, with the major product of CO.The suppression of nonradiative recombination of the charge carriers in core-shell structures led to the improved photocatalytic activity and stability.However, the CO and CH 4 production rates did not increase with a higher content of ZnS.At the optimal condition of the core-shell structure, the CO and CH 4 production rates with CdS/ZnS were 20 and 10 times higher than bare CdS, respectively.The confinement effect and suppression of defect states in photocatalysts led to the enhanced catalytic activity compared to bare CdS. The deposition of Pt onto CdS/ZnS substantially enhanced the reduction rate of CO 2 (Figure 4b), which was also influenced by the amount of Pt loading. 51Notably, the CO and CH 4 production rates were highest for CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, suggesting that the effective separation of charge carriers to co-catalyst, as revealed by optical properties, led to a higher photocatalytic efficiency.Moreover, enhanced selectivity to CH 4 was observed compared to CdS and CdS/ZnS with Pt loading. 34,525335455 At an optimal Pt loading, the CO and CH 4 production rates with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 were 45 and 47 times higher than the bare CdS, respectively, and 2 and 4 times higher than CdS/ZnS, respectively (Figure 4c).The generation rates of CO and CH 4 with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 for the first 5 h were 82 and 37 molg -1 h -1 , respectively.Indeed, the selectivity of the individual products (H 2 , CO, and CH 4 ) during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes of CdS/ZnS/ Pt-10 changed with irradiation time (Figure 4d).Under the optimized Pt loading, the generation of CO became enhanced under long-time run (20 h).In most of photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction, the photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction often exhibited the selective CO production as a major product by two-electron process, rather than CH 4 formation by eightelectron process. 525335455 In the case of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, the H 2 production rate of 299 molg -1 h -1 was observed for the first 5 h and subsequently suppressed under long-time run (20 h), as shown in Figure S9.The accumulation of intermediates on the surface inhibited the adsorption of water with increasing irradiation time, leading to the suppression of H 2 production process. 54oreover, CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 exhibited long-term stability for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in aqueous conditions.The CO production was maintained to be stable for 42 h, and then a slow decay was observed due to the adsorption of reaction products onto the photocatalytic surface under continuous irradiation (Figure S10).The photocatalytic nature of CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 was additionally evidenced by the control experiments, which were conducted in the absence of light, scavenger, and photocatalyst (Figure S11).The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process was inactive in all control experiments, which confirmed the photocatalytic activity of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.Overall, the noble-metal catalyst Pt effectively extracted the photogenerated electrons confined in CdS and enhanced the photocatalytic process.The quantum efficiency of the CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 is calculated to be 3.5 ( 425 nm). To elucidate the mechanism underlying the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 nanocomposite, the conduction band (CB) potentials were evaluated by Mott-Schottky (MS) analysis (Figure S7).The CB potentials of CdS and ZnS were estimated to be -1.03 and -1.11V (vs E Ag/AgCl ), respectively, which were transformed to the scale of normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) using the equation E NHE E Ag/AgCl 0.197 at pH 7. 55 The CB potentials (vs E NHE ) were calculated to be -0.840 and -0.913 V for CdS and ZnS, respectively, indicating the type I band structure in CdS/ZnS/ Pt-10 nanocomposite.Hence, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction catalyzed by CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 nanohybrid structures is proposed in Scheme 2. Upon absorption of solar light, the electrons are produced in CB of CdS, which is located in the potential level of -0.840 V.The holes are formed in the valence band (VB) of CdS, which is in the potential level of 1.550 V.The reduction of CO 2 to CO requires two electrons with a potential level more negative than -0.53 V, while the reduction to CH 4 needs eight electrons with a potential level of -0.24 V. Thus, the reduction of CO 2 into CO and CH 4 proceeds in CB of CdS, although the efficiency is very low due to the fast recombination of the electron-hole pairs.In a CdS/ ZnS core-shell structure, the ZnS shell suppresses the surfacerelated nonradiative recombination sites of CdS.In addition, the photogenerated electrons in CB of ZnS are transferred to CB of CdS due to the type I band structures in CdS/ZnS, while the holes in VB of ZnS are transferred to VB of CdS.In this regard, the ZnS shell supplies additional charge carriers.Accordingly, the optimal ZnS shell is beneficial to the photocatalytic reduction reaction, with CO and CH 4 production rates using CdS/ZnS being 20 and 10 times higher than bare CdS, respectively. The incorporation of Pt allows efficient electron transfer from CB of CdS to the Fermi level of Pt.Due to the metallic nature of Pt nanoparticles, the transferred electrons can be accumulated in Pt by the Schottky barrier, which are then involved in the reduction reaction of the adsorbed CO 2 species into carbon fuels.Because the potential of Pt is suitable for the reduction potential of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 after Fermi-level equilibration, multiple reduction processes can take place on the Pt nanoparticles.Accordingly, the rates of CO and CH 4 production with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 are enhanced by 50 times compared to bare CdS.Notably, the CO and CH 4 production rates are more than 2-fold higher compared to CdS/ZnS when Pt is incorporated.The holes in VB of CdS, which also include the transferred holes from VB of ZnS, are quenched by TEOA, completing the photocatalytic cycle of CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "CdS/ZnS/Pt-10", "source": "In summary, we reported the nanohybrid structure of CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10, which significantly promoted the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.", "context": "In summary, we reported the nanohybrid structure of CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10, which significantly promoted the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction.The optimized CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 nanohybrids demonstrated the outstanding performance of CO 2 reduction with the high rates of CO and CH 4 production.The reduction of CO 2 into CO and CH 4 with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was 45 and 47 times higher than those with bare CdS, respectively, which was 2 and 4 times higher than those with CdS/ZnS.Moreover, CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was stable for CO production, maintaining a steady rate for 42 h, making it suitable for long-term applications with solar light under moderate conditions.The enhanced efficiency of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was mainly attributed to the improved visible light harvesting and the enhanced transfer of photogenerated charge carriers.We expect the further optimization of core-shell structures with co-catalysts to enhance the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction and increase their application potential.

The chemical composition and electronic states of the elements in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).The presence of Cd, Zn, S, and Pt was observed in the XPS survey spectrum (Figure 1b).In the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cd (Figure 1c), the spin-orbit states of Cd 3d (3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 ) were located at 404.8 and 411.59 eV, respectively, indicating the presence of divalent Cd. 41 In the Zn 2p spectrum (Figure 1d), the peaks at 1022.3 and 1045.4 eV were ascribed to the spin-orbit states of 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 , respectively, while those at 160.9 and 162.08 eV were ascribed to the spin-orbit states of S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 (Figure 1e), respectively. 42However, the small amount of Pt in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 prevented the clear analysis of the spin-orbit states of Pt (Figure 1f).Nevertheless, the peak for Pt 4f 7/2 at 69.1 eV indicated that Pt retained its metallic nature and thus its high ability to trap photogenerated electrons. 43,44he XPS spectrum of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was compared with those of CdS and CdS/ZnS (Figure S3), indicating the slight red shift in the binding energies.This shift indicated the presence of ZnS and Pt on CdS, because the different electronegativities of Cd, Zn, and Pt influenced the binding energies of Cd and S, 45 which indicated strong interactions between CdS, ZnS, and Pt in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.On the other hand, the binding energy of the Cd 3d peak in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which was lower than CdS and CdS/ZnS, implied that electron transfer processes can be easily activated at the interfaces between CdS/ZnS and Pt.In addition, we performed the XPS analysis of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 after photocatalytic processes for 40 h (Figure S4), which revealed the stability of the catalyst for long-time practical applications under solar light. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 revealed the structure of the CdS nanorod, ZnS shell, and Pt nanoparticles.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image suggested that the nanohybrids were composed of a uniform deposition of Pt nanoparticles on a CdS/ZnS core-shell structure (Figure 2a).Lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 3.36 and 2.25 A were observed (Figure 2b), which could be ascribed to the (002) plane of CdS and the (111) plane of Pt, respectively.In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed the uniform elemental distribution of Cd (Figure 2c), Zn (Figure 2d), S (Figure 2e), and Pt (Figure 2f).We also obtained the TEM image of CdS/ZnS core-shell structure (Figure S5), which clearly showed the formation of uniform ZnS shells around the core of CdS nanorods. The optical absorption of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was investigated using UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).The absorption of the CdS nanorods revealed a steep slope at 520 nm, indicating the direct optical transition of CdS (Figure 3a).The absorption edge of CdS/ZnS slightly shifted to a longer wavelength indicated the reduced band gap and the change in the electronic structure due to the interactions between CdS and ZnS. 35,46However, the absorption edge of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was similar to that of CdS/ZnS, which specified that the incorporation of Pt did not significantly influence the intrinsic electronic structure of CdS/ ZnS.However, the shorter edge of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 than CdS and CdS/ZnS was observed, which evidenced the enhanced light absorption feature of nanohybrid.On the other hand, CdS/ZnS exhibited higher visible light absorption (520 nm) compared to bare CdS, suggesting the sensitization of ZnS for better photoabsorption.Furthermore, CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 exhibited the highest visible light absorption, which could enhance light harvesting and increase photocatalytic efficiency.The direct band gap energies of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 were estimated using Tauc plot (Figure S6), which indicated that band gap energies of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 are 2.39, 2.37, and 2.37 eV, respectively.A slightly reduced band gap was observed with ZnS shells on CdS, indicating changes in the electronic structure of CdS.When CdS/ZnS was further sensitized with Pt, the change in the band gap was not observed.However, the strong sensitization between nanocomposites in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 can lead to the enhanced visible light absorption of the nanocomposite.In addition, we measured UV-vis DRS of ZnS nanocomposite (Figure S7), which indicated the band gap energy of ZnS was 3.43 eV. The dynamics of the photogenerated charge carriers, such as charge separation and recombination, were investigated for CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy upon excitation of 380 nm (Figure 3b).The band gap emission was observed at 520 nm for CdS, with a small Stokes shift.The slightly red-shifted peak at 540 nm was observed with a higher emission intensity for the core-shell structure of CdS/ZnS, which was in line with the slight shift of absorption edge.The type I band alignment between CdS and ZnS enhanced the emission intensity of CdS/ZnS, 35,47 which indicated that the ZnS shell confined the photogenerated charge carriers within CdS.In addition, the ZnS shell passivated nonradiative recombination sites on the surface of CdS.However, the emission intensity was reduced in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which suggested that the incorporation of Pt suppressed the recombination of charge carriers in CdS/ ZnS.Furthermore, the emission peak of ZnS at 420 nm in CdS/ZnS disappeared with the loading of Pt, which confirmed that the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS were efficiently transferred to Pt. 48Thus, the modification of CdS/ZnS core-shell structure with Pt could lead to an enhanced photocatalytic activity under solar light. To further investigate the dynamics of the charge carriers, time profiles of the band gap emission were examined using time-resolved PL spectroscopy (Figure S8).The time profiles could not be fitted by a single-exponential model, indicating the complex relaxation process even in CdS.Indeed, the time profile of CdS was fitted by a triple-exponential model with the average lifetime of 0.19 ns, indicating the rapid deactivation of the charge carriers, although the origin of each component remained for further investigation.The time profile of CdS/ ZnS was also fitted by a triple-exponential model with the slightly longer average lifetime of 0.23 ns.The increased lifetime of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS indicated that the shell structures suppressed nonradiative decay centers, which coincided with the increase in emission intensity.On the other hand, the time profile of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 fitted by a tripleexponential model showed the reduced average lifetime of 0.14 ns, which suggested that charge transfer took place from CdS/ ZnS to Pt.Despite the shorter lifetime, the transferred charge carriers could delay the recombination of electron-hole pairs in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which could enhance the photocatalytic activity of the nanohybrid.In other words, the decrease in the emission intensity, in addition to the shorter lifetime, was indicative of the charge transfer from CdS to Pt, rather than the emissive recombination of the charge carriers in CdS.The efficiency of charge separation was investigated for CdS, CdS/ ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 using photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements.The transient photocurrent of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was higher than that of CdS and CdS/ZnS (Figure 3c), which evidenced the enhanced mobility of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.Moreover, the semicircle diameter in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was the smallest for CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 (Figure 3d), indicating the presence of rapid interfacial charge transfer in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10. 49The impedance results further supported the fast dynamics of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which would be beneficial for the photoreduction of CO 2 into carbon fuel. To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, the reduction reaction of CO 2 was conducted in a Pyrex glass reactor (150 mL) filled with a water-TEOA (2:1) mixture under a solar simulator. 50Carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH 4 ) were the main gaseous products of the CO 2 reduction reaction.The bare CdS nanorods did not effectively reduce CO 2 (Figure 4a), mainly due to the fast recombination of the charges carriers, which led to trace amounts of CO (2.1 molg -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (0.7 molg -1 h -1 ).On the other hand, the reduction rate of CO 2 was enhanced for CdS/ZnS, with the major product of CO.The suppression of nonradiative recombination of the charge carriers in core-shell structures led to the improved photocatalytic activity and stability.However, the CO and CH 4 production rates did not increase with a higher content of ZnS.At the optimal condition of the core-shell structure, the CO and CH 4 production rates with CdS/ZnS were 20 and 10 times higher than bare CdS, respectively.The confinement effect and suppression of defect states in photocatalysts led to the enhanced catalytic activity compared to bare CdS. The deposition of Pt onto CdS/ZnS substantially enhanced the reduction rate of CO 2 (Figure 4b), which was also influenced by the amount of Pt loading. 51Notably, the CO and CH 4 production rates were highest for CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, suggesting that the effective separation of charge carriers to co-catalyst, as revealed by optical properties, led to a higher photocatalytic efficiency.Moreover, enhanced selectivity to CH 4 was observed compared to CdS and CdS/ZnS with Pt loading. 34,525335455 At an optimal Pt loading, the CO and CH 4 production rates with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 were 45 and 47 times higher than the bare CdS, respectively, and 2 and 4 times higher than CdS/ZnS, respectively (Figure 4c).The generation rates of CO and CH 4 with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 for the first 5 h were 82 and 37 molg -1 h -1 , respectively.Indeed, the selectivity of the individual products (H 2 , CO, and CH 4 ) during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes of CdS/ZnS/ Pt-10 changed with irradiation time (Figure 4d).Under the optimized Pt loading, the generation of CO became enhanced under long-time run (20 h).In most of photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction, the photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction often exhibited the selective CO production as a major product by two-electron process, rather than CH 4 formation by eightelectron process. 525335455 In the case of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, the H 2 production rate of 299 molg -1 h -1 was observed for the first 5 h and subsequently suppressed under long-time run (20 h), as shown in Figure S9.The accumulation of intermediates on the surface inhibited the adsorption of water with increasing irradiation time, leading to the suppression of H 2 production process. 54oreover, CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 exhibited long-term stability for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in aqueous conditions.The CO production was maintained to be stable for 42 h, and then a slow decay was observed due to the adsorption of reaction products onto the photocatalytic surface under continuous irradiation (Figure S10).The photocatalytic nature of CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 was additionally evidenced by the control experiments, which were conducted in the absence of light, scavenger, and photocatalyst (Figure S11).The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process was inactive in all control experiments, which confirmed the photocatalytic activity of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.Overall, the noble-metal catalyst Pt effectively extracted the photogenerated electrons confined in CdS and enhanced the photocatalytic process.The quantum efficiency of the CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 is calculated to be 3.5 ( 425 nm). To elucidate the mechanism underlying the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 nanocomposite, the conduction band (CB) potentials were evaluated by Mott-Schottky (MS) analysis (Figure S7).The CB potentials of CdS and ZnS were estimated to be -1.03 and -1.11V (vs E Ag/AgCl ), respectively, which were transformed to the scale of normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) using the equation E NHE E Ag/AgCl 0.197 at pH 7. 55 The CB potentials (vs E NHE ) were calculated to be -0.840 and -0.913 V for CdS and ZnS, respectively, indicating the type I band structure in CdS/ZnS/ Pt-10 nanocomposite.Hence, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction catalyzed by CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 nanohybrid structures is proposed in Scheme 2. Upon absorption of solar light, the electrons are produced in CB of CdS, which is located in the potential level of -0.840 V.The holes are formed in the valence band (VB) of CdS, which is in the potential level of 1.550 V.The reduction of CO 2 to CO requires two electrons with a potential level more negative than -0.53 V, while the reduction to CH 4 needs eight electrons with a potential level of -0.24 V. Thus, the reduction of CO 2 into CO and CH 4 proceeds in CB of CdS, although the efficiency is very low due to the fast recombination of the electron-hole pairs.In a CdS/ ZnS core-shell structure, the ZnS shell suppresses the surfacerelated nonradiative recombination sites of CdS.In addition, the photogenerated electrons in CB of ZnS are transferred to CB of CdS due to the type I band structures in CdS/ZnS, while the holes in VB of ZnS are transferred to VB of CdS.In this regard, the ZnS shell supplies additional charge carriers.Accordingly, the optimal ZnS shell is beneficial to the photocatalytic reduction reaction, with CO and CH 4 production rates using CdS/ZnS being 20 and 10 times higher than bare CdS, respectively. The incorporation of Pt allows efficient electron transfer from CB of CdS to the Fermi level of Pt.Due to the metallic nature of Pt nanoparticles, the transferred electrons can be accumulated in Pt by the Schottky barrier, which are then involved in the reduction reaction of the adsorbed CO 2 species into carbon fuels.Because the potential of Pt is suitable for the reduction potential of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 after Fermi-level equilibration, multiple reduction processes can take place on the Pt nanoparticles.Accordingly, the rates of CO and CH 4 production with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 are enhanced by 50 times compared to bare CdS.Notably, the CO and CH 4 production rates are more than 2-fold higher compared to CdS/ZnS when Pt is incorporated.The holes in VB of CdS, which also include the transferred holes from VB of ZnS, are quenched by TEOA, completing the photocatalytic cycle of CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, the reduction reaction of CO 2 was conducted in a Pyrex glass reactor (150 mL) filled with a water-TEOA (2:1) mixture under a solar simulator.", "context": "The crystal structures and phases of the nanohybrid composites were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD).The XRD pattern for pristine CdS (Figure 1a) showed lattice planes of (100), ( 002), ( 101), ( 102), ( 110), ( 103), ( 112 (201), ( 202), ( 203), (211), and (105), which were clearly indexed to the crystal planes of hexagonal CdS (JCPDS No. 89-2944).The broad peaks were attributed to the finite size of CdS. 3637738 After modification with ZnS, the diffraction maxima were slightly shifted toward larger angles (Figure S1), which was typically observed in core-shell-like structures. 39,40Only diffraction peaks ascribed to CdS were observed in CdS/ZnS and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, indicating that large domains of ZnS or Pt were not formed.In addition, there was little change in the peak intensity, indicating that the basic structure of CdS was well maintained in CdS/ZnS and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10. 41We also synthesized ZnS with the same method except the addition of CdS to confirm the formation of ZnS without forming ZnO intermediates.The XRD patterns of synthesized ZnS were compared to those of commercially available ZnS and ZnO (Figure S2), which indicated that the peaks related to ZnO were not observed, suggesting that CdS was covered with ZnS. The chemical composition and electronic states of the elements in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).The presence of Cd, Zn, S, and Pt was observed in the XPS survey spectrum (Figure 1b).In the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cd (Figure 1c), the spin-orbit states of Cd 3d (3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 ) were located at 404.8 and 411.59 eV, respectively, indicating the presence of divalent Cd. 41 In the Zn 2p spectrum (Figure 1d), the peaks at 1022.3 and 1045.4 eV were ascribed to the spin-orbit states of 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 , respectively, while those at 160.9 and 162.08 eV were ascribed to the spin-orbit states of S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 (Figure 1e), respectively. 42However, the small amount of Pt in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 prevented the clear analysis of the spin-orbit states of Pt (Figure 1f).Nevertheless, the peak for Pt 4f 7/2 at 69.1 eV indicated that Pt retained its metallic nature and thus its high ability to trap photogenerated electrons. 43,44he XPS spectrum of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was compared with those of CdS and CdS/ZnS (Figure S3), indicating the slight red shift in the binding energies.This shift indicated the presence of ZnS and Pt on CdS, because the different electronegativities of Cd, Zn, and Pt influenced the binding energies of Cd and S, 45 which indicated strong interactions between CdS, ZnS, and Pt in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.On the other hand, the binding energy of the Cd 3d peak in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which was lower than CdS and CdS/ZnS, implied that electron transfer processes can be easily activated at the interfaces between CdS/ZnS and Pt.In addition, we performed the XPS analysis of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 after photocatalytic processes for 40 h (Figure S4), which revealed the stability of the catalyst for long-time practical applications under solar light. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 revealed the structure of the CdS nanorod, ZnS shell, and Pt nanoparticles.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image suggested that the nanohybrids were composed of a uniform deposition of Pt nanoparticles on a CdS/ZnS core-shell structure (Figure 2a).Lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 3.36 and 2.25 A were observed (Figure 2b), which could be ascribed to the (002) plane of CdS and the (111) plane of Pt, respectively.In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed the uniform elemental distribution of Cd (Figure 2c), Zn (Figure 2d), S (Figure 2e), and Pt (Figure 2f).We also obtained the TEM image of CdS/ZnS core-shell structure (Figure S5), which clearly showed the formation of uniform ZnS shells around the core of CdS nanorods. The optical absorption of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was investigated using UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).The absorption of the CdS nanorods revealed a steep slope at 520 nm, indicating the direct optical transition of CdS (Figure 3a).The absorption edge of CdS/ZnS slightly shifted to a longer wavelength indicated the reduced band gap and the change in the electronic structure due to the interactions between CdS and ZnS. 35,46However, the absorption edge of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was similar to that of CdS/ZnS, which specified that the incorporation of Pt did not significantly influence the intrinsic electronic structure of CdS/ ZnS.However, the shorter edge of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 than CdS and CdS/ZnS was observed, which evidenced the enhanced light absorption feature of nanohybrid.On the other hand, CdS/ZnS exhibited higher visible light absorption (520 nm) compared to bare CdS, suggesting the sensitization of ZnS for better photoabsorption.Furthermore, CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 exhibited the highest visible light absorption, which could enhance light harvesting and increase photocatalytic efficiency.The direct band gap energies of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 were estimated using Tauc plot (Figure S6), which indicated that band gap energies of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 are 2.39, 2.37, and 2.37 eV, respectively.A slightly reduced band gap was observed with ZnS shells on CdS, indicating changes in the electronic structure of CdS.When CdS/ZnS was further sensitized with Pt, the change in the band gap was not observed.However, the strong sensitization between nanocomposites in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 can lead to the enhanced visible light absorption of the nanocomposite.In addition, we measured UV-vis DRS of ZnS nanocomposite (Figure S7), which indicated the band gap energy of ZnS was 3.43 eV. The dynamics of the photogenerated charge carriers, such as charge separation and recombination, were investigated for CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy upon excitation of 380 nm (Figure 3b).The band gap emission was observed at 520 nm for CdS, with a small Stokes shift.The slightly red-shifted peak at 540 nm was observed with a higher emission intensity for the core-shell structure of CdS/ZnS, which was in line with the slight shift of absorption edge.The type I band alignment between CdS and ZnS enhanced the emission intensity of CdS/ZnS, 35,47 which indicated that the ZnS shell confined the photogenerated charge carriers within CdS.In addition, the ZnS shell passivated nonradiative recombination sites on the surface of CdS.However, the emission intensity was reduced in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which suggested that the incorporation of Pt suppressed the recombination of charge carriers in CdS/ ZnS.Furthermore, the emission peak of ZnS at 420 nm in CdS/ZnS disappeared with the loading of Pt, which confirmed that the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS were efficiently transferred to Pt. 48Thus, the modification of CdS/ZnS core-shell structure with Pt could lead to an enhanced photocatalytic activity under solar light. To further investigate the dynamics of the charge carriers, time profiles of the band gap emission were examined using time-resolved PL spectroscopy (Figure S8).The time profiles could not be fitted by a single-exponential model, indicating the complex relaxation process even in CdS.Indeed, the time profile of CdS was fitted by a triple-exponential model with the average lifetime of 0.19 ns, indicating the rapid deactivation of the charge carriers, although the origin of each component remained for further investigation.The time profile of CdS/ ZnS was also fitted by a triple-exponential model with the slightly longer average lifetime of 0.23 ns.The increased lifetime of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS indicated that the shell structures suppressed nonradiative decay centers, which coincided with the increase in emission intensity.On the other hand, the time profile of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 fitted by a tripleexponential model showed the reduced average lifetime of 0.14 ns, which suggested that charge transfer took place from CdS/ ZnS to Pt.Despite the shorter lifetime, the transferred charge carriers could delay the recombination of electron-hole pairs in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which could enhance the photocatalytic activity of the nanohybrid.In other words, the decrease in the emission intensity, in addition to the shorter lifetime, was indicative of the charge transfer from CdS to Pt, rather than the emissive recombination of the charge carriers in CdS.The efficiency of charge separation was investigated for CdS, CdS/ ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 using photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements.The transient photocurrent of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was higher than that of CdS and CdS/ZnS (Figure 3c), which evidenced the enhanced mobility of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.Moreover, the semicircle diameter in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was the smallest for CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 (Figure 3d), indicating the presence of rapid interfacial charge transfer in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10. 49The impedance results further supported the fast dynamics of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which would be beneficial for the photoreduction of CO 2 into carbon fuel.

The chemical composition and electronic states of the elements in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).The presence of Cd, Zn, S, and Pt was observed in the XPS survey spectrum (Figure 1b).In the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cd (Figure 1c), the spin-orbit states of Cd 3d (3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 ) were located at 404.8 and 411.59 eV, respectively, indicating the presence of divalent Cd. 41 In the Zn 2p spectrum (Figure 1d), the peaks at 1022.3 and 1045.4 eV were ascribed to the spin-orbit states of 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 , respectively, while those at 160.9 and 162.08 eV were ascribed to the spin-orbit states of S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 (Figure 1e), respectively. 42However, the small amount of Pt in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 prevented the clear analysis of the spin-orbit states of Pt (Figure 1f).Nevertheless, the peak for Pt 4f 7/2 at 69.1 eV indicated that Pt retained its metallic nature and thus its high ability to trap photogenerated electrons. 43,44he XPS spectrum of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was compared with those of CdS and CdS/ZnS (Figure S3), indicating the slight red shift in the binding energies.This shift indicated the presence of ZnS and Pt on CdS, because the different electronegativities of Cd, Zn, and Pt influenced the binding energies of Cd and S, 45 which indicated strong interactions between CdS, ZnS, and Pt in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.On the other hand, the binding energy of the Cd 3d peak in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which was lower than CdS and CdS/ZnS, implied that electron transfer processes can be easily activated at the interfaces between CdS/ZnS and Pt.In addition, we performed the XPS analysis of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 after photocatalytic processes for 40 h (Figure S4), which revealed the stability of the catalyst for long-time practical applications under solar light. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 revealed the structure of the CdS nanorod, ZnS shell, and Pt nanoparticles.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image suggested that the nanohybrids were composed of a uniform deposition of Pt nanoparticles on a CdS/ZnS core-shell structure (Figure 2a).Lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 3.36 and 2.25 A were observed (Figure 2b), which could be ascribed to the (002) plane of CdS and the (111) plane of Pt, respectively.In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed the uniform elemental distribution of Cd (Figure 2c), Zn (Figure 2d), S (Figure 2e), and Pt (Figure 2f).We also obtained the TEM image of CdS/ZnS core-shell structure (Figure S5), which clearly showed the formation of uniform ZnS shells around the core of CdS nanorods. The optical absorption of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was investigated using UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).The absorption of the CdS nanorods revealed a steep slope at 520 nm, indicating the direct optical transition of CdS (Figure 3a).The absorption edge of CdS/ZnS slightly shifted to a longer wavelength indicated the reduced band gap and the change in the electronic structure due to the interactions between CdS and ZnS. 35,46However, the absorption edge of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was similar to that of CdS/ZnS, which specified that the incorporation of Pt did not significantly influence the intrinsic electronic structure of CdS/ ZnS.However, the shorter edge of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 than CdS and CdS/ZnS was observed, which evidenced the enhanced light absorption feature of nanohybrid.On the other hand, CdS/ZnS exhibited higher visible light absorption (520 nm) compared to bare CdS, suggesting the sensitization of ZnS for better photoabsorption.Furthermore, CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 exhibited the highest visible light absorption, which could enhance light harvesting and increase photocatalytic efficiency.The direct band gap energies of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 were estimated using Tauc plot (Figure S6), which indicated that band gap energies of CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 are 2.39, 2.37, and 2.37 eV, respectively.A slightly reduced band gap was observed with ZnS shells on CdS, indicating changes in the electronic structure of CdS.When CdS/ZnS was further sensitized with Pt, the change in the band gap was not observed.However, the strong sensitization between nanocomposites in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 can lead to the enhanced visible light absorption of the nanocomposite.In addition, we measured UV-vis DRS of ZnS nanocomposite (Figure S7), which indicated the band gap energy of ZnS was 3.43 eV. The dynamics of the photogenerated charge carriers, such as charge separation and recombination, were investigated for CdS, CdS/ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy upon excitation of 380 nm (Figure 3b).The band gap emission was observed at 520 nm for CdS, with a small Stokes shift.The slightly red-shifted peak at 540 nm was observed with a higher emission intensity for the core-shell structure of CdS/ZnS, which was in line with the slight shift of absorption edge.The type I band alignment between CdS and ZnS enhanced the emission intensity of CdS/ZnS, 35,47 which indicated that the ZnS shell confined the photogenerated charge carriers within CdS.In addition, the ZnS shell passivated nonradiative recombination sites on the surface of CdS.However, the emission intensity was reduced in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which suggested that the incorporation of Pt suppressed the recombination of charge carriers in CdS/ ZnS.Furthermore, the emission peak of ZnS at 420 nm in CdS/ZnS disappeared with the loading of Pt, which confirmed that the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS were efficiently transferred to Pt. 48Thus, the modification of CdS/ZnS core-shell structure with Pt could lead to an enhanced photocatalytic activity under solar light. To further investigate the dynamics of the charge carriers, time profiles of the band gap emission were examined using time-resolved PL spectroscopy (Figure S8).The time profiles could not be fitted by a single-exponential model, indicating the complex relaxation process even in CdS.Indeed, the time profile of CdS was fitted by a triple-exponential model with the average lifetime of 0.19 ns, indicating the rapid deactivation of the charge carriers, although the origin of each component remained for further investigation.The time profile of CdS/ ZnS was also fitted by a triple-exponential model with the slightly longer average lifetime of 0.23 ns.The increased lifetime of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS indicated that the shell structures suppressed nonradiative decay centers, which coincided with the increase in emission intensity.On the other hand, the time profile of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 fitted by a tripleexponential model showed the reduced average lifetime of 0.14 ns, which suggested that charge transfer took place from CdS/ ZnS to Pt.Despite the shorter lifetime, the transferred charge carriers could delay the recombination of electron-hole pairs in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which could enhance the photocatalytic activity of the nanohybrid.In other words, the decrease in the emission intensity, in addition to the shorter lifetime, was indicative of the charge transfer from CdS to Pt, rather than the emissive recombination of the charge carriers in CdS.The efficiency of charge separation was investigated for CdS, CdS/ ZnS, and CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 using photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements.The transient photocurrent of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 was higher than that of CdS and CdS/ZnS (Figure 3c), which evidenced the enhanced mobility of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.Moreover, the semicircle diameter in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was the smallest for CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 (Figure 3d), indicating the presence of rapid interfacial charge transfer in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10. 49The impedance results further supported the fast dynamics of the charge carriers in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, which would be beneficial for the photoreduction of CO 2 into carbon fuel. To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, the reduction reaction of CO 2 was conducted in a Pyrex glass reactor (150 mL) filled with a water-TEOA (2:1) mixture under a solar simulator. 50Carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH 4 ) were the main gaseous products of the CO 2 reduction reaction.The bare CdS nanorods did not effectively reduce CO 2 (Figure 4a), mainly due to the fast recombination of the charges carriers, which led to trace amounts of CO (2.1 molg -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (0.7 molg -1 h -1 ).On the other hand, the reduction rate of CO 2 was enhanced for CdS/ZnS, with the major product of CO.The suppression of nonradiative recombination of the charge carriers in core-shell structures led to the improved photocatalytic activity and stability.However, the CO and CH 4 production rates did not increase with a higher content of ZnS.At the optimal condition of the core-shell structure, the CO and CH 4 production rates with CdS/ZnS were 20 and 10 times higher than bare CdS, respectively.The confinement effect and suppression of defect states in photocatalysts led to the enhanced catalytic activity compared to bare CdS. The deposition of Pt onto CdS/ZnS substantially enhanced the reduction rate of CO 2 (Figure 4b), which was also influenced by the amount of Pt loading. 51Notably, the CO and CH 4 production rates were highest for CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, suggesting that the effective separation of charge carriers to co-catalyst, as revealed by optical properties, led to a higher photocatalytic efficiency.Moreover, enhanced selectivity to CH 4 was observed compared to CdS and CdS/ZnS with Pt loading. 34,525335455 At an optimal Pt loading, the CO and CH 4 production rates with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 were 45 and 47 times higher than the bare CdS, respectively, and 2 and 4 times higher than CdS/ZnS, respectively (Figure 4c).The generation rates of CO and CH 4 with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 for the first 5 h were 82 and 37 molg -1 h -1 , respectively.Indeed, the selectivity of the individual products (H 2 , CO, and CH 4 ) during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes of CdS/ZnS/ Pt-10 changed with irradiation time (Figure 4d).Under the optimized Pt loading, the generation of CO became enhanced under long-time run (20 h).In most of photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction, the photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction often exhibited the selective CO production as a major product by two-electron process, rather than CH 4 formation by eightelectron process. 525335455 In the case of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10, the H 2 production rate of 299 molg -1 h -1 was observed for the first 5 h and subsequently suppressed under long-time run (20 h), as shown in Figure S9.The accumulation of intermediates on the surface inhibited the adsorption of water with increasing irradiation time, leading to the suppression of H 2 production process. 54oreover, CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 exhibited long-term stability for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in aqueous conditions.The CO production was maintained to be stable for 42 h, and then a slow decay was observed due to the adsorption of reaction products onto the photocatalytic surface under continuous irradiation (Figure S10).The photocatalytic nature of CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 was additionally evidenced by the control experiments, which were conducted in the absence of light, scavenger, and photocatalyst (Figure S11).The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process was inactive in all control experiments, which confirmed the photocatalytic activity of CdS/ZnS/Pt-10.Overall, the noble-metal catalyst Pt effectively extracted the photogenerated electrons confined in CdS and enhanced the photocatalytic process.The quantum efficiency of the CdS/ ZnS/Pt-10 is calculated to be 3.5 ( 425 nm). To elucidate the mechanism underlying the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction processes in CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 nanocomposite, the conduction band (CB) potentials were evaluated by Mott-Schottky (MS) analysis (Figure S7).The CB potentials of CdS and ZnS were estimated to be -1.03 and -1.11V (vs E Ag/AgCl ), respectively, which were transformed to the scale of normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) using the equation E NHE E Ag/AgCl 0.197 at pH 7. 55 The CB potentials (vs E NHE ) were calculated to be -0.840 and -0.913 V for CdS and ZnS, respectively, indicating the type I band structure in CdS/ZnS/ Pt-10 nanocomposite.Hence, the mechanism of CO 2 reduction catalyzed by CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 nanohybrid structures is proposed in Scheme 2. Upon absorption of solar light, the electrons are produced in CB of CdS, which is located in the potential level of -0.840 V.The holes are formed in the valence band (VB) of CdS, which is in the potential level of 1.550 V.The reduction of CO 2 to CO requires two electrons with a potential level more negative than -0.53 V, while the reduction to CH 4 needs eight electrons with a potential level of -0.24 V. Thus, the reduction of CO 2 into CO and CH 4 proceeds in CB of CdS, although the efficiency is very low due to the fast recombination of the electron-hole pairs.In a CdS/ ZnS core-shell structure, the ZnS shell suppresses the surfacerelated nonradiative recombination sites of CdS.In addition, the photogenerated electrons in CB of ZnS are transferred to CB of CdS due to the type I band structures in CdS/ZnS, while the holes in VB of ZnS are transferred to VB of CdS.In this regard, the ZnS shell supplies additional charge carriers.Accordingly, the optimal ZnS shell is beneficial to the photocatalytic reduction reaction, with CO and CH 4 production rates using CdS/ZnS being 20 and 10 times higher than bare CdS, respectively. The incorporation of Pt allows efficient electron transfer from CB of CdS to the Fermi level of Pt.Due to the metallic nature of Pt nanoparticles, the transferred electrons can be accumulated in Pt by the Schottky barrier, which are then involved in the reduction reaction of the adsorbed CO 2 species into carbon fuels.Because the potential of Pt is suitable for the reduction potential of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 after Fermi-level equilibration, multiple reduction processes can take place on the Pt nanoparticles.Accordingly, the rates of CO and CH 4 production with CdS/ZnS/Pt-10 are enhanced by 50 times compared to bare CdS.Notably, the CO and CH 4 production rates are more than 2-fold higher compared to CdS/ZnS when Pt is incorporated.The holes in VB of CdS, which also include the transferred holes from VB of ZnS, are quenched by TEOA, completing the photocatalytic cycle of CO 2 reduction."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
