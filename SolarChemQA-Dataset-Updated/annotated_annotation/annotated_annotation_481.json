The synthesis of photocatalysts in supercritical CO 2 was performed in an ad hoc designed experimental set-up described elsewhere 12.Synthesis conditions were pressure 20 MPa, temperature 300 C, molar ratio 28 mmol alcohol/mmol precursor and reaction time 2 h 9.Palladium acetylacetonate was added also in an appropriate amount to reach final Pd concentrations in the synthesized catalyst in the range 1-3 wt.. These experimental conditions were optimized by Alonso et al. 9 to ensure a highly pure catalyst, with good crystallinity of the solids obtained, a suitable particle size and the exclusive presence of anatase phase.Crystallinity seems to be prima facie the property with a higher influence on photocatalytic activity for TiO 2 in absence of metal. Solids obtained were removed from the reactor and dried at 105 C for 12 h.Then they were calcinated at 400 C during 6 h to remove C pollution 21.The limit in the calcination temperature is given by the transition from anatase to rutile phases, which takes place at about 700 C 22. The Pd/TiO 2 catalysts were characterized with different techniques.A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Jeol 6490 LV) was used to observe particle size and external morphology of the particles.An X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, Philips X'Pert MPD) was employed to determine crystallinity and crystalline phase of the powders, and crystallite size was estimated from Scherrer equation using the X-ray diffraction peak at 2 25.4 .A BET area analyser (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020) was used to evaluate the specific surface area of the powders.A diffuse reflectance (DR) UV-vis spec-trophotometer (Jasco, V650) was employed to obtain absorbance thresholds and band gap energies.A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet, Avatar 370 FT-IR) was used to obtain FTIR spectra of all samples.Finally, particle size was calculated in a laser scattering particle size distribution analyser (Malvern, Mastersizer 2000). The photocatalytic activity of the materials produced was tested using an ad hoc designed experimental set-up where the photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction experiments were performed.Briefly, this installation consists of a thin-film fixed-bed reactor (stainless steel chamber with volume 50 ml) having valves for gas feeding, evacuation and connection to a GC-TCD/FID system, an Oring sealed quartz window at the top for admitting radiation from a Xe arc lamp, a bubbler containing deionized water to moisten CO 2 before entering the reaction chamber and a dew point transmitter and a manometer to measure the relative humidity and pressure, respectively, during the reaction 12.Inside, there is a stainless steel grid to support the filter where the solid catalysts are placed.Prior to each experiment, 50 mg of catalyst was suspended in 1 l of deionized water, and the suspension was filtered through a glass microfiber filter (diameter 47 mm, pore size 0.45 m).The filter containing the uniformly dispersed solid catalyst was dried at 105 C for 12 h before being introduced in the reactor. The experiments have been performed with a water vapour/CO 2 ratio 2/7, a catalyst weight 30 5 mg, and initial absolute pressure in the reactor 1.07 bar.Reaction times of 3 and 4 h have been used.In previous experiments with greater weight of commercial catalyst it has been observed that light penetration was reduced by scattering 23, whereas the optimum vapour/CO 2 molar ratio is a compromise between the presence of enough reducing agent (water) and the process inhibition 24,25.Regarding the operation pressure, in this work and most systems working with water vapour, atmospheric pressure is used because CO 2 solubility (and therefore CO 2 conversion) does not increase with pressure, in contrast to what occurs in systems with liquid water 25262728.Finally, the operation temperature used is the equilibrium temperature reached with the lamp (40 C).Although a higher temperature may be beneficial to this reaction because of the enhanced desorption of products, the adsorption of reactants on catalyst surface would be also suppressed at high temperatures 29. The nature and concentration of the different species in the reaction chamber (CO, CO 2 , CH 4 , light hydrocarbons, light alcohols, ethers and ketones) were determined with a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent GC 7890A) provided with two thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) and one flame ionization detector (FID) with methanizer.H 2 could not be analysed in the system because of technical limitations."}, {"llm generation": "Photocatalysts", "source": "Photocatalysts with similar or better features than commercial TiO 2 have been produced by means of a green synthesis in supercritical media, a synthesis procedure able to offer both excellent environmental and scaling-up benefits.", "context": "Photocatalysts with similar or better features than commercial TiO 2 have been produced by means of a green synthesis in supercritical media, a synthesis procedure able to offer both excellent environmental and scaling-up benefits.

Table 1 shows that yields are within the 50-75 range and that the lower values are obtained when DIPBAT is used as TiO 2 precursor in the synthesis.Most probably it is due to the superior thermal and kinetic stability of DIPBAT molecule in contrast to more easily hydrolysable TTIP molecule 9.Regarding the effect of the hydrolytic agent, ethanol leads to larger yields, probably due to the higher polarity of this alcohol 9. Finally, the level of metal loading does not seem to affect the yield within the interval specified. Fig. 2 shows SEM images of some of the synthesized catalysts.It can be appreciated that the morphology of synthesized Pd/TiO 2 particles is spherical when DIPBAT is used as precursor.Specifically, these photographs show well-defined spheres with particle diameters of about 2-4 m (Fig. 2a andb).In principle, these small particle sizes will lead to large specific areas, which is a positive feature connected with a good photocatalytic activity 30. In contrast, when TTIP is used as precursor the solids obtained are polyhedral-like particles (Fig. 2c andd).According to the literature, these polyhedral-like shapes are usually related to a higher photocatalytic activity, as compared with that of rounded shapes 31. Further, Fig. 2 also illustrates that these results on particle shape are independent on the alcohol used in the synthesis. Regarding the relationship between particle size and alcohol used in the catalyst synthesis, Fig. 2 shows that particles are slightly larger when ethanol is employed.Finally, concerning the influence of Pd concentration on particle morphology, a certain agglomeration degree (not shown) has been found for the larger values of the variable. On the basis of the above comments, it may be concluded that, from the viewpoint of particle shape and size, the catalyst with the best photocatalytic activity should be that obtained from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination. It should be noted that the particle sizes and shapes reported above are similar to those obtained by our group 12 and other groups synthesizing TiO 2 -based particles with supercritical fluids 9,10,32.These sizes are smaller than those for materials obtained by conventional hydrothermal synthesis, where a severe agglomeration phenomenon is facilitated 33.It should also be highlighted that the particle size of catalysts synthesized in this work are slightly larger than that of the commercial catalyst (Fig. 1). Selected XRD diffractograms of synthesized catalysts are displayed in Fig. 3.It shows that catalysts obtained from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination of reactants possess the highest crystallinity (largest peak height and resolution), very similar to that of commercial catalyst (Fig. 1).Further, Fig. 3a-c also show that the doping percentage does not significantly influence crystallinity.All these samples obtained by supercritical fluid method exhibit a better crystal quality than the corresponding catalysts synthesized with a traditional method 34.It can also be observed in Fig. 3 that diffraction peaks always appear at 2 25.4 , 37.8 , 48.5 , 54.0 , 55.4 , 62.9 o , 68.9 , 70.3 , and 75.2 , an indicator of that allotropic anatase phase is the most common in catalysts synthesized in this work.However, it is noteworthy the presence of an additional peak (at 2 33 ) that does not correspond to anatase 9,12,17,35.This peak may have its origin in the low solubility of Pd acetylacetonate in supercritical CO 2 36 and is small in comparison with the rest, but it increases as metal loading in catalyst does.Accordingly, it may be suggested that the peak probably corresponds to the appearance of PdO species, which are expected to be worse distributed as the Pd percentage in the catalyst increases 37.Although the results of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 should be still analysed, it is interesting to advance that some studies relate the presence of PdO surface clusters to a decline in the photocatalytic activity of the catalysts 37. Concerning crystallite size (D), an indicator of the crystalline quality of the particles, it can be calculated with the Scherrer expression 38, defined as: D 0.9/cos.In this equation D represents the average crystal size (nm), the X-ray wavelength (0.1541 nm), the full-width at half-maximum intensity in X-ray diffractograms (rad), and the half of diffraction peak angle (aprox.12.7 for anatase crystal facet 101).The crystal sizes obtained from this equation for all synthesized catalysts are shown in Table 2. From data in this table it may be inferred that the crystal sizes reported are compatible with those found by other groups 10,23,37.Likewise, it may be appreciated that, except for the TTIPisopropyl alcohol-Pd combinations (with crystal sizes between 22.82-26.57nm), all synthesized catalysts have smaller crystallite sizes than the commercial catalyst (19.97 nm).This reduction in crystallite size with metal doping has also been observed in traditional methods of synthesis 39.Further, Table 2 also shows that, apparently, neither titania precursor, nor alcohol, nor degree of metal doping affect crystallite size, which also occurs in synthesis according to conventional hydrothermal methods 27. Then, according to XRD analyses, catalysts synthesized from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination should be those exhibiting the best photocatalytic activity since its high crystallinity favours the transfer of photoelectrons and hinders the recombination between photoinduced electrons and holes. The specific surface area is the total surface area of a material (m 2 ) per unit of mass (g).It is a parameter commonly used to determine the type and properties of a material regarding adsorption, heterogeneous catalysis, and reactions on surfaces.It has been calculated in this work using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption procedure, one of the most widely applied methods to determine the parameter. The specific surface areas of synthesized catalysts are presented in Table 3.It can be appreciated in such table that the catalysts obtained from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination exhibit the lowest values.This result is obviously related to its higher crystallinity, as indicated above.On the contrary, as expected, catalysts with lower crystallinities show larger surface areas.All these values of surface areas are similar to those reported by groups synthesizing TiO 2 with supercritical fluids 32, and larger than those catalysts obtained with conventional hydrothermal methods 33. It is also worth mentioning that surface area decreases as metal loading increases.Vaiano et al. 37 observed this same trend when preparing Pd/TiO 2 catalysts with increasing Pd loading percentages from 0.5 to 1.5 wt..They explained this decrease in BET area in terms of a partial coverage of TiO 2 by metal species. Definitely, in accordance to previous reasoning, if only surface areas were taken into account, the ideal photocatalysts should be those resulting from either the TTIP-ethanol-Pd combination or the combinations with DIPBAT.Nevertheless, it should also be considered the Chen and Mao 34 warning, according to which photocatalytic processes have the particular feature that the surface is a defective site.As a consequence, the larger the surface area, the faster the recombination probability.For this reason, a large surface area does not necessarily imply a high photocatalytic activity. In UV-vis spectroscopy analysis we have observed for all synthesized catalysts a shift of the absorbance curve to visible range when the commercial catalyst is taken as a reference (Fig. 4).Generally speaking, a shift towards the visible in the absorption threshold is often taken as direct evidence of enhanced photocatalytic activity with solar or visible irradiation 40. Fig. 4 also shows that the absorbances in the visible range of catalysts synthesized from the combination DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd increase up to 14 times (in relation to that of the commercial catalyst).Next come catalysts from the DIPBAT-isopropyl alcohol-Pd and TTIP-ethanol-Pd combinations (10-fold increases) and, finally, those from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination (only 5fold).On the other hand, for all synthesis combinations employed, Fig. 4 also shows that the level of absorbance at visible range increases as dopant percentage added increases. Moreover, Fig. 4 illustrates the appearance of one additional absorption edge at about 500 nm, more pronounced in those catalysts from the combinations with higher increase in the visible range.According to Gracia et al. 40, when more than one absorption edge appears in the spectra the catalyst behaves as a mixture of compounds with different absorption thresholds.This result should be connected to the appearance of PdO species in XRD spectra.As indicated at that time, the formation of PdO surface clusters may be imputed to the low solubility of Pd acetylacetonate in supercritical CO 2 36 and may negatively affect the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst 37.This is a subject to be later confirmed through the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction experiments presented in Section 3.3.At this point, we should note that the appearance of shoulder peaks is not exclusive of supercritical catalyst synthesis; they have also been observed in the synthesis of Cr/TiO 2 by means of conventional impregnation methods 41. UV-vis DRS spectra shown in Fig. 4 may also be used to calculate absorption thresholds and band gap energies of the synthesized catalysts.Specifically, the absorption threshold can be determined from the intersection of x-axis and a line tangent to the absorption curve where the slope is at a maximum 40.Regarding the band gap (E g ), it can be calculated from E g hc/, where h is the Planck's constant (4.1356673310 -15 eV s), c the light speed (310 5 km/s), and the absorption threshold (nm) 42.Both absorption thresholds and band gap energies are presented in Table 2. It can be appreciated in such table that the values of the absorption thresholds of Pd/TiO 2 catalysts synthesized in this work are higher (408-566 nm) than the corresponding to the commercial catalyst (407 nm) and similar to those reported by Vaiano et al. 37 for Pd/TiO 2 catalysts with Pd concentrations in the 0-5-1.5 wt. range.On the other hand, Table 2 also shows that the values of the absorption thresholds and the amount of Pd in the catalysts follow parallel variations, i.e., the absorption threshold increases when the Pd concentration in the catalyst is raised.Further, Table 2 data confirm that the combination of reactants leading to the catalyst with highest mean absorption value is DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd.This last finding confirms a favourable effect earlier observed on absorption thresholds when ethanol is used as hydrolytic agent in the synthesis of catalysts 12. To place a scale on absorbance improvement, it is comparable to the third generation of TiO 2 catalysts obtained by non-metal doping (N) with conventional techniques.This generation of catalysts always show a larger displacement to visible range than the second generation (metal doped TiO 2 -based catalysts) 43. Regarding the band gap energy, all synthesized catalysts show values in the range 2.194-3.038eV.The combination leading to the catalyst with the lowest band gap is DIPBAT-ethanol-3 wt. Pd (2.194 eV), in consistency with the results by Vaiano et al. 37, who give values 2.2-2.3 eV for 1.5 wt. Pt/TiO 2 .The rest of combinations can be divided into two types: those with band gap 0.2-0.3eV lower than commercial catalyst (TTIP-ethanol-Pd and DIPBAT-isopropyl alcohol-Pd) and those with similar band gap to commercial catalyst (TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd). Concerning the influence of precursors on the values of band gap energies, as can be seen in Table 2, combinations with DIP-BAT exhibit lower values than combinations with TTIP (average value 2.657 vs. 2.945 eV).This same trend has been observed with catalysts synthesized in absence of metal (not shown).Thus, TTIPisopropyl alcohol (with or without Pd) is the only combination that does not show any improvement of absorbance in visible range.However, it appears that it can be compensated through its very high crystallinity, given the good values of CO produc- tion rates shown in Section 3.3.Trying to explain the differences observed between precursors is complex, since both compounds share chemical similarities except for the presence of acetylacetonate (-diketone) ligands in DIPBAT, which leads to slower hydrolysis than TTIP 9.Moreover, the bibliography about the use of TTIP and DIPBAT in syntheses in supercritical media is scarce. Then, according to the parameters previously outlined, the catalyst that would exhibit the best features from the viewpoint of light absorption would be that obtained from the DIPBATethanol-3 wt. Pd combination, since it shows the highest level of absorbance in visible range, the highest absorption threshold at a higher wavelength, and the lowest band gap energy. However, in accordance with results presented above, there are two important features of this catalyst that should also be considered when analysing its behaviour in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.On the one side, its band gap could be too low to take part in a reduction reaction and, on the other side, its additional absorption edge could hinder the photocatalytic process.Nevertheless, taking into account the results of the photocatalytic reduction shown below, it may be stated that neither of them seems to negatively affect the process. Fig. 5 shows the FTIR spectrum of commercial catalyst.It can be seen that a single peak appears around 690 cm -1 corresponding to Ti O Ti bonds 44.Fig. 5 also shows the FTIR spectrum of catalyst synthesized in this work from the DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 1 combination.As shown, it exhibits an additional peak around 1625 cm -1 and a wide band centred at 3000 cm -1 , which can be attributed to stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups and water on catalyst surface 45,46.In this sense, it should be noticed that the presence of these species is usually favourable for photocatalytic process 17.Since very similar spectra to those shown in Fig. 5 for the combination DIPBATetanol-Pd 1 were attained for other combinations of reagents, it cannot be said that these species appear preferably for a certain precursor or alcohol. It should be noted that this type of double-peak structure is also rather commonly observed for anatase and rutile powders obtained with conventional methods of synthesis 47. The mean particle size is an important parameter in catalytic processes.It has a significant effect on surface area, and therefore in the catalytic process, since it provides contact surface between catalyst, light, and reactants 9,10,48. The catalysts synthesized in this work have a mean size higher than the commercial catalyst (for instance, 6 m for the catalyst from the combination DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 3 vs. 3 m for commercial Degussa P-25), a result in accordance with SEM images shown in Figs. 1 and2. Obviously, this result depends on the synthesis conditions.In particular, it has been observed that the effect of DIPBAT and TTIP precursors is smaller than those corresponding to the hydrolytic agent and dopant concentration.Specifically, the introduction of ethanol and increasing amounts of dopant agent have produced increases in both particle size and aggregation 9. Nevertheless, it should be highlighted at this point that in conventional hydrothermal synthesis a severe agglomeration process usually occurs and leads to larger particle sizes than those synthesized with supercritical fluids 33. In brief, according to findings reported above and considering that decreasing particle sizes improve TiO 2 surface properties, the commercial catalyst should show better photocatalytic activity than synthesized catalysts if such activity depended only on this variable 17. Experiments performed to determine the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized catalysts in the reduction of CO 2 were conducted in a thin-film fixed-bed reactor using water vapour in order to avoid the problems derived from the use of liquid water: low solubility of CO 2 and competitive reactions occurrence.The reaction conditions used were optimized in a previous work 12: 20-40 mg catalyst mass, water vapour/CO 2 ratio 2/7, and operation times 3-4 h. The main advantages of thin-film fixed-bed reactors are that the uniformly dispersed immobilized photocatalyst offers a high specific reactive surface area, a highly effective use of light energy, and agitation is not necessary to prevent catalyst sedimentation, as is the case in fluidised bed reactors, which are employed in systems with liquid water 49. The main reaction products were CH 4 and CO, although traces of ethane were also found with the catalyst synthesized from the DIPBAT-ethanol-1 wt. Pd combination of reactants.These results agree with those reported by other groups working under similar conditions 23,50 and are consistent with widely described CO 2 reduction mechanisms 23. This narrow variety of reaction products (CO, methane, and ethane) and the absence of O 2 in GC measurements may be explained by considering that, during the CO 2 reduction with water to produce methane, oxygen from water may oxidize certain CO 2 reduction products (for example methane to methanol) that are further oxidized in the presence of photocatalysts (noble metalsloaded TiO 2 ) very active in the photocatalytic oxidation of methanol 37. As Table 4 depicts, the production of methane is larger compared to that of CO, a common result when TiO 2 is doped with metals 35.With the purpose of comparison this table also shows the CH 4 and CO production rates (0.075 and 2.014 mol/g/h, respectively) of the catalyst of reference, the commercial catalyst Degussa P-25.It can be seen that all experiments with Pd/TiO 2 lead to methane production rates from 3 to 22 times higher than that of the commercial catalyst. These results imply that when doping with Pd a TiO 2 catalyst the photoactivity of resulting catalyst towards methane production improves, a fact which is in line with data published by other investigators.In fact, a number of groups have recently concluded that the introduction of Pd enhances the selectivity of the process towards CH 4 23,50,51. The catalyst leading to the highest methane production rate is that synthesized from the DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 3 wt.combination of reactants.It should be noted that this catalyst (and, in general, all combinations with DIPBAT) had already exhibited superior characteristics, as shown in Table S1 ordering the three best catalysts of those used in the sixteen photocatalytic experiments performed, from best to worst, according to the value of the property analysed.In particular, it can be appreciated in the table that characteristics that make this catalyst better than others are: small particle size, morphology (polyhedral), low band gap energy and relatively high surface area. Regarding the influence of these properties of catalysts on the CO 2 photocatalytic reaction, it should be noted that the higher surface area is, the more reactants molecules are adsorbed and the more quickly electrons can reach them.This results in smaller recombination probability and higher products yield 52.In connection with this property, it should also be noted that the presence of basic species (hydroxyl groups) on catalyst surface mentioned in Section 3.2 leads to stronger interactions with CO 2 and higher uptake of this gas 52,53.A low band gap energy is also a desired feature since it improves light absorption and charge carrier generation 52,54555657. Finally, polyhedral particle shapes have shown higher activity than rounded particles due to the higher density of catalytically active sites, although it has not yet been fully explained 31. If one looks at reaction time, the methane production rate is always improved when time increases from 3 to 4 h.In the current case, this increase of time is also beneficial to obtaining traces of ethane when DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 1 wt. combination is assessed 50. On the other side, we have also reported in text and in Table S1 that the catalyst obtained from the combination TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd 1 wt. displayed good features related to morphology (small polyhedral-like particles) and crystallinity (high crystallinity and large crystallite size).This high crystallinity is connected with good semiconductor properties.Probably because of this, the catalyst from this combination allowed obtaining CO production rates almost twice (1.7 times higher) that of commercial catalyst Degussa P-25. Regarding the CO production rates, it should also be noted that catalysts from reactants combinations with DIPBAT always led to lower values than those obtained from combinations with TTIP.Unfortunately, it is not clear at this moment how titania precursor affects CO reduction and methane production 58. With the aim of solving some issues raised in previous sections, we can also state that: -An increase in Pd loading enhances the selectivity towards methane (in DIPBAT combinations, methane production rates is up to 4 times higher when Pd loading changes from 1 to 3 wt.).-In this sense, the presence of PdO discovered through XRD and UV-vis DRS analyses does not seem to greatly affect the photocatalytic activity of catalysts, contrary to observed by Vaiano et al. 37.At least, it does not counteract the positive features for photocatalysis exhibited by these catalysts. In order to compare our results with those obtained by other groups working with Pd/TiO 2 , Table 5 shows some results from bibliography.It can be observed that methane and carbon monoxide production rates obtained with Pd/TiO 2 nanoparticles synthesized in CO 2 supercritical medium are generally higher than those obtained using Pd/TiO 2 nanoparticles and conventional photoreactors.However, it should be noted that other investigators 37,59 have reported higher rates when using more sophisticated systems, for example mixtures of TiO 2 and glass spheres in a fluidized bed reactor."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "Briefly, this installation consists of a thin-film fixed-bed reactor (stainless steel chamber with volume 50 ml) having valves for gas feeding, evacuation and connection to a GC-TCD/FID system, an Oring sealed quartz window at the top for admitting radiation from a Xe arc lamp, a bubbler containing deionized water to moisten CO 2 before entering the reaction chamber and a dew point transmitter and a manometer to measure the relative humidity and pressure, respectively, during the reaction 12.", "context": "Palladium-doped TiO 2 powders were synthesized by thermal hydrolysis of two different precursors (DIPBAT and TTIP) with two different alcohols (ethanol and isopropyl alcohol), in presence of palladium acetylacetonate, using supercritical CO 2 as reaction medium.DIPBAT (75 wt. in isopropyl alcohol), TTIP (pure) and Pd (II) acetylacetonate (99 wt.) were provided by Sigma-Aldrich.Ethanol (analytical reagent) and isopropyl alcohol (analytical reagent) were provided by Scharlab.CO 2 (purities 99.9 for synthesis and 99.998 for photocatalytic studies) was used as received from Contse.Degussa P-25 (Evonik) TiO 2 powder has been used as reference material for the characterization of synthesized catalysts.Some properties of this commercial catalyst are shown in Fig. 1 in order to facilitate their comparison with those of catalysts developed in this work.

Table 1 shows that yields are within the 50-75 range and that the lower values are obtained when DIPBAT is used as TiO 2 precursor in the synthesis.Most probably it is due to the superior thermal and kinetic stability of DIPBAT molecule in contrast to more easily hydrolysable TTIP molecule 9.Regarding the effect of the hydrolytic agent, ethanol leads to larger yields, probably due to the higher polarity of this alcohol 9. Finally, the level of metal loading does not seem to affect the yield within the interval specified. Fig. 2 shows SEM images of some of the synthesized catalysts.It can be appreciated that the morphology of synthesized Pd/TiO 2 particles is spherical when DIPBAT is used as precursor.Specifically, these photographs show well-defined spheres with particle diameters of about 2-4 m (Fig. 2a andb).In principle, these small particle sizes will lead to large specific areas, which is a positive feature connected with a good photocatalytic activity 30. In contrast, when TTIP is used as precursor the solids obtained are polyhedral-like particles (Fig. 2c andd).According to the literature, these polyhedral-like shapes are usually related to a higher photocatalytic activity, as compared with that of rounded shapes 31. Further, Fig. 2 also illustrates that these results on particle shape are independent on the alcohol used in the synthesis. Regarding the relationship between particle size and alcohol used in the catalyst synthesis, Fig. 2 shows that particles are slightly larger when ethanol is employed.Finally, concerning the influence of Pd concentration on particle morphology, a certain agglomeration degree (not shown) has been found for the larger values of the variable. On the basis of the above comments, it may be concluded that, from the viewpoint of particle shape and size, the catalyst with the best photocatalytic activity should be that obtained from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination. It should be noted that the particle sizes and shapes reported above are similar to those obtained by our group 12 and other groups synthesizing TiO 2 -based particles with supercritical fluids 9,10,32.These sizes are smaller than those for materials obtained by conventional hydrothermal synthesis, where a severe agglomeration phenomenon is facilitated 33.It should also be highlighted that the particle size of catalysts synthesized in this work are slightly larger than that of the commercial catalyst (Fig. 1). Selected XRD diffractograms of synthesized catalysts are displayed in Fig. 3.It shows that catalysts obtained from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination of reactants possess the highest crystallinity (largest peak height and resolution), very similar to that of commercial catalyst (Fig. 1).Further, Fig. 3a-c also show that the doping percentage does not significantly influence crystallinity.All these samples obtained by supercritical fluid method exhibit a better crystal quality than the corresponding catalysts synthesized with a traditional method 34.It can also be observed in Fig. 3 that diffraction peaks always appear at 2 25.4 , 37.8 , 48.5 , 54.0 , 55.4 , 62.9 o , 68.9 , 70.3 , and 75.2 , an indicator of that allotropic anatase phase is the most common in catalysts synthesized in this work.However, it is noteworthy the presence of an additional peak (at 2 33 ) that does not correspond to anatase 9,12,17,35.This peak may have its origin in the low solubility of Pd acetylacetonate in supercritical CO 2 36 and is small in comparison with the rest, but it increases as metal loading in catalyst does.Accordingly, it may be suggested that the peak probably corresponds to the appearance of PdO species, which are expected to be worse distributed as the Pd percentage in the catalyst increases 37.Although the results of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 should be still analysed, it is interesting to advance that some studies relate the presence of PdO surface clusters to a decline in the photocatalytic activity of the catalysts 37. Concerning crystallite size (D), an indicator of the crystalline quality of the particles, it can be calculated with the Scherrer expression 38, defined as: D 0.9/cos.In this equation D represents the average crystal size (nm), the X-ray wavelength (0.1541 nm), the full-width at half-maximum intensity in X-ray diffractograms (rad), and the half of diffraction peak angle (aprox.12.7 for anatase crystal facet 101).The crystal sizes obtained from this equation for all synthesized catalysts are shown in Table 2. From data in this table it may be inferred that the crystal sizes reported are compatible with those found by other groups 10,23,37.Likewise, it may be appreciated that, except for the TTIPisopropyl alcohol-Pd combinations (with crystal sizes between 22.82-26.57nm), all synthesized catalysts have smaller crystallite sizes than the commercial catalyst (19.97 nm).This reduction in crystallite size with metal doping has also been observed in traditional methods of synthesis 39.Further, Table 2 also shows that, apparently, neither titania precursor, nor alcohol, nor degree of metal doping affect crystallite size, which also occurs in synthesis according to conventional hydrothermal methods 27. Then, according to XRD analyses, catalysts synthesized from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination should be those exhibiting the best photocatalytic activity since its high crystallinity favours the transfer of photoelectrons and hinders the recombination between photoinduced electrons and holes. The specific surface area is the total surface area of a material (m 2 ) per unit of mass (g).It is a parameter commonly used to determine the type and properties of a material regarding adsorption, heterogeneous catalysis, and reactions on surfaces.It has been calculated in this work using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption procedure, one of the most widely applied methods to determine the parameter. The specific surface areas of synthesized catalysts are presented in Table 3.It can be appreciated in such table that the catalysts obtained from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination exhibit the lowest values.This result is obviously related to its higher crystallinity, as indicated above.On the contrary, as expected, catalysts with lower crystallinities show larger surface areas.All these values of surface areas are similar to those reported by groups synthesizing TiO 2 with supercritical fluids 32, and larger than those catalysts obtained with conventional hydrothermal methods 33. It is also worth mentioning that surface area decreases as metal loading increases.Vaiano et al. 37 observed this same trend when preparing Pd/TiO 2 catalysts with increasing Pd loading percentages from 0.5 to 1.5 wt..They explained this decrease in BET area in terms of a partial coverage of TiO 2 by metal species. Definitely, in accordance to previous reasoning, if only surface areas were taken into account, the ideal photocatalysts should be those resulting from either the TTIP-ethanol-Pd combination or the combinations with DIPBAT.Nevertheless, it should also be considered the Chen and Mao 34 warning, according to which photocatalytic processes have the particular feature that the surface is a defective site.As a consequence, the larger the surface area, the faster the recombination probability.For this reason, a large surface area does not necessarily imply a high photocatalytic activity. In UV-vis spectroscopy analysis we have observed for all synthesized catalysts a shift of the absorbance curve to visible range when the commercial catalyst is taken as a reference (Fig. 4).Generally speaking, a shift towards the visible in the absorption threshold is often taken as direct evidence of enhanced photocatalytic activity with solar or visible irradiation 40. Fig. 4 also shows that the absorbances in the visible range of catalysts synthesized from the combination DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd increase up to 14 times (in relation to that of the commercial catalyst).Next come catalysts from the DIPBAT-isopropyl alcohol-Pd and TTIP-ethanol-Pd combinations (10-fold increases) and, finally, those from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination (only 5fold).On the other hand, for all synthesis combinations employed, Fig. 4 also shows that the level of absorbance at visible range increases as dopant percentage added increases. Moreover, Fig. 4 illustrates the appearance of one additional absorption edge at about 500 nm, more pronounced in those catalysts from the combinations with higher increase in the visible range.According to Gracia et al. 40, when more than one absorption edge appears in the spectra the catalyst behaves as a mixture of compounds with different absorption thresholds.This result should be connected to the appearance of PdO species in XRD spectra.As indicated at that time, the formation of PdO surface clusters may be imputed to the low solubility of Pd acetylacetonate in supercritical CO 2 36 and may negatively affect the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst 37.This is a subject to be later confirmed through the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction experiments presented in Section 3.3.At this point, we should note that the appearance of shoulder peaks is not exclusive of supercritical catalyst synthesis; they have also been observed in the synthesis of Cr/TiO 2 by means of conventional impregnation methods 41. UV-vis DRS spectra shown in Fig. 4 may also be used to calculate absorption thresholds and band gap energies of the synthesized catalysts.Specifically, the absorption threshold can be determined from the intersection of x-axis and a line tangent to the absorption curve where the slope is at a maximum 40.Regarding the band gap (E g ), it can be calculated from E g hc/, where h is the Planck's constant (4.1356673310 -15 eV s), c the light speed (310 5 km/s), and the absorption threshold (nm) 42.Both absorption thresholds and band gap energies are presented in Table 2. It can be appreciated in such table that the values of the absorption thresholds of Pd/TiO 2 catalysts synthesized in this work are higher (408-566 nm) than the corresponding to the commercial catalyst (407 nm) and similar to those reported by Vaiano et al. 37 for Pd/TiO 2 catalysts with Pd concentrations in the 0-5-1.5 wt. range.On the other hand, Table 2 also shows that the values of the absorption thresholds and the amount of Pd in the catalysts follow parallel variations, i.e., the absorption threshold increases when the Pd concentration in the catalyst is raised.Further, Table 2 data confirm that the combination of reactants leading to the catalyst with highest mean absorption value is DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd.This last finding confirms a favourable effect earlier observed on absorption thresholds when ethanol is used as hydrolytic agent in the synthesis of catalysts 12. To place a scale on absorbance improvement, it is comparable to the third generation of TiO 2 catalysts obtained by non-metal doping (N) with conventional techniques.This generation of catalysts always show a larger displacement to visible range than the second generation (metal doped TiO 2 -based catalysts) 43. Regarding the band gap energy, all synthesized catalysts show values in the range 2.194-3.038eV.The combination leading to the catalyst with the lowest band gap is DIPBAT-ethanol-3 wt. Pd (2.194 eV), in consistency with the results by Vaiano et al. 37, who give values 2.2-2.3 eV for 1.5 wt. Pt/TiO 2 .The rest of combinations can be divided into two types: those with band gap 0.2-0.3eV lower than commercial catalyst (TTIP-ethanol-Pd and DIPBAT-isopropyl alcohol-Pd) and those with similar band gap to commercial catalyst (TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd). Concerning the influence of precursors on the values of band gap energies, as can be seen in Table 2, combinations with DIP-BAT exhibit lower values than combinations with TTIP (average value 2.657 vs. 2.945 eV).This same trend has been observed with catalysts synthesized in absence of metal (not shown).Thus, TTIPisopropyl alcohol (with or without Pd) is the only combination that does not show any improvement of absorbance in visible range.However, it appears that it can be compensated through its very high crystallinity, given the good values of CO produc- tion rates shown in Section 3.3.Trying to explain the differences observed between precursors is complex, since both compounds share chemical similarities except for the presence of acetylacetonate (-diketone) ligands in DIPBAT, which leads to slower hydrolysis than TTIP 9.Moreover, the bibliography about the use of TTIP and DIPBAT in syntheses in supercritical media is scarce. Then, according to the parameters previously outlined, the catalyst that would exhibit the best features from the viewpoint of light absorption would be that obtained from the DIPBATethanol-3 wt. Pd combination, since it shows the highest level of absorbance in visible range, the highest absorption threshold at a higher wavelength, and the lowest band gap energy. However, in accordance with results presented above, there are two important features of this catalyst that should also be considered when analysing its behaviour in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.On the one side, its band gap could be too low to take part in a reduction reaction and, on the other side, its additional absorption edge could hinder the photocatalytic process.Nevertheless, taking into account the results of the photocatalytic reduction shown below, it may be stated that neither of them seems to negatively affect the process. Fig. 5 shows the FTIR spectrum of commercial catalyst.It can be seen that a single peak appears around 690 cm -1 corresponding to Ti O Ti bonds 44.Fig. 5 also shows the FTIR spectrum of catalyst synthesized in this work from the DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 1 combination.As shown, it exhibits an additional peak around 1625 cm -1 and a wide band centred at 3000 cm -1 , which can be attributed to stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups and water on catalyst surface 45,46.In this sense, it should be noticed that the presence of these species is usually favourable for photocatalytic process 17.Since very similar spectra to those shown in Fig. 5 for the combination DIPBATetanol-Pd 1 were attained for other combinations of reagents, it cannot be said that these species appear preferably for a certain precursor or alcohol. It should be noted that this type of double-peak structure is also rather commonly observed for anatase and rutile powders obtained with conventional methods of synthesis 47. The mean particle size is an important parameter in catalytic processes.It has a significant effect on surface area, and therefore in the catalytic process, since it provides contact surface between catalyst, light, and reactants 9,10,48. The catalysts synthesized in this work have a mean size higher than the commercial catalyst (for instance, 6 m for the catalyst from the combination DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 3 vs. 3 m for commercial Degussa P-25), a result in accordance with SEM images shown in Figs. 1 and2. Obviously, this result depends on the synthesis conditions.In particular, it has been observed that the effect of DIPBAT and TTIP precursors is smaller than those corresponding to the hydrolytic agent and dopant concentration.Specifically, the introduction of ethanol and increasing amounts of dopant agent have produced increases in both particle size and aggregation 9. Nevertheless, it should be highlighted at this point that in conventional hydrothermal synthesis a severe agglomeration process usually occurs and leads to larger particle sizes than those synthesized with supercritical fluids 33. In brief, according to findings reported above and considering that decreasing particle sizes improve TiO 2 surface properties, the commercial catalyst should show better photocatalytic activity than synthesized catalysts if such activity depended only on this variable 17. Experiments performed to determine the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized catalysts in the reduction of CO 2 were conducted in a thin-film fixed-bed reactor using water vapour in order to avoid the problems derived from the use of liquid water: low solubility of CO 2 and competitive reactions occurrence.The reaction conditions used were optimized in a previous work 12: 20-40 mg catalyst mass, water vapour/CO 2 ratio 2/7, and operation times 3-4 h. The main advantages of thin-film fixed-bed reactors are that the uniformly dispersed immobilized photocatalyst offers a high specific reactive surface area, a highly effective use of light energy, and agitation is not necessary to prevent catalyst sedimentation, as is the case in fluidised bed reactors, which are employed in systems with liquid water 49. The main reaction products were CH 4 and CO, although traces of ethane were also found with the catalyst synthesized from the DIPBAT-ethanol-1 wt. Pd combination of reactants.These results agree with those reported by other groups working under similar conditions 23,50 and are consistent with widely described CO 2 reduction mechanisms 23. This narrow variety of reaction products (CO, methane, and ethane) and the absence of O 2 in GC measurements may be explained by considering that, during the CO 2 reduction with water to produce methane, oxygen from water may oxidize certain CO 2 reduction products (for example methane to methanol) that are further oxidized in the presence of photocatalysts (noble metalsloaded TiO 2 ) very active in the photocatalytic oxidation of methanol 37. As Table 4 depicts, the production of methane is larger compared to that of CO, a common result when TiO 2 is doped with metals 35.With the purpose of comparison this table also shows the CH 4 and CO production rates (0.075 and 2.014 mol/g/h, respectively) of the catalyst of reference, the commercial catalyst Degussa P-25.It can be seen that all experiments with Pd/TiO 2 lead to methane production rates from 3 to 22 times higher than that of the commercial catalyst. These results imply that when doping with Pd a TiO 2 catalyst the photoactivity of resulting catalyst towards methane production improves, a fact which is in line with data published by other investigators.In fact, a number of groups have recently concluded that the introduction of Pd enhances the selectivity of the process towards CH 4 23,50,51. The catalyst leading to the highest methane production rate is that synthesized from the DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 3 wt.combination of reactants.It should be noted that this catalyst (and, in general, all combinations with DIPBAT) had already exhibited superior characteristics, as shown in Table S1 ordering the three best catalysts of those used in the sixteen photocatalytic experiments performed, from best to worst, according to the value of the property analysed.In particular, it can be appreciated in the table that characteristics that make this catalyst better than others are: small particle size, morphology (polyhedral), low band gap energy and relatively high surface area. Regarding the influence of these properties of catalysts on the CO 2 photocatalytic reaction, it should be noted that the higher surface area is, the more reactants molecules are adsorbed and the more quickly electrons can reach them.This results in smaller recombination probability and higher products yield 52.In connection with this property, it should also be noted that the presence of basic species (hydroxyl groups) on catalyst surface mentioned in Section 3.2 leads to stronger interactions with CO 2 and higher uptake of this gas 52,53.A low band gap energy is also a desired feature since it improves light absorption and charge carrier generation 52,54555657. Finally, polyhedral particle shapes have shown higher activity than rounded particles due to the higher density of catalytically active sites, although it has not yet been fully explained 31. If one looks at reaction time, the methane production rate is always improved when time increases from 3 to 4 h.In the current case, this increase of time is also beneficial to obtaining traces of ethane when DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 1 wt. combination is assessed 50. On the other side, we have also reported in text and in Table S1 that the catalyst obtained from the combination TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd 1 wt. displayed good features related to morphology (small polyhedral-like particles) and crystallinity (high crystallinity and large crystallite size).This high crystallinity is connected with good semiconductor properties.Probably because of this, the catalyst from this combination allowed obtaining CO production rates almost twice (1.7 times higher) that of commercial catalyst Degussa P-25. Regarding the CO production rates, it should also be noted that catalysts from reactants combinations with DIPBAT always led to lower values than those obtained from combinations with TTIP.Unfortunately, it is not clear at this moment how titania precursor affects CO reduction and methane production 58. With the aim of solving some issues raised in previous sections, we can also state that: -An increase in Pd loading enhances the selectivity towards methane (in DIPBAT combinations, methane production rates is up to 4 times higher when Pd loading changes from 1 to 3 wt.).-In this sense, the presence of PdO discovered through XRD and UV-vis DRS analyses does not seem to greatly affect the photocatalytic activity of catalysts, contrary to observed by Vaiano et al. 37.At least, it does not counteract the positive features for photocatalysis exhibited by these catalysts. In order to compare our results with those obtained by other groups working with Pd/TiO 2 , Table 5 shows some results from bibliography.It can be observed that methane and carbon monoxide production rates obtained with Pd/TiO 2 nanoparticles synthesized in CO 2 supercritical medium are generally higher than those obtained using Pd/TiO 2 nanoparticles and conventional photoreactors.However, it should be noted that other investigators 37,59 have reported higher rates when using more sophisticated systems, for example mixtures of TiO 2 and glass spheres in a fluidized bed reactor."}, {"llm generation": "water", "source": "Regarding the performance of these catalysts in the CO 2 photoreduction process with water, the main final products obtained have been methane and carbon monoxide, a result consistent with CO 2 reduction mechanisms described in the literature 23.", "context": "Photocatalysts with similar or better features than commercial TiO 2 have been produced by means of a green synthesis in supercritical media, a synthesis procedure able to offer both excellent environmental and scaling-up benefits. Regarding the performance of these catalysts in the CO 2 photoreduction process with water, the main final products obtained have been methane and carbon monoxide, a result consistent with CO 2 reduction mechanisms described in the literature 23.In particular, CH 4 and CO production rates with catalysts synthesized in this work are higher than those obtained using Pd/TiO 2 nanoparticles synthesized by classical methods and conventional photoreactors.Results of the comparison are even better when commercial catalyst (Degussa P-25) is used as a reference.In this case CH 4 and CO production rates are up to 22 and 1.7 times higher, respectively. Obviously, conversion rates are still smaller than those required for the catalysts to be applicable to commercial scale.Nevertheless, experiments with Cu/TiO 2 and more sophisticated catalysts are currently being conducted in our labs in order to achieve this goal.In this sense, it is foreseeable that the improved performance of Cu/TiO 2 in both CO 2 adsorption and charge carrier separation in comparison to other metals will lead to higher methane production rates 51,60.

The synthesis of photocatalysts in supercritical CO 2 was performed in an ad hoc designed experimental set-up described elsewhere 12.Synthesis conditions were pressure 20 MPa, temperature 300 C, molar ratio 28 mmol alcohol/mmol precursor and reaction time 2 h 9.Palladium acetylacetonate was added also in an appropriate amount to reach final Pd concentrations in the synthesized catalyst in the range 1-3 wt.. These experimental conditions were optimized by Alonso et al. 9 to ensure a highly pure catalyst, with good crystallinity of the solids obtained, a suitable particle size and the exclusive presence of anatase phase.Crystallinity seems to be prima facie the property with a higher influence on photocatalytic activity for TiO 2 in absence of metal. Solids obtained were removed from the reactor and dried at 105 C for 12 h.Then they were calcinated at 400 C during 6 h to remove C pollution 21.The limit in the calcination temperature is given by the transition from anatase to rutile phases, which takes place at about 700 C 22. The Pd/TiO 2 catalysts were characterized with different techniques.A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Jeol 6490 LV) was used to observe particle size and external morphology of the particles.An X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, Philips X'Pert MPD) was employed to determine crystallinity and crystalline phase of the powders, and crystallite size was estimated from Scherrer equation using the X-ray diffraction peak at 2 25.4 .A BET area analyser (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020) was used to evaluate the specific surface area of the powders.A diffuse reflectance (DR) UV-vis spec-trophotometer (Jasco, V650) was employed to obtain absorbance thresholds and band gap energies.A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet, Avatar 370 FT-IR) was used to obtain FTIR spectra of all samples.Finally, particle size was calculated in a laser scattering particle size distribution analyser (Malvern, Mastersizer 2000). The photocatalytic activity of the materials produced was tested using an ad hoc designed experimental set-up where the photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction experiments were performed.Briefly, this installation consists of a thin-film fixed-bed reactor (stainless steel chamber with volume 50 ml) having valves for gas feeding, evacuation and connection to a GC-TCD/FID system, an Oring sealed quartz window at the top for admitting radiation from a Xe arc lamp, a bubbler containing deionized water to moisten CO 2 before entering the reaction chamber and a dew point transmitter and a manometer to measure the relative humidity and pressure, respectively, during the reaction 12.Inside, there is a stainless steel grid to support the filter where the solid catalysts are placed.Prior to each experiment, 50 mg of catalyst was suspended in 1 l of deionized water, and the suspension was filtered through a glass microfiber filter (diameter 47 mm, pore size 0.45 m).The filter containing the uniformly dispersed solid catalyst was dried at 105 C for 12 h before being introduced in the reactor. The experiments have been performed with a water vapour/CO 2 ratio 2/7, a catalyst weight 30 5 mg, and initial absolute pressure in the reactor 1.07 bar.Reaction times of 3 and 4 h have been used.In previous experiments with greater weight of commercial catalyst it has been observed that light penetration was reduced by scattering 23, whereas the optimum vapour/CO 2 molar ratio is a compromise between the presence of enough reducing agent (water) and the process inhibition 24,25.Regarding the operation pressure, in this work and most systems working with water vapour, atmospheric pressure is used because CO 2 solubility (and therefore CO 2 conversion) does not increase with pressure, in contrast to what occurs in systems with liquid water 25262728.Finally, the operation temperature used is the equilibrium temperature reached with the lamp (40 C).Although a higher temperature may be beneficial to this reaction because of the enhanced desorption of products, the adsorption of reactants on catalyst surface would be also suppressed at high temperatures 29. The nature and concentration of the different species in the reaction chamber (CO, CO 2 , CH 4 , light hydrocarbons, light alcohols, ethers and ketones) were determined with a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent GC 7890A) provided with two thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) and one flame ionization detector (FID) with methanizer.H 2 could not be analysed in the system because of technical limitations."}, {"llm generation": "Fixed-bed", "source": "Experiments performed to determine the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized catalysts in the reduction of CO 2 were conducted in a thin-film fixed-bed reactor using water vapour in order to avoid the problems derived from the use of liquid water: low solubility of CO 2 and competitive reactions occurrence.", "context": "In this study, the yield is defined as the ratio between the moles of catalyst produced (during its synthesis process in supercritical CO 2 ) and the moles of precursor used, taking into account that the synthesis reaction for both precursors is 1:1 (1 mol precursor:1 mol product). Table 1 shows that yields are within the 50-75 range and that the lower values are obtained when DIPBAT is used as TiO 2 precursor in the synthesis.Most probably it is due to the superior thermal and kinetic stability of DIPBAT molecule in contrast to more easily hydrolysable TTIP molecule 9.Regarding the effect of the hydrolytic agent, ethanol leads to larger yields, probably due to the higher polarity of this alcohol 9. Finally, the level of metal loading does not seem to affect the yield within the interval specified. Fig. 2 shows SEM images of some of the synthesized catalysts.It can be appreciated that the morphology of synthesized Pd/TiO 2 particles is spherical when DIPBAT is used as precursor.Specifically, these photographs show well-defined spheres with particle diameters of about 2-4 m (Fig. 2a andb).In principle, these small particle sizes will lead to large specific areas, which is a positive feature connected with a good photocatalytic activity 30. In contrast, when TTIP is used as precursor the solids obtained are polyhedral-like particles (Fig. 2c andd).According to the literature, these polyhedral-like shapes are usually related to a higher photocatalytic activity, as compared with that of rounded shapes 31. Further, Fig. 2 also illustrates that these results on particle shape are independent on the alcohol used in the synthesis. Regarding the relationship between particle size and alcohol used in the catalyst synthesis, Fig. 2 shows that particles are slightly larger when ethanol is employed.Finally, concerning the influence of Pd concentration on particle morphology, a certain agglomeration degree (not shown) has been found for the larger values of the variable. On the basis of the above comments, it may be concluded that, from the viewpoint of particle shape and size, the catalyst with the best photocatalytic activity should be that obtained from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination. It should be noted that the particle sizes and shapes reported above are similar to those obtained by our group 12 and other groups synthesizing TiO 2 -based particles with supercritical fluids 9,10,32.These sizes are smaller than those for materials obtained by conventional hydrothermal synthesis, where a severe agglomeration phenomenon is facilitated 33.It should also be highlighted that the particle size of catalysts synthesized in this work are slightly larger than that of the commercial catalyst (Fig. 1). Selected XRD diffractograms of synthesized catalysts are displayed in Fig. 3.It shows that catalysts obtained from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination of reactants possess the highest crystallinity (largest peak height and resolution), very similar to that of commercial catalyst (Fig. 1).Further, Fig. 3a-c also show that the doping percentage does not significantly influence crystallinity.All these samples obtained by supercritical fluid method exhibit a better crystal quality than the corresponding catalysts synthesized with a traditional method 34.It can also be observed in Fig. 3 that diffraction peaks always appear at 2 25.4 , 37.8 , 48.5 , 54.0 , 55.4 , 62.9 o , 68.9 , 70.3 , and 75.2 , an indicator of that allotropic anatase phase is the most common in catalysts synthesized in this work.However, it is noteworthy the presence of an additional peak (at 2 33 ) that does not correspond to anatase 9,12,17,35.This peak may have its origin in the low solubility of Pd acetylacetonate in supercritical CO 2 36 and is small in comparison with the rest, but it increases as metal loading in catalyst does.Accordingly, it may be suggested that the peak probably corresponds to the appearance of PdO species, which are expected to be worse distributed as the Pd percentage in the catalyst increases 37.Although the results of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 should be still analysed, it is interesting to advance that some studies relate the presence of PdO surface clusters to a decline in the photocatalytic activity of the catalysts 37. Concerning crystallite size (D), an indicator of the crystalline quality of the particles, it can be calculated with the Scherrer expression 38, defined as: D 0.9/cos.In this equation D represents the average crystal size (nm), the X-ray wavelength (0.1541 nm), the full-width at half-maximum intensity in X-ray diffractograms (rad), and the half of diffraction peak angle (aprox.12.7 for anatase crystal facet 101).The crystal sizes obtained from this equation for all synthesized catalysts are shown in Table 2. From data in this table it may be inferred that the crystal sizes reported are compatible with those found by other groups 10,23,37.Likewise, it may be appreciated that, except for the TTIPisopropyl alcohol-Pd combinations (with crystal sizes between 22.82-26.57nm), all synthesized catalysts have smaller crystallite sizes than the commercial catalyst (19.97 nm).This reduction in crystallite size with metal doping has also been observed in traditional methods of synthesis 39.Further, Table 2 also shows that, apparently, neither titania precursor, nor alcohol, nor degree of metal doping affect crystallite size, which also occurs in synthesis according to conventional hydrothermal methods 27. Then, according to XRD analyses, catalysts synthesized from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination should be those exhibiting the best photocatalytic activity since its high crystallinity favours the transfer of photoelectrons and hinders the recombination between photoinduced electrons and holes. The specific surface area is the total surface area of a material (m 2 ) per unit of mass (g).It is a parameter commonly used to determine the type and properties of a material regarding adsorption, heterogeneous catalysis, and reactions on surfaces.It has been calculated in this work using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption procedure, one of the most widely applied methods to determine the parameter. The specific surface areas of synthesized catalysts are presented in Table 3.It can be appreciated in such table that the catalysts obtained from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination exhibit the lowest values.This result is obviously related to its higher crystallinity, as indicated above.On the contrary, as expected, catalysts with lower crystallinities show larger surface areas.All these values of surface areas are similar to those reported by groups synthesizing TiO 2 with supercritical fluids 32, and larger than those catalysts obtained with conventional hydrothermal methods 33. It is also worth mentioning that surface area decreases as metal loading increases.Vaiano et al. 37 observed this same trend when preparing Pd/TiO 2 catalysts with increasing Pd loading percentages from 0.5 to 1.5 wt..They explained this decrease in BET area in terms of a partial coverage of TiO 2 by metal species. Definitely, in accordance to previous reasoning, if only surface areas were taken into account, the ideal photocatalysts should be those resulting from either the TTIP-ethanol-Pd combination or the combinations with DIPBAT.Nevertheless, it should also be considered the Chen and Mao 34 warning, according to which photocatalytic processes have the particular feature that the surface is a defective site.As a consequence, the larger the surface area, the faster the recombination probability.For this reason, a large surface area does not necessarily imply a high photocatalytic activity. In UV-vis spectroscopy analysis we have observed for all synthesized catalysts a shift of the absorbance curve to visible range when the commercial catalyst is taken as a reference (Fig. 4).Generally speaking, a shift towards the visible in the absorption threshold is often taken as direct evidence of enhanced photocatalytic activity with solar or visible irradiation 40. Fig. 4 also shows that the absorbances in the visible range of catalysts synthesized from the combination DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd increase up to 14 times (in relation to that of the commercial catalyst).Next come catalysts from the DIPBAT-isopropyl alcohol-Pd and TTIP-ethanol-Pd combinations (10-fold increases) and, finally, those from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination (only 5fold).On the other hand, for all synthesis combinations employed, Fig. 4 also shows that the level of absorbance at visible range increases as dopant percentage added increases. Moreover, Fig. 4 illustrates the appearance of one additional absorption edge at about 500 nm, more pronounced in those catalysts from the combinations with higher increase in the visible range.According to Gracia et al. 40, when more than one absorption edge appears in the spectra the catalyst behaves as a mixture of compounds with different absorption thresholds.This result should be connected to the appearance of PdO species in XRD spectra.As indicated at that time, the formation of PdO surface clusters may be imputed to the low solubility of Pd acetylacetonate in supercritical CO 2 36 and may negatively affect the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst 37.This is a subject to be later confirmed through the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction experiments presented in Section 3.3.At this point, we should note that the appearance of shoulder peaks is not exclusive of supercritical catalyst synthesis; they have also been observed in the synthesis of Cr/TiO 2 by means of conventional impregnation methods 41. UV-vis DRS spectra shown in Fig. 4 may also be used to calculate absorption thresholds and band gap energies of the synthesized catalysts.Specifically, the absorption threshold can be determined from the intersection of x-axis and a line tangent to the absorption curve where the slope is at a maximum 40.Regarding the band gap (E g ), it can be calculated from E g hc/, where h is the Planck's constant (4.1356673310 -15 eV s), c the light speed (310 5 km/s), and the absorption threshold (nm) 42.Both absorption thresholds and band gap energies are presented in Table 2. It can be appreciated in such table that the values of the absorption thresholds of Pd/TiO 2 catalysts synthesized in this work are higher (408-566 nm) than the corresponding to the commercial catalyst (407 nm) and similar to those reported by Vaiano et al. 37 for Pd/TiO 2 catalysts with Pd concentrations in the 0-5-1.5 wt. range.On the other hand, Table 2 also shows that the values of the absorption thresholds and the amount of Pd in the catalysts follow parallel variations, i.e., the absorption threshold increases when the Pd concentration in the catalyst is raised.Further, Table 2 data confirm that the combination of reactants leading to the catalyst with highest mean absorption value is DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd.This last finding confirms a favourable effect earlier observed on absorption thresholds when ethanol is used as hydrolytic agent in the synthesis of catalysts 12. To place a scale on absorbance improvement, it is comparable to the third generation of TiO 2 catalysts obtained by non-metal doping (N) with conventional techniques.This generation of catalysts always show a larger displacement to visible range than the second generation (metal doped TiO 2 -based catalysts) 43. Regarding the band gap energy, all synthesized catalysts show values in the range 2.194-3.038eV.The combination leading to the catalyst with the lowest band gap is DIPBAT-ethanol-3 wt. Pd (2.194 eV), in consistency with the results by Vaiano et al. 37, who give values 2.2-2.3 eV for 1.5 wt. Pt/TiO 2 .The rest of combinations can be divided into two types: those with band gap 0.2-0.3eV lower than commercial catalyst (TTIP-ethanol-Pd and DIPBAT-isopropyl alcohol-Pd) and those with similar band gap to commercial catalyst (TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd). Concerning the influence of precursors on the values of band gap energies, as can be seen in Table 2, combinations with DIP-BAT exhibit lower values than combinations with TTIP (average value 2.657 vs. 2.945 eV).This same trend has been observed with catalysts synthesized in absence of metal (not shown).Thus, TTIPisopropyl alcohol (with or without Pd) is the only combination that does not show any improvement of absorbance in visible range.However, it appears that it can be compensated through its very high crystallinity, given the good values of CO produc- tion rates shown in Section 3.3.Trying to explain the differences observed between precursors is complex, since both compounds share chemical similarities except for the presence of acetylacetonate (-diketone) ligands in DIPBAT, which leads to slower hydrolysis than TTIP 9.Moreover, the bibliography about the use of TTIP and DIPBAT in syntheses in supercritical media is scarce. Then, according to the parameters previously outlined, the catalyst that would exhibit the best features from the viewpoint of light absorption would be that obtained from the DIPBATethanol-3 wt. Pd combination, since it shows the highest level of absorbance in visible range, the highest absorption threshold at a higher wavelength, and the lowest band gap energy. However, in accordance with results presented above, there are two important features of this catalyst that should also be considered when analysing its behaviour in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.On the one side, its band gap could be too low to take part in a reduction reaction and, on the other side, its additional absorption edge could hinder the photocatalytic process.Nevertheless, taking into account the results of the photocatalytic reduction shown below, it may be stated that neither of them seems to negatively affect the process. Fig. 5 shows the FTIR spectrum of commercial catalyst.It can be seen that a single peak appears around 690 cm -1 corresponding to Ti O Ti bonds 44.Fig. 5 also shows the FTIR spectrum of catalyst synthesized in this work from the DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 1 combination.As shown, it exhibits an additional peak around 1625 cm -1 and a wide band centred at 3000 cm -1 , which can be attributed to stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups and water on catalyst surface 45,46.In this sense, it should be noticed that the presence of these species is usually favourable for photocatalytic process 17.Since very similar spectra to those shown in Fig. 5 for the combination DIPBATetanol-Pd 1 were attained for other combinations of reagents, it cannot be said that these species appear preferably for a certain precursor or alcohol. It should be noted that this type of double-peak structure is also rather commonly observed for anatase and rutile powders obtained with conventional methods of synthesis 47. The mean particle size is an important parameter in catalytic processes.It has a significant effect on surface area, and therefore in the catalytic process, since it provides contact surface between catalyst, light, and reactants 9,10,48. The catalysts synthesized in this work have a mean size higher than the commercial catalyst (for instance, 6 m for the catalyst from the combination DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 3 vs. 3 m for commercial Degussa P-25), a result in accordance with SEM images shown in Figs. 1 and2. Obviously, this result depends on the synthesis conditions.In particular, it has been observed that the effect of DIPBAT and TTIP precursors is smaller than those corresponding to the hydrolytic agent and dopant concentration.Specifically, the introduction of ethanol and increasing amounts of dopant agent have produced increases in both particle size and aggregation 9. Nevertheless, it should be highlighted at this point that in conventional hydrothermal synthesis a severe agglomeration process usually occurs and leads to larger particle sizes than those synthesized with supercritical fluids 33. In brief, according to findings reported above and considering that decreasing particle sizes improve TiO 2 surface properties, the commercial catalyst should show better photocatalytic activity than synthesized catalysts if such activity depended only on this variable 17. Experiments performed to determine the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized catalysts in the reduction of CO 2 were conducted in a thin-film fixed-bed reactor using water vapour in order to avoid the problems derived from the use of liquid water: low solubility of CO 2 and competitive reactions occurrence.The reaction conditions used were optimized in a previous work 12: 20-40 mg catalyst mass, water vapour/CO 2 ratio 2/7, and operation times 3-4 h. The main advantages of thin-film fixed-bed reactors are that the uniformly dispersed immobilized photocatalyst offers a high specific reactive surface area, a highly effective use of light energy, and agitation is not necessary to prevent catalyst sedimentation, as is the case in fluidised bed reactors, which are employed in systems with liquid water 49. The main reaction products were CH 4 and CO, although traces of ethane were also found with the catalyst synthesized from the DIPBAT-ethanol-1 wt. Pd combination of reactants.These results agree with those reported by other groups working under similar conditions 23,50 and are consistent with widely described CO 2 reduction mechanisms 23. This narrow variety of reaction products (CO, methane, and ethane) and the absence of O 2 in GC measurements may be explained by considering that, during the CO 2 reduction with water to produce methane, oxygen from water may oxidize certain CO 2 reduction products (for example methane to methanol) that are further oxidized in the presence of photocatalysts (noble metalsloaded TiO 2 ) very active in the photocatalytic oxidation of methanol 37. As Table 4 depicts, the production of methane is larger compared to that of CO, a common result when TiO 2 is doped with metals 35.With the purpose of comparison this table also shows the CH 4 and CO production rates (0.075 and 2.014 mol/g/h, respectively) of the catalyst of reference, the commercial catalyst Degussa P-25.It can be seen that all experiments with Pd/TiO 2 lead to methane production rates from 3 to 22 times higher than that of the commercial catalyst. These results imply that when doping with Pd a TiO 2 catalyst the photoactivity of resulting catalyst towards methane production improves, a fact which is in line with data published by other investigators.In fact, a number of groups have recently concluded that the introduction of Pd enhances the selectivity of the process towards CH 4 23,50,51. The catalyst leading to the highest methane production rate is that synthesized from the DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 3 wt.combination of reactants.It should be noted that this catalyst (and, in general, all combinations with DIPBAT) had already exhibited superior characteristics, as shown in Table S1 ordering the three best catalysts of those used in the sixteen photocatalytic experiments performed, from best to worst, according to the value of the property analysed.In particular, it can be appreciated in the table that characteristics that make this catalyst better than others are: small particle size, morphology (polyhedral), low band gap energy and relatively high surface area. Regarding the influence of these properties of catalysts on the CO 2 photocatalytic reaction, it should be noted that the higher surface area is, the more reactants molecules are adsorbed and the more quickly electrons can reach them.This results in smaller recombination probability and higher products yield 52.In connection with this property, it should also be noted that the presence of basic species (hydroxyl groups) on catalyst surface mentioned in Section 3.2 leads to stronger interactions with CO 2 and higher uptake of this gas 52,53.A low band gap energy is also a desired feature since it improves light absorption and charge carrier generation 52,54555657. Finally, polyhedral particle shapes have shown higher activity than rounded particles due to the higher density of catalytically active sites, although it has not yet been fully explained 31. If one looks at reaction time, the methane production rate is always improved when time increases from 3 to 4 h.In the current case, this increase of time is also beneficial to obtaining traces of ethane when DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 1 wt. combination is assessed 50. On the other side, we have also reported in text and in Table S1 that the catalyst obtained from the combination TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd 1 wt. displayed good features related to morphology (small polyhedral-like particles) and crystallinity (high crystallinity and large crystallite size).This high crystallinity is connected with good semiconductor properties.Probably because of this, the catalyst from this combination allowed obtaining CO production rates almost twice (1.7 times higher) that of commercial catalyst Degussa P-25. Regarding the CO production rates, it should also be noted that catalysts from reactants combinations with DIPBAT always led to lower values than those obtained from combinations with TTIP.Unfortunately, it is not clear at this moment how titania precursor affects CO reduction and methane production 58. With the aim of solving some issues raised in previous sections, we can also state that: -An increase in Pd loading enhances the selectivity towards methane (in DIPBAT combinations, methane production rates is up to 4 times higher when Pd loading changes from 1 to 3 wt.).-In this sense, the presence of PdO discovered through XRD and UV-vis DRS analyses does not seem to greatly affect the photocatalytic activity of catalysts, contrary to observed by Vaiano et al. 37.At least, it does not counteract the positive features for photocatalysis exhibited by these catalysts. In order to compare our results with those obtained by other groups working with Pd/TiO 2 , Table 5 shows some results from bibliography.It can be observed that methane and carbon monoxide production rates obtained with Pd/TiO 2 nanoparticles synthesized in CO 2 supercritical medium are generally higher than those obtained using Pd/TiO 2 nanoparticles and conventional photoreactors.However, it should be noted that other investigators 37,59 have reported higher rates when using more sophisticated systems, for example mixtures of TiO 2 and glass spheres in a fluidized bed reactor."}, {"llm generation": "Fluidised-bed", "source": "The main advantages of thin-film fixed-bed reactors are that the uniformly dispersed immobilized photocatalyst offers a high specific reactive surface area, a highly effective use of light energy, and agitation is not necessary to prevent catalyst sedimentation, as is the case in fluidised bed reactors, which are employed in systems with liquid water 49.", "context": "In this study, the yield is defined as the ratio between the moles of catalyst produced (during its synthesis process in supercritical CO 2 ) and the moles of precursor used, taking into account that the synthesis reaction for both precursors is 1:1 (1 mol precursor:1 mol product). Table 1 shows that yields are within the 50-75 range and that the lower values are obtained when DIPBAT is used as TiO 2 precursor in the synthesis.Most probably it is due to the superior thermal and kinetic stability of DIPBAT molecule in contrast to more easily hydrolysable TTIP molecule 9.Regarding the effect of the hydrolytic agent, ethanol leads to larger yields, probably due to the higher polarity of this alcohol 9. Finally, the level of metal loading does not seem to affect the yield within the interval specified. Fig. 2 shows SEM images of some of the synthesized catalysts.It can be appreciated that the morphology of synthesized Pd/TiO 2 particles is spherical when DIPBAT is used as precursor.Specifically, these photographs show well-defined spheres with particle diameters of about 2-4 m (Fig. 2a andb).In principle, these small particle sizes will lead to large specific areas, which is a positive feature connected with a good photocatalytic activity 30. In contrast, when TTIP is used as precursor the solids obtained are polyhedral-like particles (Fig. 2c andd).According to the literature, these polyhedral-like shapes are usually related to a higher photocatalytic activity, as compared with that of rounded shapes 31. Further, Fig. 2 also illustrates that these results on particle shape are independent on the alcohol used in the synthesis. Regarding the relationship between particle size and alcohol used in the catalyst synthesis, Fig. 2 shows that particles are slightly larger when ethanol is employed.Finally, concerning the influence of Pd concentration on particle morphology, a certain agglomeration degree (not shown) has been found for the larger values of the variable. On the basis of the above comments, it may be concluded that, from the viewpoint of particle shape and size, the catalyst with the best photocatalytic activity should be that obtained from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination. It should be noted that the particle sizes and shapes reported above are similar to those obtained by our group 12 and other groups synthesizing TiO 2 -based particles with supercritical fluids 9,10,32.These sizes are smaller than those for materials obtained by conventional hydrothermal synthesis, where a severe agglomeration phenomenon is facilitated 33.It should also be highlighted that the particle size of catalysts synthesized in this work are slightly larger than that of the commercial catalyst (Fig. 1). Selected XRD diffractograms of synthesized catalysts are displayed in Fig. 3.It shows that catalysts obtained from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination of reactants possess the highest crystallinity (largest peak height and resolution), very similar to that of commercial catalyst (Fig. 1).Further, Fig. 3a-c also show that the doping percentage does not significantly influence crystallinity.All these samples obtained by supercritical fluid method exhibit a better crystal quality than the corresponding catalysts synthesized with a traditional method 34.It can also be observed in Fig. 3 that diffraction peaks always appear at 2 25.4 , 37.8 , 48.5 , 54.0 , 55.4 , 62.9 o , 68.9 , 70.3 , and 75.2 , an indicator of that allotropic anatase phase is the most common in catalysts synthesized in this work.However, it is noteworthy the presence of an additional peak (at 2 33 ) that does not correspond to anatase 9,12,17,35.This peak may have its origin in the low solubility of Pd acetylacetonate in supercritical CO 2 36 and is small in comparison with the rest, but it increases as metal loading in catalyst does.Accordingly, it may be suggested that the peak probably corresponds to the appearance of PdO species, which are expected to be worse distributed as the Pd percentage in the catalyst increases 37.Although the results of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 should be still analysed, it is interesting to advance that some studies relate the presence of PdO surface clusters to a decline in the photocatalytic activity of the catalysts 37. Concerning crystallite size (D), an indicator of the crystalline quality of the particles, it can be calculated with the Scherrer expression 38, defined as: D 0.9/cos.In this equation D represents the average crystal size (nm), the X-ray wavelength (0.1541 nm), the full-width at half-maximum intensity in X-ray diffractograms (rad), and the half of diffraction peak angle (aprox.12.7 for anatase crystal facet 101).The crystal sizes obtained from this equation for all synthesized catalysts are shown in Table 2. From data in this table it may be inferred that the crystal sizes reported are compatible with those found by other groups 10,23,37.Likewise, it may be appreciated that, except for the TTIPisopropyl alcohol-Pd combinations (with crystal sizes between 22.82-26.57nm), all synthesized catalysts have smaller crystallite sizes than the commercial catalyst (19.97 nm).This reduction in crystallite size with metal doping has also been observed in traditional methods of synthesis 39.Further, Table 2 also shows that, apparently, neither titania precursor, nor alcohol, nor degree of metal doping affect crystallite size, which also occurs in synthesis according to conventional hydrothermal methods 27. Then, according to XRD analyses, catalysts synthesized from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination should be those exhibiting the best photocatalytic activity since its high crystallinity favours the transfer of photoelectrons and hinders the recombination between photoinduced electrons and holes. The specific surface area is the total surface area of a material (m 2 ) per unit of mass (g).It is a parameter commonly used to determine the type and properties of a material regarding adsorption, heterogeneous catalysis, and reactions on surfaces.It has been calculated in this work using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption procedure, one of the most widely applied methods to determine the parameter. The specific surface areas of synthesized catalysts are presented in Table 3.It can be appreciated in such table that the catalysts obtained from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination exhibit the lowest values.This result is obviously related to its higher crystallinity, as indicated above.On the contrary, as expected, catalysts with lower crystallinities show larger surface areas.All these values of surface areas are similar to those reported by groups synthesizing TiO 2 with supercritical fluids 32, and larger than those catalysts obtained with conventional hydrothermal methods 33. It is also worth mentioning that surface area decreases as metal loading increases.Vaiano et al. 37 observed this same trend when preparing Pd/TiO 2 catalysts with increasing Pd loading percentages from 0.5 to 1.5 wt..They explained this decrease in BET area in terms of a partial coverage of TiO 2 by metal species. Definitely, in accordance to previous reasoning, if only surface areas were taken into account, the ideal photocatalysts should be those resulting from either the TTIP-ethanol-Pd combination or the combinations with DIPBAT.Nevertheless, it should also be considered the Chen and Mao 34 warning, according to which photocatalytic processes have the particular feature that the surface is a defective site.As a consequence, the larger the surface area, the faster the recombination probability.For this reason, a large surface area does not necessarily imply a high photocatalytic activity. In UV-vis spectroscopy analysis we have observed for all synthesized catalysts a shift of the absorbance curve to visible range when the commercial catalyst is taken as a reference (Fig. 4).Generally speaking, a shift towards the visible in the absorption threshold is often taken as direct evidence of enhanced photocatalytic activity with solar or visible irradiation 40. Fig. 4 also shows that the absorbances in the visible range of catalysts synthesized from the combination DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd increase up to 14 times (in relation to that of the commercial catalyst).Next come catalysts from the DIPBAT-isopropyl alcohol-Pd and TTIP-ethanol-Pd combinations (10-fold increases) and, finally, those from the TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd combination (only 5fold).On the other hand, for all synthesis combinations employed, Fig. 4 also shows that the level of absorbance at visible range increases as dopant percentage added increases. Moreover, Fig. 4 illustrates the appearance of one additional absorption edge at about 500 nm, more pronounced in those catalysts from the combinations with higher increase in the visible range.According to Gracia et al. 40, when more than one absorption edge appears in the spectra the catalyst behaves as a mixture of compounds with different absorption thresholds.This result should be connected to the appearance of PdO species in XRD spectra.As indicated at that time, the formation of PdO surface clusters may be imputed to the low solubility of Pd acetylacetonate in supercritical CO 2 36 and may negatively affect the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst 37.This is a subject to be later confirmed through the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction experiments presented in Section 3.3.At this point, we should note that the appearance of shoulder peaks is not exclusive of supercritical catalyst synthesis; they have also been observed in the synthesis of Cr/TiO 2 by means of conventional impregnation methods 41. UV-vis DRS spectra shown in Fig. 4 may also be used to calculate absorption thresholds and band gap energies of the synthesized catalysts.Specifically, the absorption threshold can be determined from the intersection of x-axis and a line tangent to the absorption curve where the slope is at a maximum 40.Regarding the band gap (E g ), it can be calculated from E g hc/, where h is the Planck's constant (4.1356673310 -15 eV s), c the light speed (310 5 km/s), and the absorption threshold (nm) 42.Both absorption thresholds and band gap energies are presented in Table 2. It can be appreciated in such table that the values of the absorption thresholds of Pd/TiO 2 catalysts synthesized in this work are higher (408-566 nm) than the corresponding to the commercial catalyst (407 nm) and similar to those reported by Vaiano et al. 37 for Pd/TiO 2 catalysts with Pd concentrations in the 0-5-1.5 wt. range.On the other hand, Table 2 also shows that the values of the absorption thresholds and the amount of Pd in the catalysts follow parallel variations, i.e., the absorption threshold increases when the Pd concentration in the catalyst is raised.Further, Table 2 data confirm that the combination of reactants leading to the catalyst with highest mean absorption value is DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd.This last finding confirms a favourable effect earlier observed on absorption thresholds when ethanol is used as hydrolytic agent in the synthesis of catalysts 12. To place a scale on absorbance improvement, it is comparable to the third generation of TiO 2 catalysts obtained by non-metal doping (N) with conventional techniques.This generation of catalysts always show a larger displacement to visible range than the second generation (metal doped TiO 2 -based catalysts) 43. Regarding the band gap energy, all synthesized catalysts show values in the range 2.194-3.038eV.The combination leading to the catalyst with the lowest band gap is DIPBAT-ethanol-3 wt. Pd (2.194 eV), in consistency with the results by Vaiano et al. 37, who give values 2.2-2.3 eV for 1.5 wt. Pt/TiO 2 .The rest of combinations can be divided into two types: those with band gap 0.2-0.3eV lower than commercial catalyst (TTIP-ethanol-Pd and DIPBAT-isopropyl alcohol-Pd) and those with similar band gap to commercial catalyst (TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd). Concerning the influence of precursors on the values of band gap energies, as can be seen in Table 2, combinations with DIP-BAT exhibit lower values than combinations with TTIP (average value 2.657 vs. 2.945 eV).This same trend has been observed with catalysts synthesized in absence of metal (not shown).Thus, TTIPisopropyl alcohol (with or without Pd) is the only combination that does not show any improvement of absorbance in visible range.However, it appears that it can be compensated through its very high crystallinity, given the good values of CO produc- tion rates shown in Section 3.3.Trying to explain the differences observed between precursors is complex, since both compounds share chemical similarities except for the presence of acetylacetonate (-diketone) ligands in DIPBAT, which leads to slower hydrolysis than TTIP 9.Moreover, the bibliography about the use of TTIP and DIPBAT in syntheses in supercritical media is scarce. Then, according to the parameters previously outlined, the catalyst that would exhibit the best features from the viewpoint of light absorption would be that obtained from the DIPBATethanol-3 wt. Pd combination, since it shows the highest level of absorbance in visible range, the highest absorption threshold at a higher wavelength, and the lowest band gap energy. However, in accordance with results presented above, there are two important features of this catalyst that should also be considered when analysing its behaviour in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.On the one side, its band gap could be too low to take part in a reduction reaction and, on the other side, its additional absorption edge could hinder the photocatalytic process.Nevertheless, taking into account the results of the photocatalytic reduction shown below, it may be stated that neither of them seems to negatively affect the process. Fig. 5 shows the FTIR spectrum of commercial catalyst.It can be seen that a single peak appears around 690 cm -1 corresponding to Ti O Ti bonds 44.Fig. 5 also shows the FTIR spectrum of catalyst synthesized in this work from the DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 1 combination.As shown, it exhibits an additional peak around 1625 cm -1 and a wide band centred at 3000 cm -1 , which can be attributed to stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups and water on catalyst surface 45,46.In this sense, it should be noticed that the presence of these species is usually favourable for photocatalytic process 17.Since very similar spectra to those shown in Fig. 5 for the combination DIPBATetanol-Pd 1 were attained for other combinations of reagents, it cannot be said that these species appear preferably for a certain precursor or alcohol. It should be noted that this type of double-peak structure is also rather commonly observed for anatase and rutile powders obtained with conventional methods of synthesis 47. The mean particle size is an important parameter in catalytic processes.It has a significant effect on surface area, and therefore in the catalytic process, since it provides contact surface between catalyst, light, and reactants 9,10,48. The catalysts synthesized in this work have a mean size higher than the commercial catalyst (for instance, 6 m for the catalyst from the combination DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 3 vs. 3 m for commercial Degussa P-25), a result in accordance with SEM images shown in Figs. 1 and2. Obviously, this result depends on the synthesis conditions.In particular, it has been observed that the effect of DIPBAT and TTIP precursors is smaller than those corresponding to the hydrolytic agent and dopant concentration.Specifically, the introduction of ethanol and increasing amounts of dopant agent have produced increases in both particle size and aggregation 9. Nevertheless, it should be highlighted at this point that in conventional hydrothermal synthesis a severe agglomeration process usually occurs and leads to larger particle sizes than those synthesized with supercritical fluids 33. In brief, according to findings reported above and considering that decreasing particle sizes improve TiO 2 surface properties, the commercial catalyst should show better photocatalytic activity than synthesized catalysts if such activity depended only on this variable 17. Experiments performed to determine the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized catalysts in the reduction of CO 2 were conducted in a thin-film fixed-bed reactor using water vapour in order to avoid the problems derived from the use of liquid water: low solubility of CO 2 and competitive reactions occurrence.The reaction conditions used were optimized in a previous work 12: 20-40 mg catalyst mass, water vapour/CO 2 ratio 2/7, and operation times 3-4 h. The main advantages of thin-film fixed-bed reactors are that the uniformly dispersed immobilized photocatalyst offers a high specific reactive surface area, a highly effective use of light energy, and agitation is not necessary to prevent catalyst sedimentation, as is the case in fluidised bed reactors, which are employed in systems with liquid water 49. The main reaction products were CH 4 and CO, although traces of ethane were also found with the catalyst synthesized from the DIPBAT-ethanol-1 wt. Pd combination of reactants.These results agree with those reported by other groups working under similar conditions 23,50 and are consistent with widely described CO 2 reduction mechanisms 23. This narrow variety of reaction products (CO, methane, and ethane) and the absence of O 2 in GC measurements may be explained by considering that, during the CO 2 reduction with water to produce methane, oxygen from water may oxidize certain CO 2 reduction products (for example methane to methanol) that are further oxidized in the presence of photocatalysts (noble metalsloaded TiO 2 ) very active in the photocatalytic oxidation of methanol 37. As Table 4 depicts, the production of methane is larger compared to that of CO, a common result when TiO 2 is doped with metals 35.With the purpose of comparison this table also shows the CH 4 and CO production rates (0.075 and 2.014 mol/g/h, respectively) of the catalyst of reference, the commercial catalyst Degussa P-25.It can be seen that all experiments with Pd/TiO 2 lead to methane production rates from 3 to 22 times higher than that of the commercial catalyst. These results imply that when doping with Pd a TiO 2 catalyst the photoactivity of resulting catalyst towards methane production improves, a fact which is in line with data published by other investigators.In fact, a number of groups have recently concluded that the introduction of Pd enhances the selectivity of the process towards CH 4 23,50,51. The catalyst leading to the highest methane production rate is that synthesized from the DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 3 wt.combination of reactants.It should be noted that this catalyst (and, in general, all combinations with DIPBAT) had already exhibited superior characteristics, as shown in Table S1 ordering the three best catalysts of those used in the sixteen photocatalytic experiments performed, from best to worst, according to the value of the property analysed.In particular, it can be appreciated in the table that characteristics that make this catalyst better than others are: small particle size, morphology (polyhedral), low band gap energy and relatively high surface area. Regarding the influence of these properties of catalysts on the CO 2 photocatalytic reaction, it should be noted that the higher surface area is, the more reactants molecules are adsorbed and the more quickly electrons can reach them.This results in smaller recombination probability and higher products yield 52.In connection with this property, it should also be noted that the presence of basic species (hydroxyl groups) on catalyst surface mentioned in Section 3.2 leads to stronger interactions with CO 2 and higher uptake of this gas 52,53.A low band gap energy is also a desired feature since it improves light absorption and charge carrier generation 52,54555657. Finally, polyhedral particle shapes have shown higher activity than rounded particles due to the higher density of catalytically active sites, although it has not yet been fully explained 31. If one looks at reaction time, the methane production rate is always improved when time increases from 3 to 4 h.In the current case, this increase of time is also beneficial to obtaining traces of ethane when DIPBAT-ethanol-Pd 1 wt. combination is assessed 50. On the other side, we have also reported in text and in Table S1 that the catalyst obtained from the combination TTIP-isopropyl alcohol-Pd 1 wt. displayed good features related to morphology (small polyhedral-like particles) and crystallinity (high crystallinity and large crystallite size).This high crystallinity is connected with good semiconductor properties.Probably because of this, the catalyst from this combination allowed obtaining CO production rates almost twice (1.7 times higher) that of commercial catalyst Degussa P-25. Regarding the CO production rates, it should also be noted that catalysts from reactants combinations with DIPBAT always led to lower values than those obtained from combinations with TTIP.Unfortunately, it is not clear at this moment how titania precursor affects CO reduction and methane production 58. With the aim of solving some issues raised in previous sections, we can also state that: -An increase in Pd loading enhances the selectivity towards methane (in DIPBAT combinations, methane production rates is up to 4 times higher when Pd loading changes from 1 to 3 wt.).-In this sense, the presence of PdO discovered through XRD and UV-vis DRS analyses does not seem to greatly affect the photocatalytic activity of catalysts, contrary to observed by Vaiano et al. 37.At least, it does not counteract the positive features for photocatalysis exhibited by these catalysts. In order to compare our results with those obtained by other groups working with Pd/TiO 2 , Table 5 shows some results from bibliography.It can be observed that methane and carbon monoxide production rates obtained with Pd/TiO 2 nanoparticles synthesized in CO 2 supercritical medium are generally higher than those obtained using Pd/TiO 2 nanoparticles and conventional photoreactors.However, it should be noted that other investigators 37,59 have reported higher rates when using more sophisticated systems, for example mixtures of TiO 2 and glass spheres in a fluidized bed reactor."}], "operation mode": []}}
