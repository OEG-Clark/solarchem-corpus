To attest the efficacy of the deposition-precipitation synthesis route, morphology and microstructure of the as-obtained AgCl/CN composite and unsupported AgCl were studied using Field Emissions Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM).The relevant particle sizes for pure AgCl and other AgCl/CN composites were also investigated statistically and is summarized in Table 1.The morphology of pure AgCl manifested as irregular, almost-spherical particles with sizes ranging from 1000-3000 nm.Upon involvement of CN as a substrate, AgCl particles ripened to form nanospheres-like particles on the surface of CN.This is owing to the defects present in CN which function as nanoparticle nucleation sites and helped to suppress the growth rate of AgCl particles. 30This manifestation is illustrated in Figure 2, whereby the mean size of AgCl particles in its pure form and in AgCl/CN composite was reduced drastically from 2032 nm to 20-100 nm respectively.This nanocrystal formation is integral to the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity since this correlates to more reactive sites and shorter electron migration path to surface-adsorbed molecules.All AgCl nanoparticles were strongly anchored on the surface of CN and the intimate contact between AgCl and CN form an efficient heterojunction for the charge separation during the photocatalytic process.Additionally, another trend which can be established from FESEM, was the dispersion state of AgCl with increasing mass percentage.As observed in Figure 2(A-F), it was evident that the higher the mass percentage of AgCl incorporated, the more AgCl nanoparticles were formed on the CN support.Most notably, the average particle sizes of AgCl were found to increase in conjunction to an increased loading percentage.On top of that, increasing loading also produced AgCl nanoparticles which exhibited a wider distribution and thus a progressively higher standard deviation (SD).For Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins example, at the two loadings extremities, AgCl-10/CN yielded the smallest average particle size of 28.5 nm and a SD of 4.5 nm, whereas AgCl-70/CN yielded a considerably larger average particle size and a SD of 93.2 and 28.7 respectively.The complete particle size histograms for each pertaining mass percentages of AgCl/CN composites are provided in Figure S5(A-E).Furthermore, at higher loadings as illustrated in Figure 2(D-E), there was an apparent agglomeration of AgCl nanoparticles.This was owing to the excess number of AgCl on the CN sheet, which tend to agglomerate and form clumps, resulting in the poor dispersion of the nanoparticles. Overall, this revealed that the amount of AgCl incorporated in the composite is a highly influential parameter to the dispersion and the size of the AgCl nanoparticles deposited on the CN support.In addition to that, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping have also been performed.This is in order to examine the elemental distribution of the composite, which provided concrete evidence that all relevant elements (C, N, Ag and Cl) are highly dispersed with the spatial distribution as displayed in Figure 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the phase structure of the as-synthesized CN, AgCl and AgCl/CN composite as depicted in Figure 4. Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was additionally performed to investigate the surface elemental composition and chemical states of AgCl/CN as given in Figure 6(A-D).The high resolution C 1s spectrum showed two major peaks at 284.6eV and 288.2eV which is characteristic to the graphitic carbon (C-C bonding) and the disrupted sp 2 -bonded carbon (attributed by C-N groups) of CN respectively. 41On the other hand, N 1s spectrum showed an array of peaks owing to the multi-environment nitrogen atom.The most intense peak at 398.6eV was ascribed to aromatic (CN-C) linkage, the weaker 399.7eV peak corresponded to tertiary N bonded to C atoms (N-C 3 ), and the 401eV peak was assigned to amino groups (C-N-H), while lastly the highest binding energy peak at 404.3eV was attributed to excitation. 8As for Ag3d spectrum, it was comprised of two spin-orbit doublets represented by peaks at 368eV and 374eV, which was accredited to the binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 respectively.These individual peaks can be further deconvolved into two peaks whereby 367.5eV and 373.5eV peaks were designated to Ag in AgCl and meanwhile 368.6eV and 374.6eV peaks were to metal Ag 0 which may arise from slight photocorrosion of the sample due to the exposure of light whilst handling.On the other hand, Cl 2p spectra displayed two spin-orbit doublets of Cl 2p 5/2 and Cl 2p 3/2 which were correlated to bands of binding energy 197.8eV and 199.5eV respectively and were attributed to Cl -ion from AgCl. The photocatalytic performance of AgCl/CN in gas-phase CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 was investigated using a low-power 15W energy-saving daylight bulb as a visible light source and under ambient conditions.As observed from Figure 7(A), the habitation of AgCl on CN yielded a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic activity .Firstly, it could be seen from Figure 7(A) that even CN on its own exhibited a massive 30 fold improvement as compared to commercial P25.This was owing to its visible-responsive trait and its extended 2D, porous structure.The AgCl/CN composite further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of its derivative CN with an optimum achieved at an intermediate loading.Upon light illumination, the photocatalytic performance on CO This measures how efficiently the impinging photons were converted into electron-hole pairs that were subsequently used in the formation of CH 4 .Based on the photo-reduction of CO 2 under low-power 15W light source, the photochemical quantum yield of CH 4 was found to be 0.085.Although a low power daylight bulb was used, this result is comparable to some previously reported values which even employed high power Xe or Hg lamps, therefore making our process more practically feasible. 43444546 Several control experiments were executed to validate the role of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in the reduction of CO produced was in fact was derived from CO 2 and not due to carbon residues of the catalyst.Lastly, blank test ( 3) and ( 4) indicated the relevance of the role of these parameters (light and H 2 O) in the photo-reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .This confirmed that the CH 4 was in fact derived from photocatalysis and highlighted the significance of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in driving CO 2 reduction.Furthermore, the hourly progression of the CO 2 photo-reduction reaction can be observed from Figure 7(C).It can be seen that the reaction kicked off with low evolution of CH 4 which later increased as the reaction progresses.This observation can be associated to the low photo-conversion of CO 2 since intermediate products in the form of radicals were initially formed at this stage.However at succeeding hours, CH 4 evolution progressively reduced and this may be attributed to the radical intermediates and products saturating the active sites which consequently slowed down the rate of Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins reaction.A similar trend was also observed in a number of other CO 2 reduction reports. Since, it has been highlighted that there was a large enhancement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the AgCl/CN hybrid, it is now necessary to account the reasons for this observation.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared AgCl/CN composite and its derivatives (AgCl and CN) were measured to reflect their light harvesting ability towards different wavelength in the solar radiation.From Figure 8, both pure CN and AgCl exhibit typical semiconductor absorption whereby distinct absorption is seen only in the UV region (200nm-400nm) but a limited absorption in the visible region (400nm-700nm).Pure AgCl exhibited the highest absorption in the visible range, showing a bump due the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the photo-reduced Ag, whereas CN showed a minimal background absorption in that region.As compared to CN, composite AgCl/CN, displayed a strengthened absorption peak in the targeted visible light range (450-700nm) as well as the UV, validating the habitation of visible-light-sensitive AgCl host materials on CN.Moreover, this absorbance incrementally increases with the content of AgCl as shown in the inset in Figure 8.This confirms the fabrication of heterojunction structure between CN and light-sensitive AgCl allows for an enhanced optical absorption.The bandgap of CN and AgCl was individually obtained to be 2.7 and 3 eV respectively based from the plots of (F(R)hv) 1/2 vs hv (Figure S6).Once again, it should be pointed out that there was no distinct red or blue shift in the band edge of the composite with respect to CN, suggesting that AgCl nanoparticles was not covalently intercalated into CN matrix but it was merely dispersed on its surface owing to the low-temperature synthesis process.It was discussed earlier that AgCl/CN composite demonstrated the highest CH 4 yield at an intermediate loading.These findings suggested that the photocatalytic performance was impeded by larger particle sizes and agglomeration at higher loading content.This was since larger particles associate with lower surface area, longer electron migration paths and less area for light harvesting. 49rom another aspect, the bigger the cluster of AgCl nanoparticles anchored on CN, the weaker the co-ordination bond between CN and AgCl which then disrupted the heterojunction structure which led to a less efficient charge flow via the two materials.An appropriate amount of AgCl is hence paramount for an optimal enhancement in the photocatalytic activity.This claim was further corroborated by Photoluminescence (PL) emission measurements which is shown in Figure 9. PL spectra can be used to evaluate the recombination probability and separation efficiency of photoinduced electron and holes. 50Higher spectra intensity correlates to higher recombination rate as more electron and holes recombine to emit more (hv).The intensity goes by the order CN AgCl-70/CN AgCl-10/CN AgCl-50/CN AgCl-30/CN which were in accordance with the CO 2 photo-reduction results.This implied that AgCl-30/CN has the most efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs since it was the desired intermediate whereby enough AgCl were integrated for an improved light-absorption and heterojunction engineering but not in the extent where severe aggregation of its particles occurred.It is now evident that the hybridization of photosensitive AgCl to CN led to the improvement of photocatalytic activity, however its stability for practical application remains to be elucidated.Therefore, a recycling experiment was performed using the best sample AgCl-30/CN and all the experiment conditions were unchanged to ensure reproducibility of results.As shown in Fig. 7D, the photocatalytic reduction activity was only slightly reduced for each of the consecutive runs and the greater part of the photoactivity was preserved.This signifies that AgCl/CN composites were fairly stable and did not undergo serious decline in activity with repeated usage. After the recyclability experiment, which comprised of 4 runs, the spent AgCl-30/CN was analyzed using XPS to reveal the eventual formation of Ag 0 .From Fig. 2A, the XPS patterns of Ag 3d in AgCl- Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins generate a sustained photoactivity under prolonged reaction hours. Based from area analysis on Ag 3d XPS peaks, the mole ratio of surface metallic Ag 0 was 0.25 out of the total Ag species (Ag 0 Ag ) after the 4 consecutive stability runs as compared to a mere 0.09 for the case of fresh AgCl-30/CN catalyst.Accompanying this increase in intensity of Ag 0 peaks, was also the shrinking of Ag peaks in Ag 3d (Fig. 2A) and Cl peaks in Cl 2p (Fig 2B).Furthermore, all the Ag and Cl peaks have also been slightly shifted from their initial binding energy, indicating the renewed interaction with newly formed Ag 0 .These all further verified that in the course of the photocatalytic reaction, the entirety of AgCl in the composite was lost and there exist a new formation of an Ag/AgCl heterojunction.AgCl is photosensitive and its photo-generated electrons inevitably combines with Ag to form Ag 0 clusters on the AgCl particles from repeated absorption of photons.These Ag species which were formed during the photocatalytic process, brings significant benefits to photocatalysis.Firstly, Ag exhibits surface plasmon response (SPR) in the visible light region, meaning that it can utilize photons in visible light region to generate electron-hole pairs due to SPR oscillations.51, 52 This helped in enhancing the visible light absorption of the otherwise wide-bandgap AgCl.The subsequent separation of these plasmon-induced charge carriers in Ag is thereafter promoted by the Schottky barrier formed between the Ag-AgCl metal-semiconductor junction owing to the differences in their work function. 34This Schottky junction produced an internal electric field at the interface which forced electron and holes to move oppositely.Since Ag has lower work function than AgCl ( AgCl 4.8 eV Ag 4.25), the transfer of electrons occurred from Ag to AgCl. 53This relaying of electrons were also facilitated by the metallic nature of Ag which provided a fast medium for electron transfer. When CN and Ag/AgCl were coupled, they associate closely together to form a staggered heterojunction interface.The band potentials of semiconductor CN and AgCl (vs.NHE) were obtained by a theoretical method based on the absolute Mulliken electronegativity.This simple method has been proven to be in good agreement with the experimental results and has also been widely employed by an appreciable number of researchers.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of each semiconductor was calculated by the equation as follows Where, X, is the geometric mean of the absolute Mullikan electronegativity of constituent atoms, which can be calculated from the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy.E c is the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale taken as 4. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Moreover, CH 4 was the only hydrocarbon product which was detected in this experiment.Typically, CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the gas phase produced CO, CH 4 or higher alkenes, while oxygenated products such as alcohols and carboxylic acids are only collected in high H 2 O environment such as under liquid phase, or at high H 2 O/CO 2 ratio which would otherwise require an elevated temperature or a reduced pressure condition. 575885960 Since in this case, the H 2 O/CO 2 was low at 0.043, these products are likely to be absent.Moreover, another plausible reason as to why other hydrocarbon products were not existent in the product gas, can also be explained from their reduction potential in comparison to CH 4 .The reduction potentials of other possible products are given as follows: CO 2 /HCOOH: -0.61 V possesses the lowest reduction potential, inferring that it is the most thermodynamically favored product.This can be an accountable reason for CH 4 as being the sole product achieved.In addition to that, no considerable H 2 molecules were also detected in the product gas.This can possibly mean that intermediate H radicals and protons generated from to the dissociation of water molecules were rapidly consumed by CO 2 in the photocatalytic reaction.An observation similar to this has also been reported by Liu et al. 65 , Yu et al. 66 and Wang et al."}, {"llm generation": "AgCl", "source": "Additionally, another trend which can be established from FESEM, was the dispersion state of AgCl with increasing mass percentage.", "context": "Urea was initially used as a precursor since it is low cost and allegedly yield a more thin, flake-like and mesoporous structure due to releases of CO 2 and NH 3 during its pyrolysis. 26,27A TEM image of the as-prepared CN is provided in Fig S3 .Initially, the obtained bulk CN underwent sonication in 0.5M HCl acid solution.This triggered the delamination of the layered CN into individual sheets, which in effect, assist in furnishing larger contact area subjectable to protonation attack.In addition, this transformation from bulk CN to CN nanosheets is also vital to the photocatalytic efficiency.In the event of bulk CN, most of the strands in the inner bulk layers have redundant role and do not contribute to photocatalysis at all.These bounded sheets reduces the effective surface area and severely limits adsorption-desorption area and light harnessing sites.More importantly, photo-excited carriers in the bulk CN suffers from serious bulk recombination owing to the long travelling distance it requires in reaching the surface.This exfoliation of bulk CN to thin, 2D nanosheets is hence a necessity as it increases the probability of charge carriers in reaching the surface, where it can be consumed to drive photoreactions. 28On another note, acid treatment serves to increase the abundance of amino function groups onto CN sheets surface, which will successively play a key role in the adhesion of AgCl nanoparticles. 4,29 his formation was validated by FTIR analysis in which there exists the emergence of N-H bump corresponding to the peak at 3200cm -1 as depicted in Figure S4.The corresponding amine group will then play apart in acting as Lewis bases whereby the lone pairs of electrons on the N atom in the tri-s-triazine ring structure co-ordinates and bind strongly to metal Ag upon addition of reagent AgNO 3.This was then subsequently grown into AgCl nanoparticles through an in-situ nucleation mechanism by deposition-precipitation method under ambient room temperature.The schematic depiction of the synthesis strategy is presented in Figure 1.

Based from area analysis on Ag 3d XPS peaks, the mole ratio of surface metallic Ag 0 was 0.25 out of the total Ag species (Ag 0 Ag ) after the 4 consecutive stability runs as compared to a mere 0.09 for the case of fresh AgCl-30/CN catalyst.Accompanying this increase in intensity of Ag 0 peaks, was also the shrinking of Ag peaks in Ag 3d (Fig. 2A) and Cl peaks in Cl 2p (Fig 2B).Furthermore, all the Ag and Cl peaks have also been slightly shifted from their initial binding energy, indicating the renewed interaction with newly formed Ag 0 .These all further verified that in the course of the photocatalytic reaction, the entirety of AgCl in the composite was lost and there exist a new formation of an Ag/AgCl heterojunction.AgCl is photosensitive and its photo-generated electrons inevitably combines with Ag to form Ag 0 clusters on the AgCl particles from repeated absorption of photons.These Ag species which were formed during the photocatalytic process, brings significant benefits to photocatalysis.Firstly, Ag exhibits surface plasmon response (SPR) in the visible light region, meaning that it can utilize photons in visible light region to generate electron-hole pairs due to SPR oscillations.51, 52 This helped in enhancing the visible light absorption of the otherwise wide-bandgap AgCl.The subsequent separation of these plasmon-induced charge carriers in Ag is thereafter promoted by the Schottky barrier formed between the Ag-AgCl metal-semiconductor junction owing to the differences in their work function. 34This Schottky junction produced an internal electric field at the interface which forced electron and holes to move oppositely.Since Ag has lower work function than AgCl ( AgCl 4.8 eV Ag 4.25), the transfer of electrons occurred from Ag to AgCl. 53This relaying of electrons were also facilitated by the metallic nature of Ag which provided a fast medium for electron transfer. When CN and Ag/AgCl were coupled, they associate closely together to form a staggered heterojunction interface.The band potentials of semiconductor CN and AgCl (vs.NHE) were obtained by a theoretical method based on the absolute Mulliken electronegativity.This simple method has been proven to be in good agreement with the experimental results and has also been widely employed by an appreciable number of researchers.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of each semiconductor was calculated by the equation as follows Where, X, is the geometric mean of the absolute Mullikan electronegativity of constituent atoms, which can be calculated from the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy.E c is the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale taken as 4. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Moreover, CH 4 was the only hydrocarbon product which was detected in this experiment.Typically, CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the gas phase produced CO, CH 4 or higher alkenes, while oxygenated products such as alcohols and carboxylic acids are only collected in high H 2 O environment such as under liquid phase, or at high H 2 O/CO 2 ratio which would otherwise require an elevated temperature or a reduced pressure condition. 575885960 Since in this case, the H 2 O/CO 2 was low at 0.043, these products are likely to be absent.Moreover, another plausible reason as to why other hydrocarbon products were not existent in the product gas, can also be explained from their reduction potential in comparison to CH 4 .The reduction potentials of other possible products are given as follows: CO 2 /HCOOH: -0.61 V possesses the lowest reduction potential, inferring that it is the most thermodynamically favored product.This can be an accountable reason for CH 4 as being the sole product achieved.In addition to that, no considerable H 2 molecules were also detected in the product gas.This can possibly mean that intermediate H radicals and protons generated from to the dissociation of water molecules were rapidly consumed by CO 2 in the photocatalytic reaction.An observation similar to this has also been reported by Liu et al. 65 , Yu et al. 66 and Wang et al."}, {"llm generation": "AgCl nanoparticles", "source": "Furthermore, at higher loadings as illustrated in Figure 2(D-E), there was an apparent agglomeration of AgCl nanoparticles.", "context": "Urea was initially used as a precursor since it is low cost and allegedly yield a more thin, flake-like and mesoporous structure due to releases of CO 2 and NH 3 during its pyrolysis. 26,27A TEM image of the as-prepared CN is provided in Fig S3 .Initially, the obtained bulk CN underwent sonication in 0.5M HCl acid solution.This triggered the delamination of the layered CN into individual sheets, which in effect, assist in furnishing larger contact area subjectable to protonation attack.In addition, this transformation from bulk CN to CN nanosheets is also vital to the photocatalytic efficiency.In the event of bulk CN, most of the strands in the inner bulk layers have redundant role and do not contribute to photocatalysis at all.These bounded sheets reduces the effective surface area and severely limits adsorption-desorption area and light harnessing sites.More importantly, photo-excited carriers in the bulk CN suffers from serious bulk recombination owing to the long travelling distance it requires in reaching the surface.This exfoliation of bulk CN to thin, 2D nanosheets is hence a necessity as it increases the probability of charge carriers in reaching the surface, where it can be consumed to drive photoreactions. 28On another note, acid treatment serves to increase the abundance of amino function groups onto CN sheets surface, which will successively play a key role in the adhesion of AgCl nanoparticles. 4,29 his formation was validated by FTIR analysis in which there exists the emergence of N-H bump corresponding to the peak at 3200cm -1 as depicted in Figure S4.The corresponding amine group will then play apart in acting as Lewis bases whereby the lone pairs of electrons on the N atom in the tri-s-triazine ring structure co-ordinates and bind strongly to metal Ag upon addition of reagent AgNO 3.This was then subsequently grown into AgCl nanoparticles through an in-situ nucleation mechanism by deposition-precipitation method under ambient room temperature.The schematic depiction of the synthesis strategy is presented in Figure 1. To attest the efficacy of the deposition-precipitation synthesis route, morphology and microstructure of the as-obtained AgCl/CN composite and unsupported AgCl were studied using Field Emissions Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM).The relevant particle sizes for pure AgCl and other AgCl/CN composites were also investigated statistically and is summarized in Table 1.The morphology of pure AgCl manifested as irregular, almost-spherical particles with sizes ranging from 1000-3000 nm.Upon involvement of CN as a substrate, AgCl particles ripened to form nanospheres-like particles on the surface of CN.This is owing to the defects present in CN which function as nanoparticle nucleation sites and helped to suppress the growth rate of AgCl particles. 30This manifestation is illustrated in Figure 2, whereby the mean size of AgCl particles in its pure form and in AgCl/CN composite was reduced drastically from 2032 nm to 20-100 nm respectively.This nanocrystal formation is integral to the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity since this correlates to more reactive sites and shorter electron migration path to surface-adsorbed molecules.All AgCl nanoparticles were strongly anchored on the surface of CN and the intimate contact between AgCl and CN form an efficient heterojunction for the charge separation during the photocatalytic process.Additionally, another trend which can be established from FESEM, was the dispersion state of AgCl with increasing mass percentage.As observed in Figure 2(A-F), it was evident that the higher the mass percentage of AgCl incorporated, the more AgCl nanoparticles were formed on the CN support.Most notably, the average particle sizes of AgCl were found to increase in conjunction to an increased loading percentage.On top of that, increasing loading also produced AgCl nanoparticles which exhibited a wider distribution and thus a progressively higher standard deviation (SD).For Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins example, at the two loadings extremities, AgCl-10/CN yielded the smallest average particle size of 28.5 nm and a SD of 4.5 nm, whereas AgCl-70/CN yielded a considerably larger average particle size and a SD of 93.2 and 28.7 respectively.The complete particle size histograms for each pertaining mass percentages of AgCl/CN composites are provided in Figure S5(A-E).Furthermore, at higher loadings as illustrated in Figure 2(D-E), there was an apparent agglomeration of AgCl nanoparticles.This was owing to the excess number of AgCl on the CN sheet, which tend to agglomerate and form clumps, resulting in the poor dispersion of the nanoparticles. Overall, this revealed that the amount of AgCl incorporated in the composite is a highly influential parameter to the dispersion and the size of the AgCl nanoparticles deposited on the CN support.In addition to that, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping have also been performed.This is in order to examine the elemental distribution of the composite, which provided concrete evidence that all relevant elements (C, N, Ag and Cl) are highly dispersed with the spatial distribution as displayed in Figure 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the phase structure of the as-synthesized CN, AgCl and AgCl/CN composite as depicted in Figure 4. Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was additionally performed to investigate the surface elemental composition and chemical states of AgCl/CN as given in Figure 6(A-D).The high resolution C 1s spectrum showed two major peaks at 284.6eV and 288.2eV which is characteristic to the graphitic carbon (C-C bonding) and the disrupted sp 2 -bonded carbon (attributed by C-N groups) of CN respectively. 41On the other hand, N 1s spectrum showed an array of peaks owing to the multi-environment nitrogen atom.The most intense peak at 398.6eV was ascribed to aromatic (CN-C) linkage, the weaker 399.7eV peak corresponded to tertiary N bonded to C atoms (N-C 3 ), and the 401eV peak was assigned to amino groups (C-N-H), while lastly the highest binding energy peak at 404.3eV was attributed to excitation. 8As for Ag3d spectrum, it was comprised of two spin-orbit doublets represented by peaks at 368eV and 374eV, which was accredited to the binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 respectively.These individual peaks can be further deconvolved into two peaks whereby 367.5eV and 373.5eV peaks were designated to Ag in AgCl and meanwhile 368.6eV and 374.6eV peaks were to metal Ag 0 which may arise from slight photocorrosion of the sample due to the exposure of light whilst handling.On the other hand, Cl 2p spectra displayed two spin-orbit doublets of Cl 2p 5/2 and Cl 2p 3/2 which were correlated to bands of binding energy 197.8eV and 199.5eV respectively and were attributed to Cl -ion from AgCl. The photocatalytic performance of AgCl/CN in gas-phase CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 was investigated using a low-power 15W energy-saving daylight bulb as a visible light source and under ambient conditions.As observed from Figure 7(A), the habitation of AgCl on CN yielded a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic activity .Firstly, it could be seen from Figure 7(A) that even CN on its own exhibited a massive 30 fold improvement as compared to commercial P25.This was owing to its visible-responsive trait and its extended 2D, porous structure.The AgCl/CN composite further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of its derivative CN with an optimum achieved at an intermediate loading.Upon light illumination, the photocatalytic performance on CO This measures how efficiently the impinging photons were converted into electron-hole pairs that were subsequently used in the formation of CH 4 .Based on the photo-reduction of CO 2 under low-power 15W light source, the photochemical quantum yield of CH 4 was found to be 0.085.Although a low power daylight bulb was used, this result is comparable to some previously reported values which even employed high power Xe or Hg lamps, therefore making our process more practically feasible. 43444546 Several control experiments were executed to validate the role of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in the reduction of CO produced was in fact was derived from CO 2 and not due to carbon residues of the catalyst.Lastly, blank test ( 3) and ( 4) indicated the relevance of the role of these parameters (light and H 2 O) in the photo-reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .This confirmed that the CH 4 was in fact derived from photocatalysis and highlighted the significance of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in driving CO 2 reduction.Furthermore, the hourly progression of the CO 2 photo-reduction reaction can be observed from Figure 7(C).It can be seen that the reaction kicked off with low evolution of CH 4 which later increased as the reaction progresses.This observation can be associated to the low photo-conversion of CO 2 since intermediate products in the form of radicals were initially formed at this stage.However at succeeding hours, CH 4 evolution progressively reduced and this may be attributed to the radical intermediates and products saturating the active sites which consequently slowed down the rate of Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins reaction.A similar trend was also observed in a number of other CO 2 reduction reports. Since, it has been highlighted that there was a large enhancement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the AgCl/CN hybrid, it is now necessary to account the reasons for this observation.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared AgCl/CN composite and its derivatives (AgCl and CN) were measured to reflect their light harvesting ability towards different wavelength in the solar radiation.From Figure 8, both pure CN and AgCl exhibit typical semiconductor absorption whereby distinct absorption is seen only in the UV region (200nm-400nm) but a limited absorption in the visible region (400nm-700nm).Pure AgCl exhibited the highest absorption in the visible range, showing a bump due the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the photo-reduced Ag, whereas CN showed a minimal background absorption in that region.As compared to CN, composite AgCl/CN, displayed a strengthened absorption peak in the targeted visible light range (450-700nm) as well as the UV, validating the habitation of visible-light-sensitive AgCl host materials on CN.Moreover, this absorbance incrementally increases with the content of AgCl as shown in the inset in Figure 8.This confirms the fabrication of heterojunction structure between CN and light-sensitive AgCl allows for an enhanced optical absorption.The bandgap of CN and AgCl was individually obtained to be 2.7 and 3 eV respectively based from the plots of (F(R)hv) 1/2 vs hv (Figure S6).Once again, it should be pointed out that there was no distinct red or blue shift in the band edge of the composite with respect to CN, suggesting that AgCl nanoparticles was not covalently intercalated into CN matrix but it was merely dispersed on its surface owing to the low-temperature synthesis process.It was discussed earlier that AgCl/CN composite demonstrated the highest CH 4 yield at an intermediate loading.These findings suggested that the photocatalytic performance was impeded by larger particle sizes and agglomeration at higher loading content.This was since larger particles associate with lower surface area, longer electron migration paths and less area for light harvesting. 49rom another aspect, the bigger the cluster of AgCl nanoparticles anchored on CN, the weaker the co-ordination bond between CN and AgCl which then disrupted the heterojunction structure which led to a less efficient charge flow via the two materials.An appropriate amount of AgCl is hence paramount for an optimal enhancement in the photocatalytic activity.This claim was further corroborated by Photoluminescence (PL) emission measurements which is shown in Figure 9. PL spectra can be used to evaluate the recombination probability and separation efficiency of photoinduced electron and holes. 50Higher spectra intensity correlates to higher recombination rate as more electron and holes recombine to emit more (hv).The intensity goes by the order CN AgCl-70/CN AgCl-10/CN AgCl-50/CN AgCl-30/CN which were in accordance with the CO 2 photo-reduction results.This implied that AgCl-30/CN has the most efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs since it was the desired intermediate whereby enough AgCl were integrated for an improved light-absorption and heterojunction engineering but not in the extent where severe aggregation of its particles occurred.It is now evident that the hybridization of photosensitive AgCl to CN led to the improvement of photocatalytic activity, however its stability for practical application remains to be elucidated.Therefore, a recycling experiment was performed using the best sample AgCl-30/CN and all the experiment conditions were unchanged to ensure reproducibility of results.As shown in Fig. 7D, the photocatalytic reduction activity was only slightly reduced for each of the consecutive runs and the greater part of the photoactivity was preserved.This signifies that AgCl/CN composites were fairly stable and did not undergo serious decline in activity with repeated usage. After the recyclability experiment, which comprised of 4 runs, the spent AgCl-30/CN was analyzed using XPS to reveal the eventual formation of Ag 0 .From Fig. 2A, the XPS patterns of Ag 3d in AgCl- Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins generate a sustained photoactivity under prolonged reaction hours.

Since, it has been highlighted that there was a large enhancement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the AgCl/CN hybrid, it is now necessary to account the reasons for this observation.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared AgCl/CN composite and its derivatives (AgCl and CN) were measured to reflect their light harvesting ability towards different wavelength in the solar radiation.From Figure 8, both pure CN and AgCl exhibit typical semiconductor absorption whereby distinct absorption is seen only in the UV region (200nm-400nm) but a limited absorption in the visible region (400nm-700nm).Pure AgCl exhibited the highest absorption in the visible range, showing a bump due the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the photo-reduced Ag, whereas CN showed a minimal background absorption in that region.As compared to CN, composite AgCl/CN, displayed a strengthened absorption peak in the targeted visible light range (450-700nm) as well as the UV, validating the habitation of visible-light-sensitive AgCl host materials on CN.Moreover, this absorbance incrementally increases with the content of AgCl as shown in the inset in Figure 8.This confirms the fabrication of heterojunction structure between CN and light-sensitive AgCl allows for an enhanced optical absorption.The bandgap of CN and AgCl was individually obtained to be 2.7 and 3 eV respectively based from the plots of (F(R)hv) 1/2 vs hv (Figure S6).Once again, it should be pointed out that there was no distinct red or blue shift in the band edge of the composite with respect to CN, suggesting that AgCl nanoparticles was not covalently intercalated into CN matrix but it was merely dispersed on its surface owing to the low-temperature synthesis process.It was discussed earlier that AgCl/CN composite demonstrated the highest CH 4 yield at an intermediate loading.These findings suggested that the photocatalytic performance was impeded by larger particle sizes and agglomeration at higher loading content.This was since larger particles associate with lower surface area, longer electron migration paths and less area for light harvesting. 49rom another aspect, the bigger the cluster of AgCl nanoparticles anchored on CN, the weaker the co-ordination bond between CN and AgCl which then disrupted the heterojunction structure which led to a less efficient charge flow via the two materials.An appropriate amount of AgCl is hence paramount for an optimal enhancement in the photocatalytic activity.This claim was further corroborated by Photoluminescence (PL) emission measurements which is shown in Figure 9. PL spectra can be used to evaluate the recombination probability and separation efficiency of photoinduced electron and holes. 50Higher spectra intensity correlates to higher recombination rate as more electron and holes recombine to emit more (hv).The intensity goes by the order CN AgCl-70/CN AgCl-10/CN AgCl-50/CN AgCl-30/CN which were in accordance with the CO 2 photo-reduction results.This implied that AgCl-30/CN has the most efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs since it was the desired intermediate whereby enough AgCl were integrated for an improved light-absorption and heterojunction engineering but not in the extent where severe aggregation of its particles occurred.It is now evident that the hybridization of photosensitive AgCl to CN led to the improvement of photocatalytic activity, however its stability for practical application remains to be elucidated.Therefore, a recycling experiment was performed using the best sample AgCl-30/CN and all the experiment conditions were unchanged to ensure reproducibility of results.As shown in Fig. 7D, the photocatalytic reduction activity was only slightly reduced for each of the consecutive runs and the greater part of the photoactivity was preserved.This signifies that AgCl/CN composites were fairly stable and did not undergo serious decline in activity with repeated usage. After the recyclability experiment, which comprised of 4 runs, the spent AgCl-30/CN was analyzed using XPS to reveal the eventual formation of Ag 0 .From Fig. 2A, the XPS patterns of Ag 3d in AgCl- Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins generate a sustained photoactivity under prolonged reaction hours. Based from area analysis on Ag 3d XPS peaks, the mole ratio of surface metallic Ag 0 was 0.25 out of the total Ag species (Ag 0 Ag ) after the 4 consecutive stability runs as compared to a mere 0.09 for the case of fresh AgCl-30/CN catalyst.Accompanying this increase in intensity of Ag 0 peaks, was also the shrinking of Ag peaks in Ag 3d (Fig. 2A) and Cl peaks in Cl 2p (Fig 2B).Furthermore, all the Ag and Cl peaks have also been slightly shifted from their initial binding energy, indicating the renewed interaction with newly formed Ag 0 .These all further verified that in the course of the photocatalytic reaction, the entirety of AgCl in the composite was lost and there exist a new formation of an Ag/AgCl heterojunction.AgCl is photosensitive and its photo-generated electrons inevitably combines with Ag to form Ag 0 clusters on the AgCl particles from repeated absorption of photons.These Ag species which were formed during the photocatalytic process, brings significant benefits to photocatalysis.Firstly, Ag exhibits surface plasmon response (SPR) in the visible light region, meaning that it can utilize photons in visible light region to generate electron-hole pairs due to SPR oscillations.51, 52 This helped in enhancing the visible light absorption of the otherwise wide-bandgap AgCl.The subsequent separation of these plasmon-induced charge carriers in Ag is thereafter promoted by the Schottky barrier formed between the Ag-AgCl metal-semiconductor junction owing to the differences in their work function. 34This Schottky junction produced an internal electric field at the interface which forced electron and holes to move oppositely.Since Ag has lower work function than AgCl ( AgCl 4.8 eV Ag 4.25), the transfer of electrons occurred from Ag to AgCl. 53This relaying of electrons were also facilitated by the metallic nature of Ag which provided a fast medium for electron transfer. When CN and Ag/AgCl were coupled, they associate closely together to form a staggered heterojunction interface.The band potentials of semiconductor CN and AgCl (vs.NHE) were obtained by a theoretical method based on the absolute Mulliken electronegativity.This simple method has been proven to be in good agreement with the experimental results and has also been widely employed by an appreciable number of researchers.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of each semiconductor was calculated by the equation as follows Where, X, is the geometric mean of the absolute Mullikan electronegativity of constituent atoms, which can be calculated from the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy.E c is the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale taken as 4. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Moreover, CH 4 was the only hydrocarbon product which was detected in this experiment.Typically, CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the gas phase produced CO, CH 4 or higher alkenes, while oxygenated products such as alcohols and carboxylic acids are only collected in high H 2 O environment such as under liquid phase, or at high H 2 O/CO 2 ratio which would otherwise require an elevated temperature or a reduced pressure condition. 575885960 Since in this case, the H 2 O/CO 2 was low at 0.043, these products are likely to be absent.Moreover, another plausible reason as to why other hydrocarbon products were not existent in the product gas, can also be explained from their reduction potential in comparison to CH 4 .The reduction potentials of other possible products are given as follows: CO 2 /HCOOH: -0.61 V possesses the lowest reduction potential, inferring that it is the most thermodynamically favored product.This can be an accountable reason for CH 4 as being the sole product achieved.In addition to that, no considerable H 2 molecules were also detected in the product gas.This can possibly mean that intermediate H radicals and protons generated from to the dissociation of water molecules were rapidly consumed by CO 2 in the photocatalytic reaction.An observation similar to this has also been reported by Liu et al. 65 , Yu et al. 66 and Wang et al."}, {"llm generation": "pure AgCl", "source": "In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).", "context": "Urea was initially used as a precursor since it is low cost and allegedly yield a more thin, flake-like and mesoporous structure due to releases of CO 2 and NH 3 during its pyrolysis. 26,27A TEM image of the as-prepared CN is provided in Fig S3 .Initially, the obtained bulk CN underwent sonication in 0.5M HCl acid solution.This triggered the delamination of the layered CN into individual sheets, which in effect, assist in furnishing larger contact area subjectable to protonation attack.In addition, this transformation from bulk CN to CN nanosheets is also vital to the photocatalytic efficiency.In the event of bulk CN, most of the strands in the inner bulk layers have redundant role and do not contribute to photocatalysis at all.These bounded sheets reduces the effective surface area and severely limits adsorption-desorption area and light harnessing sites.More importantly, photo-excited carriers in the bulk CN suffers from serious bulk recombination owing to the long travelling distance it requires in reaching the surface.This exfoliation of bulk CN to thin, 2D nanosheets is hence a necessity as it increases the probability of charge carriers in reaching the surface, where it can be consumed to drive photoreactions. 28On another note, acid treatment serves to increase the abundance of amino function groups onto CN sheets surface, which will successively play a key role in the adhesion of AgCl nanoparticles. 4,29 his formation was validated by FTIR analysis in which there exists the emergence of N-H bump corresponding to the peak at 3200cm -1 as depicted in Figure S4.The corresponding amine group will then play apart in acting as Lewis bases whereby the lone pairs of electrons on the N atom in the tri-s-triazine ring structure co-ordinates and bind strongly to metal Ag upon addition of reagent AgNO 3.This was then subsequently grown into AgCl nanoparticles through an in-situ nucleation mechanism by deposition-precipitation method under ambient room temperature.The schematic depiction of the synthesis strategy is presented in Figure 1. To attest the efficacy of the deposition-precipitation synthesis route, morphology and microstructure of the as-obtained AgCl/CN composite and unsupported AgCl were studied using Field Emissions Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM).The relevant particle sizes for pure AgCl and other AgCl/CN composites were also investigated statistically and is summarized in Table 1.The morphology of pure AgCl manifested as irregular, almost-spherical particles with sizes ranging from 1000-3000 nm.Upon involvement of CN as a substrate, AgCl particles ripened to form nanospheres-like particles on the surface of CN.This is owing to the defects present in CN which function as nanoparticle nucleation sites and helped to suppress the growth rate of AgCl particles. 30This manifestation is illustrated in Figure 2, whereby the mean size of AgCl particles in its pure form and in AgCl/CN composite was reduced drastically from 2032 nm to 20-100 nm respectively.This nanocrystal formation is integral to the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity since this correlates to more reactive sites and shorter electron migration path to surface-adsorbed molecules.All AgCl nanoparticles were strongly anchored on the surface of CN and the intimate contact between AgCl and CN form an efficient heterojunction for the charge separation during the photocatalytic process.Additionally, another trend which can be established from FESEM, was the dispersion state of AgCl with increasing mass percentage.As observed in Figure 2(A-F), it was evident that the higher the mass percentage of AgCl incorporated, the more AgCl nanoparticles were formed on the CN support.Most notably, the average particle sizes of AgCl were found to increase in conjunction to an increased loading percentage.On top of that, increasing loading also produced AgCl nanoparticles which exhibited a wider distribution and thus a progressively higher standard deviation (SD).For Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins example, at the two loadings extremities, AgCl-10/CN yielded the smallest average particle size of 28.5 nm and a SD of 4.5 nm, whereas AgCl-70/CN yielded a considerably larger average particle size and a SD of 93.2 and 28.7 respectively.The complete particle size histograms for each pertaining mass percentages of AgCl/CN composites are provided in Figure S5(A-E).Furthermore, at higher loadings as illustrated in Figure 2(D-E), there was an apparent agglomeration of AgCl nanoparticles.This was owing to the excess number of AgCl on the CN sheet, which tend to agglomerate and form clumps, resulting in the poor dispersion of the nanoparticles. Overall, this revealed that the amount of AgCl incorporated in the composite is a highly influential parameter to the dispersion and the size of the AgCl nanoparticles deposited on the CN support.In addition to that, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping have also been performed.This is in order to examine the elemental distribution of the composite, which provided concrete evidence that all relevant elements (C, N, Ag and Cl) are highly dispersed with the spatial distribution as displayed in Figure 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the phase structure of the as-synthesized CN, AgCl and AgCl/CN composite as depicted in Figure 4. Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples.

To attest the efficacy of the deposition-precipitation synthesis route, morphology and microstructure of the as-obtained AgCl/CN composite and unsupported AgCl were studied using Field Emissions Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM).The relevant particle sizes for pure AgCl and other AgCl/CN composites were also investigated statistically and is summarized in Table 1.The morphology of pure AgCl manifested as irregular, almost-spherical particles with sizes ranging from 1000-3000 nm.Upon involvement of CN as a substrate, AgCl particles ripened to form nanospheres-like particles on the surface of CN.This is owing to the defects present in CN which function as nanoparticle nucleation sites and helped to suppress the growth rate of AgCl particles. 30This manifestation is illustrated in Figure 2, whereby the mean size of AgCl particles in its pure form and in AgCl/CN composite was reduced drastically from 2032 nm to 20-100 nm respectively.This nanocrystal formation is integral to the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity since this correlates to more reactive sites and shorter electron migration path to surface-adsorbed molecules.All AgCl nanoparticles were strongly anchored on the surface of CN and the intimate contact between AgCl and CN form an efficient heterojunction for the charge separation during the photocatalytic process.Additionally, another trend which can be established from FESEM, was the dispersion state of AgCl with increasing mass percentage.As observed in Figure 2(A-F), it was evident that the higher the mass percentage of AgCl incorporated, the more AgCl nanoparticles were formed on the CN support.Most notably, the average particle sizes of AgCl were found to increase in conjunction to an increased loading percentage.On top of that, increasing loading also produced AgCl nanoparticles which exhibited a wider distribution and thus a progressively higher standard deviation (SD).For Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins example, at the two loadings extremities, AgCl-10/CN yielded the smallest average particle size of 28.5 nm and a SD of 4.5 nm, whereas AgCl-70/CN yielded a considerably larger average particle size and a SD of 93.2 and 28.7 respectively.The complete particle size histograms for each pertaining mass percentages of AgCl/CN composites are provided in Figure S5(A-E).Furthermore, at higher loadings as illustrated in Figure 2(D-E), there was an apparent agglomeration of AgCl nanoparticles.This was owing to the excess number of AgCl on the CN sheet, which tend to agglomerate and form clumps, resulting in the poor dispersion of the nanoparticles. Overall, this revealed that the amount of AgCl incorporated in the composite is a highly influential parameter to the dispersion and the size of the AgCl nanoparticles deposited on the CN support.In addition to that, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping have also been performed.This is in order to examine the elemental distribution of the composite, which provided concrete evidence that all relevant elements (C, N, Ag and Cl) are highly dispersed with the spatial distribution as displayed in Figure 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the phase structure of the as-synthesized CN, AgCl and AgCl/CN composite as depicted in Figure 4. Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was additionally performed to investigate the surface elemental composition and chemical states of AgCl/CN as given in Figure 6(A-D).The high resolution C 1s spectrum showed two major peaks at 284.6eV and 288.2eV which is characteristic to the graphitic carbon (C-C bonding) and the disrupted sp 2 -bonded carbon (attributed by C-N groups) of CN respectively. 41On the other hand, N 1s spectrum showed an array of peaks owing to the multi-environment nitrogen atom.The most intense peak at 398.6eV was ascribed to aromatic (CN-C) linkage, the weaker 399.7eV peak corresponded to tertiary N bonded to C atoms (N-C 3 ), and the 401eV peak was assigned to amino groups (C-N-H), while lastly the highest binding energy peak at 404.3eV was attributed to excitation. 8As for Ag3d spectrum, it was comprised of two spin-orbit doublets represented by peaks at 368eV and 374eV, which was accredited to the binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 respectively.These individual peaks can be further deconvolved into two peaks whereby 367.5eV and 373.5eV peaks were designated to Ag in AgCl and meanwhile 368.6eV and 374.6eV peaks were to metal Ag 0 which may arise from slight photocorrosion of the sample due to the exposure of light whilst handling.On the other hand, Cl 2p spectra displayed two spin-orbit doublets of Cl 2p 5/2 and Cl 2p 3/2 which were correlated to bands of binding energy 197.8eV and 199.5eV respectively and were attributed to Cl -ion from AgCl. The photocatalytic performance of AgCl/CN in gas-phase CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 was investigated using a low-power 15W energy-saving daylight bulb as a visible light source and under ambient conditions.As observed from Figure 7(A), the habitation of AgCl on CN yielded a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic activity .Firstly, it could be seen from Figure 7(A) that even CN on its own exhibited a massive 30 fold improvement as compared to commercial P25.This was owing to its visible-responsive trait and its extended 2D, porous structure.The AgCl/CN composite further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of its derivative CN with an optimum achieved at an intermediate loading.Upon light illumination, the photocatalytic performance on CO This measures how efficiently the impinging photons were converted into electron-hole pairs that were subsequently used in the formation of CH 4 .Based on the photo-reduction of CO 2 under low-power 15W light source, the photochemical quantum yield of CH 4 was found to be 0.085.Although a low power daylight bulb was used, this result is comparable to some previously reported values which even employed high power Xe or Hg lamps, therefore making our process more practically feasible. 43444546 Several control experiments were executed to validate the role of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in the reduction of CO produced was in fact was derived from CO 2 and not due to carbon residues of the catalyst.Lastly, blank test ( 3) and ( 4) indicated the relevance of the role of these parameters (light and H 2 O) in the photo-reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .This confirmed that the CH 4 was in fact derived from photocatalysis and highlighted the significance of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in driving CO 2 reduction.Furthermore, the hourly progression of the CO 2 photo-reduction reaction can be observed from Figure 7(C).It can be seen that the reaction kicked off with low evolution of CH 4 which later increased as the reaction progresses.This observation can be associated to the low photo-conversion of CO 2 since intermediate products in the form of radicals were initially formed at this stage.However at succeeding hours, CH 4 evolution progressively reduced and this may be attributed to the radical intermediates and products saturating the active sites which consequently slowed down the rate of Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins reaction.A similar trend was also observed in a number of other CO 2 reduction reports. Since, it has been highlighted that there was a large enhancement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the AgCl/CN hybrid, it is now necessary to account the reasons for this observation.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared AgCl/CN composite and its derivatives (AgCl and CN) were measured to reflect their light harvesting ability towards different wavelength in the solar radiation.From Figure 8, both pure CN and AgCl exhibit typical semiconductor absorption whereby distinct absorption is seen only in the UV region (200nm-400nm) but a limited absorption in the visible region (400nm-700nm).Pure AgCl exhibited the highest absorption in the visible range, showing a bump due the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the photo-reduced Ag, whereas CN showed a minimal background absorption in that region.As compared to CN, composite AgCl/CN, displayed a strengthened absorption peak in the targeted visible light range (450-700nm) as well as the UV, validating the habitation of visible-light-sensitive AgCl host materials on CN.Moreover, this absorbance incrementally increases with the content of AgCl as shown in the inset in Figure 8.This confirms the fabrication of heterojunction structure between CN and light-sensitive AgCl allows for an enhanced optical absorption.The bandgap of CN and AgCl was individually obtained to be 2.7 and 3 eV respectively based from the plots of (F(R)hv) 1/2 vs hv (Figure S6).Once again, it should be pointed out that there was no distinct red or blue shift in the band edge of the composite with respect to CN, suggesting that AgCl nanoparticles was not covalently intercalated into CN matrix but it was merely dispersed on its surface owing to the low-temperature synthesis process.It was discussed earlier that AgCl/CN composite demonstrated the highest CH 4 yield at an intermediate loading.These findings suggested that the photocatalytic performance was impeded by larger particle sizes and agglomeration at higher loading content.This was since larger particles associate with lower surface area, longer electron migration paths and less area for light harvesting. 49rom another aspect, the bigger the cluster of AgCl nanoparticles anchored on CN, the weaker the co-ordination bond between CN and AgCl which then disrupted the heterojunction structure which led to a less efficient charge flow via the two materials.An appropriate amount of AgCl is hence paramount for an optimal enhancement in the photocatalytic activity.This claim was further corroborated by Photoluminescence (PL) emission measurements which is shown in Figure 9. PL spectra can be used to evaluate the recombination probability and separation efficiency of photoinduced electron and holes. 50Higher spectra intensity correlates to higher recombination rate as more electron and holes recombine to emit more (hv).The intensity goes by the order CN AgCl-70/CN AgCl-10/CN AgCl-50/CN AgCl-30/CN which were in accordance with the CO 2 photo-reduction results.This implied that AgCl-30/CN has the most efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs since it was the desired intermediate whereby enough AgCl were integrated for an improved light-absorption and heterojunction engineering but not in the extent where severe aggregation of its particles occurred.It is now evident that the hybridization of photosensitive AgCl to CN led to the improvement of photocatalytic activity, however its stability for practical application remains to be elucidated.Therefore, a recycling experiment was performed using the best sample AgCl-30/CN and all the experiment conditions were unchanged to ensure reproducibility of results.As shown in Fig. 7D, the photocatalytic reduction activity was only slightly reduced for each of the consecutive runs and the greater part of the photoactivity was preserved.This signifies that AgCl/CN composites were fairly stable and did not undergo serious decline in activity with repeated usage. After the recyclability experiment, which comprised of 4 runs, the spent AgCl-30/CN was analyzed using XPS to reveal the eventual formation of Ag 0 .From Fig. 2A, the XPS patterns of Ag 3d in AgCl- Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins generate a sustained photoactivity under prolonged reaction hours. Based from area analysis on Ag 3d XPS peaks, the mole ratio of surface metallic Ag 0 was 0.25 out of the total Ag species (Ag 0 Ag ) after the 4 consecutive stability runs as compared to a mere 0.09 for the case of fresh AgCl-30/CN catalyst.Accompanying this increase in intensity of Ag 0 peaks, was also the shrinking of Ag peaks in Ag 3d (Fig. 2A) and Cl peaks in Cl 2p (Fig 2B).Furthermore, all the Ag and Cl peaks have also been slightly shifted from their initial binding energy, indicating the renewed interaction with newly formed Ag 0 .These all further verified that in the course of the photocatalytic reaction, the entirety of AgCl in the composite was lost and there exist a new formation of an Ag/AgCl heterojunction.AgCl is photosensitive and its photo-generated electrons inevitably combines with Ag to form Ag 0 clusters on the AgCl particles from repeated absorption of photons.These Ag species which were formed during the photocatalytic process, brings significant benefits to photocatalysis.Firstly, Ag exhibits surface plasmon response (SPR) in the visible light region, meaning that it can utilize photons in visible light region to generate electron-hole pairs due to SPR oscillations.51, 52 This helped in enhancing the visible light absorption of the otherwise wide-bandgap AgCl.The subsequent separation of these plasmon-induced charge carriers in Ag is thereafter promoted by the Schottky barrier formed between the Ag-AgCl metal-semiconductor junction owing to the differences in their work function. 34This Schottky junction produced an internal electric field at the interface which forced electron and holes to move oppositely.Since Ag has lower work function than AgCl ( AgCl 4.8 eV Ag 4.25), the transfer of electrons occurred from Ag to AgCl. 53This relaying of electrons were also facilitated by the metallic nature of Ag which provided a fast medium for electron transfer. When CN and Ag/AgCl were coupled, they associate closely together to form a staggered heterojunction interface.The band potentials of semiconductor CN and AgCl (vs.NHE) were obtained by a theoretical method based on the absolute Mulliken electronegativity.This simple method has been proven to be in good agreement with the experimental results and has also been widely employed by an appreciable number of researchers.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of each semiconductor was calculated by the equation as follows Where, X, is the geometric mean of the absolute Mullikan electronegativity of constituent atoms, which can be calculated from the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy.E c is the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale taken as 4.

PL spectra can be used to evaluate the recombination probability and separation efficiency of photoinduced electron and holes. 50Higher spectra intensity correlates to higher recombination rate as more electron and holes recombine to emit more (hv).The intensity goes by the order CN AgCl-70/CN AgCl-10/CN AgCl-50/CN AgCl-30/CN which were in accordance with the CO 2 photo-reduction results.This implied that AgCl-30/CN has the most efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs since it was the desired intermediate whereby enough AgCl were integrated for an improved light-absorption and heterojunction engineering but not in the extent where severe aggregation of its particles occurred.It is now evident that the hybridization of photosensitive AgCl to CN led to the improvement of photocatalytic activity, however its stability for practical application remains to be elucidated.Therefore, a recycling experiment was performed using the best sample AgCl-30/CN and all the experiment conditions were unchanged to ensure reproducibility of results.As shown in Fig. 7D, the photocatalytic reduction activity was only slightly reduced for each of the consecutive runs and the greater part of the photoactivity was preserved.This signifies that AgCl/CN composites were fairly stable and did not undergo serious decline in activity with repeated usage. After the recyclability experiment, which comprised of 4 runs, the spent AgCl-30/CN was analyzed using XPS to reveal the eventual formation of Ag 0 .From Fig. 2A, the XPS patterns of Ag 3d in AgCl- Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins generate a sustained photoactivity under prolonged reaction hours. Based from area analysis on Ag 3d XPS peaks, the mole ratio of surface metallic Ag 0 was 0.25 out of the total Ag species (Ag 0 Ag ) after the 4 consecutive stability runs as compared to a mere 0.09 for the case of fresh AgCl-30/CN catalyst.Accompanying this increase in intensity of Ag 0 peaks, was also the shrinking of Ag peaks in Ag 3d (Fig. 2A) and Cl peaks in Cl 2p (Fig 2B).Furthermore, all the Ag and Cl peaks have also been slightly shifted from their initial binding energy, indicating the renewed interaction with newly formed Ag 0 .These all further verified that in the course of the photocatalytic reaction, the entirety of AgCl in the composite was lost and there exist a new formation of an Ag/AgCl heterojunction.AgCl is photosensitive and its photo-generated electrons inevitably combines with Ag to form Ag 0 clusters on the AgCl particles from repeated absorption of photons.These Ag species which were formed during the photocatalytic process, brings significant benefits to photocatalysis.Firstly, Ag exhibits surface plasmon response (SPR) in the visible light region, meaning that it can utilize photons in visible light region to generate electron-hole pairs due to SPR oscillations.51, 52 This helped in enhancing the visible light absorption of the otherwise wide-bandgap AgCl.The subsequent separation of these plasmon-induced charge carriers in Ag is thereafter promoted by the Schottky barrier formed between the Ag-AgCl metal-semiconductor junction owing to the differences in their work function. 34This Schottky junction produced an internal electric field at the interface which forced electron and holes to move oppositely.Since Ag has lower work function than AgCl ( AgCl 4.8 eV Ag 4.25), the transfer of electrons occurred from Ag to AgCl. 53This relaying of electrons were also facilitated by the metallic nature of Ag which provided a fast medium for electron transfer. When CN and Ag/AgCl were coupled, they associate closely together to form a staggered heterojunction interface.The band potentials of semiconductor CN and AgCl (vs.NHE) were obtained by a theoretical method based on the absolute Mulliken electronegativity.This simple method has been proven to be in good agreement with the experimental results and has also been widely employed by an appreciable number of researchers.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of each semiconductor was calculated by the equation as follows Where, X, is the geometric mean of the absolute Mullikan electronegativity of constituent atoms, which can be calculated from the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy.E c is the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale taken as 4. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Moreover, CH 4 was the only hydrocarbon product which was detected in this experiment.Typically, CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the gas phase produced CO, CH 4 or higher alkenes, while oxygenated products such as alcohols and carboxylic acids are only collected in high H 2 O environment such as under liquid phase, or at high H 2 O/CO 2 ratio which would otherwise require an elevated temperature or a reduced pressure condition. 575885960 Since in this case, the H 2 O/CO 2 was low at 0.043, these products are likely to be absent.Moreover, another plausible reason as to why other hydrocarbon products were not existent in the product gas, can also be explained from their reduction potential in comparison to CH 4 .The reduction potentials of other possible products are given as follows: CO 2 /HCOOH: -0.61 V possesses the lowest reduction potential, inferring that it is the most thermodynamically favored product.This can be an accountable reason for CH 4 as being the sole product achieved.In addition to that, no considerable H 2 molecules were also detected in the product gas.This can possibly mean that intermediate H radicals and protons generated from to the dissociation of water molecules were rapidly consumed by CO 2 in the photocatalytic reaction.An observation similar to this has also been reported by Liu et al. 65 , Yu et al. 66 and Wang et al."}, {"llm generation": "CN", "source": "The high resolution C 1s spectrum showed two major peaks at 284.6eV and 288.2eV which is characteristic to the graphitic carbon (C-C bonding) and the disrupted sp 2 -bonded carbon (attributed by C-N groups) of CN respectively. 41", "context": "Urea was initially used as a precursor since it is low cost and allegedly yield a more thin, flake-like and mesoporous structure due to releases of CO 2 and NH 3 during its pyrolysis. 26,27A TEM image of the as-prepared CN is provided in Fig S3 .Initially, the obtained bulk CN underwent sonication in 0.5M HCl acid solution.This triggered the delamination of the layered CN into individual sheets, which in effect, assist in furnishing larger contact area subjectable to protonation attack.In addition, this transformation from bulk CN to CN nanosheets is also vital to the photocatalytic efficiency.In the event of bulk CN, most of the strands in the inner bulk layers have redundant role and do not contribute to photocatalysis at all.These bounded sheets reduces the effective surface area and severely limits adsorption-desorption area and light harnessing sites.More importantly, photo-excited carriers in the bulk CN suffers from serious bulk recombination owing to the long travelling distance it requires in reaching the surface.This exfoliation of bulk CN to thin, 2D nanosheets is hence a necessity as it increases the probability of charge carriers in reaching the surface, where it can be consumed to drive photoreactions. 28On another note, acid treatment serves to increase the abundance of amino function groups onto CN sheets surface, which will successively play a key role in the adhesion of AgCl nanoparticles. 4,29 his formation was validated by FTIR analysis in which there exists the emergence of N-H bump corresponding to the peak at 3200cm -1 as depicted in Figure S4.The corresponding amine group will then play apart in acting as Lewis bases whereby the lone pairs of electrons on the N atom in the tri-s-triazine ring structure co-ordinates and bind strongly to metal Ag upon addition of reagent AgNO 3.This was then subsequently grown into AgCl nanoparticles through an in-situ nucleation mechanism by deposition-precipitation method under ambient room temperature.The schematic depiction of the synthesis strategy is presented in Figure 1. To attest the efficacy of the deposition-precipitation synthesis route, morphology and microstructure of the as-obtained AgCl/CN composite and unsupported AgCl were studied using Field Emissions Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM).The relevant particle sizes for pure AgCl and other AgCl/CN composites were also investigated statistically and is summarized in Table 1.The morphology of pure AgCl manifested as irregular, almost-spherical particles with sizes ranging from 1000-3000 nm.Upon involvement of CN as a substrate, AgCl particles ripened to form nanospheres-like particles on the surface of CN.This is owing to the defects present in CN which function as nanoparticle nucleation sites and helped to suppress the growth rate of AgCl particles. 30This manifestation is illustrated in Figure 2, whereby the mean size of AgCl particles in its pure form and in AgCl/CN composite was reduced drastically from 2032 nm to 20-100 nm respectively.This nanocrystal formation is integral to the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity since this correlates to more reactive sites and shorter electron migration path to surface-adsorbed molecules.All AgCl nanoparticles were strongly anchored on the surface of CN and the intimate contact between AgCl and CN form an efficient heterojunction for the charge separation during the photocatalytic process.Additionally, another trend which can be established from FESEM, was the dispersion state of AgCl with increasing mass percentage.As observed in Figure 2(A-F), it was evident that the higher the mass percentage of AgCl incorporated, the more AgCl nanoparticles were formed on the CN support.Most notably, the average particle sizes of AgCl were found to increase in conjunction to an increased loading percentage.On top of that, increasing loading also produced AgCl nanoparticles which exhibited a wider distribution and thus a progressively higher standard deviation (SD).For Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins example, at the two loadings extremities, AgCl-10/CN yielded the smallest average particle size of 28.5 nm and a SD of 4.5 nm, whereas AgCl-70/CN yielded a considerably larger average particle size and a SD of 93.2 and 28.7 respectively.The complete particle size histograms for each pertaining mass percentages of AgCl/CN composites are provided in Figure S5(A-E).Furthermore, at higher loadings as illustrated in Figure 2(D-E), there was an apparent agglomeration of AgCl nanoparticles.This was owing to the excess number of AgCl on the CN sheet, which tend to agglomerate and form clumps, resulting in the poor dispersion of the nanoparticles. Overall, this revealed that the amount of AgCl incorporated in the composite is a highly influential parameter to the dispersion and the size of the AgCl nanoparticles deposited on the CN support.In addition to that, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping have also been performed.This is in order to examine the elemental distribution of the composite, which provided concrete evidence that all relevant elements (C, N, Ag and Cl) are highly dispersed with the spatial distribution as displayed in Figure 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the phase structure of the as-synthesized CN, AgCl and AgCl/CN composite as depicted in Figure 4. Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was additionally performed to investigate the surface elemental composition and chemical states of AgCl/CN as given in Figure 6(A-D).The high resolution C 1s spectrum showed two major peaks at 284.6eV and 288.2eV which is characteristic to the graphitic carbon (C-C bonding) and the disrupted sp 2 -bonded carbon (attributed by C-N groups) of CN respectively. 41On the other hand, N 1s spectrum showed an array of peaks owing to the multi-environment nitrogen atom.The most intense peak at 398.6eV was ascribed to aromatic (CN-C) linkage, the weaker 399.7eV peak corresponded to tertiary N bonded to C atoms (N-C 3 ), and the 401eV peak was assigned to amino groups (C-N-H), while lastly the highest binding energy peak at 404.3eV was attributed to excitation. 8As for Ag3d spectrum, it was comprised of two spin-orbit doublets represented by peaks at 368eV and 374eV, which was accredited to the binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 respectively.These individual peaks can be further deconvolved into two peaks whereby 367.5eV and 373.5eV peaks were designated to Ag in AgCl and meanwhile 368.6eV and 374.6eV peaks were to metal Ag 0 which may arise from slight photocorrosion of the sample due to the exposure of light whilst handling.On the other hand, Cl 2p spectra displayed two spin-orbit doublets of Cl 2p 5/2 and Cl 2p 3/2 which were correlated to bands of binding energy 197.8eV and 199.5eV respectively and were attributed to Cl -ion from AgCl.

Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was additionally performed to investigate the surface elemental composition and chemical states of AgCl/CN as given in Figure 6(A-D).The high resolution C 1s spectrum showed two major peaks at 284.6eV and 288.2eV which is characteristic to the graphitic carbon (C-C bonding) and the disrupted sp 2 -bonded carbon (attributed by C-N groups) of CN respectively. 41On the other hand, N 1s spectrum showed an array of peaks owing to the multi-environment nitrogen atom.The most intense peak at 398.6eV was ascribed to aromatic (CN-C) linkage, the weaker 399.7eV peak corresponded to tertiary N bonded to C atoms (N-C 3 ), and the 401eV peak was assigned to amino groups (C-N-H), while lastly the highest binding energy peak at 404.3eV was attributed to excitation. 8As for Ag3d spectrum, it was comprised of two spin-orbit doublets represented by peaks at 368eV and 374eV, which was accredited to the binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 respectively.These individual peaks can be further deconvolved into two peaks whereby 367.5eV and 373.5eV peaks were designated to Ag in AgCl and meanwhile 368.6eV and 374.6eV peaks were to metal Ag 0 which may arise from slight photocorrosion of the sample due to the exposure of light whilst handling.On the other hand, Cl 2p spectra displayed two spin-orbit doublets of Cl 2p 5/2 and Cl 2p 3/2 which were correlated to bands of binding energy 197.8eV and 199.5eV respectively and were attributed to Cl -ion from AgCl. The photocatalytic performance of AgCl/CN in gas-phase CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 was investigated using a low-power 15W energy-saving daylight bulb as a visible light source and under ambient conditions.As observed from Figure 7(A), the habitation of AgCl on CN yielded a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic activity .Firstly, it could be seen from Figure 7(A) that even CN on its own exhibited a massive 30 fold improvement as compared to commercial P25.This was owing to its visible-responsive trait and its extended 2D, porous structure.The AgCl/CN composite further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of its derivative CN with an optimum achieved at an intermediate loading.Upon light illumination, the photocatalytic performance on CO This measures how efficiently the impinging photons were converted into electron-hole pairs that were subsequently used in the formation of CH 4 .Based on the photo-reduction of CO 2 under low-power 15W light source, the photochemical quantum yield of CH 4 was found to be 0.085.Although a low power daylight bulb was used, this result is comparable to some previously reported values which even employed high power Xe or Hg lamps, therefore making our process more practically feasible. 43444546 Several control experiments were executed to validate the role of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in the reduction of CO produced was in fact was derived from CO 2 and not due to carbon residues of the catalyst.Lastly, blank test ( 3) and ( 4) indicated the relevance of the role of these parameters (light and H 2 O) in the photo-reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .This confirmed that the CH 4 was in fact derived from photocatalysis and highlighted the significance of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in driving CO 2 reduction.Furthermore, the hourly progression of the CO 2 photo-reduction reaction can be observed from Figure 7(C).It can be seen that the reaction kicked off with low evolution of CH 4 which later increased as the reaction progresses.This observation can be associated to the low photo-conversion of CO 2 since intermediate products in the form of radicals were initially formed at this stage.However at succeeding hours, CH 4 evolution progressively reduced and this may be attributed to the radical intermediates and products saturating the active sites which consequently slowed down the rate of Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins reaction.A similar trend was also observed in a number of other CO 2 reduction reports. Since, it has been highlighted that there was a large enhancement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the AgCl/CN hybrid, it is now necessary to account the reasons for this observation.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared AgCl/CN composite and its derivatives (AgCl and CN) were measured to reflect their light harvesting ability towards different wavelength in the solar radiation.From Figure 8, both pure CN and AgCl exhibit typical semiconductor absorption whereby distinct absorption is seen only in the UV region (200nm-400nm) but a limited absorption in the visible region (400nm-700nm).Pure AgCl exhibited the highest absorption in the visible range, showing a bump due the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the photo-reduced Ag, whereas CN showed a minimal background absorption in that region.As compared to CN, composite AgCl/CN, displayed a strengthened absorption peak in the targeted visible light range (450-700nm) as well as the UV, validating the habitation of visible-light-sensitive AgCl host materials on CN.Moreover, this absorbance incrementally increases with the content of AgCl as shown in the inset in Figure 8.This confirms the fabrication of heterojunction structure between CN and light-sensitive AgCl allows for an enhanced optical absorption.The bandgap of CN and AgCl was individually obtained to be 2.7 and 3 eV respectively based from the plots of (F(R)hv) 1/2 vs hv (Figure S6).Once again, it should be pointed out that there was no distinct red or blue shift in the band edge of the composite with respect to CN, suggesting that AgCl nanoparticles was not covalently intercalated into CN matrix but it was merely dispersed on its surface owing to the low-temperature synthesis process.It was discussed earlier that AgCl/CN composite demonstrated the highest CH 4 yield at an intermediate loading.These findings suggested that the photocatalytic performance was impeded by larger particle sizes and agglomeration at higher loading content.This was since larger particles associate with lower surface area, longer electron migration paths and less area for light harvesting. 49rom another aspect, the bigger the cluster of AgCl nanoparticles anchored on CN, the weaker the co-ordination bond between CN and AgCl which then disrupted the heterojunction structure which led to a less efficient charge flow via the two materials.An appropriate amount of AgCl is hence paramount for an optimal enhancement in the photocatalytic activity.This claim was further corroborated by Photoluminescence (PL) emission measurements which is shown in Figure 9. PL spectra can be used to evaluate the recombination probability and separation efficiency of photoinduced electron and holes. 50Higher spectra intensity correlates to higher recombination rate as more electron and holes recombine to emit more (hv).The intensity goes by the order CN AgCl-70/CN AgCl-10/CN AgCl-50/CN AgCl-30/CN which were in accordance with the CO 2 photo-reduction results.This implied that AgCl-30/CN has the most efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs since it was the desired intermediate whereby enough AgCl were integrated for an improved light-absorption and heterojunction engineering but not in the extent where severe aggregation of its particles occurred.It is now evident that the hybridization of photosensitive AgCl to CN led to the improvement of photocatalytic activity, however its stability for practical application remains to be elucidated.Therefore, a recycling experiment was performed using the best sample AgCl-30/CN and all the experiment conditions were unchanged to ensure reproducibility of results.As shown in Fig. 7D, the photocatalytic reduction activity was only slightly reduced for each of the consecutive runs and the greater part of the photoactivity was preserved.This signifies that AgCl/CN composites were fairly stable and did not undergo serious decline in activity with repeated usage. After the recyclability experiment, which comprised of 4 runs, the spent AgCl-30/CN was analyzed using XPS to reveal the eventual formation of Ag 0 .From Fig. 2A, the XPS patterns of Ag 3d in AgCl- Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins generate a sustained photoactivity under prolonged reaction hours. Based from area analysis on Ag 3d XPS peaks, the mole ratio of surface metallic Ag 0 was 0.25 out of the total Ag species (Ag 0 Ag ) after the 4 consecutive stability runs as compared to a mere 0.09 for the case of fresh AgCl-30/CN catalyst.Accompanying this increase in intensity of Ag 0 peaks, was also the shrinking of Ag peaks in Ag 3d (Fig. 2A) and Cl peaks in Cl 2p (Fig 2B).Furthermore, all the Ag and Cl peaks have also been slightly shifted from their initial binding energy, indicating the renewed interaction with newly formed Ag 0 .These all further verified that in the course of the photocatalytic reaction, the entirety of AgCl in the composite was lost and there exist a new formation of an Ag/AgCl heterojunction.AgCl is photosensitive and its photo-generated electrons inevitably combines with Ag to form Ag 0 clusters on the AgCl particles from repeated absorption of photons.These Ag species which were formed during the photocatalytic process, brings significant benefits to photocatalysis.Firstly, Ag exhibits surface plasmon response (SPR) in the visible light region, meaning that it can utilize photons in visible light region to generate electron-hole pairs due to SPR oscillations.51, 52 This helped in enhancing the visible light absorption of the otherwise wide-bandgap AgCl.The subsequent separation of these plasmon-induced charge carriers in Ag is thereafter promoted by the Schottky barrier formed between the Ag-AgCl metal-semiconductor junction owing to the differences in their work function. 34This Schottky junction produced an internal electric field at the interface which forced electron and holes to move oppositely.Since Ag has lower work function than AgCl ( AgCl 4.8 eV Ag 4.25), the transfer of electrons occurred from Ag to AgCl. 53This relaying of electrons were also facilitated by the metallic nature of Ag which provided a fast medium for electron transfer. When CN and Ag/AgCl were coupled, they associate closely together to form a staggered heterojunction interface.The band potentials of semiconductor CN and AgCl (vs.NHE) were obtained by a theoretical method based on the absolute Mulliken electronegativity.This simple method has been proven to be in good agreement with the experimental results and has also been widely employed by an appreciable number of researchers.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of each semiconductor was calculated by the equation as follows Where, X, is the geometric mean of the absolute Mullikan electronegativity of constituent atoms, which can be calculated from the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy.E c is the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale taken as 4. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Moreover, CH 4 was the only hydrocarbon product which was detected in this experiment.Typically, CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the gas phase produced CO, CH 4 or higher alkenes, while oxygenated products such as alcohols and carboxylic acids are only collected in high H 2 O environment such as under liquid phase, or at high H 2 O/CO 2 ratio which would otherwise require an elevated temperature or a reduced pressure condition. 575885960 Since in this case, the H 2 O/CO 2 was low at 0.043, these products are likely to be absent.Moreover, another plausible reason as to why other hydrocarbon products were not existent in the product gas, can also be explained from their reduction potential in comparison to CH 4 .The reduction potentials of other possible products are given as follows: CO 2 /HCOOH: -0.61 V possesses the lowest reduction potential, inferring that it is the most thermodynamically favored product.This can be an accountable reason for CH 4 as being the sole product achieved.In addition to that, no considerable H 2 molecules were also detected in the product gas.This can possibly mean that intermediate H radicals and protons generated from to the dissociation of water molecules were rapidly consumed by CO 2 in the photocatalytic reaction.An observation similar to this has also been reported by Liu et al. 65 , Yu et al. 66 and Wang et al."}, {"llm generation": "CN", "source": "As compared to CN, composite AgCl/CN, displayed a strengthened absorption peak in the targeted visible light range (450-700nm) as well as the UV, validating the habitation of visible-light-sensitive AgCl host materials on CN.", "context": "Urea was initially used as a precursor since it is low cost and allegedly yield a more thin, flake-like and mesoporous structure due to releases of CO 2 and NH 3 during its pyrolysis. 26,27A TEM image of the as-prepared CN is provided in Fig S3 .Initially, the obtained bulk CN underwent sonication in 0.5M HCl acid solution.This triggered the delamination of the layered CN into individual sheets, which in effect, assist in furnishing larger contact area subjectable to protonation attack.In addition, this transformation from bulk CN to CN nanosheets is also vital to the photocatalytic efficiency.In the event of bulk CN, most of the strands in the inner bulk layers have redundant role and do not contribute to photocatalysis at all.These bounded sheets reduces the effective surface area and severely limits adsorption-desorption area and light harnessing sites.More importantly, photo-excited carriers in the bulk CN suffers from serious bulk recombination owing to the long travelling distance it requires in reaching the surface.This exfoliation of bulk CN to thin, 2D nanosheets is hence a necessity as it increases the probability of charge carriers in reaching the surface, where it can be consumed to drive photoreactions. 28On another note, acid treatment serves to increase the abundance of amino function groups onto CN sheets surface, which will successively play a key role in the adhesion of AgCl nanoparticles. 4,29 his formation was validated by FTIR analysis in which there exists the emergence of N-H bump corresponding to the peak at 3200cm -1 as depicted in Figure S4.The corresponding amine group will then play apart in acting as Lewis bases whereby the lone pairs of electrons on the N atom in the tri-s-triazine ring structure co-ordinates and bind strongly to metal Ag upon addition of reagent AgNO 3.This was then subsequently grown into AgCl nanoparticles through an in-situ nucleation mechanism by deposition-precipitation method under ambient room temperature.The schematic depiction of the synthesis strategy is presented in Figure 1. To attest the efficacy of the deposition-precipitation synthesis route, morphology and microstructure of the as-obtained AgCl/CN composite and unsupported AgCl were studied using Field Emissions Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM).The relevant particle sizes for pure AgCl and other AgCl/CN composites were also investigated statistically and is summarized in Table 1.The morphology of pure AgCl manifested as irregular, almost-spherical particles with sizes ranging from 1000-3000 nm.Upon involvement of CN as a substrate, AgCl particles ripened to form nanospheres-like particles on the surface of CN.This is owing to the defects present in CN which function as nanoparticle nucleation sites and helped to suppress the growth rate of AgCl particles. 30This manifestation is illustrated in Figure 2, whereby the mean size of AgCl particles in its pure form and in AgCl/CN composite was reduced drastically from 2032 nm to 20-100 nm respectively.This nanocrystal formation is integral to the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity since this correlates to more reactive sites and shorter electron migration path to surface-adsorbed molecules.All AgCl nanoparticles were strongly anchored on the surface of CN and the intimate contact between AgCl and CN form an efficient heterojunction for the charge separation during the photocatalytic process.Additionally, another trend which can be established from FESEM, was the dispersion state of AgCl with increasing mass percentage.As observed in Figure 2(A-F), it was evident that the higher the mass percentage of AgCl incorporated, the more AgCl nanoparticles were formed on the CN support.Most notably, the average particle sizes of AgCl were found to increase in conjunction to an increased loading percentage.On top of that, increasing loading also produced AgCl nanoparticles which exhibited a wider distribution and thus a progressively higher standard deviation (SD).For Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins example, at the two loadings extremities, AgCl-10/CN yielded the smallest average particle size of 28.5 nm and a SD of 4.5 nm, whereas AgCl-70/CN yielded a considerably larger average particle size and a SD of 93.2 and 28.7 respectively.The complete particle size histograms for each pertaining mass percentages of AgCl/CN composites are provided in Figure S5(A-E).Furthermore, at higher loadings as illustrated in Figure 2(D-E), there was an apparent agglomeration of AgCl nanoparticles.This was owing to the excess number of AgCl on the CN sheet, which tend to agglomerate and form clumps, resulting in the poor dispersion of the nanoparticles. Overall, this revealed that the amount of AgCl incorporated in the composite is a highly influential parameter to the dispersion and the size of the AgCl nanoparticles deposited on the CN support.In addition to that, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping have also been performed.This is in order to examine the elemental distribution of the composite, which provided concrete evidence that all relevant elements (C, N, Ag and Cl) are highly dispersed with the spatial distribution as displayed in Figure 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the phase structure of the as-synthesized CN, AgCl and AgCl/CN composite as depicted in Figure 4. Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples.

Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Moreover, CH 4 was the only hydrocarbon product which was detected in this experiment.Typically, CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the gas phase produced CO, CH 4 or higher alkenes, while oxygenated products such as alcohols and carboxylic acids are only collected in high H 2 O environment such as under liquid phase, or at high H 2 O/CO 2 ratio which would otherwise require an elevated temperature or a reduced pressure condition. 575885960 Since in this case, the H 2 O/CO 2 was low at 0.043, these products are likely to be absent.Moreover, another plausible reason as to why other hydrocarbon products were not existent in the product gas, can also be explained from their reduction potential in comparison to CH 4 .The reduction potentials of other possible products are given as follows: CO 2 /HCOOH: -0.61 V possesses the lowest reduction potential, inferring that it is the most thermodynamically favored product.This can be an accountable reason for CH 4 as being the sole product achieved.In addition to that, no considerable H 2 molecules were also detected in the product gas.This can possibly mean that intermediate H radicals and protons generated from to the dissociation of water molecules were rapidly consumed by CO 2 in the photocatalytic reaction.An observation similar to this has also been reported by Liu et al. 65 , Yu et al. 66 and Wang et al."}, {"llm generation": "AgCl/CN", "source": "As compared to CN, composite AgCl/CN, displayed a strengthened absorption peak in the targeted visible light range (450-700nm) as well as the UV, validating the habitation of visible-light-sensitive AgCl host materials on CN.", "context": "Urea was initially used as a precursor since it is low cost and allegedly yield a more thin, flake-like and mesoporous structure due to releases of CO 2 and NH 3 during its pyrolysis. 26,27A TEM image of the as-prepared CN is provided in Fig S3 .Initially, the obtained bulk CN underwent sonication in 0.5M HCl acid solution.This triggered the delamination of the layered CN into individual sheets, which in effect, assist in furnishing larger contact area subjectable to protonation attack.In addition, this transformation from bulk CN to CN nanosheets is also vital to the photocatalytic efficiency.In the event of bulk CN, most of the strands in the inner bulk layers have redundant role and do not contribute to photocatalysis at all.These bounded sheets reduces the effective surface area and severely limits adsorption-desorption area and light harnessing sites.More importantly, photo-excited carriers in the bulk CN suffers from serious bulk recombination owing to the long travelling distance it requires in reaching the surface.This exfoliation of bulk CN to thin, 2D nanosheets is hence a necessity as it increases the probability of charge carriers in reaching the surface, where it can be consumed to drive photoreactions. 28On another note, acid treatment serves to increase the abundance of amino function groups onto CN sheets surface, which will successively play a key role in the adhesion of AgCl nanoparticles. 4,29 his formation was validated by FTIR analysis in which there exists the emergence of N-H bump corresponding to the peak at 3200cm -1 as depicted in Figure S4.The corresponding amine group will then play apart in acting as Lewis bases whereby the lone pairs of electrons on the N atom in the tri-s-triazine ring structure co-ordinates and bind strongly to metal Ag upon addition of reagent AgNO 3.This was then subsequently grown into AgCl nanoparticles through an in-situ nucleation mechanism by deposition-precipitation method under ambient room temperature.The schematic depiction of the synthesis strategy is presented in Figure 1. To attest the efficacy of the deposition-precipitation synthesis route, morphology and microstructure of the as-obtained AgCl/CN composite and unsupported AgCl were studied using Field Emissions Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM).The relevant particle sizes for pure AgCl and other AgCl/CN composites were also investigated statistically and is summarized in Table 1.The morphology of pure AgCl manifested as irregular, almost-spherical particles with sizes ranging from 1000-3000 nm.Upon involvement of CN as a substrate, AgCl particles ripened to form nanospheres-like particles on the surface of CN.This is owing to the defects present in CN which function as nanoparticle nucleation sites and helped to suppress the growth rate of AgCl particles. 30This manifestation is illustrated in Figure 2, whereby the mean size of AgCl particles in its pure form and in AgCl/CN composite was reduced drastically from 2032 nm to 20-100 nm respectively.This nanocrystal formation is integral to the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity since this correlates to more reactive sites and shorter electron migration path to surface-adsorbed molecules.All AgCl nanoparticles were strongly anchored on the surface of CN and the intimate contact between AgCl and CN form an efficient heterojunction for the charge separation during the photocatalytic process.Additionally, another trend which can be established from FESEM, was the dispersion state of AgCl with increasing mass percentage.As observed in Figure 2(A-F), it was evident that the higher the mass percentage of AgCl incorporated, the more AgCl nanoparticles were formed on the CN support.Most notably, the average particle sizes of AgCl were found to increase in conjunction to an increased loading percentage.On top of that, increasing loading also produced AgCl nanoparticles which exhibited a wider distribution and thus a progressively higher standard deviation (SD).For Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins example, at the two loadings extremities, AgCl-10/CN yielded the smallest average particle size of 28.5 nm and a SD of 4.5 nm, whereas AgCl-70/CN yielded a considerably larger average particle size and a SD of 93.2 and 28.7 respectively.The complete particle size histograms for each pertaining mass percentages of AgCl/CN composites are provided in Figure S5(A-E).Furthermore, at higher loadings as illustrated in Figure 2(D-E), there was an apparent agglomeration of AgCl nanoparticles.This was owing to the excess number of AgCl on the CN sheet, which tend to agglomerate and form clumps, resulting in the poor dispersion of the nanoparticles. Overall, this revealed that the amount of AgCl incorporated in the composite is a highly influential parameter to the dispersion and the size of the AgCl nanoparticles deposited on the CN support.In addition to that, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping have also been performed.This is in order to examine the elemental distribution of the composite, which provided concrete evidence that all relevant elements (C, N, Ag and Cl) are highly dispersed with the spatial distribution as displayed in Figure 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the phase structure of the as-synthesized CN, AgCl and AgCl/CN composite as depicted in Figure 4. Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was additionally performed to investigate the surface elemental composition and chemical states of AgCl/CN as given in Figure 6(A-D).The high resolution C 1s spectrum showed two major peaks at 284.6eV and 288.2eV which is characteristic to the graphitic carbon (C-C bonding) and the disrupted sp 2 -bonded carbon (attributed by C-N groups) of CN respectively. 41On the other hand, N 1s spectrum showed an array of peaks owing to the multi-environment nitrogen atom.The most intense peak at 398.6eV was ascribed to aromatic (CN-C) linkage, the weaker 399.7eV peak corresponded to tertiary N bonded to C atoms (N-C 3 ), and the 401eV peak was assigned to amino groups (C-N-H), while lastly the highest binding energy peak at 404.3eV was attributed to excitation. 8As for Ag3d spectrum, it was comprised of two spin-orbit doublets represented by peaks at 368eV and 374eV, which was accredited to the binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 respectively.These individual peaks can be further deconvolved into two peaks whereby 367.5eV and 373.5eV peaks were designated to Ag in AgCl and meanwhile 368.6eV and 374.6eV peaks were to metal Ag 0 which may arise from slight photocorrosion of the sample due to the exposure of light whilst handling.On the other hand, Cl 2p spectra displayed two spin-orbit doublets of Cl 2p 5/2 and Cl 2p 3/2 which were correlated to bands of binding energy 197.8eV and 199.5eV respectively and were attributed to Cl -ion from AgCl. The photocatalytic performance of AgCl/CN in gas-phase CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 was investigated using a low-power 15W energy-saving daylight bulb as a visible light source and under ambient conditions.As observed from Figure 7(A), the habitation of AgCl on CN yielded a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic activity .Firstly, it could be seen from Figure 7(A) that even CN on its own exhibited a massive 30 fold improvement as compared to commercial P25.This was owing to its visible-responsive trait and its extended 2D, porous structure.The AgCl/CN composite further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of its derivative CN with an optimum achieved at an intermediate loading.Upon light illumination, the photocatalytic performance on CO This measures how efficiently the impinging photons were converted into electron-hole pairs that were subsequently used in the formation of CH 4 .Based on the photo-reduction of CO 2 under low-power 15W light source, the photochemical quantum yield of CH 4 was found to be 0.085.Although a low power daylight bulb was used, this result is comparable to some previously reported values which even employed high power Xe or Hg lamps, therefore making our process more practically feasible. 43444546 Several control experiments were executed to validate the role of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in the reduction of CO produced was in fact was derived from CO 2 and not due to carbon residues of the catalyst.Lastly, blank test ( 3) and ( 4) indicated the relevance of the role of these parameters (light and H 2 O) in the photo-reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .This confirmed that the CH 4 was in fact derived from photocatalysis and highlighted the significance of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in driving CO 2 reduction.Furthermore, the hourly progression of the CO 2 photo-reduction reaction can be observed from Figure 7(C).It can be seen that the reaction kicked off with low evolution of CH 4 which later increased as the reaction progresses.This observation can be associated to the low photo-conversion of CO 2 since intermediate products in the form of radicals were initially formed at this stage.However at succeeding hours, CH 4 evolution progressively reduced and this may be attributed to the radical intermediates and products saturating the active sites which consequently slowed down the rate of Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins reaction.A similar trend was also observed in a number of other CO 2 reduction reports. Since, it has been highlighted that there was a large enhancement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the AgCl/CN hybrid, it is now necessary to account the reasons for this observation.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared AgCl/CN composite and its derivatives (AgCl and CN) were measured to reflect their light harvesting ability towards different wavelength in the solar radiation.From Figure 8, both pure CN and AgCl exhibit typical semiconductor absorption whereby distinct absorption is seen only in the UV region (200nm-400nm) but a limited absorption in the visible region (400nm-700nm).Pure AgCl exhibited the highest absorption in the visible range, showing a bump due the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the photo-reduced Ag, whereas CN showed a minimal background absorption in that region.As compared to CN, composite AgCl/CN, displayed a strengthened absorption peak in the targeted visible light range (450-700nm) as well as the UV, validating the habitation of visible-light-sensitive AgCl host materials on CN.Moreover, this absorbance incrementally increases with the content of AgCl as shown in the inset in Figure 8.This confirms the fabrication of heterojunction structure between CN and light-sensitive AgCl allows for an enhanced optical absorption.The bandgap of CN and AgCl was individually obtained to be 2.7 and 3 eV respectively based from the plots of (F(R)hv) 1/2 vs hv (Figure S6).Once again, it should be pointed out that there was no distinct red or blue shift in the band edge of the composite with respect to CN, suggesting that AgCl nanoparticles was not covalently intercalated into CN matrix but it was merely dispersed on its surface owing to the low-temperature synthesis process.It was discussed earlier that AgCl/CN composite demonstrated the highest CH 4 yield at an intermediate loading.These findings suggested that the photocatalytic performance was impeded by larger particle sizes and agglomeration at higher loading content.This was since larger particles associate with lower surface area, longer electron migration paths and less area for light harvesting. 49rom another aspect, the bigger the cluster of AgCl nanoparticles anchored on CN, the weaker the co-ordination bond between CN and AgCl which then disrupted the heterojunction structure which led to a less efficient charge flow via the two materials.An appropriate amount of AgCl is hence paramount for an optimal enhancement in the photocatalytic activity.This claim was further corroborated by Photoluminescence (PL) emission measurements which is shown in Figure 9. PL spectra can be used to evaluate the recombination probability and separation efficiency of photoinduced electron and holes. 50Higher spectra intensity correlates to higher recombination rate as more electron and holes recombine to emit more (hv).The intensity goes by the order CN AgCl-70/CN AgCl-10/CN AgCl-50/CN AgCl-30/CN which were in accordance with the CO 2 photo-reduction results.This implied that AgCl-30/CN has the most efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs since it was the desired intermediate whereby enough AgCl were integrated for an improved light-absorption and heterojunction engineering but not in the extent where severe aggregation of its particles occurred.It is now evident that the hybridization of photosensitive AgCl to CN led to the improvement of photocatalytic activity, however its stability for practical application remains to be elucidated.Therefore, a recycling experiment was performed using the best sample AgCl-30/CN and all the experiment conditions were unchanged to ensure reproducibility of results.As shown in Fig. 7D, the photocatalytic reduction activity was only slightly reduced for each of the consecutive runs and the greater part of the photoactivity was preserved.This signifies that AgCl/CN composites were fairly stable and did not undergo serious decline in activity with repeated usage. After the recyclability experiment, which comprised of 4 runs, the spent AgCl-30/CN was analyzed using XPS to reveal the eventual formation of Ag 0 .From Fig. 2A, the XPS patterns of Ag 3d in AgCl- Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins generate a sustained photoactivity under prolonged reaction hours. Based from area analysis on Ag 3d XPS peaks, the mole ratio of surface metallic Ag 0 was 0.25 out of the total Ag species (Ag 0 Ag ) after the 4 consecutive stability runs as compared to a mere 0.09 for the case of fresh AgCl-30/CN catalyst.Accompanying this increase in intensity of Ag 0 peaks, was also the shrinking of Ag peaks in Ag 3d (Fig. 2A) and Cl peaks in Cl 2p (Fig 2B).Furthermore, all the Ag and Cl peaks have also been slightly shifted from their initial binding energy, indicating the renewed interaction with newly formed Ag 0 .These all further verified that in the course of the photocatalytic reaction, the entirety of AgCl in the composite was lost and there exist a new formation of an Ag/AgCl heterojunction.AgCl is photosensitive and its photo-generated electrons inevitably combines with Ag to form Ag 0 clusters on the AgCl particles from repeated absorption of photons.These Ag species which were formed during the photocatalytic process, brings significant benefits to photocatalysis.Firstly, Ag exhibits surface plasmon response (SPR) in the visible light region, meaning that it can utilize photons in visible light region to generate electron-hole pairs due to SPR oscillations.51, 52 This helped in enhancing the visible light absorption of the otherwise wide-bandgap AgCl.The subsequent separation of these plasmon-induced charge carriers in Ag is thereafter promoted by the Schottky barrier formed between the Ag-AgCl metal-semiconductor junction owing to the differences in their work function. 34This Schottky junction produced an internal electric field at the interface which forced electron and holes to move oppositely.Since Ag has lower work function than AgCl ( AgCl 4.8 eV Ag 4.25), the transfer of electrons occurred from Ag to AgCl. 53This relaying of electrons were also facilitated by the metallic nature of Ag which provided a fast medium for electron transfer.

Since, it has been highlighted that there was a large enhancement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the AgCl/CN hybrid, it is now necessary to account the reasons for this observation.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared AgCl/CN composite and its derivatives (AgCl and CN) were measured to reflect their light harvesting ability towards different wavelength in the solar radiation.From Figure 8, both pure CN and AgCl exhibit typical semiconductor absorption whereby distinct absorption is seen only in the UV region (200nm-400nm) but a limited absorption in the visible region (400nm-700nm).Pure AgCl exhibited the highest absorption in the visible range, showing a bump due the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the photo-reduced Ag, whereas CN showed a minimal background absorption in that region.As compared to CN, composite AgCl/CN, displayed a strengthened absorption peak in the targeted visible light range (450-700nm) as well as the UV, validating the habitation of visible-light-sensitive AgCl host materials on CN.Moreover, this absorbance incrementally increases with the content of AgCl as shown in the inset in Figure 8.This confirms the fabrication of heterojunction structure between CN and light-sensitive AgCl allows for an enhanced optical absorption.The bandgap of CN and AgCl was individually obtained to be 2.7 and 3 eV respectively based from the plots of (F(R)hv) 1/2 vs hv (Figure S6).Once again, it should be pointed out that there was no distinct red or blue shift in the band edge of the composite with respect to CN, suggesting that AgCl nanoparticles was not covalently intercalated into CN matrix but it was merely dispersed on its surface owing to the low-temperature synthesis process.It was discussed earlier that AgCl/CN composite demonstrated the highest CH 4 yield at an intermediate loading.These findings suggested that the photocatalytic performance was impeded by larger particle sizes and agglomeration at higher loading content.This was since larger particles associate with lower surface area, longer electron migration paths and less area for light harvesting. 49rom another aspect, the bigger the cluster of AgCl nanoparticles anchored on CN, the weaker the co-ordination bond between CN and AgCl which then disrupted the heterojunction structure which led to a less efficient charge flow via the two materials.An appropriate amount of AgCl is hence paramount for an optimal enhancement in the photocatalytic activity.This claim was further corroborated by Photoluminescence (PL) emission measurements which is shown in Figure 9. PL spectra can be used to evaluate the recombination probability and separation efficiency of photoinduced electron and holes. 50Higher spectra intensity correlates to higher recombination rate as more electron and holes recombine to emit more (hv).The intensity goes by the order CN AgCl-70/CN AgCl-10/CN AgCl-50/CN AgCl-30/CN which were in accordance with the CO 2 photo-reduction results.This implied that AgCl-30/CN has the most efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs since it was the desired intermediate whereby enough AgCl were integrated for an improved light-absorption and heterojunction engineering but not in the extent where severe aggregation of its particles occurred.It is now evident that the hybridization of photosensitive AgCl to CN led to the improvement of photocatalytic activity, however its stability for practical application remains to be elucidated.Therefore, a recycling experiment was performed using the best sample AgCl-30/CN and all the experiment conditions were unchanged to ensure reproducibility of results.As shown in Fig. 7D, the photocatalytic reduction activity was only slightly reduced for each of the consecutive runs and the greater part of the photoactivity was preserved.This signifies that AgCl/CN composites were fairly stable and did not undergo serious decline in activity with repeated usage. After the recyclability experiment, which comprised of 4 runs, the spent AgCl-30/CN was analyzed using XPS to reveal the eventual formation of Ag 0 .From Fig. 2A, the XPS patterns of Ag 3d in AgCl- Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins generate a sustained photoactivity under prolonged reaction hours. Based from area analysis on Ag 3d XPS peaks, the mole ratio of surface metallic Ag 0 was 0.25 out of the total Ag species (Ag 0 Ag ) after the 4 consecutive stability runs as compared to a mere 0.09 for the case of fresh AgCl-30/CN catalyst.Accompanying this increase in intensity of Ag 0 peaks, was also the shrinking of Ag peaks in Ag 3d (Fig. 2A) and Cl peaks in Cl 2p (Fig 2B).Furthermore, all the Ag and Cl peaks have also been slightly shifted from their initial binding energy, indicating the renewed interaction with newly formed Ag 0 .These all further verified that in the course of the photocatalytic reaction, the entirety of AgCl in the composite was lost and there exist a new formation of an Ag/AgCl heterojunction.AgCl is photosensitive and its photo-generated electrons inevitably combines with Ag to form Ag 0 clusters on the AgCl particles from repeated absorption of photons.These Ag species which were formed during the photocatalytic process, brings significant benefits to photocatalysis.Firstly, Ag exhibits surface plasmon response (SPR) in the visible light region, meaning that it can utilize photons in visible light region to generate electron-hole pairs due to SPR oscillations.51, 52 This helped in enhancing the visible light absorption of the otherwise wide-bandgap AgCl.The subsequent separation of these plasmon-induced charge carriers in Ag is thereafter promoted by the Schottky barrier formed between the Ag-AgCl metal-semiconductor junction owing to the differences in their work function. 34This Schottky junction produced an internal electric field at the interface which forced electron and holes to move oppositely.Since Ag has lower work function than AgCl ( AgCl 4.8 eV Ag 4.25), the transfer of electrons occurred from Ag to AgCl. 53This relaying of electrons were also facilitated by the metallic nature of Ag which provided a fast medium for electron transfer. When CN and Ag/AgCl were coupled, they associate closely together to form a staggered heterojunction interface.The band potentials of semiconductor CN and AgCl (vs.NHE) were obtained by a theoretical method based on the absolute Mulliken electronegativity.This simple method has been proven to be in good agreement with the experimental results and has also been widely employed by an appreciable number of researchers.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of each semiconductor was calculated by the equation as follows Where, X, is the geometric mean of the absolute Mullikan electronegativity of constituent atoms, which can be calculated from the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy.E c is the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale taken as 4. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Moreover, CH 4 was the only hydrocarbon product which was detected in this experiment.Typically, CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the gas phase produced CO, CH 4 or higher alkenes, while oxygenated products such as alcohols and carboxylic acids are only collected in high H 2 O environment such as under liquid phase, or at high H 2 O/CO 2 ratio which would otherwise require an elevated temperature or a reduced pressure condition. 575885960 Since in this case, the H 2 O/CO 2 was low at 0.043, these products are likely to be absent.Moreover, another plausible reason as to why other hydrocarbon products were not existent in the product gas, can also be explained from their reduction potential in comparison to CH 4 .The reduction potentials of other possible products are given as follows: CO 2 /HCOOH: -0.61 V possesses the lowest reduction potential, inferring that it is the most thermodynamically favored product.This can be an accountable reason for CH 4 as being the sole product achieved.In addition to that, no considerable H 2 molecules were also detected in the product gas.This can possibly mean that intermediate H radicals and protons generated from to the dissociation of water molecules were rapidly consumed by CO 2 in the photocatalytic reaction.An observation similar to this has also been reported by Liu et al. 65 , Yu et al. 66 and Wang et al."}, {"llm generation": "Ag 0", "source": "Accompanying this increase in intensity of Ag 0 peaks, was also the shrinking of Ag peaks in Ag 3d (Fig. 2A) and Cl peaks in Cl 2p (Fig 2B).", "context": "Urea was initially used as a precursor since it is low cost and allegedly yield a more thin, flake-like and mesoporous structure due to releases of CO 2 and NH 3 during its pyrolysis. 26,27A TEM image of the as-prepared CN is provided in Fig S3 .Initially, the obtained bulk CN underwent sonication in 0.5M HCl acid solution.This triggered the delamination of the layered CN into individual sheets, which in effect, assist in furnishing larger contact area subjectable to protonation attack.In addition, this transformation from bulk CN to CN nanosheets is also vital to the photocatalytic efficiency.In the event of bulk CN, most of the strands in the inner bulk layers have redundant role and do not contribute to photocatalysis at all.These bounded sheets reduces the effective surface area and severely limits adsorption-desorption area and light harnessing sites.More importantly, photo-excited carriers in the bulk CN suffers from serious bulk recombination owing to the long travelling distance it requires in reaching the surface.This exfoliation of bulk CN to thin, 2D nanosheets is hence a necessity as it increases the probability of charge carriers in reaching the surface, where it can be consumed to drive photoreactions. 28On another note, acid treatment serves to increase the abundance of amino function groups onto CN sheets surface, which will successively play a key role in the adhesion of AgCl nanoparticles. 4,29 his formation was validated by FTIR analysis in which there exists the emergence of N-H bump corresponding to the peak at 3200cm -1 as depicted in Figure S4.The corresponding amine group will then play apart in acting as Lewis bases whereby the lone pairs of electrons on the N atom in the tri-s-triazine ring structure co-ordinates and bind strongly to metal Ag upon addition of reagent AgNO 3.This was then subsequently grown into AgCl nanoparticles through an in-situ nucleation mechanism by deposition-precipitation method under ambient room temperature.The schematic depiction of the synthesis strategy is presented in Figure 1. To attest the efficacy of the deposition-precipitation synthesis route, morphology and microstructure of the as-obtained AgCl/CN composite and unsupported AgCl were studied using Field Emissions Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM).The relevant particle sizes for pure AgCl and other AgCl/CN composites were also investigated statistically and is summarized in Table 1.The morphology of pure AgCl manifested as irregular, almost-spherical particles with sizes ranging from 1000-3000 nm.Upon involvement of CN as a substrate, AgCl particles ripened to form nanospheres-like particles on the surface of CN.This is owing to the defects present in CN which function as nanoparticle nucleation sites and helped to suppress the growth rate of AgCl particles. 30This manifestation is illustrated in Figure 2, whereby the mean size of AgCl particles in its pure form and in AgCl/CN composite was reduced drastically from 2032 nm to 20-100 nm respectively.This nanocrystal formation is integral to the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity since this correlates to more reactive sites and shorter electron migration path to surface-adsorbed molecules.All AgCl nanoparticles were strongly anchored on the surface of CN and the intimate contact between AgCl and CN form an efficient heterojunction for the charge separation during the photocatalytic process.Additionally, another trend which can be established from FESEM, was the dispersion state of AgCl with increasing mass percentage.As observed in Figure 2(A-F), it was evident that the higher the mass percentage of AgCl incorporated, the more AgCl nanoparticles were formed on the CN support.Most notably, the average particle sizes of AgCl were found to increase in conjunction to an increased loading percentage.On top of that, increasing loading also produced AgCl nanoparticles which exhibited a wider distribution and thus a progressively higher standard deviation (SD).For Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins example, at the two loadings extremities, AgCl-10/CN yielded the smallest average particle size of 28.5 nm and a SD of 4.5 nm, whereas AgCl-70/CN yielded a considerably larger average particle size and a SD of 93.2 and 28.7 respectively.The complete particle size histograms for each pertaining mass percentages of AgCl/CN composites are provided in Figure S5(A-E).Furthermore, at higher loadings as illustrated in Figure 2(D-E), there was an apparent agglomeration of AgCl nanoparticles.This was owing to the excess number of AgCl on the CN sheet, which tend to agglomerate and form clumps, resulting in the poor dispersion of the nanoparticles. Overall, this revealed that the amount of AgCl incorporated in the composite is a highly influential parameter to the dispersion and the size of the AgCl nanoparticles deposited on the CN support.In addition to that, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping have also been performed.This is in order to examine the elemental distribution of the composite, which provided concrete evidence that all relevant elements (C, N, Ag and Cl) are highly dispersed with the spatial distribution as displayed in Figure 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the phase structure of the as-synthesized CN, AgCl and AgCl/CN composite as depicted in Figure 4. Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples.

To attest the efficacy of the deposition-precipitation synthesis route, morphology and microstructure of the as-obtained AgCl/CN composite and unsupported AgCl were studied using Field Emissions Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM).The relevant particle sizes for pure AgCl and other AgCl/CN composites were also investigated statistically and is summarized in Table 1.The morphology of pure AgCl manifested as irregular, almost-spherical particles with sizes ranging from 1000-3000 nm.Upon involvement of CN as a substrate, AgCl particles ripened to form nanospheres-like particles on the surface of CN.This is owing to the defects present in CN which function as nanoparticle nucleation sites and helped to suppress the growth rate of AgCl particles. 30This manifestation is illustrated in Figure 2, whereby the mean size of AgCl particles in its pure form and in AgCl/CN composite was reduced drastically from 2032 nm to 20-100 nm respectively.This nanocrystal formation is integral to the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity since this correlates to more reactive sites and shorter electron migration path to surface-adsorbed molecules.All AgCl nanoparticles were strongly anchored on the surface of CN and the intimate contact between AgCl and CN form an efficient heterojunction for the charge separation during the photocatalytic process.Additionally, another trend which can be established from FESEM, was the dispersion state of AgCl with increasing mass percentage.As observed in Figure 2(A-F), it was evident that the higher the mass percentage of AgCl incorporated, the more AgCl nanoparticles were formed on the CN support.Most notably, the average particle sizes of AgCl were found to increase in conjunction to an increased loading percentage.On top of that, increasing loading also produced AgCl nanoparticles which exhibited a wider distribution and thus a progressively higher standard deviation (SD).For Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins example, at the two loadings extremities, AgCl-10/CN yielded the smallest average particle size of 28.5 nm and a SD of 4.5 nm, whereas AgCl-70/CN yielded a considerably larger average particle size and a SD of 93.2 and 28.7 respectively.The complete particle size histograms for each pertaining mass percentages of AgCl/CN composites are provided in Figure S5(A-E).Furthermore, at higher loadings as illustrated in Figure 2(D-E), there was an apparent agglomeration of AgCl nanoparticles.This was owing to the excess number of AgCl on the CN sheet, which tend to agglomerate and form clumps, resulting in the poor dispersion of the nanoparticles. Overall, this revealed that the amount of AgCl incorporated in the composite is a highly influential parameter to the dispersion and the size of the AgCl nanoparticles deposited on the CN support.In addition to that, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping have also been performed.This is in order to examine the elemental distribution of the composite, which provided concrete evidence that all relevant elements (C, N, Ag and Cl) are highly dispersed with the spatial distribution as displayed in Figure 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the phase structure of the as-synthesized CN, AgCl and AgCl/CN composite as depicted in Figure 4. Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was additionally performed to investigate the surface elemental composition and chemical states of AgCl/CN as given in Figure 6(A-D).The high resolution C 1s spectrum showed two major peaks at 284.6eV and 288.2eV which is characteristic to the graphitic carbon (C-C bonding) and the disrupted sp 2 -bonded carbon (attributed by C-N groups) of CN respectively. 41On the other hand, N 1s spectrum showed an array of peaks owing to the multi-environment nitrogen atom.The most intense peak at 398.6eV was ascribed to aromatic (CN-C) linkage, the weaker 399.7eV peak corresponded to tertiary N bonded to C atoms (N-C 3 ), and the 401eV peak was assigned to amino groups (C-N-H), while lastly the highest binding energy peak at 404.3eV was attributed to excitation. 8As for Ag3d spectrum, it was comprised of two spin-orbit doublets represented by peaks at 368eV and 374eV, which was accredited to the binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 respectively.These individual peaks can be further deconvolved into two peaks whereby 367.5eV and 373.5eV peaks were designated to Ag in AgCl and meanwhile 368.6eV and 374.6eV peaks were to metal Ag 0 which may arise from slight photocorrosion of the sample due to the exposure of light whilst handling.On the other hand, Cl 2p spectra displayed two spin-orbit doublets of Cl 2p 5/2 and Cl 2p 3/2 which were correlated to bands of binding energy 197.8eV and 199.5eV respectively and were attributed to Cl -ion from AgCl. The photocatalytic performance of AgCl/CN in gas-phase CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 was investigated using a low-power 15W energy-saving daylight bulb as a visible light source and under ambient conditions.As observed from Figure 7(A), the habitation of AgCl on CN yielded a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic activity .Firstly, it could be seen from Figure 7(A) that even CN on its own exhibited a massive 30 fold improvement as compared to commercial P25.This was owing to its visible-responsive trait and its extended 2D, porous structure.The AgCl/CN composite further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of its derivative CN with an optimum achieved at an intermediate loading.Upon light illumination, the photocatalytic performance on CO This measures how efficiently the impinging photons were converted into electron-hole pairs that were subsequently used in the formation of CH 4 .Based on the photo-reduction of CO 2 under low-power 15W light source, the photochemical quantum yield of CH 4 was found to be 0.085.Although a low power daylight bulb was used, this result is comparable to some previously reported values which even employed high power Xe or Hg lamps, therefore making our process more practically feasible. 43444546 Several control experiments were executed to validate the role of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in the reduction of CO produced was in fact was derived from CO 2 and not due to carbon residues of the catalyst.Lastly, blank test ( 3) and ( 4) indicated the relevance of the role of these parameters (light and H 2 O) in the photo-reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .This confirmed that the CH 4 was in fact derived from photocatalysis and highlighted the significance of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in driving CO 2 reduction.Furthermore, the hourly progression of the CO 2 photo-reduction reaction can be observed from Figure 7(C).It can be seen that the reaction kicked off with low evolution of CH 4 which later increased as the reaction progresses.This observation can be associated to the low photo-conversion of CO 2 since intermediate products in the form of radicals were initially formed at this stage.However at succeeding hours, CH 4 evolution progressively reduced and this may be attributed to the radical intermediates and products saturating the active sites which consequently slowed down the rate of Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins reaction.A similar trend was also observed in a number of other CO 2 reduction reports. Since, it has been highlighted that there was a large enhancement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the AgCl/CN hybrid, it is now necessary to account the reasons for this observation.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared AgCl/CN composite and its derivatives (AgCl and CN) were measured to reflect their light harvesting ability towards different wavelength in the solar radiation.From Figure 8, both pure CN and AgCl exhibit typical semiconductor absorption whereby distinct absorption is seen only in the UV region (200nm-400nm) but a limited absorption in the visible region (400nm-700nm).Pure AgCl exhibited the highest absorption in the visible range, showing a bump due the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the photo-reduced Ag, whereas CN showed a minimal background absorption in that region.As compared to CN, composite AgCl/CN, displayed a strengthened absorption peak in the targeted visible light range (450-700nm) as well as the UV, validating the habitation of visible-light-sensitive AgCl host materials on CN.Moreover, this absorbance incrementally increases with the content of AgCl as shown in the inset in Figure 8.This confirms the fabrication of heterojunction structure between CN and light-sensitive AgCl allows for an enhanced optical absorption.The bandgap of CN and AgCl was individually obtained to be 2.7 and 3 eV respectively based from the plots of (F(R)hv) 1/2 vs hv (Figure S6).Once again, it should be pointed out that there was no distinct red or blue shift in the band edge of the composite with respect to CN, suggesting that AgCl nanoparticles was not covalently intercalated into CN matrix but it was merely dispersed on its surface owing to the low-temperature synthesis process.It was discussed earlier that AgCl/CN composite demonstrated the highest CH 4 yield at an intermediate loading.These findings suggested that the photocatalytic performance was impeded by larger particle sizes and agglomeration at higher loading content.This was since larger particles associate with lower surface area, longer electron migration paths and less area for light harvesting. 49rom another aspect, the bigger the cluster of AgCl nanoparticles anchored on CN, the weaker the co-ordination bond between CN and AgCl which then disrupted the heterojunction structure which led to a less efficient charge flow via the two materials.An appropriate amount of AgCl is hence paramount for an optimal enhancement in the photocatalytic activity.This claim was further corroborated by Photoluminescence (PL) emission measurements which is shown in Figure 9. PL spectra can be used to evaluate the recombination probability and separation efficiency of photoinduced electron and holes. 50Higher spectra intensity correlates to higher recombination rate as more electron and holes recombine to emit more (hv).The intensity goes by the order CN AgCl-70/CN AgCl-10/CN AgCl-50/CN AgCl-30/CN which were in accordance with the CO 2 photo-reduction results.This implied that AgCl-30/CN has the most efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs since it was the desired intermediate whereby enough AgCl were integrated for an improved light-absorption and heterojunction engineering but not in the extent where severe aggregation of its particles occurred.It is now evident that the hybridization of photosensitive AgCl to CN led to the improvement of photocatalytic activity, however its stability for practical application remains to be elucidated.Therefore, a recycling experiment was performed using the best sample AgCl-30/CN and all the experiment conditions were unchanged to ensure reproducibility of results.As shown in Fig. 7D, the photocatalytic reduction activity was only slightly reduced for each of the consecutive runs and the greater part of the photoactivity was preserved.This signifies that AgCl/CN composites were fairly stable and did not undergo serious decline in activity with repeated usage. After the recyclability experiment, which comprised of 4 runs, the spent AgCl-30/CN was analyzed using XPS to reveal the eventual formation of Ag 0 .From Fig. 2A, the XPS patterns of Ag 3d in AgCl- Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins generate a sustained photoactivity under prolonged reaction hours. Based from area analysis on Ag 3d XPS peaks, the mole ratio of surface metallic Ag 0 was 0.25 out of the total Ag species (Ag 0 Ag ) after the 4 consecutive stability runs as compared to a mere 0.09 for the case of fresh AgCl-30/CN catalyst.Accompanying this increase in intensity of Ag 0 peaks, was also the shrinking of Ag peaks in Ag 3d (Fig. 2A) and Cl peaks in Cl 2p (Fig 2B).Furthermore, all the Ag and Cl peaks have also been slightly shifted from their initial binding energy, indicating the renewed interaction with newly formed Ag 0 .These all further verified that in the course of the photocatalytic reaction, the entirety of AgCl in the composite was lost and there exist a new formation of an Ag/AgCl heterojunction.AgCl is photosensitive and its photo-generated electrons inevitably combines with Ag to form Ag 0 clusters on the AgCl particles from repeated absorption of photons.These Ag species which were formed during the photocatalytic process, brings significant benefits to photocatalysis.Firstly, Ag exhibits surface plasmon response (SPR) in the visible light region, meaning that it can utilize photons in visible light region to generate electron-hole pairs due to SPR oscillations.51, 52 This helped in enhancing the visible light absorption of the otherwise wide-bandgap AgCl.The subsequent separation of these plasmon-induced charge carriers in Ag is thereafter promoted by the Schottky barrier formed between the Ag-AgCl metal-semiconductor junction owing to the differences in their work function. 34This Schottky junction produced an internal electric field at the interface which forced electron and holes to move oppositely.Since Ag has lower work function than AgCl ( AgCl 4.8 eV Ag 4.25), the transfer of electrons occurred from Ag to AgCl. 53This relaying of electrons were also facilitated by the metallic nature of Ag which provided a fast medium for electron transfer. When CN and Ag/AgCl were coupled, they associate closely together to form a staggered heterojunction interface.The band potentials of semiconductor CN and AgCl (vs.NHE) were obtained by a theoretical method based on the absolute Mulliken electronegativity.This simple method has been proven to be in good agreement with the experimental results and has also been widely employed by an appreciable number of researchers.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of each semiconductor was calculated by the equation as follows Where, X, is the geometric mean of the absolute Mullikan electronegativity of constituent atoms, which can be calculated from the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy.E c is the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale taken as 4.

CN was similarly prepared as that from earlier publications by our research group. 23,24,25Bulk CN was synthesized through the thermal polycondensation of urea precursor.In brief, 3.2g of urea was packed into a ceramic crucible and was calcined to 520 o C at a rate of 10 o C/min for a duration of 2.5h.A lid was placed to minimize the loss of mass originating from the sublimation of urea.The ceramic crucible was then left to cool naturally and the final CN bulk product was collected after it was grounded to powder form.For the protonation of CN, formerly prepared bulk CN (1g) was acid treated under ultra-sonication for 1h in 250mL of 0.5M hydrochloric acid (HCl).This helps with the removal of the leftover unpolymerized molecules.The exfoliated CN was then subjected to additional 4h of stirring to allow further protonation.Finally the product was washed with de-ionized water, filtered and left to dry overnight at 70 o C. All samples were prepared via deposition-precipitation method.In a typical synthesis procedure, the as obtained acid pre-treated CN (0.4g) was added into 50mL de-ionized water and the resultant suspension was sonicated for 30 minutes.Then a solution of AgNO 3 (0.04g) was added to the suspension drop-wise and was stirred for 1hr to allow complete adsorption of Ag onto CN surface. Afterwards, NaCl was added drop-wise to the former mixture solution at a molar excess of 10.This gradual addition of precipitating agent, NaCl, is required in order to avoid the rapid nucleation of the precipitate in the solution but exclusively on the CN substrate surface.The mixture was then allowed to stir for another 4 hrs in the absence of light.The product was finally obtained by vacuum filtration, washed with ethanol and deionized water, and dried overnight at 70 o C.

Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out in a continuous gasphase system, at ambient temperature and pressure, and using low power 15W energy-saving daylight lamp (Phillips, TORNADO WW E27 220-240V 1CT) as the light source.The light spectrum of this bulb is given in Figure S1 (Supplementary Information) which is largely in the visible light range (400-650 nm) and with an average light intensity which was measured to be 8.5 mW/cm 2 (Kipp and Zonen pyranometer CMP 6).The prepared catalyst was evenly coated on to glass rods for immobilization into a tubular fixed bed reactor configuration.The glass rods were fixated inside quartz tubes occurring in three consecutive series.The distance between bulb and the quartz was fixed to be 5cm.This setup was enclosed in a black box to minimize light interference from the surroundings.

Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was additionally performed to investigate the surface elemental composition and chemical states of AgCl/CN as given in Figure 6(A-D).The high resolution C 1s spectrum showed two major peaks at 284.6eV and 288.2eV which is characteristic to the graphitic carbon (C-C bonding) and the disrupted sp 2 -bonded carbon (attributed by C-N groups) of CN respectively. 41On the other hand, N 1s spectrum showed an array of peaks owing to the multi-environment nitrogen atom.The most intense peak at 398.6eV was ascribed to aromatic (CN-C) linkage, the weaker 399.7eV peak corresponded to tertiary N bonded to C atoms (N-C 3 ), and the 401eV peak was assigned to amino groups (C-N-H), while lastly the highest binding energy peak at 404.3eV was attributed to excitation. 8As for Ag3d spectrum, it was comprised of two spin-orbit doublets represented by peaks at 368eV and 374eV, which was accredited to the binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 respectively.These individual peaks can be further deconvolved into two peaks whereby 367.5eV and 373.5eV peaks were designated to Ag in AgCl and meanwhile 368.6eV and 374.6eV peaks were to metal Ag 0 which may arise from slight photocorrosion of the sample due to the exposure of light whilst handling.On the other hand, Cl 2p spectra displayed two spin-orbit doublets of Cl 2p 5/2 and Cl 2p 3/2 which were correlated to bands of binding energy 197.8eV and 199.5eV respectively and were attributed to Cl -ion from AgCl. The photocatalytic performance of AgCl/CN in gas-phase CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 was investigated using a low-power 15W energy-saving daylight bulb as a visible light source and under ambient conditions.As observed from Figure 7(A), the habitation of AgCl on CN yielded a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic activity .Firstly, it could be seen from Figure 7(A) that even CN on its own exhibited a massive 30 fold improvement as compared to commercial P25.This was owing to its visible-responsive trait and its extended 2D, porous structure.The AgCl/CN composite further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of its derivative CN with an optimum achieved at an intermediate loading.Upon light illumination, the photocatalytic performance on CO This measures how efficiently the impinging photons were converted into electron-hole pairs that were subsequently used in the formation of CH 4 .Based on the photo-reduction of CO 2 under low-power 15W light source, the photochemical quantum yield of CH 4 was found to be 0.085.Although a low power daylight bulb was used, this result is comparable to some previously reported values which even employed high power Xe or Hg lamps, therefore making our process more practically feasible. 43444546 Several control experiments were executed to validate the role of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in the reduction of CO produced was in fact was derived from CO 2 and not due to carbon residues of the catalyst.Lastly, blank test ( 3) and ( 4) indicated the relevance of the role of these parameters (light and H 2 O) in the photo-reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .This confirmed that the CH 4 was in fact derived from photocatalysis and highlighted the significance of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in driving CO 2 reduction.Furthermore, the hourly progression of the CO 2 photo-reduction reaction can be observed from Figure 7(C).It can be seen that the reaction kicked off with low evolution of CH 4 which later increased as the reaction progresses.This observation can be associated to the low photo-conversion of CO 2 since intermediate products in the form of radicals were initially formed at this stage.However at succeeding hours, CH 4 evolution progressively reduced and this may be attributed to the radical intermediates and products saturating the active sites which consequently slowed down the rate of Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins reaction.A similar trend was also observed in a number of other CO 2 reduction reports. Since, it has been highlighted that there was a large enhancement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the AgCl/CN hybrid, it is now necessary to account the reasons for this observation.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared AgCl/CN composite and its derivatives (AgCl and CN) were measured to reflect their light harvesting ability towards different wavelength in the solar radiation.From Figure 8, both pure CN and AgCl exhibit typical semiconductor absorption whereby distinct absorption is seen only in the UV region (200nm-400nm) but a limited absorption in the visible region (400nm-700nm).Pure AgCl exhibited the highest absorption in the visible range, showing a bump due the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the photo-reduced Ag, whereas CN showed a minimal background absorption in that region.As compared to CN, composite AgCl/CN, displayed a strengthened absorption peak in the targeted visible light range (450-700nm) as well as the UV, validating the habitation of visible-light-sensitive AgCl host materials on CN.Moreover, this absorbance incrementally increases with the content of AgCl as shown in the inset in Figure 8.This confirms the fabrication of heterojunction structure between CN and light-sensitive AgCl allows for an enhanced optical absorption.The bandgap of CN and AgCl was individually obtained to be 2.7 and 3 eV respectively based from the plots of (F(R)hv) 1/2 vs hv (Figure S6).Once again, it should be pointed out that there was no distinct red or blue shift in the band edge of the composite with respect to CN, suggesting that AgCl nanoparticles was not covalently intercalated into CN matrix but it was merely dispersed on its surface owing to the low-temperature synthesis process.It was discussed earlier that AgCl/CN composite demonstrated the highest CH 4 yield at an intermediate loading.These findings suggested that the photocatalytic performance was impeded by larger particle sizes and agglomeration at higher loading content.This was since larger particles associate with lower surface area, longer electron migration paths and less area for light harvesting. 49rom another aspect, the bigger the cluster of AgCl nanoparticles anchored on CN, the weaker the co-ordination bond between CN and AgCl which then disrupted the heterojunction structure which led to a less efficient charge flow via the two materials.An appropriate amount of AgCl is hence paramount for an optimal enhancement in the photocatalytic activity.This claim was further corroborated by Photoluminescence (PL) emission measurements which is shown in Figure 9. PL spectra can be used to evaluate the recombination probability and separation efficiency of photoinduced electron and holes. 50Higher spectra intensity correlates to higher recombination rate as more electron and holes recombine to emit more (hv).The intensity goes by the order CN AgCl-70/CN AgCl-10/CN AgCl-50/CN AgCl-30/CN which were in accordance with the CO 2 photo-reduction results.This implied that AgCl-30/CN has the most efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs since it was the desired intermediate whereby enough AgCl were integrated for an improved light-absorption and heterojunction engineering but not in the extent where severe aggregation of its particles occurred.It is now evident that the hybridization of photosensitive AgCl to CN led to the improvement of photocatalytic activity, however its stability for practical application remains to be elucidated.Therefore, a recycling experiment was performed using the best sample AgCl-30/CN and all the experiment conditions were unchanged to ensure reproducibility of results.As shown in Fig. 7D, the photocatalytic reduction activity was only slightly reduced for each of the consecutive runs and the greater part of the photoactivity was preserved.This signifies that AgCl/CN composites were fairly stable and did not undergo serious decline in activity with repeated usage. After the recyclability experiment, which comprised of 4 runs, the spent AgCl-30/CN was analyzed using XPS to reveal the eventual formation of Ag 0 .From Fig. 2A, the XPS patterns of Ag 3d in AgCl- Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins generate a sustained photoactivity under prolonged reaction hours. Based from area analysis on Ag 3d XPS peaks, the mole ratio of surface metallic Ag 0 was 0.25 out of the total Ag species (Ag 0 Ag ) after the 4 consecutive stability runs as compared to a mere 0.09 for the case of fresh AgCl-30/CN catalyst.Accompanying this increase in intensity of Ag 0 peaks, was also the shrinking of Ag peaks in Ag 3d (Fig. 2A) and Cl peaks in Cl 2p (Fig 2B).Furthermore, all the Ag and Cl peaks have also been slightly shifted from their initial binding energy, indicating the renewed interaction with newly formed Ag 0 .These all further verified that in the course of the photocatalytic reaction, the entirety of AgCl in the composite was lost and there exist a new formation of an Ag/AgCl heterojunction.AgCl is photosensitive and its photo-generated electrons inevitably combines with Ag to form Ag 0 clusters on the AgCl particles from repeated absorption of photons.These Ag species which were formed during the photocatalytic process, brings significant benefits to photocatalysis.Firstly, Ag exhibits surface plasmon response (SPR) in the visible light region, meaning that it can utilize photons in visible light region to generate electron-hole pairs due to SPR oscillations.51, 52 This helped in enhancing the visible light absorption of the otherwise wide-bandgap AgCl.The subsequent separation of these plasmon-induced charge carriers in Ag is thereafter promoted by the Schottky barrier formed between the Ag-AgCl metal-semiconductor junction owing to the differences in their work function. 34This Schottky junction produced an internal electric field at the interface which forced electron and holes to move oppositely.Since Ag has lower work function than AgCl ( AgCl 4.8 eV Ag 4.25), the transfer of electrons occurred from Ag to AgCl. 53This relaying of electrons were also facilitated by the metallic nature of Ag which provided a fast medium for electron transfer. When CN and Ag/AgCl were coupled, they associate closely together to form a staggered heterojunction interface.The band potentials of semiconductor CN and AgCl (vs.NHE) were obtained by a theoretical method based on the absolute Mulliken electronegativity.This simple method has been proven to be in good agreement with the experimental results and has also been widely employed by an appreciable number of researchers.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of each semiconductor was calculated by the equation as follows Where, X, is the geometric mean of the absolute Mullikan electronegativity of constituent atoms, which can be calculated from the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy.E c is the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale taken as 4. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Moreover, CH 4 was the only hydrocarbon product which was detected in this experiment.Typically, CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the gas phase produced CO, CH 4 or higher alkenes, while oxygenated products such as alcohols and carboxylic acids are only collected in high H 2 O environment such as under liquid phase, or at high H 2 O/CO 2 ratio which would otherwise require an elevated temperature or a reduced pressure condition. 575885960 Since in this case, the H 2 O/CO 2 was low at 0.043, these products are likely to be absent.Moreover, another plausible reason as to why other hydrocarbon products were not existent in the product gas, can also be explained from their reduction potential in comparison to CH 4 .The reduction potentials of other possible products are given as follows: CO 2 /HCOOH: -0.61 V possesses the lowest reduction potential, inferring that it is the most thermodynamically favored product.This can be an accountable reason for CH 4 as being the sole product achieved.In addition to that, no considerable H 2 molecules were also detected in the product gas.This can possibly mean that intermediate H radicals and protons generated from to the dissociation of water molecules were rapidly consumed by CO 2 in the photocatalytic reaction.An observation similar to this has also been reported by Liu et al. 65 , Yu et al. 66 and Wang et al."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "15W energy-saving daylight lamp (Phillips, TORNADO WW E27 220-240V 1CT)", "source": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out in a continuous gasphase system, at ambient temperature and pressure, and using low power 15W energy-saving daylight lamp (Phillips, TORNADO WW E27 220-240V 1CT) as the light source.", "context": "Urea ( 99.0), hydrochloric acid HCl (37), silver nitrate AgNO 3 ( 99.0), sodium chloride NaCl ( 99.0), ethanol (99) and Degussa P25 (99.5) were the chemicals used in the experiment.All reagents were of analytical-grade and used as per received with no additional purification.De-ionized water (18.2M cm resistivity) was used throughout the span of the experiment in the preparation of an aqueous solution.

To attest the efficacy of the deposition-precipitation synthesis route, morphology and microstructure of the as-obtained AgCl/CN composite and unsupported AgCl were studied using Field Emissions Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM).The relevant particle sizes for pure AgCl and other AgCl/CN composites were also investigated statistically and is summarized in Table 1.The morphology of pure AgCl manifested as irregular, almost-spherical particles with sizes ranging from 1000-3000 nm.Upon involvement of CN as a substrate, AgCl particles ripened to form nanospheres-like particles on the surface of CN.This is owing to the defects present in CN which function as nanoparticle nucleation sites and helped to suppress the growth rate of AgCl particles. 30This manifestation is illustrated in Figure 2, whereby the mean size of AgCl particles in its pure form and in AgCl/CN composite was reduced drastically from 2032 nm to 20-100 nm respectively.This nanocrystal formation is integral to the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity since this correlates to more reactive sites and shorter electron migration path to surface-adsorbed molecules.All AgCl nanoparticles were strongly anchored on the surface of CN and the intimate contact between AgCl and CN form an efficient heterojunction for the charge separation during the photocatalytic process.Additionally, another trend which can be established from FESEM, was the dispersion state of AgCl with increasing mass percentage.As observed in Figure 2(A-F), it was evident that the higher the mass percentage of AgCl incorporated, the more AgCl nanoparticles were formed on the CN support.Most notably, the average particle sizes of AgCl were found to increase in conjunction to an increased loading percentage.On top of that, increasing loading also produced AgCl nanoparticles which exhibited a wider distribution and thus a progressively higher standard deviation (SD).For Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins example, at the two loadings extremities, AgCl-10/CN yielded the smallest average particle size of 28.5 nm and a SD of 4.5 nm, whereas AgCl-70/CN yielded a considerably larger average particle size and a SD of 93.2 and 28.7 respectively.The complete particle size histograms for each pertaining mass percentages of AgCl/CN composites are provided in Figure S5(A-E).Furthermore, at higher loadings as illustrated in Figure 2(D-E), there was an apparent agglomeration of AgCl nanoparticles.This was owing to the excess number of AgCl on the CN sheet, which tend to agglomerate and form clumps, resulting in the poor dispersion of the nanoparticles. Overall, this revealed that the amount of AgCl incorporated in the composite is a highly influential parameter to the dispersion and the size of the AgCl nanoparticles deposited on the CN support.In addition to that, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping have also been performed.This is in order to examine the elemental distribution of the composite, which provided concrete evidence that all relevant elements (C, N, Ag and Cl) are highly dispersed with the spatial distribution as displayed in Figure 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the phase structure of the as-synthesized CN, AgCl and AgCl/CN composite as depicted in Figure 4. Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was additionally performed to investigate the surface elemental composition and chemical states of AgCl/CN as given in Figure 6(A-D).The high resolution C 1s spectrum showed two major peaks at 284.6eV and 288.2eV which is characteristic to the graphitic carbon (C-C bonding) and the disrupted sp 2 -bonded carbon (attributed by C-N groups) of CN respectively. 41On the other hand, N 1s spectrum showed an array of peaks owing to the multi-environment nitrogen atom.The most intense peak at 398.6eV was ascribed to aromatic (CN-C) linkage, the weaker 399.7eV peak corresponded to tertiary N bonded to C atoms (N-C 3 ), and the 401eV peak was assigned to amino groups (C-N-H), while lastly the highest binding energy peak at 404.3eV was attributed to excitation. 8As for Ag3d spectrum, it was comprised of two spin-orbit doublets represented by peaks at 368eV and 374eV, which was accredited to the binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 respectively.These individual peaks can be further deconvolved into two peaks whereby 367.5eV and 373.5eV peaks were designated to Ag in AgCl and meanwhile 368.6eV and 374.6eV peaks were to metal Ag 0 which may arise from slight photocorrosion of the sample due to the exposure of light whilst handling.On the other hand, Cl 2p spectra displayed two spin-orbit doublets of Cl 2p 5/2 and Cl 2p 3/2 which were correlated to bands of binding energy 197.8eV and 199.5eV respectively and were attributed to Cl -ion from AgCl. The photocatalytic performance of AgCl/CN in gas-phase CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 was investigated using a low-power 15W energy-saving daylight bulb as a visible light source and under ambient conditions.As observed from Figure 7(A), the habitation of AgCl on CN yielded a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic activity .Firstly, it could be seen from Figure 7(A) that even CN on its own exhibited a massive 30 fold improvement as compared to commercial P25.This was owing to its visible-responsive trait and its extended 2D, porous structure.The AgCl/CN composite further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of its derivative CN with an optimum achieved at an intermediate loading.Upon light illumination, the photocatalytic performance on CO This measures how efficiently the impinging photons were converted into electron-hole pairs that were subsequently used in the formation of CH 4 .Based on the photo-reduction of CO 2 under low-power 15W light source, the photochemical quantum yield of CH 4 was found to be 0.085.Although a low power daylight bulb was used, this result is comparable to some previously reported values which even employed high power Xe or Hg lamps, therefore making our process more practically feasible. 43444546 Several control experiments were executed to validate the role of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in the reduction of CO produced was in fact was derived from CO 2 and not due to carbon residues of the catalyst.Lastly, blank test ( 3) and ( 4) indicated the relevance of the role of these parameters (light and H 2 O) in the photo-reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .This confirmed that the CH 4 was in fact derived from photocatalysis and highlighted the significance of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in driving CO 2 reduction.Furthermore, the hourly progression of the CO 2 photo-reduction reaction can be observed from Figure 7(C).It can be seen that the reaction kicked off with low evolution of CH 4 which later increased as the reaction progresses.This observation can be associated to the low photo-conversion of CO 2 since intermediate products in the form of radicals were initially formed at this stage.However at succeeding hours, CH 4 evolution progressively reduced and this may be attributed to the radical intermediates and products saturating the active sites which consequently slowed down the rate of Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins reaction.A similar trend was also observed in a number of other CO 2 reduction reports. Since, it has been highlighted that there was a large enhancement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the AgCl/CN hybrid, it is now necessary to account the reasons for this observation.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared AgCl/CN composite and its derivatives (AgCl and CN) were measured to reflect their light harvesting ability towards different wavelength in the solar radiation.From Figure 8, both pure CN and AgCl exhibit typical semiconductor absorption whereby distinct absorption is seen only in the UV region (200nm-400nm) but a limited absorption in the visible region (400nm-700nm).Pure AgCl exhibited the highest absorption in the visible range, showing a bump due the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the photo-reduced Ag, whereas CN showed a minimal background absorption in that region.As compared to CN, composite AgCl/CN, displayed a strengthened absorption peak in the targeted visible light range (450-700nm) as well as the UV, validating the habitation of visible-light-sensitive AgCl host materials on CN.Moreover, this absorbance incrementally increases with the content of AgCl as shown in the inset in Figure 8.This confirms the fabrication of heterojunction structure between CN and light-sensitive AgCl allows for an enhanced optical absorption.The bandgap of CN and AgCl was individually obtained to be 2.7 and 3 eV respectively based from the plots of (F(R)hv) 1/2 vs hv (Figure S6).Once again, it should be pointed out that there was no distinct red or blue shift in the band edge of the composite with respect to CN, suggesting that AgCl nanoparticles was not covalently intercalated into CN matrix but it was merely dispersed on its surface owing to the low-temperature synthesis process.It was discussed earlier that AgCl/CN composite demonstrated the highest CH 4 yield at an intermediate loading.These findings suggested that the photocatalytic performance was impeded by larger particle sizes and agglomeration at higher loading content.This was since larger particles associate with lower surface area, longer electron migration paths and less area for light harvesting. 49rom another aspect, the bigger the cluster of AgCl nanoparticles anchored on CN, the weaker the co-ordination bond between CN and AgCl which then disrupted the heterojunction structure which led to a less efficient charge flow via the two materials.An appropriate amount of AgCl is hence paramount for an optimal enhancement in the photocatalytic activity.This claim was further corroborated by Photoluminescence (PL) emission measurements which is shown in Figure 9. PL spectra can be used to evaluate the recombination probability and separation efficiency of photoinduced electron and holes. 50Higher spectra intensity correlates to higher recombination rate as more electron and holes recombine to emit more (hv).The intensity goes by the order CN AgCl-70/CN AgCl-10/CN AgCl-50/CN AgCl-30/CN which were in accordance with the CO 2 photo-reduction results.This implied that AgCl-30/CN has the most efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs since it was the desired intermediate whereby enough AgCl were integrated for an improved light-absorption and heterojunction engineering but not in the extent where severe aggregation of its particles occurred.It is now evident that the hybridization of photosensitive AgCl to CN led to the improvement of photocatalytic activity, however its stability for practical application remains to be elucidated.Therefore, a recycling experiment was performed using the best sample AgCl-30/CN and all the experiment conditions were unchanged to ensure reproducibility of results.As shown in Fig. 7D, the photocatalytic reduction activity was only slightly reduced for each of the consecutive runs and the greater part of the photoactivity was preserved.This signifies that AgCl/CN composites were fairly stable and did not undergo serious decline in activity with repeated usage. After the recyclability experiment, which comprised of 4 runs, the spent AgCl-30/CN was analyzed using XPS to reveal the eventual formation of Ag 0 .From Fig. 2A, the XPS patterns of Ag 3d in AgCl- Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins generate a sustained photoactivity under prolonged reaction hours. Based from area analysis on Ag 3d XPS peaks, the mole ratio of surface metallic Ag 0 was 0.25 out of the total Ag species (Ag 0 Ag ) after the 4 consecutive stability runs as compared to a mere 0.09 for the case of fresh AgCl-30/CN catalyst.Accompanying this increase in intensity of Ag 0 peaks, was also the shrinking of Ag peaks in Ag 3d (Fig. 2A) and Cl peaks in Cl 2p (Fig 2B).Furthermore, all the Ag and Cl peaks have also been slightly shifted from their initial binding energy, indicating the renewed interaction with newly formed Ag 0 .These all further verified that in the course of the photocatalytic reaction, the entirety of AgCl in the composite was lost and there exist a new formation of an Ag/AgCl heterojunction.AgCl is photosensitive and its photo-generated electrons inevitably combines with Ag to form Ag 0 clusters on the AgCl particles from repeated absorption of photons.These Ag species which were formed during the photocatalytic process, brings significant benefits to photocatalysis.Firstly, Ag exhibits surface plasmon response (SPR) in the visible light region, meaning that it can utilize photons in visible light region to generate electron-hole pairs due to SPR oscillations.51, 52 This helped in enhancing the visible light absorption of the otherwise wide-bandgap AgCl.The subsequent separation of these plasmon-induced charge carriers in Ag is thereafter promoted by the Schottky barrier formed between the Ag-AgCl metal-semiconductor junction owing to the differences in their work function. 34This Schottky junction produced an internal electric field at the interface which forced electron and holes to move oppositely.Since Ag has lower work function than AgCl ( AgCl 4.8 eV Ag 4.25), the transfer of electrons occurred from Ag to AgCl. 53This relaying of electrons were also facilitated by the metallic nature of Ag which provided a fast medium for electron transfer. When CN and Ag/AgCl were coupled, they associate closely together to form a staggered heterojunction interface.The band potentials of semiconductor CN and AgCl (vs.NHE) were obtained by a theoretical method based on the absolute Mulliken electronegativity.This simple method has been proven to be in good agreement with the experimental results and has also been widely employed by an appreciable number of researchers.The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge of each semiconductor was calculated by the equation as follows Where, X, is the geometric mean of the absolute Mullikan electronegativity of constituent atoms, which can be calculated from the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy.E c is the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale taken as 4. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Moreover, CH 4 was the only hydrocarbon product which was detected in this experiment.Typically, CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the gas phase produced CO, CH 4 or higher alkenes, while oxygenated products such as alcohols and carboxylic acids are only collected in high H 2 O environment such as under liquid phase, or at high H 2 O/CO 2 ratio which would otherwise require an elevated temperature or a reduced pressure condition. 575885960 Since in this case, the H 2 O/CO 2 was low at 0.043, these products are likely to be absent.Moreover, another plausible reason as to why other hydrocarbon products were not existent in the product gas, can also be explained from their reduction potential in comparison to CH 4 .The reduction potentials of other possible products are given as follows: CO 2 /HCOOH: -0.61 V possesses the lowest reduction potential, inferring that it is the most thermodynamically favored product.This can be an accountable reason for CH 4 as being the sole product achieved.In addition to that, no considerable H 2 molecules were also detected in the product gas.This can possibly mean that intermediate H radicals and protons generated from to the dissociation of water molecules were rapidly consumed by CO 2 in the photocatalytic reaction.An observation similar to this has also been reported by Liu et al. 65 , Yu et al. 66 and Wang et al."}, {"llm generation": "gas phase", "source": "Typically, CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the gas phase produced CO, CH 4 or higher alkenes, while oxygenated products such as alcohols and carboxylic acids are only collected in high H 2 O environment such as under liquid phase, or at high H 2 O/CO 2 ratio which would otherwise require an elevated temperature or a reduced pressure condition. 575885960", "context": "Urea was initially used as a precursor since it is low cost and allegedly yield a more thin, flake-like and mesoporous structure due to releases of CO 2 and NH 3 during its pyrolysis. 26,27A TEM image of the as-prepared CN is provided in Fig S3 .Initially, the obtained bulk CN underwent sonication in 0.5M HCl acid solution.This triggered the delamination of the layered CN into individual sheets, which in effect, assist in furnishing larger contact area subjectable to protonation attack.In addition, this transformation from bulk CN to CN nanosheets is also vital to the photocatalytic efficiency.In the event of bulk CN, most of the strands in the inner bulk layers have redundant role and do not contribute to photocatalysis at all.These bounded sheets reduces the effective surface area and severely limits adsorption-desorption area and light harnessing sites.More importantly, photo-excited carriers in the bulk CN suffers from serious bulk recombination owing to the long travelling distance it requires in reaching the surface.This exfoliation of bulk CN to thin, 2D nanosheets is hence a necessity as it increases the probability of charge carriers in reaching the surface, where it can be consumed to drive photoreactions. 28On another note, acid treatment serves to increase the abundance of amino function groups onto CN sheets surface, which will successively play a key role in the adhesion of AgCl nanoparticles. 4,29 his formation was validated by FTIR analysis in which there exists the emergence of N-H bump corresponding to the peak at 3200cm -1 as depicted in Figure S4.The corresponding amine group will then play apart in acting as Lewis bases whereby the lone pairs of electrons on the N atom in the tri-s-triazine ring structure co-ordinates and bind strongly to metal Ag upon addition of reagent AgNO 3.This was then subsequently grown into AgCl nanoparticles through an in-situ nucleation mechanism by deposition-precipitation method under ambient room temperature.The schematic depiction of the synthesis strategy is presented in Figure 1. To attest the efficacy of the deposition-precipitation synthesis route, morphology and microstructure of the as-obtained AgCl/CN composite and unsupported AgCl were studied using Field Emissions Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM).The relevant particle sizes for pure AgCl and other AgCl/CN composites were also investigated statistically and is summarized in Table 1.The morphology of pure AgCl manifested as irregular, almost-spherical particles with sizes ranging from 1000-3000 nm.Upon involvement of CN as a substrate, AgCl particles ripened to form nanospheres-like particles on the surface of CN.This is owing to the defects present in CN which function as nanoparticle nucleation sites and helped to suppress the growth rate of AgCl particles. 30This manifestation is illustrated in Figure 2, whereby the mean size of AgCl particles in its pure form and in AgCl/CN composite was reduced drastically from 2032 nm to 20-100 nm respectively.This nanocrystal formation is integral to the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity since this correlates to more reactive sites and shorter electron migration path to surface-adsorbed molecules.All AgCl nanoparticles were strongly anchored on the surface of CN and the intimate contact between AgCl and CN form an efficient heterojunction for the charge separation during the photocatalytic process.Additionally, another trend which can be established from FESEM, was the dispersion state of AgCl with increasing mass percentage.As observed in Figure 2(A-F), it was evident that the higher the mass percentage of AgCl incorporated, the more AgCl nanoparticles were formed on the CN support.Most notably, the average particle sizes of AgCl were found to increase in conjunction to an increased loading percentage.On top of that, increasing loading also produced AgCl nanoparticles which exhibited a wider distribution and thus a progressively higher standard deviation (SD).For Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins example, at the two loadings extremities, AgCl-10/CN yielded the smallest average particle size of 28.5 nm and a SD of 4.5 nm, whereas AgCl-70/CN yielded a considerably larger average particle size and a SD of 93.2 and 28.7 respectively.The complete particle size histograms for each pertaining mass percentages of AgCl/CN composites are provided in Figure S5(A-E).Furthermore, at higher loadings as illustrated in Figure 2(D-E), there was an apparent agglomeration of AgCl nanoparticles.This was owing to the excess number of AgCl on the CN sheet, which tend to agglomerate and form clumps, resulting in the poor dispersion of the nanoparticles. Overall, this revealed that the amount of AgCl incorporated in the composite is a highly influential parameter to the dispersion and the size of the AgCl nanoparticles deposited on the CN support.In addition to that, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping have also been performed.This is in order to examine the elemental distribution of the composite, which provided concrete evidence that all relevant elements (C, N, Ag and Cl) are highly dispersed with the spatial distribution as displayed in Figure 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the phase structure of the as-synthesized CN, AgCl and AgCl/CN composite as depicted in Figure 4. Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples.

To attest the efficacy of the deposition-precipitation synthesis route, morphology and microstructure of the as-obtained AgCl/CN composite and unsupported AgCl were studied using Field Emissions Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM).The relevant particle sizes for pure AgCl and other AgCl/CN composites were also investigated statistically and is summarized in Table 1.The morphology of pure AgCl manifested as irregular, almost-spherical particles with sizes ranging from 1000-3000 nm.Upon involvement of CN as a substrate, AgCl particles ripened to form nanospheres-like particles on the surface of CN.This is owing to the defects present in CN which function as nanoparticle nucleation sites and helped to suppress the growth rate of AgCl particles. 30This manifestation is illustrated in Figure 2, whereby the mean size of AgCl particles in its pure form and in AgCl/CN composite was reduced drastically from 2032 nm to 20-100 nm respectively.This nanocrystal formation is integral to the enhancement of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity since this correlates to more reactive sites and shorter electron migration path to surface-adsorbed molecules.All AgCl nanoparticles were strongly anchored on the surface of CN and the intimate contact between AgCl and CN form an efficient heterojunction for the charge separation during the photocatalytic process.Additionally, another trend which can be established from FESEM, was the dispersion state of AgCl with increasing mass percentage.As observed in Figure 2(A-F), it was evident that the higher the mass percentage of AgCl incorporated, the more AgCl nanoparticles were formed on the CN support.Most notably, the average particle sizes of AgCl were found to increase in conjunction to an increased loading percentage.On top of that, increasing loading also produced AgCl nanoparticles which exhibited a wider distribution and thus a progressively higher standard deviation (SD).For Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins example, at the two loadings extremities, AgCl-10/CN yielded the smallest average particle size of 28.5 nm and a SD of 4.5 nm, whereas AgCl-70/CN yielded a considerably larger average particle size and a SD of 93.2 and 28.7 respectively.The complete particle size histograms for each pertaining mass percentages of AgCl/CN composites are provided in Figure S5(A-E).Furthermore, at higher loadings as illustrated in Figure 2(D-E), there was an apparent agglomeration of AgCl nanoparticles.This was owing to the excess number of AgCl on the CN sheet, which tend to agglomerate and form clumps, resulting in the poor dispersion of the nanoparticles. Overall, this revealed that the amount of AgCl incorporated in the composite is a highly influential parameter to the dispersion and the size of the AgCl nanoparticles deposited on the CN support.In addition to that, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping have also been performed.This is in order to examine the elemental distribution of the composite, which provided concrete evidence that all relevant elements (C, N, Ag and Cl) are highly dispersed with the spatial distribution as displayed in Figure 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the phase structure of the as-synthesized CN, AgCl and AgCl/CN composite as depicted in Figure 4. Two apparent peaks indicative of CN could be distinctly identified (as annotated with ).The subtle peak at 13.2 o was assigned to the (100) in-plane structural packing motif of tri-striazine units at a separation distance of d0.68nm. 31Whereas a stronger peak at 27.3 o was indexed to (002) interspacing of the conjugated aromatic systems at a calculated distance d0.33, which indicated that CN sheets were densely stacked in nature. 32 200), ( 220), ( 311), ( 222), ( 400), ( 331) and (420) lattice planes of AgCl cubic crystal phase (JCPDS file, 31-1238). 34,35Added to that, these diffraction patterns undergo progressive transition whereby the higher the loading, the weaker the characteristic peaks of CN and the higher the intensities of AgCl peaks.In the diffraction patterns of pure AgCl, the relative intensity of plane ( 200) is twice as that of (111).However, for a low loading as seen in AgCl-10/CN, the intensity of (111) and ( 200) are almost of equal height.This is as a result of the still apparent peak of CN (002) which overlapped and superimposed with the AgCl (111) peak.With an increased in AgCl loading, the relative intensity (200) diffraction peak surpassed that of (111) due to the diminished presence of CN.Moreover, there were no foreign peaks observed in all the diffraction patterns, indicating that no impurities were found in the composite samples. Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was additionally performed to investigate the surface elemental composition and chemical states of AgCl/CN as given in Figure 6(A-D).The high resolution C 1s spectrum showed two major peaks at 284.6eV and 288.2eV which is characteristic to the graphitic carbon (C-C bonding) and the disrupted sp 2 -bonded carbon (attributed by C-N groups) of CN respectively. 41On the other hand, N 1s spectrum showed an array of peaks owing to the multi-environment nitrogen atom.The most intense peak at 398.6eV was ascribed to aromatic (CN-C) linkage, the weaker 399.7eV peak corresponded to tertiary N bonded to C atoms (N-C 3 ), and the 401eV peak was assigned to amino groups (C-N-H), while lastly the highest binding energy peak at 404.3eV was attributed to excitation. 8As for Ag3d spectrum, it was comprised of two spin-orbit doublets represented by peaks at 368eV and 374eV, which was accredited to the binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 respectively.These individual peaks can be further deconvolved into two peaks whereby 367.5eV and 373.5eV peaks were designated to Ag in AgCl and meanwhile 368.6eV and 374.6eV peaks were to metal Ag 0 which may arise from slight photocorrosion of the sample due to the exposure of light whilst handling.On the other hand, Cl 2p spectra displayed two spin-orbit doublets of Cl 2p 5/2 and Cl 2p 3/2 which were correlated to bands of binding energy 197.8eV and 199.5eV respectively and were attributed to Cl -ion from AgCl. The photocatalytic performance of AgCl/CN in gas-phase CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CH 4 was investigated using a low-power 15W energy-saving daylight bulb as a visible light source and under ambient conditions.As observed from Figure 7(A), the habitation of AgCl on CN yielded a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic activity .Firstly, it could be seen from Figure 7(A) that even CN on its own exhibited a massive 30 fold improvement as compared to commercial P25.This was owing to its visible-responsive trait and its extended 2D, porous structure.The AgCl/CN composite further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of its derivative CN with an optimum achieved at an intermediate loading.Upon light illumination, the photocatalytic performance on CO This measures how efficiently the impinging photons were converted into electron-hole pairs that were subsequently used in the formation of CH 4 .Based on the photo-reduction of CO 2 under low-power 15W light source, the photochemical quantum yield of CH 4 was found to be 0.085.Although a low power daylight bulb was used, this result is comparable to some previously reported values which even employed high power Xe or Hg lamps, therefore making our process more practically feasible. 43444546 Several control experiments were executed to validate the role of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in the reduction of CO produced was in fact was derived from CO 2 and not due to carbon residues of the catalyst.Lastly, blank test ( 3) and ( 4) indicated the relevance of the role of these parameters (light and H 2 O) in the photo-reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .This confirmed that the CH 4 was in fact derived from photocatalysis and highlighted the significance of AgCl/CN as a photocatalyst in driving CO 2 reduction.Furthermore, the hourly progression of the CO 2 photo-reduction reaction can be observed from Figure 7(C).It can be seen that the reaction kicked off with low evolution of CH 4 which later increased as the reaction progresses.This observation can be associated to the low photo-conversion of CO 2 since intermediate products in the form of radicals were initially formed at this stage.However at succeeding hours, CH 4 evolution progressively reduced and this may be attributed to the radical intermediates and products saturating the active sites which consequently slowed down the rate of Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins reaction.A similar trend was also observed in a number of other CO 2 reduction reports. Since, it has been highlighted that there was a large enhancement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by the AgCl/CN hybrid, it is now necessary to account the reasons for this observation.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared AgCl/CN composite and its derivatives (AgCl and CN) were measured to reflect their light harvesting ability towards different wavelength in the solar radiation.From Figure 8, both pure CN and AgCl exhibit typical semiconductor absorption whereby distinct absorption is seen only in the UV region (200nm-400nm) but a limited absorption in the visible region (400nm-700nm).Pure AgCl exhibited the highest absorption in the visible range, showing a bump due the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the photo-reduced Ag, whereas CN showed a minimal background absorption in that region.As compared to CN, composite AgCl/CN, displayed a strengthened absorption peak in the targeted visible light range (450-700nm) as well as the UV, validating the habitation of visible-light-sensitive AgCl host materials on CN.Moreover, this absorbance incrementally increases with the content of AgCl as shown in the inset in Figure 8.This confirms the fabrication of heterojunction structure between CN and light-sensitive AgCl allows for an enhanced optical absorption.The bandgap of CN and AgCl was individually obtained to be 2.7 and 3 eV respectively based from the plots of (F(R)hv) 1/2 vs hv (Figure S6).Once again, it should be pointed out that there was no distinct red or blue shift in the band edge of the composite with respect to CN, suggesting that AgCl nanoparticles was not covalently intercalated into CN matrix but it was merely dispersed on its surface owing to the low-temperature synthesis process.It was discussed earlier that AgCl/CN composite demonstrated the highest CH 4 yield at an intermediate loading.These findings suggested that the photocatalytic performance was impeded by larger particle sizes and agglomeration at higher loading content.This was since larger particles associate with lower surface area, longer electron migration paths and less area for light harvesting. 49rom another aspect, the bigger the cluster of AgCl nanoparticles anchored on CN, the weaker the co-ordination bond between CN and AgCl which then disrupted the heterojunction structure which led to a less efficient charge flow via the two materials.An appropriate amount of AgCl is hence paramount for an optimal enhancement in the photocatalytic activity.This claim was further corroborated by Photoluminescence (PL) emission measurements which is shown in Figure 9. PL spectra can be used to evaluate the recombination probability and separation efficiency of photoinduced electron and holes. 50Higher spectra intensity correlates to higher recombination rate as more electron and holes recombine to emit more (hv).The intensity goes by the order CN AgCl-70/CN AgCl-10/CN AgCl-50/CN AgCl-30/CN which were in accordance with the CO 2 photo-reduction results.This implied that AgCl-30/CN has the most efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs since it was the desired intermediate whereby enough AgCl were integrated for an improved light-absorption and heterojunction engineering but not in the extent where severe aggregation of its particles occurred.It is now evident that the hybridization of photosensitive AgCl to CN led to the improvement of photocatalytic activity, however its stability for practical application remains to be elucidated.Therefore, a recycling experiment was performed using the best sample AgCl-30/CN and all the experiment conditions were unchanged to ensure reproducibility of results.As shown in Fig. 7D, the photocatalytic reduction activity was only slightly reduced for each of the consecutive runs and the greater part of the photoactivity was preserved.This signifies that AgCl/CN composites were fairly stable and did not undergo serious decline in activity with repeated usage. After the recyclability experiment, which comprised of 4 runs, the spent AgCl-30/CN was analyzed using XPS to reveal the eventual formation of Ag 0 .From Fig. 2A, the XPS patterns of Ag 3d in AgCl- Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins generate a sustained photoactivity under prolonged reaction hours. Based from area analysis on Ag 3d XPS peaks, the mole ratio of surface metallic Ag 0 was 0.25 out of the total Ag species (Ag 0 Ag ) after the 4 consecutive stability runs as compared to a mere 0.09 for the case of fresh AgCl-30/CN catalyst.Accompanying this increase in intensity of Ag 0 peaks, was also the shrinking of Ag peaks in Ag 3d (Fig. 2A) and Cl peaks in Cl 2p (Fig 2B).Furthermore, all the Ag and Cl peaks have also been slightly shifted from their initial binding energy, indicating the renewed interaction with newly formed Ag 0 .These all further verified that in the course of the photocatalytic reaction, the entirety of AgCl in the composite was lost and there exist a new formation of an Ag/AgCl heterojunction.AgCl is photosensitive and its photo-generated electrons inevitably combines with Ag to form Ag 0 clusters on the AgCl particles from repeated absorption of photons.These Ag species which were formed during the photocatalytic process, brings significant benefits to photocatalysis.Firstly, Ag exhibits surface plasmon response (SPR) in the visible light region, meaning that it can utilize photons in visible light region to generate electron-hole pairs due to SPR oscillations.51, 52 This helped in enhancing the visible light absorption of the otherwise wide-bandgap AgCl.The subsequent separation of these plasmon-induced charge carriers in Ag is thereafter promoted by the Schottky barrier formed between the Ag-AgCl metal-semiconductor junction owing to the differences in their work function. 34This Schottky junction produced an internal electric field at the interface which forced electron and holes to move oppositely.Since Ag has lower work function than AgCl ( AgCl 4.8 eV Ag 4.25), the transfer of electrons occurred from Ag to AgCl. 53This relaying of electrons were also facilitated by the metallic nature of Ag which provided a fast medium for electron transfer.

Characterization studies have shown that AgCl nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of CN and the resultant heterostructured AgCl/CN nanojunction resulted in a more efficient transfer and separation of electron and holes.Furthermore, SPR effect from metallic Ag 0 formed during the photocatalytic reaction played a significant role by enhancing absorption of visible light to generate additional electron-hole pairs utilizable for CO 2 reduction.These effects commingle to lead to the significant enhancement in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , offering a 2.5 fold enhancement over pure CN and a massive 30 fold over commercial P25 in the case of AgCl-30/CN.Therefore, the high photocatalytic activity of this composite suggests that they are promising materials as a photocatalyst, not particularly constrained to CO 2 reduction, but also in other applications such as water splitting and environmental remediation purposes.

Figure 5 displayed the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of composite AgCl/CN and derivative CN.All AgCl/CN composites featured the characteristic peaks of CN, inferring that the chemical integrity of CN was sustained even after the habitation of AgCl nanoparticles.A distinguishable feature of CN was firstly the acute band occurring at 811cm -1 which arised from the symmetric breathing mode of tri-s-triazine unit.36, 37 The array of bands between 1200-1650cm -1 was due to the skeletal stretching vibration of C-N heterocycles with specific peaks positioned at 1250, 1327, 1420, 1572 and 1637cm -1 , signifying the presence of fully condensed trigonal N-(C) 3 and partially condensed bridging C-NH-C units.38, 39 This indicated the successful fabrication of the extended C-N-C network for all composites.The wide band in the range of 3000-3650cm -1 was attributable to the stretching of amino (N-H) in CN and the hydroxyl (O-H) groups for adsorbed water molecules.It was observed that in comparison to pure CN, the bands of AgCl/CN composite did not exhibit any pronounced shift.This suggests that AgCl particles were merely deposited onto CN support surface and no covalent interaction exist between the two.40 J.

CN was similarly prepared as that from earlier publications by our research group. 23,24,25Bulk CN was synthesized through the thermal polycondensation of urea precursor.In brief, 3.2g of urea was packed into a ceramic crucible and was calcined to 520 o C at a rate of 10 o C/min for a duration of 2.5h.A lid was placed to minimize the loss of mass originating from the sublimation of urea.The ceramic crucible was then left to cool naturally and the final CN bulk product was collected after it was grounded to powder form.For the protonation of CN, formerly prepared bulk CN (1g) was acid treated under ultra-sonication for 1h in 250mL of 0.5M hydrochloric acid (HCl).This helps with the removal of the leftover unpolymerized molecules.The exfoliated CN was then subjected to additional 4h of stirring to allow further protonation.Finally the product was washed with de-ionized water, filtered and left to dry overnight at 70 o C. All samples were prepared via deposition-precipitation method.In a typical synthesis procedure, the as obtained acid pre-treated CN (0.4g) was added into 50mL de-ionized water and the resultant suspension was sonicated for 30 minutes.Then a solution of AgNO 3 (0.04g) was added to the suspension drop-wise and was stirred for 1hr to allow complete adsorption of Ag onto CN surface. Afterwards, NaCl was added drop-wise to the former mixture solution at a molar excess of 10.This gradual addition of precipitating agent, NaCl, is required in order to avoid the rapid nucleation of the precipitate in the solution but exclusively on the CN substrate surface.The mixture was then allowed to stir for another 4 hrs in the absence of light.The product was finally obtained by vacuum filtration, washed with ethanol and deionized water, and dried overnight at 70 o C. The samples were denoted as AgCl-X/CN, in which X is ascribed to the theoretical mass percentage of precursor silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ) to CN.This step was repeated to synthesize a series of catalyst which was denoted as AgCl-10/CN, AgCl-30/CN, AgCl-50/CN and AgCl-70/CN. The surface morphology were analyzed using Hitachi SU8010 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM).The crystallographic structure was investigated using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) on Bruker D8 Discover X-Ray Diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu K radiation (0.154056nm) at a scan rate of 0.02 o s -1 operated at 40kV and 40mA over the diffraction angle range 25 o -45 o . Elemental and chemical analysis was performed using Thermo-Nicolet iS10 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) using standard KBr pellet method in the range 400-4000cm -1 . The absorbance spectra of the sample was obtained using Cary 100 Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer equipped with an integrated sphere.The optical properties were measured in the analysis range between 200nm and 800nm and at room temperature.The band gap energies of the photocatalysts were then determined from the Kubelka-Munk function, F(R) and the extrapolation of Tauc plot (F(R).hv 1/2 vs hv).The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) wide and narrow scan spectra was acquired using AXIS Ultra DLD, Kratos, equipped with an Al K X-ray source (1486.6 eV) at 10 mA, 15 kV, analyzing 300 mm x 700 mm area under 3.1 x 10-9 torr ultra vacuum environment.The spectra were analyzed using vision software which included vision manager and vision processing.All spectra were charge corrected by means of adventitious carbon signal (C 1s) at 284.6 eV.The linear method was used for background subtraction and curve fitting.The surface structure of charge carrier trapping is analysed using Photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature by 325 nm He-Cd laser as an excitation light source using Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope.The emission spectra were scanned from 350 to 750 nm.The width of excitation slit and emission slit were 10nm. Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out in a continuous gasphase system, at ambient temperature and pressure, and using low power 15W energy-saving daylight lamp (Phillips, TORNADO WW E27 220-240V 1CT) as the light source.The light spectrum of this bulb is given in Figure S1 (Supplementary Information) which is largely in the visible light range (400-650 nm) and with an average light intensity which was measured to be 8.5 mW/cm 2 (Kipp and Zonen pyranometer CMP 6).The prepared catalyst was evenly coated on to glass rods for immobilization into a tubular fixed bed reactor configuration.The glass rods were fixated inside quartz tubes occurring in three consecutive series.The distance between bulb and the quartz was fixed to be 5cm.This setup was enclosed in a black box to minimize light interference from the surroundings. Prior to entering the reactor, highly pure CO 2 (99.999) gas was first bubbled into water (H 2 O) to generate a CO 2 and H 2 O gas mixture.The H 2 O/CO 2 molar ratio of the gas feed to the reactor was measured to be 0.043.Before each test, the reactor system was initially purged with CO 2 and water vapour at 50mL/min to Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins evacuate impurity such as air for a full 30 minutes, while at the same time, allowed absorption-desorption equilibrium to be achieved on the catalyst surface.The flowrate was then reduced and maintained at 5 mL/min throughout the photocatalytic reaction duration of 10 hours and product gas was sampled hourly.Meanwhile, recyclability test was also performed using the best sample.The AgCl/CN sample underwent four consecutive test cycles with each lasting for 10 h.After the end of each cycle, the photoreactor was purged with N 2 overnight to remove the gaseous products completely and the cycle reiterates with CO 2 purging.An Agilent 780A Gas Chromatography (GC) was subsequently used to reveal product gas components and to quantify the methane yield.The mass loaded on the system was made to be consistent at approximately 50mg to ensure the reproducibility of the results and produce a fair comparison between the samples."}]}}
