The low-angle XRD patterns in Fig. 2a show that a moderate diffraction corresponding to (100) reflection of the 2D hexagonal (p6 mm) symmetry can be observed for all samples, indicating the synthesized CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites have retained some regular mesostructures although the higher angle two diffractions indexed to (110) and ( 200) are too weak to be detected, as confirmed by their TEM images (see below).Fig. 2b shows the wideangle XRD patterns, it can be seen that in addition to an anatase structure observed for pure TiO 2 , the structures of pure CeO 2 and other three CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites were identified as cubic fluorite phase.It should be noted that the peaks of cubic fluorite phase become broader and the intensity becomes weaker with the decreasing content of CeO 2 in the composites, and sample Mes-CeTi-0.5 with the lowest of Ce/Ti molar ratio exhibits a very broad diffraction peak at 224-37 o which is ascribed to the overlap of two peaks, indicating amorphous-like structure.The intensity difference and peak broadening of the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites were attributed to a significant reduction of crystallite size.In addition, the peaks corresponding to cubic fluorite phase of composites are shifted toward lower angle with increasing CeO 2 content because of the larger ionic radius of Ce 4 (0.97 A) than Ti 4 (0.61 A).Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed that the molar ratio of the residual Si in these ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites was very low (Table 1), indicating most of the silica template has been removed. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of above samples are shown in Fig. 3.All isotherm curves show an obvious uptake of N 2 as a result of capillary condensation in a wide relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.55-0.95,which indicates the existence of multiform pore distributions.The pore size distribution obtained from an analysis of desorption branch of the isotherms is shown in Fig. 3b.It can be seen that except Mes-TiO 2 with a relative broad pore size distribution, other four samples possess bimodal pore size distributions centered at about 3.3 and 9.1 nm which are respectively ascribed to the dissolution of the silica walls and the coalescence of unfilled spaces of the template SBA-15 or/and the voids between the small particles.The corresponding textural properties are summarized in Table 1.These ordered mesoporous materials generally have high BET surface areas (134.6-254.1 m 2 /g) and large pore volumes (0.515-0.832 cm 3 /g), and both are increased with the decrease of CeO 2 content in composites. Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of the Mes-TiO 2 , Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0, and Mes-CeO 2 .From the lowmagnification TEM images (Fig. 4 left), it can be seen that besides the rodlike morphology, ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructure can be clearly observed for all samples, suggesting thus-prepared materials are well reverse-replica of the template, which is consistent with low-angle XRD results.The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 4 right show the detail structure of the mesopores, and the pore walls are well constituted by metal oxide nanocrystals with a diameter of several nanometers.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns are given in the inset of Fig. 4 left.All shows the diffraction rings, indicating that the metal oxide nanocrystals, as building units of the pore walls, are polycrystalline.It should be noted that the diffraction rings for Mes-CeTi-0.5 are not very clear since the semicrystalline structure, which is in agreement with its wide-angle XRD result. In order to investigate the electronic states of the catalysts, UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) studies were performed on Mes-TiO 2 , Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0, and Mes-CeO 2 (as shown in Fig. 5).For comparison, a commercial titania powers P25 was also measured and plotted in same Figure .Interestingly, the Mes-TiO 2 displays a slight red shift of light absorption with respect to the commercial P25 which absorbs light with wavelength shorter than 400 nm, this is phenomenon may ascribed to its ordered mesoporous structure, enlarged surface area and multiple scatting enable it to harvest light much more efficiently 40.The samples of three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites show spectral response in a broad visible region ( 400-600 nm) owing to the photosentisizing effect of CeO 2 .It is worthy to note that these CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibit a much stronger absorption in both untraviolet and visble-light regions than that of Mes-TiO 2 , this enhanced light-trapping effect is the result of the reflection Textural properties and the energy of band gap (Eg) of Mes-TiO2, Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0, and Mes-CeO2. Ce:Ti molar ratio Ce:Ti molar ratio (XPS) Surface area (m or transmission of the light scattered by the ordered mesopores implanted in the body of CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites, and a similar effect has been verified in literature 32.The band energy gap of above samples could be calculated by using ( h ) n k(h -E g ), where is the absorption coefficient, k is the parameter that related to the effective masses associated with the valence and conduction bands, n is 1 / 2 for a direct transition, h is the absorption energy, and E g is the band gap energy 41.Plotting ( h ) 1/2 versus h based on the spectral response in Fig. 5a give the extrapolated intercept corresponding to the E g value (Fig. 5b).As shown in Table 1, the Mes-TiO 2 exhibits decreased E g value (2.81 eV) with respect to that of commercial P25 (3.10 eV), which is consistent with the DRS result.Moreover, the optical band gap energies of the Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0, and Mes-CeTi-2.0 (2.16, 2.20, and 2.25 eV, respectively) display obvious red-shifts compared to that of Mes-TiO 2 (2.83 eV) and Mes-CeO 2 (2.61 eV).The results of this study therefore indicate that the enhanced ability to absorb visible-light of these ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites makes them a promising photocatalyst for solar-driven applications. The surface chemical state of Ce, Ti, and O in all samples was also investigated by XPS analysis.Ce 3d spectra of Mes-CeO 2 and three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites are shown in Fig. 6a.The labels used in identifying Ce 3d XPS peaks were established by Burroughs et al. 42, where and u indicate the spin-orbit coupling 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 , respectively.The peaks denoted as , , and are contributed by CeO 2 , which can be respectively assigned to a mixture of Ce IV (3d 9 4f 2 ) O (2p 4 ), Ce IV (3d 9 4f 1 ) O (2p 5 ) and Ce IV (3d 9 4f 0 ) O (2p 6 ).The same peak assignment is applied to u structures.The /u doublet is ascribed to photoemission from Ce 3 cations 43.Therefore, a mixture of Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states exists on the surface of the Mes-CeO 2 and three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites, which was in good agreement with the studies of Fang et al. 44 and Gao et al. 45.The surface concentrations of Ce 3 for Mes-CeO 2 and three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites evaluated by deconvolution of the XPS spectra are summarized in Table 2, it is worthy to note that Ce 3 concentrations in CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites are much higher Summary of the XPS data for Mes-TiO2, Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0,Mes-CeO2 and commercial P25. Ce 3 /(Ce 3 Ce 4 ) () OOH/OT () than that of Mes-CeO 2 , suggesting that the introduction of TiO 2 into CeO 2 causes the partial reduction of Ce tetravalent cation 46.The binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 in both commercial P25 and Mes-TiO 2 are about 464.4 and 458.4 eV, respectively (Fig. 6b).Meanwhile, the presence of CeO 2 in composites shows no significant influence on the Ti2p binding energies which vary at most within 0.3 eV.This indicates that Ti exists as Ti 4 in all samples, which agreed well with the values reported in the literature 44,47.It can be also observed from Fig. 6b that the Ti 2p XPS peaks became broader after the introduction of CeO 2 , which was attributed to the heterogeneous environments of Ti 4 in CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites 44.The surface Ce/Ti molar ratios derived from XPS for three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites are listed in Table 1, it can be seen that the results are in good agreement with the ratios in initial mixture. Fig. 6c shows the O1s XPS spectra and the deconvolution results of all samples.The O1s XPS spectra appear broad, which can be deconvoluted into three distinct peaks: the one with lower binding energy is assigned to lattice oxygen in the metal oxides, the next is ascribed to chemisorbed oxygen or/and weakly bonded oxygen species, and the third peak at the highest binding energy is due to surface oxygen by hydroxyl species and/or adsorbed water species on the surface 38,45,48.Based on the area integral of the three peaks respectively corresponding to lattice oxygen (OL), chemisorbed oxygen (OC) and surface oxygen (OS) of O 1s photoemissions, the ratio of OC to OT (OT OL OC OS) for all samples was calculated as shown in Table 2.It can be noticed that the introduction of CeO 2 species can effectively enhance the chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite.Because of the ordered mesostructure and high specific surface area, the Mes-TiO 2 possesses higher ratio of OC/OT than that of commercial P25. The photocatalytic activity of Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0,Mes-TiO 2 , Mes-CeO 2 , and commercial P25 was evaluated in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.Fig. 7 shows the evolution of main products (CO and CH 4 ) as functions of irradiation time over all photocatalysts.It can be seen that the yields of CO and CH 4 are increased with the irradiation time for all photocatalysts, and three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than Mes-TiO 2 as well as Mes-CeO 2 , suggesting that CeO 2 addition can enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of pure mesoporous TiO 2 .Moreover, the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites show a much higher level of activity than that of commercial P25.our experiment, the 300 W Xe arc lamp excitation spectrum contains about 50 visible-light which is greatly contributed to the high photocatalytic efficiency for the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.At the same time, the photogenerated electrons in the TiO 2 can drift to the CeO 2 under the inner electric field between CeO 2 and TiO 2 because of the energy band bending in space charge region, it is more helpful for the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in TiO 2 , resulting in the improvement of photocatalytic activity under solar irradiation.Finally, XPS analysis confirms that the CeO 2 addition can greatly enhance the surface chemisorbed oxygen species of the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites, these oxygen species can easily capture electrons and yield surface oxygen radicals with excellent reduction capability.Also, the existence of mixture of Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states on the surface of CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites denote that the partial metal in composites is not fully oxidized, so that Ce 3 can interact with holes and prevent the combination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher quantum efficiency of photocatalytic reaction. In addition, in order to investigate the structural stability of the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites in photocatalytic reaction in the presence of H 2 O, we have characterized the structure of these ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites after photocatalytic test by XRD and TEM analysis.It was found that the structure of these used CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites hasn't changed when compared with that of the corresponding fresh ones, indicating a good structural stability.Fig. 8 shows the XRD patterns and TEM image of the representative Mes-CeTi-1.0 sample after photocatalytic test."}, {"llm generation": "ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites", "source": "Due to the special composition and structure, the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.", "context": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites with 2D hexagonal structure and varied compositions were synthesized via a simple nanocasting route.XRD, nitrogen sorption, and TEM results reveal that the obtained CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites have ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructures with high specific surface area and hierarchical porosity.Introduction of CeO 2 species to TiO 2 can effectively extend the spectral response from UV to visible area and enhance the surface chemisorbed oxygen species of the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites, which are confirmed by UV-vis and XPS analysis.Due to the special composition and structure, the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.

Ordered mesoporous silica SBA-15 template with rod-like morphology was synthesized as the reported procedure except enlarging the amount by ten times 39.Ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites were synthesized using the hard template method with the help of acetone.In a typical preparation process, a total 12 mmol of TiCl 4 and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O with different Ce/Ti molar ratios (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) in sequence was dissolved into 15 mL of acetone.After the solution became clear, 2 g of SBA-15 hard template was added and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours in a 100 mL beaker, then the mixture was transferred to a clean flat Petri dish (diameter: 8 cm) and the solvent was evaporated.In order to achieve higher loadings, the above dried hybrid powder was calcined at 200 C for 6 h to decompose the metal precursors, and then the impregnation step was repeated, but the amount of precursors was reduced to 2/3 compared to the first step.The resulting samples were calcined in air at 500 C for 4 h with a heating ramp of 1 K min -1 to completely decompose the inorganic precursors.Finally, the silica template was removed using a 2 M NaOH aqueous solution at room temperature and this etching process was repeated three times.The obtained CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites with different initial Ce/Ti molar ratios (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) are denoted as Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0, and Mes-CeTi-2.0, respectively.For comparison, ordered mesporous TiO 2 (Mes-TiO 2 ) and mesoporous CeO 2 (Mes-CeO 2 ) were also prepared by the same method.

All binding energies were calibrated by using the contaminant carbon (C 1S 284.6 eV) as a reference.

Ce 3 /(Ce 3 Ce 4 ) () OOH/OT () than that of Mes-CeO 2 , suggesting that the introduction of TiO 2 into CeO 2 causes the partial reduction of Ce tetravalent cation 46.The binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 in both commercial P25 and Mes-TiO 2 are about 464.4 and 458.4 eV, respectively (Fig. 6b).Meanwhile, the presence of CeO 2 in composites shows no significant influence on the Ti2p binding energies which vary at most within 0.3 eV.This indicates that Ti exists as Ti 4 in all samples, which agreed well with the values reported in the literature 44,47.It can be also observed from Fig. 6b that the Ti 2p XPS peaks became broader after the introduction of CeO 2 , which was attributed to the heterogeneous environments of Ti 4 in CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites 44.The surface Ce/Ti molar ratios derived from XPS for three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites are listed in Table 1, it can be seen that the results are in good agreement with the ratios in initial mixture. Fig. 6c shows the O1s XPS spectra and the deconvolution results of all samples.The O1s XPS spectra appear broad, which can be deconvoluted into three distinct peaks: the one with lower binding energy is assigned to lattice oxygen in the metal oxides, the next is ascribed to chemisorbed oxygen or/and weakly bonded oxygen species, and the third peak at the highest binding energy is due to surface oxygen by hydroxyl species and/or adsorbed water species on the surface 38,45,48.Based on the area integral of the three peaks respectively corresponding to lattice oxygen (OL), chemisorbed oxygen (OC) and surface oxygen (OS) of O 1s photoemissions, the ratio of OC to OT (OT OL OC OS) for all samples was calculated as shown in Table 2.It can be noticed that the introduction of CeO 2 species can effectively enhance the chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite.Because of the ordered mesostructure and high specific surface area, the Mes-TiO 2 possesses higher ratio of OC/OT than that of commercial P25. The photocatalytic activity of Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0,Mes-TiO 2 , Mes-CeO 2 , and commercial P25 was evaluated in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.Fig. 7 shows the evolution of main products (CO and CH 4 ) as functions of irradiation time over all photocatalysts.It can be seen that the yields of CO and CH 4 are increased with the irradiation time for all photocatalysts, and three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than Mes-TiO 2 as well as Mes-CeO 2 , suggesting that CeO 2 addition can enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of pure mesoporous TiO 2 .Moreover, the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites show a much higher level of activity than that of commercial P25.our experiment, the 300 W Xe arc lamp excitation spectrum contains about 50 visible-light which is greatly contributed to the high photocatalytic efficiency for the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.At the same time, the photogenerated electrons in the TiO 2 can drift to the CeO 2 under the inner electric field between CeO 2 and TiO 2 because of the energy band bending in space charge region, it is more helpful for the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in TiO 2 , resulting in the improvement of photocatalytic activity under solar irradiation.Finally, XPS analysis confirms that the CeO 2 addition can greatly enhance the surface chemisorbed oxygen species of the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites, these oxygen species can easily capture electrons and yield surface oxygen radicals with excellent reduction capability.Also, the existence of mixture of Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states on the surface of CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites denote that the partial metal in composites is not fully oxidized, so that Ce 3 can interact with holes and prevent the combination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher quantum efficiency of photocatalytic reaction. In addition, in order to investigate the structural stability of the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites in photocatalytic reaction in the presence of H 2 O, we have characterized the structure of these ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites after photocatalytic test by XRD and TEM analysis.It was found that the structure of these used CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites hasn't changed when compared with that of the corresponding fresh ones, indicating a good structural stability.Fig. 8 shows the XRD patterns and TEM image of the representative Mes-CeTi-1.0 sample after photocatalytic test."}, {"llm generation": "Solar", "source": "Due to the special composition and structure, the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.", "context": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites with 2D hexagonal structure and varied compositions were synthesized via a simple nanocasting route.XRD, nitrogen sorption, and TEM results reveal that the obtained CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites have ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructures with high specific surface area and hierarchical porosity.Introduction of CeO 2 species to TiO 2 can effectively extend the spectral response from UV to visible area and enhance the surface chemisorbed oxygen species of the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites, which are confirmed by UV-vis and XPS analysis.Due to the special composition and structure, the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.

Ordered mesoporous silica SBA-15 template with rod-like morphology was synthesized as the reported procedure except enlarging the amount by ten times 39.Ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites were synthesized using the hard template method with the help of acetone.In a typical preparation process, a total 12 mmol of TiCl 4 and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O with different Ce/Ti molar ratios (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) in sequence was dissolved into 15 mL of acetone.After the solution became clear, 2 g of SBA-15 hard template was added and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours in a 100 mL beaker, then the mixture was transferred to a clean flat Petri dish (diameter: 8 cm) and the solvent was evaporated.In order to achieve higher loadings, the above dried hybrid powder was calcined at 200 C for 6 h to decompose the metal precursors, and then the impregnation step was repeated, but the amount of precursors was reduced to 2/3 compared to the first step.The resulting samples were calcined in air at 500 C for 4 h with a heating ramp of 1 K min -1 to completely decompose the inorganic precursors.Finally, the silica template was removed using a 2 M NaOH aqueous solution at room temperature and this etching process was repeated three times.The obtained CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites with different initial Ce/Ti molar ratios (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) are denoted as Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0, and Mes-CeTi-2.0, respectively.For comparison, ordered mesporous TiO 2 (Mes-TiO 2 ) and mesoporous CeO 2 (Mes-CeO 2 ) were also prepared by the same method. Low-angle X-ray diffraction patterns were collected in -2 mode using Rigaku D/MAX-2550VB/PC diffractometer (CuK 1 radiation, 1.5406 A), operated at 40 kV and 200 mA (scanning step: 0.02 per second).Wide-angle XRD patterns were collected in the same mode, but operated at 100 mA.Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were done using a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at -196 C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus.The diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples over a range of 200-800 nm were recorded by a Varian Cary 500 Scan UV-vis system.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out on a RBO upgraded PHI-5000 C ESCA system (Pekin Elmer) using monochromated Al K X-rays (h1486.6 eV) as a radiation at 250 W. All binding energies were calibrated by using the contaminant carbon (C 1S 284.6 eV) as a reference. Photocatalytic activity tests for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O were carried out in a stainless steel reactor with the volume of 1500 ml (as shown in Fig. 1).Catalyst powder (0.10 g) was dispersed on the stainless steel omentum which was fixed in the center of reactor.The bottom of glass wool support was moisturized with 5.0 g of deionized water to maintain saturated water vapor in the reactor, and a Xe arc lamp (300 W) with sunlike radiation spectrum was put at the top of quartz window with the distance of 8 cm, which can irradiate the whole catalyst powder.In order to control the reaction temperature, the Xe lamp was placed in a cold trap and the whole reactor system is in the air circulation.Prior to illumination, the reactor was first purged with the CO 2 H 2 O mixture at 100 mL/min for 2 h and then reduced to 20 mL/min for another 1 h to establish an adsorption-desorption balance, and the gas phase volume concentrations of CO 2 and H 2 O were controlled at about 95.5 and 4.5, respectively.After that, the reactor was tightly closed and the Xe lamp was then switched on to start the experiment.The reaction temperature and pressure were maintained at 30 C and 110KPa, respectively.The gas phase products were taken at various time during the irradiation and analyzed by gas chromatography."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "our experiment, the 300 W Xe arc lamp excitation spectrum contains about 50 visible-light which is greatly contributed to the high photocatalytic efficiency for the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.", "context": "The formation of ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites with different compositions is firstly provided by XRD analysis as shown in Fig. 2. The low-angle XRD patterns in Fig. 2a show that a moderate diffraction corresponding to (100) reflection of the 2D hexagonal (p6 mm) symmetry can be observed for all samples, indicating the synthesized CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites have retained some regular mesostructures although the higher angle two diffractions indexed to (110) and ( 200) are too weak to be detected, as confirmed by their TEM images (see below).Fig. 2b shows the wideangle XRD patterns, it can be seen that in addition to an anatase structure observed for pure TiO 2 , the structures of pure CeO 2 and other three CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites were identified as cubic fluorite phase.It should be noted that the peaks of cubic fluorite phase become broader and the intensity becomes weaker with the decreasing content of CeO 2 in the composites, and sample Mes-CeTi-0.5 with the lowest of Ce/Ti molar ratio exhibits a very broad diffraction peak at 224-37 o which is ascribed to the overlap of two peaks, indicating amorphous-like structure.The intensity difference and peak broadening of the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites were attributed to a significant reduction of crystallite size.In addition, the peaks corresponding to cubic fluorite phase of composites are shifted toward lower angle with increasing CeO 2 content because of the larger ionic radius of Ce 4 (0.97 A) than Ti 4 (0.61 A).Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed that the molar ratio of the residual Si in these ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites was very low (Table 1), indicating most of the silica template has been removed. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of above samples are shown in Fig. 3.All isotherm curves show an obvious uptake of N 2 as a result of capillary condensation in a wide relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.55-0.95,which indicates the existence of multiform pore distributions.The pore size distribution obtained from an analysis of desorption branch of the isotherms is shown in Fig. 3b.It can be seen that except Mes-TiO 2 with a relative broad pore size distribution, other four samples possess bimodal pore size distributions centered at about 3.3 and 9.1 nm which are respectively ascribed to the dissolution of the silica walls and the coalescence of unfilled spaces of the template SBA-15 or/and the voids between the small particles.The corresponding textural properties are summarized in Table 1.These ordered mesoporous materials generally have high BET surface areas (134.6-254.1 m 2 /g) and large pore volumes (0.515-0.832 cm 3 /g), and both are increased with the decrease of CeO 2 content in composites. Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of the Mes-TiO 2 , Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0, and Mes-CeO 2 .From the lowmagnification TEM images (Fig. 4 left), it can be seen that besides the rodlike morphology, ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructure can be clearly observed for all samples, suggesting thus-prepared materials are well reverse-replica of the template, which is consistent with low-angle XRD results.The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 4 right show the detail structure of the mesopores, and the pore walls are well constituted by metal oxide nanocrystals with a diameter of several nanometers.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns are given in the inset of Fig. 4 left.All shows the diffraction rings, indicating that the metal oxide nanocrystals, as building units of the pore walls, are polycrystalline.It should be noted that the diffraction rings for Mes-CeTi-0.5 are not very clear since the semicrystalline structure, which is in agreement with its wide-angle XRD result. In order to investigate the electronic states of the catalysts, UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) studies were performed on Mes-TiO 2 , Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0, and Mes-CeO 2 (as shown in Fig. 5).For comparison, a commercial titania powers P25 was also measured and plotted in same Figure .Interestingly, the Mes-TiO 2 displays a slight red shift of light absorption with respect to the commercial P25 which absorbs light with wavelength shorter than 400 nm, this is phenomenon may ascribed to its ordered mesoporous structure, enlarged surface area and multiple scatting enable it to harvest light much more efficiently 40.The samples of three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites show spectral response in a broad visible region ( 400-600 nm) owing to the photosentisizing effect of CeO 2 .It is worthy to note that these CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibit a much stronger absorption in both untraviolet and visble-light regions than that of Mes-TiO 2 , this enhanced light-trapping effect is the result of the reflection Textural properties and the energy of band gap (Eg) of Mes-TiO2, Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0, and Mes-CeO2. Ce:Ti molar ratio Ce:Ti molar ratio (XPS) Surface area (m or transmission of the light scattered by the ordered mesopores implanted in the body of CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites, and a similar effect has been verified in literature 32.The band energy gap of above samples could be calculated by using ( h ) n k(h -E g ), where is the absorption coefficient, k is the parameter that related to the effective masses associated with the valence and conduction bands, n is 1 / 2 for a direct transition, h is the absorption energy, and E g is the band gap energy 41.Plotting ( h ) 1/2 versus h based on the spectral response in Fig. 5a give the extrapolated intercept corresponding to the E g value (Fig. 5b).As shown in Table 1, the Mes-TiO 2 exhibits decreased E g value (2.81 eV) with respect to that of commercial P25 (3.10 eV), which is consistent with the DRS result.Moreover, the optical band gap energies of the Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0, and Mes-CeTi-2.0 (2.16, 2.20, and 2.25 eV, respectively) display obvious red-shifts compared to that of Mes-TiO 2 (2.83 eV) and Mes-CeO 2 (2.61 eV).The results of this study therefore indicate that the enhanced ability to absorb visible-light of these ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites makes them a promising photocatalyst for solar-driven applications. The surface chemical state of Ce, Ti, and O in all samples was also investigated by XPS analysis.Ce 3d spectra of Mes-CeO 2 and three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites are shown in Fig. 6a.The labels used in identifying Ce 3d XPS peaks were established by Burroughs et al. 42, where and u indicate the spin-orbit coupling 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 , respectively.The peaks denoted as , , and are contributed by CeO 2 , which can be respectively assigned to a mixture of Ce IV (3d 9 4f 2 ) O (2p 4 ), Ce IV (3d 9 4f 1 ) O (2p 5 ) and Ce IV (3d 9 4f 0 ) O (2p 6 ).The same peak assignment is applied to u structures.The /u doublet is ascribed to photoemission from Ce 3 cations 43.Therefore, a mixture of Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states exists on the surface of the Mes-CeO 2 and three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites, which was in good agreement with the studies of Fang et al. 44 and Gao et al. 45.The surface concentrations of Ce 3 for Mes-CeO 2 and three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites evaluated by deconvolution of the XPS spectra are summarized in Table 2, it is worthy to note that Ce 3 concentrations in CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites are much higher Summary of the XPS data for Mes-TiO2, Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0,Mes-CeO2 and commercial P25. Ce 3 /(Ce 3 Ce 4 ) () OOH/OT () than that of Mes-CeO 2 , suggesting that the introduction of TiO 2 into CeO 2 causes the partial reduction of Ce tetravalent cation 46.The binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 in both commercial P25 and Mes-TiO 2 are about 464.4 and 458.4 eV, respectively (Fig. 6b).Meanwhile, the presence of CeO 2 in composites shows no significant influence on the Ti2p binding energies which vary at most within 0.3 eV.This indicates that Ti exists as Ti 4 in all samples, which agreed well with the values reported in the literature 44,47.It can be also observed from Fig. 6b that the Ti 2p XPS peaks became broader after the introduction of CeO 2 , which was attributed to the heterogeneous environments of Ti 4 in CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites 44.The surface Ce/Ti molar ratios derived from XPS for three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites are listed in Table 1, it can be seen that the results are in good agreement with the ratios in initial mixture. Fig. 6c shows the O1s XPS spectra and the deconvolution results of all samples.The O1s XPS spectra appear broad, which can be deconvoluted into three distinct peaks: the one with lower binding energy is assigned to lattice oxygen in the metal oxides, the next is ascribed to chemisorbed oxygen or/and weakly bonded oxygen species, and the third peak at the highest binding energy is due to surface oxygen by hydroxyl species and/or adsorbed water species on the surface 38,45,48.Based on the area integral of the three peaks respectively corresponding to lattice oxygen (OL), chemisorbed oxygen (OC) and surface oxygen (OS) of O 1s photoemissions, the ratio of OC to OT (OT OL OC OS) for all samples was calculated as shown in Table 2.It can be noticed that the introduction of CeO 2 species can effectively enhance the chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite.Because of the ordered mesostructure and high specific surface area, the Mes-TiO 2 possesses higher ratio of OC/OT than that of commercial P25. The photocatalytic activity of Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0,Mes-TiO 2 , Mes-CeO 2 , and commercial P25 was evaluated in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.Fig. 7 shows the evolution of main products (CO and CH 4 ) as functions of irradiation time over all photocatalysts.It can be seen that the yields of CO and CH 4 are increased with the irradiation time for all photocatalysts, and three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than Mes-TiO 2 as well as Mes-CeO 2 , suggesting that CeO 2 addition can enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of pure mesoporous TiO 2 .Moreover, the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites show a much higher level of activity than that of commercial P25.our experiment, the 300 W Xe arc lamp excitation spectrum contains about 50 visible-light which is greatly contributed to the high photocatalytic efficiency for the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.At the same time, the photogenerated electrons in the TiO 2 can drift to the CeO 2 under the inner electric field between CeO 2 and TiO 2 because of the energy band bending in space charge region, it is more helpful for the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in TiO 2 , resulting in the improvement of photocatalytic activity under solar irradiation.Finally, XPS analysis confirms that the CeO 2 addition can greatly enhance the surface chemisorbed oxygen species of the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites, these oxygen species can easily capture electrons and yield surface oxygen radicals with excellent reduction capability.Also, the existence of mixture of Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states on the surface of CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites denote that the partial metal in composites is not fully oxidized, so that Ce 3 can interact with holes and prevent the combination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher quantum efficiency of photocatalytic reaction. In addition, in order to investigate the structural stability of the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites in photocatalytic reaction in the presence of H 2 O, we have characterized the structure of these ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites after photocatalytic test by XRD and TEM analysis.It was found that the structure of these used CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites hasn't changed when compared with that of the corresponding fresh ones, indicating a good structural stability.Fig. 8 shows the XRD patterns and TEM image of the representative Mes-CeTi-1.0 sample after photocatalytic test."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Due to the peculiar composition and structural characteristics, these ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.", "context": "Ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites with 2D hexagonal structure and varied compositions were synthesized through a nanocasting route using ordered mesoporous SBA-15 as the template.Xray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra analysis techniques were used to characterize the samples.It is observed that the obtained CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites have ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructures with high specific surface area and hierarchical porosity.Introduction of CeO 2 species can effectively extend the spectral response from UV to visible area and enhance the surface chemisorbed oxygen of the ordered mesoporous TiO 2 .Due to the peculiar composition and structural characteristics, these ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The photocatalytic activity of Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0,Mes-TiO 2 , Mes-CeO 2 , and commercial P25 was evaluated in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.", "context": "The formation of ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites with different compositions is firstly provided by XRD analysis as shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of the Mes-TiO 2 , Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0, and Mes-CeO 2 .From the lowmagnification TEM images (Fig. 4 left), it can be seen that besides the rodlike morphology, ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructure can be clearly observed for all samples, suggesting thus-prepared materials are well reverse-replica of the template, which is consistent with low-angle XRD results.The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 4 right show the detail structure of the mesopores, and the pore walls are well constituted by metal oxide nanocrystals with a diameter of several nanometers.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns are given in the inset of Fig. 4 left.All shows the diffraction rings, indicating that the metal oxide nanocrystals, as building units of the pore walls, are polycrystalline.It should be noted that the diffraction rings for Mes-CeTi-0.5 are not very clear since the semicrystalline structure, which is in agreement with its wide-angle XRD result. In order to investigate the electronic states of the catalysts, UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) studies were performed on Mes-TiO 2 , Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0, and Mes-CeO 2 (as shown in Fig. 5).For comparison, a commercial titania powers P25 was also measured and plotted in same Figure .Interestingly, the Mes-TiO 2 displays a slight red shift of light absorption with respect to the commercial P25 which absorbs light with wavelength shorter than 400 nm, this is phenomenon may ascribed to its ordered mesoporous structure, enlarged surface area and multiple scatting enable it to harvest light much more efficiently 40.The samples of three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites show spectral response in a broad visible region ( 400-600 nm) owing to the photosentisizing effect of CeO 2 .It is worthy to note that these CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibit a much stronger absorption in both untraviolet and visble-light regions than that of Mes-TiO 2 , this enhanced light-trapping effect is the result of the reflection Textural properties and the energy of band gap (Eg) of Mes-TiO2, Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0, and Mes-CeO2. Ce:Ti molar ratio Ce:Ti molar ratio (XPS) Surface area (m or transmission of the light scattered by the ordered mesopores implanted in the body of CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites, and a similar effect has been verified in literature 32.The band energy gap of above samples could be calculated by using ( h ) n k(h -E g ), where is the absorption coefficient, k is the parameter that related to the effective masses associated with the valence and conduction bands, n is 1 / 2 for a direct transition, h is the absorption energy, and E g is the band gap energy 41.Plotting ( h ) 1/2 versus h based on the spectral response in Fig. 5a give the extrapolated intercept corresponding to the E g value (Fig. 5b).As shown in Table 1, the Mes-TiO 2 exhibits decreased E g value (2.81 eV) with respect to that of commercial P25 (3.10 eV), which is consistent with the DRS result.Moreover, the optical band gap energies of the Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0, and Mes-CeTi-2.0 (2.16, 2.20, and 2.25 eV, respectively) display obvious red-shifts compared to that of Mes-TiO 2 (2.83 eV) and Mes-CeO 2 (2.61 eV).The results of this study therefore indicate that the enhanced ability to absorb visible-light of these ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites makes them a promising photocatalyst for solar-driven applications. The surface chemical state of Ce, Ti, and O in all samples was also investigated by XPS analysis.Ce 3d spectra of Mes-CeO 2 and three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites are shown in Fig. 6a.The labels used in identifying Ce 3d XPS peaks were established by Burroughs et al. 42, where and u indicate the spin-orbit coupling 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 , respectively.The peaks denoted as , , and are contributed by CeO 2 , which can be respectively assigned to a mixture of Ce IV (3d 9 4f 2 ) O (2p 4 ), Ce IV (3d 9 4f 1 ) O (2p 5 ) and Ce IV (3d 9 4f 0 ) O (2p 6 ).The same peak assignment is applied to u structures.The /u doublet is ascribed to photoemission from Ce 3 cations 43.Therefore, a mixture of Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states exists on the surface of the Mes-CeO 2 and three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites, which was in good agreement with the studies of Fang et al. 44 and Gao et al. 45.The surface concentrations of Ce 3 for Mes-CeO 2 and three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites evaluated by deconvolution of the XPS spectra are summarized in Table 2, it is worthy to note that Ce 3 concentrations in CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites are much higher Summary of the XPS data for Mes-TiO2, Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0,Mes-CeO2 and commercial P25. Ce 3 /(Ce 3 Ce 4 ) () OOH/OT () than that of Mes-CeO 2 , suggesting that the introduction of TiO 2 into CeO 2 causes the partial reduction of Ce tetravalent cation 46.The binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 in both commercial P25 and Mes-TiO 2 are about 464.4 and 458.4 eV, respectively (Fig. 6b).Meanwhile, the presence of CeO 2 in composites shows no significant influence on the Ti2p binding energies which vary at most within 0.3 eV.This indicates that Ti exists as Ti 4 in all samples, which agreed well with the values reported in the literature 44,47.It can be also observed from Fig. 6b that the Ti 2p XPS peaks became broader after the introduction of CeO 2 , which was attributed to the heterogeneous environments of Ti 4 in CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites 44.The surface Ce/Ti molar ratios derived from XPS for three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites are listed in Table 1, it can be seen that the results are in good agreement with the ratios in initial mixture. Fig. 6c shows the O1s XPS spectra and the deconvolution results of all samples.The O1s XPS spectra appear broad, which can be deconvoluted into three distinct peaks: the one with lower binding energy is assigned to lattice oxygen in the metal oxides, the next is ascribed to chemisorbed oxygen or/and weakly bonded oxygen species, and the third peak at the highest binding energy is due to surface oxygen by hydroxyl species and/or adsorbed water species on the surface 38,45,48.Based on the area integral of the three peaks respectively corresponding to lattice oxygen (OL), chemisorbed oxygen (OC) and surface oxygen (OS) of O 1s photoemissions, the ratio of OC to OT (OT OL OC OS) for all samples was calculated as shown in Table 2.It can be noticed that the introduction of CeO 2 species can effectively enhance the chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of the CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite.Because of the ordered mesostructure and high specific surface area, the Mes-TiO 2 possesses higher ratio of OC/OT than that of commercial P25. The photocatalytic activity of Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0,Mes-CeTi-2.0,Mes-TiO 2 , Mes-CeO 2 , and commercial P25 was evaluated in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.Fig. 7 shows the evolution of main products (CO and CH 4 ) as functions of irradiation time over all photocatalysts.It can be seen that the yields of CO and CH 4 are increased with the irradiation time for all photocatalysts, and three ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than Mes-TiO 2 as well as Mes-CeO 2 , suggesting that CeO 2 addition can enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of pure mesoporous TiO 2 .Moreover, the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites show a much higher level of activity than that of commercial P25.our experiment, the 300 W Xe arc lamp excitation spectrum contains about 50 visible-light which is greatly contributed to the high photocatalytic efficiency for the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.At the same time, the photogenerated electrons in the TiO 2 can drift to the CeO 2 under the inner electric field between CeO 2 and TiO 2 because of the energy band bending in space charge region, it is more helpful for the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in TiO 2 , resulting in the improvement of photocatalytic activity under solar irradiation.Finally, XPS analysis confirms that the CeO 2 addition can greatly enhance the surface chemisorbed oxygen species of the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites, these oxygen species can easily capture electrons and yield surface oxygen radicals with excellent reduction capability.Also, the existence of mixture of Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states on the surface of CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites denote that the partial metal in composites is not fully oxidized, so that Ce 3 can interact with holes and prevent the combination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a higher quantum efficiency of photocatalytic reaction. In addition, in order to investigate the structural stability of the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites in photocatalytic reaction in the presence of H 2 O, we have characterized the structure of these ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites after photocatalytic test by XRD and TEM analysis.It was found that the structure of these used CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites hasn't changed when compared with that of the corresponding fresh ones, indicating a good structural stability.Fig. 8 shows the XRD patterns and TEM image of the representative Mes-CeTi-1.0 sample after photocatalytic test."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Due to the special composition and structure, the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.", "context": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites with 2D hexagonal structure and varied compositions were synthesized via a simple nanocasting route.XRD, nitrogen sorption, and TEM results reveal that the obtained CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites have ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructures with high specific surface area and hierarchical porosity.Introduction of CeO 2 species to TiO 2 can effectively extend the spectral response from UV to visible area and enhance the surface chemisorbed oxygen species of the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites, which are confirmed by UV-vis and XPS analysis.Due to the special composition and structure, the ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.

Ordered mesoporous silica SBA-15 template with rod-like morphology was synthesized as the reported procedure except enlarging the amount by ten times 39.Ordered mesoporous CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites were synthesized using the hard template method with the help of acetone.In a typical preparation process, a total 12 mmol of TiCl 4 and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O with different Ce/Ti molar ratios (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) in sequence was dissolved into 15 mL of acetone.After the solution became clear, 2 g of SBA-15 hard template was added and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours in a 100 mL beaker, then the mixture was transferred to a clean flat Petri dish (diameter: 8 cm) and the solvent was evaporated.In order to achieve higher loadings, the above dried hybrid powder was calcined at 200 C for 6 h to decompose the metal precursors, and then the impregnation step was repeated, but the amount of precursors was reduced to 2/3 compared to the first step.The resulting samples were calcined in air at 500 C for 4 h with a heating ramp of 1 K min -1 to completely decompose the inorganic precursors.Finally, the silica template was removed using a 2 M NaOH aqueous solution at room temperature and this etching process was repeated three times.The obtained CeO 2 -TiO 2 composites with different initial Ce/Ti molar ratios (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) are denoted as Mes-CeTi-0.5, Mes-CeTi-1.0, and Mes-CeTi-2.0, respectively.For comparison, ordered mesporous TiO 2 (Mes-TiO 2 ) and mesoporous CeO 2 (Mes-CeO 2 ) were also prepared by the same method. Low-angle X-ray diffraction patterns were collected in -2 mode using Rigaku D/MAX-2550VB/PC diffractometer (CuK 1 radiation, 1.5406 A), operated at 40 kV and 200 mA (scanning step: 0.02 per second).Wide-angle XRD patterns were collected in the same mode, but operated at 100 mA.Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were done using a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at -196 C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus.The diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples over a range of 200-800 nm were recorded by a Varian Cary 500 Scan UV-vis system.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out on a RBO upgraded PHI-5000 C ESCA system (Pekin Elmer) using monochromated Al K X-rays (h1486.6 eV) as a radiation at 250 W. All binding energies were calibrated by using the contaminant carbon (C 1S 284.6 eV) as a reference. Photocatalytic activity tests for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O were carried out in a stainless steel reactor with the volume of 1500 ml (as shown in Fig. 1).Catalyst powder (0.10 g) was dispersed on the stainless steel omentum which was fixed in the center of reactor.The bottom of glass wool support was moisturized with 5.0 g of deionized water to maintain saturated water vapor in the reactor, and a Xe arc lamp (300 W) with sunlike radiation spectrum was put at the top of quartz window with the distance of 8 cm, which can irradiate the whole catalyst powder.In order to control the reaction temperature, the Xe lamp was placed in a cold trap and the whole reactor system is in the air circulation.Prior to illumination, the reactor was first purged with the CO 2 H 2 O mixture at 100 mL/min for 2 h and then reduced to 20 mL/min for another 1 h to establish an adsorption-desorption balance, and the gas phase volume concentrations of CO 2 and H 2 O were controlled at about 95.5 and 4.5, respectively.After that, the reactor was tightly closed and the Xe lamp was then switched on to start the experiment.The reaction temperature and pressure were maintained at 30 C and 110KPa, respectively.The gas phase products were taken at various time during the irradiation and analyzed by gas chromatography."}], "operation mode": []}}
