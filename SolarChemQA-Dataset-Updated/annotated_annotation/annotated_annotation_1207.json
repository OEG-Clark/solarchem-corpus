The photocatalytic CO production was further ameliorated by regulating the electronic structure of the 2D Fe-MNS by doping Co ions, achieving a remarkable photocatalytic activity of 1637 lmol g -1 h A1 .This work further supports that the dyesensitized system is an auspicious strategy worth exploring with different catalysts for the development of visible-light-responsive photocatalytic systems."}, {"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "A 300-W Xe lamp (Solar edge 700, set at 100 mW cm A2 ) covered with a 420 nm cut-off filter was used as a light source.", "context": "All the chemical reagents used in this manuscript were analytical grade and used as received without additional purification, and 18.2 MO deionized water was used for the preparation of the aqueous solutions.N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8, Aladdin), ethanol (99.5, Aladdin), 1,4-terephthalic acid (H 2 BDC, 99, Aladdin), triethylamine (TEA, 99.5, Meryer), Fe(NO 3 ) 3 A9H 2 O (99, Aladdin), and Co(NO 3 ) 2 (99, Aladdin), were used as raw materials for the preparation of the 2D Fe-MNS and 2D Co-Fe-MNS samples.Na 2 SO 4 (98, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as an electrolyte precursor.Acetonitrile (greater than99, Aladdin), triethanolamine (TEOA, 98, Aladdin) were used as a solvent and sacrificial reagent, respectively.Ruthenium bipyridine (Ru(bpy) 3 2 , 95, Aladdin) was used as a dye-sensitizer.
