Hydrazine hydrate (8.5 mL) was added dropwise to solution A under stirring to produce solution B, which was heated to 80 C.This temperature was maintained for 24 h to form NG, which was subsequently filtered by centrifugation, washed with deionized water, and dried in a vacuum chamber. CeCl 3 7H 2 O (0.5587 g) and NaOH (4.0 g, 0.1 mol) were dissolved in 20.0 and 100.0 mL of deionized water, respectively.Afterwards, 12 mL of 1.0 mol/L NaOH was added dropwise to the CeCl 3 solution under stirring until bright yellow colour was achieved.NG (0.0278 g) was dispersed in 20 mL of 0.01 mol/L NaOH solution by ultrasonic dispersion for 3 h.The NG dispersed solution was added dropwise to the Ce(OH) 3 suspension solution under continuous stirring.Deionized water was also added to the suspension solution up to the final total volume of 60 mL.The suspension solution was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave that was sealed and maintained at 180 C for 8 h.After the suspension was cooled to room temperature, it was filtered to collect CeO 2 -NG precipitates. Exactly 0.2000 g of CuSO 4 5H 2 O was dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water and diluted to 100 mL, resulting in 0.008 mol L -1 Cu(II) solution.A 0.1 g CeO 2 -NG sample was immersed in 10.0 mL of Cu(II) solution of 0.008 mol L -1 for 5 h under ultrasound to gather the artificial metalloenzyme on CeO 2 -NG photocatalyst by forming a coordination bond between Cu atoms and N atoms on NG frame denoted as CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 .Then, it was rinsed with deionized water at least 3 times, separated with a centrifuge and dried at 60 C in a vacuum for use.For the control tests, NG was immersed in 10.0 mL of Cu(II) solution of 0.008 mol L -1 for 5 h under ultrasound. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was conducted using a photoreactor (Type BL-GHX-V, Shanghai Bilon Instrument Co.

The Raman spectrum of graphene was characterized by three main features, namely, G, D, and 2D modes, each having different physical origins (Fig. 1S, see the supporting materials).The peak at 1598 cm -1 (G band), arising from the emission of zone-centred optical phonons, corresponded with the doubly degenerate E 2g mode of graphite and was related to the coplanar vibration of sp 2 -bonded C atoms.The peak at 1330 cm -1 (D band) was related to the occurrence of defects and disorders.Peaks at 2650 and 2930 cm -1 (2D band) originated from the second-order zone boundary phonons and varies with the number of graphene layers.The intensity ratio of D to G bands (I D /I G 1.767) was very large, reflecting the very high defect density of NG and also confirming N atoms incorporation into graphene.The intensity ratio I D /I G decreased to 1.182 when NG was linked to CeO 2 , displaying the lowered defect density of NG.The observed peaks were assigned to 450 cm -1 for CeO 2 and 455 cm -1 for CeO 2 -NG, respectively.The band at 595 cm -1 was related to the O vacancies because of the presence of Ce 3 in the CeO 2 lattice and defects caused by small size effects 18.The presence of Ce 3 in the CeO 2 lattice and defects were also confirmed by XPS results. Wide-scan XPS spectrum showed that the as-synthesized CeO 2 -NG sample comprised Ce, C, and O elements (Fig. 2S, see the supporting materials), in which C 1s, O 1s and Ce 3d peaks appeared at 284.6, 534, and 900 eV, respectively.The high-resolution XPS spectra of N, C, Ce and Cu elements revealed the presence of both pyridine-like (398.17eV) and pyrrolic (399.10 eV) N atoms within the graphene structure (Fig. 2A).When C atoms within the graphene layers were substituted by N atoms in the form of \"graphitic\" N, the corresponding N 1 s peak was located at 400.53 eV 19.Therefore, N atoms were bonded in the C lattice of graphene.One main peak located at 284.60 eV corresponded with sp 2 -hybridized graphenic C, whereas the 288.38 eV peak was attributed to C bonded to O atoms.Due to the linkage of nitrogen atoms to the frame of grapheme it can be deconvoluted into 5 peaks as shown in Fig. 2B.These peaks were assigned to CC at 284.55 eV, C-O at 286.1 ev, CN at 285.49 eV, C-N at 286.62 eV and O-CO at 288.42 eV 20, respectively.The integrated area of CN is equal to 14.2 and the area of C-N is 2.0 in total area.So the concentration of nitrogen atoms in N-doped grapheme sheets is about 16.2.Fig. 2C shows the XPS spectrum of Ce element, which can be fully described by five spin-orbit doublets (3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 ) and was composed of two structures of Ce 2 O 3 and three structures of CeO 2 .The Ce 3d spectrum can be deconvoluted into 10 peaks when considering spin-orbit coupling.Peaks v 0 , v, v', v\", and v\"' were attributed to Ce 3d 5/2 ionization, whereas u 0 , u, u', u\", and u\"' were assigned to Ce 3d 3/2 ionization.Peaks labelled v, v\", v\"', u, u\", and u\"' belonged to Ce 4 ions, whereas peaks labelled v 0 , v', u 0 , and u' were assigned to Ce 3 ions.These peaks were assigned in Table 1 21222324, in which Ce 4 and Ce 3 coexisted on the surface of the CeO 2 -NG sample.According to ratio of the area assigned to Ce 3 to total area, the percentage of Ce 3 was 38.3, whereas the percentage was 37.4 after photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to methanol (Fig. 5S).This indicates the Ce 3 concentration almost remains constant.Thus, methanol was produced by photo-generated electrons to reduce carbon dioxide during photocatalytic process. Generally, E b at ca. 936.4 eV was assigned to Cu(OH) 2 25,26.The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the Cu 2p region displayed peaks at 934.88 (Cu 2p 3/2 ) and 954.67 (Cu 2p 1/2 ) eV, showing that Cu(II) ions were bonded to N atoms on the graphene frame 26,27.The TEM image revealed that CeO 2 was crystalline whose crystal size was approximately 5-7 nm, in good agreement with the XRD measurements.Lattice fringes can be observed in the magnified images of different crystallites and measure 0.31 nm, corresponding with the interplane distance between the (111) lattice planes of cubic CeO 2 .Selected-area electron diffraction patterns consisted of single spots on diffuse rings (Fig. 3E), indicated that crystal domains were quite small, in agreement with XRD data.In addition, some long fringes belonging to NG sheets can be clearly seen in Fig. 3C.Both Fig. 3B andC show the tight bond between NG and CeO 2 . The reactivities of CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 and CeO 2 -NG samples were tested for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using Na 2 SO 3 as sacrificial agent.After photoreduction, 1 mL of liquid was withdrawn and determined in a gas chromatograph equipped with a hydrogen flame detector.The dependence of methanol yields on irradiation time is presented in Fig. 4. Methanol amounts approached 67.64 mol for CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 catalyst and 0.78 mol for CeO 2 -NG catalyst at 80 min, which corresponded to methanol yields of 507.3 and 5.8 mol g -1 cat. h -1 , 1, respectively.Methanol yield of Cu-artificial enzyme was 65.0-fold that of bare CeO 2 -NG catalyst, indicating the highly catalytic activity of Cu ions as active sites. After that, the catalyst seemed inactive, however, it played the catalytic role of the photoreduction of carbon dioxide again after it was immersed in 10.0 mL Cu(II) solution of 0.008 mol L -1 for 5 h under ultrasound.The reason is not clear at present.Maybe Cu(II) ions adsorbed on NG were desorbed during catalytic process and Cu(II) ions were adsorbed on NG again when it was immersed in Cu(II) solution, resulting in continuous catalytic reduction of CO 2 under irradiation. To elucidate the reaction mechanism of the photosynthesis of methanol, control tests were carried out.Under similar conditions, 250.0 mL solution of 0.1 mol/L NaHCO 3 containing 0.1 mol/L Na 2 SO 3 and 0.1 g CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 artificial enzyme was stirred in the dark for 80 min.Similarly, 0.1 g of bare CeO 2 -NG catalyst was used for dark reaction for 80 min.Results showed that approximately 9 mol of methanol was produced in 0.1 g of CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 artificial enzyme solution, whereas only 0.78 mol of methanol was generated in 0.1 g of bare CeO 2 -NG catalyst solution.These results demonstrated that Cu ions played a key role in converting CO 2 into methanol.Nine mol of methanol can be produced in 20 min, and the amount of methanol almost did not increase after 20 min, indicating that a reaction partner was quickly depleted.When bare CeO 2 -NG catalyst was utilized but no Cu ions were adsorbed onto CeO 2 -NG catalyst, only a miniscule amount of methanol (0.78 mol) was detected after dark reaction for 80 min.From the comparison between methanol yields in CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 artificial enzyme system and that in CeO 2 -NG catalyst system, Cu can be inferred as a critical element in CO 2 reduction to methanol.Another blank test has been conducted in 0.1 mol/L Na 2 S 2 O 3 solution that was bubbled by nitrogen gas for 20 min for the removal of dissolved O 2 and CO 2 in the presence of CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 catalyst under white light irradiation.The detection results showed no methanol was found even though irradiation time lasted for 180 min.It indicated that methanol comes from NaHCO 3 in solution. However, when 1.56 mmol of Cu 2 (0.1 g Cu 2 ) was poured into 250 mL solution of 0.1 mol/L NaHCO 3 containing 0.1 mol/L Na 2 SO 3 , no methanol was detected even if the solution was irradiated for 2 h.For control test, 0.1 g of bare NG was used as catalyst, and no methanol was detected either.However, when 0.1 g of NG was immersed in 10.0 mL of Cu(II) solution of 0.008 mol L -1 for 5 h, Cu(II) adsorbed onto NG produced 0.96 mol of methanol under irradiation for 2 h.This result showed that only Cu(II) coordinated on NG can play a catalytic role in converting CO 2 into methanol, but not Cu(OH) 2 , CuCO 3 , or Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 .Therefore, Cu(II) in coordination state catalysed the reduction of CO 2 to methanol during irradiation (The results of the control tests have been tabulated in supplementary materials). The band gap E g for CeO 2 -NG was 2.86 eV, Eg for CeO 2 was equal to 3.05 eV, corresponding with the absorption onset of ca.433 nm and 406 nm (see Fig. 3S), respectively.The position of conduction and valence bands of CeO 2 -NG nanoparticles can be empirically calculated according to Eq. ((1)): where E e is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV), X is the absolute electronegativity of the atom semiconductor, expressed as the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of the constituent atoms 28, and E g is the band-gap energy of semiconductor.The edge of conduction band (E c ) was estimated as -0.23 V (vs.normal hydrogen electrode, NHE), and the edge of the valence band (E v ) was 2.63 V (vs.NHE).However, from the presented XPS measurements and results, some O vacancies existed on the surface of CeO 2 , and Ce(III) state was not negligible.Therefore, the energies of the conduction and valence bands for Ce 2 O 3 can be theoretically calculated; E c was calculated as -0.55 V and E v was 2.31 V for Ce 2 O 3 .In fact, Shieh et al. measured the positions of conduction and valence bands for CeO 2 using UV photoelectron spectroscopy and calculated E c as -1.02 V (vs.NHE) and E v as 1.53 V (vs.NHE) 29.Thus, the energy of the conduction band for CeO 2 can meet the energetic requirement for the reduction of CO 2 to methanol (E 0 CO 2 CH 3 OH 14 -0:38 V) 30.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to methanol is presented in Fig. 5.

However, when 1.56 mmol of Cu 2 (0.1 g Cu 2 ) was poured into 250 mL solution of 0.1 mol/L NaHCO 3 containing 0.1 mol/L Na 2 SO 3 , no methanol was detected even if the solution was irradiated for 2 h.For control test, 0.1 g of bare NG was used as catalyst, and no methanol was detected either.However, when 0.1 g of NG was immersed in 10.0 mL of Cu(II) solution of 0.008 mol L -1 for 5 h, Cu(II) adsorbed onto NG produced 0.96 mol of methanol under irradiation for 2 h.This result showed that only Cu(II) coordinated on NG can play a catalytic role in converting CO 2 into methanol, but not Cu(OH) 2 , CuCO 3 , or Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 .Therefore, Cu(II) in coordination state catalysed the reduction of CO 2 to methanol during irradiation (The results of the control tests have been tabulated in supplementary materials). The band gap E g for CeO 2 -NG was 2.86 eV, Eg for CeO 2 was equal to 3.05 eV, corresponding with the absorption onset of ca.433 nm and 406 nm (see Fig. 3S), respectively.The position of conduction and valence bands of CeO 2 -NG nanoparticles can be empirically calculated according to Eq. ((1)): where E e is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV), X is the absolute electronegativity of the atom semiconductor, expressed as the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of the constituent atoms 28, and E g is the band-gap energy of semiconductor.The edge of conduction band (E c ) was estimated as -0.23 V (vs.normal hydrogen electrode, NHE), and the edge of the valence band (E v ) was 2.63 V (vs.NHE).However, from the presented XPS measurements and results, some O vacancies existed on the surface of CeO 2 , and Ce(III) state was not negligible.Therefore, the energies of the conduction and valence bands for Ce 2 O 3 can be theoretically calculated; E c was calculated as -0.55 V and E v was 2.31 V for Ce 2 O 3 .In fact, Shieh et al. measured the positions of conduction and valence bands for CeO 2 using UV photoelectron spectroscopy and calculated E c as -1.02 V (vs.NHE) and E v as 1.53 V (vs.NHE) 29.Thus, the energy of the conduction band for CeO 2 can meet the energetic requirement for the reduction of CO 2 to methanol (E 0 CO 2 CH 3 OH 14 -0:38 V) 30.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to methanol is presented in Fig. 5.

The Raman spectrum of graphene was characterized by three main features, namely, G, D, and 2D modes, each having different physical origins (Fig. 1S, see the supporting materials).The peak at 1598 cm -1 (G band), arising from the emission of zone-centred optical phonons, corresponded with the doubly degenerate E 2g mode of graphite and was related to the coplanar vibration of sp 2 -bonded C atoms.The peak at 1330 cm -1 (D band) was related to the occurrence of defects and disorders.Peaks at 2650 and 2930 cm -1 (2D band) originated from the second-order zone boundary phonons and varies with the number of graphene layers.The intensity ratio of D to G bands (I D /I G 1.767) was very large, reflecting the very high defect density of NG and also confirming N atoms incorporation into graphene.The intensity ratio I D /I G decreased to 1.182 when NG was linked to CeO 2 , displaying the lowered defect density of NG.The observed peaks were assigned to 450 cm -1 for CeO 2 and 455 cm -1 for CeO 2 -NG, respectively.The band at 595 cm -1 was related to the O vacancies because of the presence of Ce 3 in the CeO 2 lattice and defects caused by small size effects 18.The presence of Ce 3 in the CeO 2 lattice and defects were also confirmed by XPS results. Wide-scan XPS spectrum showed that the as-synthesized CeO 2 -NG sample comprised Ce, C, and O elements (Fig. 2S, see the supporting materials), in which C 1s, O 1s and Ce 3d peaks appeared at 284.6, 534, and 900 eV, respectively.The high-resolution XPS spectra of N, C, Ce and Cu elements revealed the presence of both pyridine-like (398.17eV) and pyrrolic (399.10 eV) N atoms within the graphene structure (Fig. 2A).When C atoms within the graphene layers were substituted by N atoms in the form of \"graphitic\" N, the corresponding N 1 s peak was located at 400.53 eV 19.Therefore, N atoms were bonded in the C lattice of graphene.One main peak located at 284.60 eV corresponded with sp 2 -hybridized graphenic C, whereas the 288.38 eV peak was attributed to C bonded to O atoms.Due to the linkage of nitrogen atoms to the frame of grapheme it can be deconvoluted into 5 peaks as shown in Fig. 2B.These peaks were assigned to CC at 284.55 eV, C-O at 286.1 ev, CN at 285.49 eV, C-N at 286.62 eV and O-CO at 288.42 eV 20, respectively.The integrated area of CN is equal to 14.2 and the area of C-N is 2.0 in total area.So the concentration of nitrogen atoms in N-doped grapheme sheets is about 16.2.Fig. 2C shows the XPS spectrum of Ce element, which can be fully described by five spin-orbit doublets (3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 ) and was composed of two structures of Ce 2 O 3 and three structures of CeO 2 .The Ce 3d spectrum can be deconvoluted into 10 peaks when considering spin-orbit coupling.Peaks v 0 , v, v', v\", and v\"' were attributed to Ce 3d 5/2 ionization, whereas u 0 , u, u', u\", and u\"' were assigned to Ce 3d 3/2 ionization.Peaks labelled v, v\", v\"', u, u\", and u\"' belonged to Ce 4 ions, whereas peaks labelled v 0 , v', u 0 , and u' were assigned to Ce 3 ions.These peaks were assigned in Table 1 21222324, in which Ce 4 and Ce 3 coexisted on the surface of the CeO 2 -NG sample.According to ratio of the area assigned to Ce 3 to total area, the percentage of Ce 3 was 38.3, whereas the percentage was 37.4 after photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to methanol (Fig. 5S).This indicates the Ce 3 concentration almost remains constant.Thus, methanol was produced by photo-generated electrons to reduce carbon dioxide during photocatalytic process. Generally, E b at ca. 936.4 eV was assigned to Cu(OH) 2 25,26.The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the Cu 2p region displayed peaks at 934.88 (Cu 2p 3/2 ) and 954.67 (Cu 2p 1/2 ) eV, showing that Cu(II) ions were bonded to N atoms on the graphene frame 26,27.The TEM image revealed that CeO 2 was crystalline whose crystal size was approximately 5-7 nm, in good agreement with the XRD measurements.Lattice fringes can be observed in the magnified images of different crystallites and measure 0.31 nm, corresponding with the interplane distance between the (111) lattice planes of cubic CeO 2 .Selected-area electron diffraction patterns consisted of single spots on diffuse rings (Fig. 3E), indicated that crystal domains were quite small, in agreement with XRD data.In addition, some long fringes belonging to NG sheets can be clearly seen in Fig. 3C.Both Fig. 3B andC show the tight bond between NG and CeO 2 . The reactivities of CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 and CeO 2 -NG samples were tested for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using Na 2 SO 3 as sacrificial agent.After photoreduction, 1 mL of liquid was withdrawn and determined in a gas chromatograph equipped with a hydrogen flame detector.The dependence of methanol yields on irradiation time is presented in Fig. 4. Methanol amounts approached 67.64 mol for CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 catalyst and 0.78 mol for CeO 2 -NG catalyst at 80 min, which corresponded to methanol yields of 507.3 and 5.8 mol g -1 cat. h -1 , 1, respectively.Methanol yield of Cu-artificial enzyme was 65.0-fold that of bare CeO 2 -NG catalyst, indicating the highly catalytic activity of Cu ions as active sites. After that, the catalyst seemed inactive, however, it played the catalytic role of the photoreduction of carbon dioxide again after it was immersed in 10.0 mL Cu(II) solution of 0.008 mol L -1 for 5 h under ultrasound.The reason is not clear at present.Maybe Cu(II) ions adsorbed on NG were desorbed during catalytic process and Cu(II) ions were adsorbed on NG again when it was immersed in Cu(II) solution, resulting in continuous catalytic reduction of CO 2 under irradiation. To elucidate the reaction mechanism of the photosynthesis of methanol, control tests were carried out.Under similar conditions, 250.0 mL solution of 0.1 mol/L NaHCO 3 containing 0.1 mol/L Na 2 SO 3 and 0.1 g CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 artificial enzyme was stirred in the dark for 80 min.Similarly, 0.1 g of bare CeO 2 -NG catalyst was used for dark reaction for 80 min.Results showed that approximately 9 mol of methanol was produced in 0.1 g of CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 artificial enzyme solution, whereas only 0.78 mol of methanol was generated in 0.1 g of bare CeO 2 -NG catalyst solution.These results demonstrated that Cu ions played a key role in converting CO 2 into methanol.Nine mol of methanol can be produced in 20 min, and the amount of methanol almost did not increase after 20 min, indicating that a reaction partner was quickly depleted.When bare CeO 2 -NG catalyst was utilized but no Cu ions were adsorbed onto CeO 2 -NG catalyst, only a miniscule amount of methanol (0.78 mol) was detected after dark reaction for 80 min.From the comparison between methanol yields in CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 artificial enzyme system and that in CeO 2 -NG catalyst system, Cu can be inferred as a critical element in CO 2 reduction to methanol.Another blank test has been conducted in 0.1 mol/L Na 2 S 2 O 3 solution that was bubbled by nitrogen gas for 20 min for the removal of dissolved O 2 and CO 2 in the presence of CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 catalyst under white light irradiation.The detection results showed no methanol was found even though irradiation time lasted for 180 min.It indicated that methanol comes from NaHCO 3 in solution. However, when 1.56 mmol of Cu 2 (0.1 g Cu 2 ) was poured into 250 mL solution of 0.1 mol/L NaHCO 3 containing 0.1 mol/L Na 2 SO 3 , no methanol was detected even if the solution was irradiated for 2 h.For control test, 0.1 g of bare NG was used as catalyst, and no methanol was detected either.However, when 0.1 g of NG was immersed in 10.0 mL of Cu(II) solution of 0.008 mol L -1 for 5 h, Cu(II) adsorbed onto NG produced 0.96 mol of methanol under irradiation for 2 h.This result showed that only Cu(II) coordinated on NG can play a catalytic role in converting CO 2 into methanol, but not Cu(OH) 2 , CuCO 3 , or Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 .Therefore, Cu(II) in coordination state catalysed the reduction of CO 2 to methanol during irradiation (The results of the control tests have been tabulated in supplementary materials). The band gap E g for CeO 2 -NG was 2.86 eV, Eg for CeO 2 was equal to 3.05 eV, corresponding with the absorption onset of ca.433 nm and 406 nm (see Fig. 3S), respectively.The position of conduction and valence bands of CeO 2 -NG nanoparticles can be empirically calculated according to Eq.

Ltd., China) in a 250 mL aqueous system under 250 W xenon lamp irradiation in the inner suspension solution.", "context": "Hummers' method was initially adopted to synthesize graphene oxide (GO) as our group has previously synthesized 16.Assynthesized GO (0.1000 g) was ultrasonically dispersed in 25.0 mL of deionized water, and pH was adjusted to 10.0 using ammonium hydroxide (10 mL, 1.0 mol/L).This GO solution was stirred with urea (30.0000 g) dissolved in 250.0 mL of deionized water to produce solution A. Hydrazine hydrate (8.5 mL) was added dropwise to solution A under stirring to produce solution B, which was heated to 80 C.This temperature was maintained for 24 h to form NG, which was subsequently filtered by centrifugation, washed with deionized water, and dried in a vacuum chamber. CeCl 3 7H 2 O (0.5587 g) and NaOH (4.0 g, 0.1 mol) were dissolved in 20.0 and 100.0 mL of deionized water, respectively.Afterwards, 12 mL of 1.0 mol/L NaOH was added dropwise to the CeCl 3 solution under stirring until bright yellow colour was achieved.NG (0.0278 g) was dispersed in 20 mL of 0.01 mol/L NaOH solution by ultrasonic dispersion for 3 h.The NG dispersed solution was added dropwise to the Ce(OH) 3 suspension solution under continuous stirring.Deionized water was also added to the suspension solution up to the final total volume of 60 mL.The suspension solution was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave that was sealed and maintained at 180 C for 8 h.After the suspension was cooled to room temperature, it was filtered to collect CeO 2 -NG precipitates. Exactly 0.2000 g of CuSO 4 5H 2 O was dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water and diluted to 100 mL, resulting in 0.008 mol L -1 Cu(II) solution.A 0.1 g CeO 2 -NG sample was immersed in 10.0 mL of Cu(II) solution of 0.008 mol L -1 for 5 h under ultrasound to gather the artificial metalloenzyme on CeO 2 -NG photocatalyst by forming a coordination bond between Cu atoms and N atoms on NG frame denoted as CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 .Then, it was rinsed with deionized water at least 3 times, separated with a centrifuge and dried at 60 C in a vacuum for use.For the control tests, NG was immersed in 10.0 mL of Cu(II) solution of 0.008 mol L -1 for 5 h under ultrasound. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was conducted using a photoreactor (Type BL-GHX-V, Shanghai Bilon Instrument Co. Ltd., China) in a 250 mL aqueous system under 250 W xenon lamp irradiation in the inner suspension solution.In 250 ml of distilled water containing NaHCO 3 (0.1 mol L -1 ) and 0.1 mol L -1 Na 2 SO 3 as electron donors, 0.1 g of catalyst was dispersed.The suspension solution was purged with CO 2 to remove O 2 for 20 min before switching on the lamp.The suspension solution was magnetically stirred during irradiation.Control experiments were conducted in the dark or under irradiation without catalysts.Blank CH 3 OH was also detected for all tested catalysts before photoreaction.The temperature inside the photoreactor was maintained at ca. 298 K by means of a continuous circulation of water driven by a 50 W freezer."}], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "Under similar conditions, 250.0 mL solution of 0.1 mol/L NaHCO 3 containing 0.1 mol/L Na 2 SO 3 and 0.1 g CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 artificial enzyme was stirred in the dark for 80 min.", "context": "The wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns of NG, CeO 2 , and a CeO 2 -NG sample (raw material mass ratio of NG to CeO 2 was 3.6) depicted the expected peaks perfectly indexed as the face-centred cubic fluorite phase of well-crystallized CeO 2 materials (Fm3 m; JCPDS card No. 34-0394) with lattice constant a b c 5.4141 A (Fig. 1).Diffraction peaks were observed at 2 28.56,33.20, 47.28, 56.64, 58.92, 69.30, and 76.89, which represented the Braggs reflections from the (111), ( 220), ( 220), (311), ( 222), (400), and (331) planes, respectively 17.The average diameters (D) of the as-synthesized CeO 2 particles were calculated as 5.4 nm for CeO 2 -NG sample and 4.6 nm for CeO 2 sample using the Debye-Scherrer equation D K/(Wcos) at a diffraction angle of 28.56(2).The average diameter of CeO 2 on NG sheets was larger than that of single CeO 2 , indicating the existence of NG facilitating the growth of CeO 2 crystals.The calculated d-spacing value was equal to 0.3123 nm based on Braggs Law and attributed to the distance between (111) planes of CeO 2 .The d-spacing value was also comparable with the values obtained using TEM. The Raman spectrum of graphene was characterized by three main features, namely, G, D, and 2D modes, each having different physical origins (Fig. 1S, see the supporting materials).The peak at 1598 cm -1 (G band), arising from the emission of zone-centred optical phonons, corresponded with the doubly degenerate E 2g mode of graphite and was related to the coplanar vibration of sp 2 -bonded C atoms.The peak at 1330 cm -1 (D band) was related to the occurrence of defects and disorders.Peaks at 2650 and 2930 cm -1 (2D band) originated from the second-order zone boundary phonons and varies with the number of graphene layers.The intensity ratio of D to G bands (I D /I G 1.767) was very large, reflecting the very high defect density of NG and also confirming N atoms incorporation into graphene.The intensity ratio I D /I G decreased to 1.182 when NG was linked to CeO 2 , displaying the lowered defect density of NG.The observed peaks were assigned to 450 cm -1 for CeO 2 and 455 cm -1 for CeO 2 -NG, respectively.The band at 595 cm -1 was related to the O vacancies because of the presence of Ce 3 in the CeO 2 lattice and defects caused by small size effects 18.The presence of Ce 3 in the CeO 2 lattice and defects were also confirmed by XPS results. Wide-scan XPS spectrum showed that the as-synthesized CeO 2 -NG sample comprised Ce, C, and O elements (Fig. 2S, see the supporting materials), in which C 1s, O 1s and Ce 3d peaks appeared at 284.6, 534, and 900 eV, respectively.The high-resolution XPS spectra of N, C, Ce and Cu elements revealed the presence of both pyridine-like (398.17eV) and pyrrolic (399.10 eV) N atoms within the graphene structure (Fig. 2A).When C atoms within the graphene layers were substituted by N atoms in the form of \"graphitic\" N, the corresponding N 1 s peak was located at 400.53 eV 19.Therefore, N atoms were bonded in the C lattice of graphene.One main peak located at 284.60 eV corresponded with sp 2 -hybridized graphenic C, whereas the 288.38 eV peak was attributed to C bonded to O atoms.Due to the linkage of nitrogen atoms to the frame of grapheme it can be deconvoluted into 5 peaks as shown in Fig. 2B.These peaks were assigned to CC at 284.55 eV, C-O at 286.1 ev, CN at 285.49 eV, C-N at 286.62 eV and O-CO at 288.42 eV 20, respectively.The integrated area of CN is equal to 14.2 and the area of C-N is 2.0 in total area.So the concentration of nitrogen atoms in N-doped grapheme sheets is about 16.2.Fig. 2C shows the XPS spectrum of Ce element, which can be fully described by five spin-orbit doublets (3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 ) and was composed of two structures of Ce 2 O 3 and three structures of CeO 2 .The Ce 3d spectrum can be deconvoluted into 10 peaks when considering spin-orbit coupling.Peaks v 0 , v, v', v\", and v\"' were attributed to Ce 3d 5/2 ionization, whereas u 0 , u, u', u\", and u\"' were assigned to Ce 3d 3/2 ionization.Peaks labelled v, v\", v\"', u, u\", and u\"' belonged to Ce 4 ions, whereas peaks labelled v 0 , v', u 0 , and u' were assigned to Ce 3 ions.These peaks were assigned in Table 1 21222324, in which Ce 4 and Ce 3 coexisted on the surface of the CeO 2 -NG sample.According to ratio of the area assigned to Ce 3 to total area, the percentage of Ce 3 was 38.3, whereas the percentage was 37.4 after photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to methanol (Fig. 5S).This indicates the Ce 3 concentration almost remains constant.Thus, methanol was produced by photo-generated electrons to reduce carbon dioxide during photocatalytic process. Generally, E b at ca. 936.4 eV was assigned to Cu(OH) 2 25,26.The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the Cu 2p region displayed peaks at 934.88 (Cu 2p 3/2 ) and 954.67 (Cu 2p 1/2 ) eV, showing that Cu(II) ions were bonded to N atoms on the graphene frame 26,27.The TEM image revealed that CeO 2 was crystalline whose crystal size was approximately 5-7 nm, in good agreement with the XRD measurements.Lattice fringes can be observed in the magnified images of different crystallites and measure 0.31 nm, corresponding with the interplane distance between the (111) lattice planes of cubic CeO 2 .Selected-area electron diffraction patterns consisted of single spots on diffuse rings (Fig. 3E), indicated that crystal domains were quite small, in agreement with XRD data.In addition, some long fringes belonging to NG sheets can be clearly seen in Fig. 3C.Both Fig. 3B andC show the tight bond between NG and CeO 2 . The reactivities of CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 and CeO 2 -NG samples were tested for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using Na 2 SO 3 as sacrificial agent.After photoreduction, 1 mL of liquid was withdrawn and determined in a gas chromatograph equipped with a hydrogen flame detector.The dependence of methanol yields on irradiation time is presented in Fig. 4. Methanol amounts approached 67.64 mol for CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 catalyst and 0.78 mol for CeO 2 -NG catalyst at 80 min, which corresponded to methanol yields of 507.3 and 5.8 mol g -1 cat. h -1 , 1, respectively.Methanol yield of Cu-artificial enzyme was 65.0-fold that of bare CeO 2 -NG catalyst, indicating the highly catalytic activity of Cu ions as active sites. After that, the catalyst seemed inactive, however, it played the catalytic role of the photoreduction of carbon dioxide again after it was immersed in 10.0 mL Cu(II) solution of 0.008 mol L -1 for 5 h under ultrasound.The reason is not clear at present.Maybe Cu(II) ions adsorbed on NG were desorbed during catalytic process and Cu(II) ions were adsorbed on NG again when it was immersed in Cu(II) solution, resulting in continuous catalytic reduction of CO 2 under irradiation. To elucidate the reaction mechanism of the photosynthesis of methanol, control tests were carried out.Under similar conditions, 250.0 mL solution of 0.1 mol/L NaHCO 3 containing 0.1 mol/L Na 2 SO 3 and 0.1 g CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 artificial enzyme was stirred in the dark for 80 min.Similarly, 0.1 g of bare CeO 2 -NG catalyst was used for dark reaction for 80 min.Results showed that approximately 9 mol of methanol was produced in 0.1 g of CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 artificial enzyme solution, whereas only 0.78 mol of methanol was generated in 0.1 g of bare CeO 2 -NG catalyst solution.These results demonstrated that Cu ions played a key role in converting CO 2 into methanol.Nine mol of methanol can be produced in 20 min, and the amount of methanol almost did not increase after 20 min, indicating that a reaction partner was quickly depleted.When bare CeO 2 -NG catalyst was utilized but no Cu ions were adsorbed onto CeO 2 -NG catalyst, only a miniscule amount of methanol (0.78 mol) was detected after dark reaction for 80 min.From the comparison between methanol yields in CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 artificial enzyme system and that in CeO 2 -NG catalyst system, Cu can be inferred as a critical element in CO 2 reduction to methanol.Another blank test has been conducted in 0.1 mol/L Na 2 S 2 O 3 solution that was bubbled by nitrogen gas for 20 min for the removal of dissolved O 2 and CO 2 in the presence of CeO 2 -NG-Cu 2 catalyst under white light irradiation.The detection results showed no methanol was found even though irradiation time lasted for 180 min.It indicated that methanol comes from NaHCO 3 in solution. However, when 1.56 mmol of Cu 2 (0.1 g Cu 2 ) was poured into 250 mL solution of 0.1 mol/L NaHCO 3 containing 0.1 mol/L Na 2 SO 3 , no methanol was detected even if the solution was irradiated for 2 h.For control test, 0.1 g of bare NG was used as catalyst, and no methanol was detected either.However, when 0.1 g of NG was immersed in 10.0 mL of Cu(II) solution of 0.008 mol L -1 for 5 h, Cu(II) adsorbed onto NG produced 0.96 mol of methanol under irradiation for 2 h.This result showed that only Cu(II) coordinated on NG can play a catalytic role in converting CO 2 into methanol, but not Cu(OH) 2 , CuCO 3 , or Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 .Therefore, Cu(II) in coordination state catalysed the reduction of CO 2 to methanol during irradiation (The results of the control tests have been tabulated in supplementary materials). The band gap E g for CeO 2 -NG was 2.86 eV, Eg for CeO 2 was equal to 3.05 eV, corresponding with the absorption onset of ca.433 nm and 406 nm (see Fig. 3S), respectively.The position of conduction and valence bands of CeO 2 -NG nanoparticles can be empirically calculated according to Eq. ((1)): where E e is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV), X is the absolute electronegativity of the atom semiconductor, expressed as the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of the constituent atoms 28, and E g is the band-gap energy of semiconductor.The edge of conduction band (E c ) was estimated as -0.23 V (vs.normal hydrogen electrode, NHE), and the edge of the valence band (E v ) was 2.63 V (vs.NHE).However, from the presented XPS measurements and results, some O vacancies existed on the surface of CeO 2 , and Ce(III) state was not negligible.Therefore, the energies of the conduction and valence bands for Ce 2 O 3 can be theoretically calculated; E c was calculated as -0.55 V and E v was 2.31 V for Ce 2 O 3 .In fact, Shieh et al. measured the positions of conduction and valence bands for CeO 2 using UV photoelectron spectroscopy and calculated E c as -1.02 V (vs.NHE) and E v as 1.53 V (vs.NHE) 29.Thus, the energy of the conduction band for CeO 2 can meet the energetic requirement for the reduction of CO 2 to methanol (E 0 CO 2 CH 3 OH 14 -0:38 V) 30.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to methanol is presented in Fig. 5. When CeO 2 -NG nanoparticles were immersed in Cu(II) solution, Cu(II) ions reacted with N atoms on NG to form coordination bonds between Cu and N atoms.The coordinated Cu ions functioned as artificial metalloenzymes to reduce CO 2 to methanol."}]}}
