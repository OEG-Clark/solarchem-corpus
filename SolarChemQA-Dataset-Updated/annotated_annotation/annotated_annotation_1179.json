The photoreduction of CO 2 experiment was carried out in CEL-SPH2N-D9 (CeAulight, China) with a condensate circulating water filter to avoid the photothermal effect.Firstly, 5 mg of the as-synthesized photocatalysts were scattered in 15 mL MeCN and 1 mL water with 3 mL TEOA as a sacrificial agent, ultra-sonicated to form a suspension, and pour into the reaction cell (d 4 cm).In a vacuum reaction system, pure CO 2 gas (80 kPa, 99.999 , Shangyuan Gas) was injected with a 4 C condenser circulation pump.A 300 W xenon arc lamp with AM 1.5 G filter (100 mW/cm 2 ) was used as the light source and vertically placed outside the reactor.Every 1 h, 1.0 mL of reactive gas were taken from the reactor with the online automatic gas sampling system (CEL-GSOA-1).The gas products were detected by gas chromatography (GC-9860) with a flame ionized detector (FID).The retention time of CO and CH 4 are 1.290 and 2.370 min.All photocatalytic data were repeated at least three times.Recycling experiments were performed under similar conditions by using a collected catalyst instead of a fresh catalyst. The electrochemical measurements including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky test were performed on the Zahner electrochemical workstation with standard threeelectrode system.Carbon cloth and photocatalyst-coated glassy carbon as the working electrode for EIS and Mott-Schottky test, graphite rod as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode.0.2 M of Na 2 SO 4 solution and the mixed solution of 0.5 M of KCl solution and 0.01 M of K 3 Fe(CN) 6 /K 4 Fe(CN) 6 with a ratio of 1:1 were used as the electrolyte for Mott-Schottky and EIS test, respectively. The cyclic voltammetry curve was measured on a CHI 730E electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode system with a scan rate of 0.1 V/s.Platinum wire and Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter and refence electrode.The working electrode was ITO coated with samples.The curves were obtained for the electrolyte in MeCN with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M).The inks were prepared by utrasonication of 2 mg samples in a 1.05 mL mixed solution (Nafion: H 2 O: isopropanol 1:10:10) for 30 min and dropping 100 L of the suspension onto the ITO electrode. Transient photocurrent measurements were measured on a CHI 730E electrochemical workstation in a standard three-electrode system.Graphite rod, ITO plate(1 cm 2 ) and Ag/AgCl electrode as counter, working and reference electrode, respectively.Na 2 SO 4 (0.2 M) solution as the electrolyte.Switch light at least 10 recycles. The quantum yield of CO 2 photocatalytic conversion in 5 h can be calculated by following Eqs.( 18) and (19).Two and eight electrons are required to convert CO 2 to CO and CH 4 , respectively 42,43. 2 mole of CO formation mole of photons absorbed by photocatalyst (18) CH4 () 8 mole of CH 4 formation mole of photons absorbed by photocatalyst (19) The number of moles of photons absorbed by photocatalyst (MPAP) during 5 h was calculated by Eq.
