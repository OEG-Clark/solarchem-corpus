Photoreduction CO 2 experiment was conducted in a Teflon-lined stainless reaction chamber with a quartz window at the top for light irradiation 16,42,43.The photocatalyst (43 mg) was spread in the reaction chamber.Prior to the photoreaction, the chamber was evacuated by a mechanical pump.Then, CO 2 (Beijing Beiwen Gas Factory, 99.999 ) bubbled through water was added to the chamber to achieve a pressure of 0.1 MPa.The products formed under full-spectrum irradiation (300 W Xe lamp, Beijing Perfect-Light Technology Co.

Schematic illustration for the fabrication of leaf-branch TiO 2 /CZIF-L photocatalysts by three steps including electrospinning of TiO 2 /PAN fiber, pyrolysis of TiO 2 /PAN fiber, and in-situ growth of ZIF-L on the TiO 2 /C fiber. Meanwhile, the fringes with lattice spaces of 0.35 nm can be indexed to the (101) plane of the anatase TiO 2 phase (Fig. 1D) 44,45.In addition, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping with signals for Ti, C, Co, and Zn elements confirmed the homogeneous distribution of carbon and ZIF-L on the TiO 2 nanofibers (Figs.1E andS3).Similarly, leaf-branch TiO 2 /CCo-ZIF-L and TiO 2 /CZn-ZIF-L were fabricated, respectively (Figs.S4-S7). The composition and phase structure of the obtained TiO 2 /CZIF-L was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD).As shown in Fig. 2A, the XRD pattern of bare TiO 2 displays a tetragonal anatase structure 46,47.After the decoration of ZIF-L (Fig. S8), a superimposition of the patterns for the TiO 2 and ZIF-L without other new diffraction peaks was observed from TiO 2 /CZIF-L.The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) also confirmed the existence of both TiO 2 and ZIF-L in TiO 2 /CZIF-L (Fig. S9).Moreover, a shoulder peak at 804 cm -1 in the spectrum of TiO 2 /C and TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L assigned to the Ti-O-C vibration was observed 48,49.The results indicate that the pyrolysis treatment results in the formation of chemisorption interfaces via Ti-O-C bonding, probably facilitating the charge transfer.In addition, the Raman spectrum was used to identify the existence of carbon (Fig. 2B).Both of TiO 2 /C and TiO 2 /CZIF-L showed two intense bands at 1361 (D-band) and 1575 cm -1 (G-band), corresponding to the disordered or defect carbon and graphitic sp 2 carbon (Fig. 2B), respectively 50.Moreover, the low I D /I G (the intensity ratio of D to G bands) values of 1.01 manifest a distinct degree of graphitization in the TiO 2 / CZIF-L fibers, being favorable for improving conductivity.Besides the peaks for the carbon, the peaks at 146, 357, 509 and 628 cm -1 could be assigned to E g , B 1g , A 1g B 1g and E g of TiO 2 51,52, being consistent with above XRD results. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to investigate the interaction of components in TiO 2 /CZIF-L.The C 1s peak of TiO 2 /C at 284.3 eV, 285.3 and 286.3 eV attributed to sp 2 and sp 3 hybridized carbon (Fig. 2C), highly agreed with the Raman result.The peak at 288.2 eV was assigned to Ti-O-C band 53, probably generated from the strong interaction between carbon and TiO 2 .Fig. 3D showed the Ti 2p XPS spectra, which were deconvoluted by the Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 peaks.For TiO 2 , the Ti 4 state was determined by the binding energies of 457.75 and 463.47 eV for Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 , respectively.In contrast, the two Ti 2p peaks of TiO 2 /C increased to 458.87 and 464.62 eV, further proved well interaction between TiO 2 and C, accorded with the FT-IR results.After further decorating ZnCo-ZIF-L, the binding energies of Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 in the TiO 2 /C ZnCo-ZIF-L fibers showed a positive shift to 458.65 and 464.08 eV.Simultaneously, the observed negative shift of the Co 2p (Fig. 2E) binding energies indicated an electron transfer from TiO 2 to ZIF-L (Figs.S10-S13), being favorable for the fast charge transfer at the interface.Moreover, in comparison to pristine TiO 2 and TiO 2 /C fibers, some new small peaks of TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L located at 462.72 eV and 457.59 eV indicate the presence of Ti 3 bonds, which implies the formation of oxygen vacancy generated by the integration with ZIF-L 54,55.In addition, the CO 2 uptake capability was also evaluated.Compared with bare TiO 2 /C, TiO 2 /CZIF-L exhibits increased CO 2 uptakes of 0.79 mmol g -1 (Fig. 2F), which is attributed to high CO 2 absorbing property (1 mmol g -1 ) of ZIF-L with unique cushion-shaped cavities 56,57. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were conducted to investigate the optical absorption property (Figs.S14 andS15).The TiO 2 displayed a steep absorption edge located at 382 nm assigned to the Ti-O bond 58, while the ZnCo-ZIF-L shell showed strong absorption in the visible light range (450-700 nm) (Fig. 3A).As expected, the TiO 2 / CZnCo-ZIF-L exhibits a significantly extended scale consisting of a visible light absorption band (400-800 nm) and a UV absorption band.In addition, a slight redshift to higher wavelength of 390 nm for steep absorption edge was observed, which is probably attributed to the effective interactions between TiO 2 , carbon, and ZIF-L 49.And, the band gaps of 3.01 eV (TiO 2 ) and 1.89 eV (ZnCo-ZIF-L) were calculated by the Kubelka-Munk (KM) method (Figs.S16 andS17) 59,60.The electron spin resonance (ESR) was utilized to explore the unpaired electrons in photocatalysts (Fig. 3B).Compared with TiO 2 and ZIF-L with a negligible signal peak, the TiO 2 /C and TiO 2 /CZIF-L shows a very strong EPR signal at g 2.002.The result indicated the efficient combination leads to the unpaired electrons trapped on surface oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 , which is consistent with the XPS results.More importantly, after decoration of various ZIF-L, the TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L gave the strongest noted Ti 3 signal (Fig. 3B).These observed results reveal that introduction of ZIF-L enables the alternation of surface states on TiO 2 and generation of defects such as Ti 3 and oxygen vacancy. The amperometric I-t curves under chopped-light illumination were also tested (Fig. 3C).The current density follows the sequence of TiO 2 TiO 2 /C TiO 2 /CZIF-L.In addition, the pure ZnCo-ZIF-L sample shows a relative low photocurrent response (Fig. S18).The result indicated that well-integrated ternary composites extend the light harvest absorption range, improve electron-hole separation, and boost the mobility of the charge carriers.Especially, the growth on ZnCo-ZIF-L and Co-ZIF-L affords remarkable improved current density compared with Zn-ZIF-L, indicating the transition Co ion in the ZIF could probably act as co-catalysis sites for promoting the transient photocurrent response.Based on the triple-exponential fitting of the emission decay curves (Fig. S20), the fluorescence lifetimes followed the sequence of TiO 2 TiO 2 /C TiO 2 /CZn-ZIF-L TiO 2 /CCo-ZIF-L TiO 2 /C ZnCo-ZIF-L, which is in coincide with the trend of PL intensities (Fig. S19).In addition, TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L has the longest excited-state lifetime, which is beneficial for suppressing recombination of electronhole pair in the TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L.To investigate the charge transfer efficiency, the surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy of these photocatalysts were investigated.As shown in Fig. S21, the SPV positive response intensity orders are as follows: TiO 2 TiO 2 /C TiO 2 /CZn-ZIF-L TiO 2 /CCo-ZIF-L TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L, which is in good agreement with the above results.Therefore, the photogenerated charge separation of TiO 2 could be greatly improved after the decoration of ZnCo-ZIF-L.Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) illustrated the TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L (Fig. 3D) exhibited the smallest semicircular diameter compared to TiO 2 /C, TiO 2 /CZn-ZIF-L, and TiO 2 /CCo-ZIF-L (Figs.S21 andS23).The result further confirmed the lowest electron-transfer resistance of TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L, being favorable for the electron-hole generation and separation. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over different catalysts was then evaluated without the addition of any sacrificial reagents.The conversion of main product CO with the function of time as shown in Fig. 4A.The pristine TiO 2 and ZIF-L showed relative low CO production rate of 4.1 and 0.36 mol h -1 g -1 , respectively.A slightly increased CO production rate of 7.8 mol h -1 g -1 was achieved for TiO 2 /C.Obviously, the TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L displays largely improved CO production rate, owing to the efficient visible light harvesting and high CO 2 adsorption/activation capacity of MOF.In contrast to TiO 2 ZnCo-ZIF-L with a CO production rate of 6.6 mol h -1 g -1 , the results illustrated that graphitic carbon with superior electron mobility is favorable for accepting electron transfer between TiO 2 and ZnCo-ZIF-L.In addition, The CO production as a function of reaction time under dark and irradiation conditions on TiO 2 , TiO 2 /C, TiO 2 /CZn-ZIF-L, TiO 2 /CCo-ZIF-L, and TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L.In-situ FT-IR spectra of TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L (B) before (blue curve) and after (red curve) absorption of CO 2 , (C) before (blue curve) and in (red curve) photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.(D) Gas chromatogram and mass spectra of 13 CO (m/z 29) produced over TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L.(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)the mixture of TiO 2 /ZnCo-ZIF-L showed poor CO 2 reduction ability (1.3 mol h -1 g -1 ), further illustrated that the leaf-branch structure would afford abundant exposed active sites and strong electronic coupling for electron-hole separation (Fig. S24).Remarkably, the CO evolution rate of TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L reached 28.6 mol h -1 g -1 (Fig. 4A), higher than those of TiO 2 /CCo-ZIF-L (22.7 mol h -1 g -1 ) and TiO 2 /CZn-ZIF-L (18.7 mol h -1 g -1 ).It can be seen from the results that the bimetallic ZnCo-ZIF exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than the single metal ZIF.In addition, the properties characterization results demonstrated that the combination of both Co 2 and Zn 2 with synergistic effect could enhance the CO 2 adsorption and light-harvesting (Figs.3A,C, S20, and S21).As a result, the synergistic effect leads to an improvement in catalytic performance.As shown in Fig. S27, the H 2 yield in 10 h for the TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L is 3.6 mol g -1 , which is much lower than that of TiO 2 (12.3 mol g -1 ).The result shows that the proton reduction into H 2 is efficiently inhibited on the TiO 2 /C ZnCo-ZIF-L catalyst, being probably related to its higher CO 2 adsorption capacity.In addition, the photogenerated holes were quenched by H 2 O to generate O 2 (Fig. S25). To make a fair comparison, the commercial TiO 2 (P25) was tested.And the CO evolution rate of 0.4 mol g -1 h -1 for P25 was obviously lower than that of the leaf-branch photocatalysts.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L composites for photocatalytic CO production was almost 70 times more than that of P25.Most importantly, the CO selectivity could achieve 99 for TiO 2 /C ZnCo-ZIF-L ( Selectivity of productC () 100 i moles ofC in product mixture total moles ofC produced i , where C i is the mole of carbon species i (CO, CH 4 , C 2 H 4 , and C 2 H 6 ) and H 2 in the products mixture, and C is the mole of total carbon compounds and H 2 produced).In contrast, a mixture of H 2 , CH 4 , CO, C 2 H 6 , and C 2 H 4 was detected for TiO 2 (Figs.S26 andS27).These results indicated that the well integration of ZIF-L and graphitic carbon on TiO 2 would efficiently inhibit the formation of by-product.Subsequently, the in-situ FT-IR was performed to gain an in-depth illustration of high selectivity.As shown in Fig. 4B, a weak band at 2267 cm -1 for the TiO 2 / CZnCo-ZIF-L after absorption of CO 2 was observed, which can be assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibrations of CO 2 molecules adsorbed on Zn/Co ions 616263.It should be noted that the metal sites in ZIF-L acting as Lewis acid is favorable for binding and activating the polar carbon-oxygen bonds of CO 2 , implying the existence of different active centers for the activation of CO 2 between TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L and TiO 2 .Moreover, in-situ FT-IR also was used to monitor the photocatalysis process.Before photocatalytic reaction, the monodentate , 1341, 1651 cm -1 ) and bicarbonate (HCO 3 2-, 1238, 1396, and 1420 cm -1 ) was observed for TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L (Fig. 4C).After illumination, two new peaks at 1356 and 1525 cm -1 assigned to COO -stretching appeared 646566.It should be noted that the formation of COOH is an important intermediate for the formation of CO.The results illustrate that the Lewis acid sites in ZIF-L are favorable for adsorption/activation of CO 2 into COOH, contributing to the remarkable CO selectively. The 13 CO 2 isotope-labeling experiments and other control tests were also conducted (Fig. 4D).As summarized in Table S1, the results illustrated the products (CO and CH 4 ) are only detected for the TiO 2 /C ZnCo-ZIF-L and ZnCo-ZIF-L with CO 2 under light irradiation, confirming the CO is produced by CO 2 over TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L and ZnCo-ZIF-L photocatalyst.In addition, the signals of the mass spectrum showed that the peak at m/z 29 can be attributed to 13 CO, firmly testifying the produced CO generated from CO 2 reduction but not from impurities or any other carbon source.The photocatalytic stability of TiO 2 /CZIF-L was examined upon cycled photoreactions.Only a slight decrease in CO generation was observed after three cycles (Fig. S28), illustrating the TiO 2 /CZIF-L based fibrous mat can be easily reused without losing activity.In addition, no obvious change of XRD patterns, SEM and HRTEM images, and Raman spectra (Figs.S29-S32) after three cycles were observed, proving its high stability.These results thus illustrate that the fabricated semiconductor/carbonMOF composites can serve as promising photocatalysts toward CO 2 reduction with highly efficient conversion and remarkable selectivity, as well as high recyclability. The theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the electronic structure of TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L (Fig. S33).As shown in Fig. 5C, the partial density of states (PDOS) illustrated that the forbidden zones of both TiO 2 and ZIF-L in TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L became narrower compared with individual TiO 2 and ZIF-L (Figs. 5A-C, and S34), which was probably attributed to their conjugation with carbon and the existence of electronic coupling.Afterward, the energy levels of the conduction band minimum (E CBM ) and valence band maximum (E VBM ) for TiO 2 and ZIF-L, together with the Fermi level of carbon were calculated (Figs.S35 andS36).The calculated band gap energies for TiO 2 and ZnCo-ZIF-L were 3.036 eV and 1.808 eV, being consistent with experimental results (Figs.S16 andS17).Most importantly, the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB) of TiO 2 were respectively higher and lower than the corresponding bands of ZIF-L, indicating the dual excitation paths in TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L with a Z-scheme heterojunction (Fig. 5D).Thus, under light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons on the TiO 2 migrate to the VB of the ZIF-L via an electron shuttle carbon, being favorable for the electrons further exciting to the CB of ZIF-L for efficient CO 2 reduction to CO.It should be noted that the electron-hole pairs cannot be effectively separated for the type I heterojunction TiO 2 ZnCo-ZIF-L photocatalyst (Fig. S37) because both electrons and holes will accumulate at the CB and the VB levels of ZIF-L 67,68, is different from the electron transfer path of TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L system.The reaction pathways of CO 2 reduction to CO were also shown in Fig. 5E and Equations 69707172: where the asterisks denote catalytically active sites.The CO 2 is initially adsorbed on the Lewis acid centers in ZIF-L and activated to COOH intermediate.The formation of COOH as the critical intermediate for generation CO is then reduced to CO intermediate.Finally, the CO adsorbed on the Lewis acid centers is converted into CO efficiently.In addition, the calculated adsorption energy of CO on TiO 2 /CZnCo-ZIF-L was -1.08 eV, which was clearly lower than that on TiO 2 (-3.21 eV) and ZnCo-ZIF-L (-2.23 eV) (Fig. 5F).The results thus indicated that the binding energy of CO adsorbed on the TiO 2 /CZIF-L is too weak and the CO could be easily desorbed from the active sites, contributing to a high CO selectivity."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xe lamp", "source": "The products formed under full-spectrum irradiation (300 W Xe lamp, Beijing Perfect-Light Technology Co.
