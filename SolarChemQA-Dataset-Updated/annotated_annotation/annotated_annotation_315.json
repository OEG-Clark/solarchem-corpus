Diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) of the samples were recorded on a Varian Cary-500 spectrophotometer.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS system with a monochromatic Al-Ka source and a charge neutralizer.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300 E electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer at 77 K.In situ CO-adsorbed FTIR experiments were carried out on a Nicolet 670 FTIR spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm A1 and 32 scans.FTIR experiments were performed in a home-made IR cell in conjunction with a vacuum system. 23,41he catalyst powders were first pressed into self-supporting disks (18 mm diameter, 20 mg), and then each disk was placed in a sample cell, which allowed the disk to move vertically along the cell tube.Prior to the FTIR measurements, the disks were treated under a dynamic vacuum (10 A4 Torr) at 473 K for 2 h.After cooling the disks to room temperature, different contents of CO were introduced into the cell via the septum with a syringe.The infrared spectra of both the solid sample and the gas phase were recorded regularly. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was performed in a gassolid heterogeneous reaction mode under atmospheric pressure at ambient temperature.A 40 ml Schlenk flask with a silicone rubber septum was used as a reactor.The loading mass of the photocatalyst sample was 20 mg.This system was evacuated by a mechanical pump and filled with pure CO 2 gas.The evacuationfilling operation was repeated three times.A bar of CO 2 and 6 ml of liquid water were introduced finally with a syringe via the septum.A 300 W commercial Xe lamp was used as an irradiation resource and vertically placed outside the reactor.The temperature of the reactor was kept at 298 K with an electronic fan.After 4 h of irradiation, 0.5 ml of reactive gas was taken from the reactor with a syringe and analyzed by a GC-7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and a chromatographic column (GASPRO). Indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass pieces were used for preparation of the working electrode, which was cleaned in turn by sonication in cleanout fluid, acetone and ethanol for 10 min.5 mg of photocatalyst powder was dispersed into 0.5 ml of dimethylformamide under sonication for 6 h to form a slurry.The slurry was spread onto the conductive surface of the ITO glass to form a photocatalyst film with an area of 0.25 cm 2 .The uncoated parts of the ITO glass were isolated with epoxy resin.The photocurrent was measured by a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell.A platinum foil counter electrode, a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as reference, and the working electrode were immersed in a sodium sulfate electrolyte solution (0.2 M) and irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (l 320-780 nm).The light/dark short circuit photocurrent response was recorded with a BAS Epsilon workstation.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was determined on a ZENNIUM electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Germany) and operated in a frequency range of 200 kHz to 5 mHz at an amplitude of 10 mV in DC potential after a 10 min delay."}]}}
