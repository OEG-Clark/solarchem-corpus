The Cu/CeO 2-x NPs were also prepared by the similar hydrothermal method as CeO 2-x NPs.Typically, 0.1 g of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O and different amount of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 5H 2 O were dissolved in 15 mL of deionized water and treated under the same hydrothermal and thermalreduction conditions as pure CeO 2-x NPs.The obtained samples were denoted as Cu/CeO 2-x -y, here y represents the mole ratio of Cu(NO Rigaku D/Max 2200PC X-ray diffractmeter was used to record X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the samples.The measurement was operated at room temperature under the Cu K radiation with scanning rate of 4min -1 .Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected through a field emission Hitachi S-4800.A JEM-2100F field emission TEM was operated at 200 kV to obtain the images of Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns.Ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were recorded from 800 to 200 nm by a UV-3101 PC Shimadzu spectroscope (BaSO 4 as the reference standard material).With the excitation wavelength of 330 nm, Hitachi F-4500 was used to analyze the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was obtained on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with multichannel detector, Al K radiation as excitation source and C1s at 284.6 eV as a signal calibrating standard of binding energy values.Time resolved fluorescence spectra were test on the machine of Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 spectrometer under 420 nm excitation of deuterium lamp.DXR Raman microscope was used to obtain Raman spectra under the excitation (532 nm).In-situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were detected in N 2 and CO 2 by MCT detector (Nicolet iS10).The carbon isotope analysis is performed on a high resolution Nu Evolution Stable Isotope Ratio Mass Sepctrometer with ion source emission current of 2.6 mA. Electrochemical measurements were conducted on a CHI660A electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode cell.Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) deposited with photocatalysts, graphite carbon paper and Ag/AgCl act as working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively.The electrolyte was 0.2M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution.The preparation process of working electrodes by electrophoretic deposition as follows:sample powder (20 mg) and iodine (40 mg) were mixed and well milled in an agate mortar, then well-dispersed in acetone (30 mL).Thus the plating solution was obtained.At a potentiostat bias of 10 V for 10 min, a thin film of the sample was uniformly deposited on FTO and then calcined in a drying oven at 423 K for 2 h.During the electrochemical measurement, the coated area of all the samples was controlled at 1 cm 2 .Nyquist plots were tested in dark with the bias voltage of -0.4 V versus Ag/AgCl.With irradiation from a 300 W of Xenon-arc lamp, the transient photocurrent densities were obtained at 0.3 V versus Ag/AgCl. The light source was a 300 W of Xenon-arc lamp from Aulight CEL-HX, Beijing.The gas products (CO, CH 4 ) were analyzed by GC-2060 gas chromatograph (FID detector), which is equipped with a 5A molecular column and a TDX-01 packed column.The photocatalysis test was conducted typically as follows: 50 mg of photo-catalyst was uniformly dispersed on a 2.5 cm2.5 cm glass, treated at 423 K for 2 h in air and put at the bottom of a 500 mL sealed glass reactor equipped with an optical quartz window at the top.The temperature of reactor was kept at 298 K by cooling water circulation.To exclude the possible influence of contaminants, the sealed reactor was full of N 2 and under the irradiation of Xe lamp for 2 h.Subsequently, CO 2 (99.99 of purity) passed through a water bubbler was filled in the reactor and stabilized for 30 min,.During the photoreaction, 1 mL of sample gas was continually extracted from the reactor per hour and analyzed on GC based on external standard method.Before each (or cycle) activity test, the photocatalyst was first heat-treated at 423 K for 2 h, removing the organic impurities and adsorbed carbon species on catalysts' surface."}, {"llm generation": "Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1", "source": "And there was trace 13 CH 4 having been detected, further implying the main product on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is CO.", "context": "In this work, the main gas product of CO 2 reduction was CO.Trace CH 4 was also detected.The unit of CO yield was mol g -1 . At first, the similar catalytic experiments were carried out under the same conditions without light irradiation or photocatalysts.No products were detected, hinting that the product of CO was derived from CO 2 photoreduction.To eliminate the impact of containments, the carbon isotope analysis ( 13 C) was performed and the result is shown in Figure 1.The relative content of 13 CO is about 93, which indicates that the influence of containments could be negligible.And there was trace 13 CH 4 having been detected, further implying the main product on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is CO.As displayed in Figure 1 The 13 C isotope analysis spectrum of the products on Cu/CeO 2-x after 2 h Xenon-light irradiation under humid CO 2 atmosphere.Figure 2a, little CO was detected on pure CeO 2 , and trace CO was produced on CeO 2-x .On Cu/CeO 2-x , the CO is produced remarkably, indicating that Cu-introduction contributes greatly in CO 2 photoreduction reaction.With the increase of Cu content, the CO 2 photocatalytic activity decreased.Among the as-obtained catalysts, the sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the best CO 2 photoreduction activity and the CO yield is about 8.25 mol g -1 under 5 h irradiation, which is about 26 times higher than that on CeO 2-x (Figure 2a).As is shown in Figure S1, the CO generation decreases in per hour irradiation, which possibly results from the untimely conversion of intermediate or delayed desorption of CO from the active sites, resulting in the gradual deactivation of the active sites.After a mild heat treatment at 448 K for 2 h in N 2 flowing, the adsorbed CO or intermediates on the active sites was removed and the photocatalytic activity of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 was recovered.And after several cycles with heat treating after each cycle, Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 still maintained the original high activity, demonstrating that the as-prepared catalysts have good chemical stability (Figure 2b).To understand the relationship between the O vacancies and catalytic stability of Cu/CeO 2-x in more detail, the photocatalytic activity of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 was retested for five cycles, during which the catalyst was just swept by N 2 gas at room temperature after each cycle.As displayed in Figure 2c, the yield of CO shows slight decline, implying that the adsorbents on the catalyst surface is the main reason of the decreased CO yield by covering catalytic active sites.The result clearly illustrates that the introduction of Cu can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic activity of CeO 2-x in CO 2 reduction and also helps to maintain the photocatalytic stability of the catalyst.(denoted as Cu/CeO 2-x ).TEM iamges show that CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x composites are both in the morphology of nanoparticles of below 50 nm in particle size (Figure 4a and 4b).HRTEM image gives the lattice spacing values of 0.28, 0.31 and 0.18 nm, which are indexed to the exposed CeO 2 (1 0 0), CeO 2 (1 1 1), and (2 0 0) facets of Cu, respectively.The SAED pattern shows clear and highly regular diffraction spots and diffraction rings, indicating the polycrystalline feature of the as-obtained samples.According to the elements mapping of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 (Figure S11), Cu is uniformly dispersed in the catalyst. XPS spectra were collected to investigate the chemical composition and chemical state on the surface of the asobtained samples.The survey spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 (Figure S3) shows that the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 has Cu, Ce and O atoms.The Ce 3d spectra are rather complicated as shown in Figure 5a.The peaks located at 916.9, 907.4,901.4 eV and 898.4,889.1 and 882.7 eV (spinorbit splitting peaks) are corresponding to Ce 4 final states: 3d 9 4f 1 , 3d 9 4f 2 and 3d 9 4f 0 , respectively 15 .There are two peaks at 903.4 and 899.4 eV, which attributing to Ce 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 of Ce 3 with 3d 9 4f 1 and 3d 9 4f 2 final states, respectively 5 , indicating that Ce species exist with mixed valences of Ce 3 and Ce 4 in Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1.The Cu 2p XPS spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is shown in Figure 5b, which contains two peaks at 932.4 and 952.6 eV assigned to Cu 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Cu 0 (or Cu ), respectively.Furthermore, the O 1s spectra of the samples (Figure 6) show two peaks (529.5, 531.6 eV) corresponding to the O atoms in CeO 2 lattice and the adsorbed oxygen on its surface.After Ar ion beam etching, the contents of lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen on the subsurface of CeO 2 and Cu/CeO 2- x -0.1 are found to be different from those on their surface.As displayed in Figure 6 and Table S1, the content of adsorbed oxygen on their subsurface is lower than that on their surface, which suggests there are more oxygen vacancies on their surface.And as shown in Figure S9 and Table S2, the atom content of Cu is stable, but the ratio of Cu/(CeCu) decreases with Ar ion etching time. Combining the results of XRD and TEM, Cu may not only for clusters on ceria surface, but also been doped in ceria lattice.And the Cu atom content on its surface is higher than that on its subsurface.Compared with CeO 2 , the content of adsorbed oxygen is much higher on the surface and subsurface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1, implying that Cu introduction has increased the concentration of O vacancies in CeO 2-x via charge transfer and activated adsorbed oxygen 16 .This phenomenon is similar with Wang's result 12b .From the XPS results, O vacancies are verified to exist on the surface of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 but after the introduction of Cu species (Cu 0 or Cu ), the change of O vacancy amount cannot been verified.To further confirm the valences of Cu species and the O vacancies, Raman spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 was collected and shown in Figure 5c.No peaks appeared at 220 and 290 cm -1 corresponding to Cu 2 O and CuO, suggesting that Cu exists as Cu 17 .In addition, a hump peak is observed in the Raman spectrum, which can be fitted into two peaks.According to The bands at 458 cm -1 and 592 cm -1 are respectively assigned to F 2g Raman active mode of cubic CeO 2 and O vacancies 18 .Compared to Raman spectra of CeO 2-x , the intensity of peak at 458 cm -1 decreases and the peak at 592 cm -1 is intensified after the introduction of Cu, suggesting that the Cu incorporation has led to the increased disorder of CeO 2 and more O vacancies has been produced in CeO 2 .The half width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the peak at 458 cm -1 is about 30.2 cm -1 . According to the literatures 18a, 19 , the O vacancy concentration on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 can be calculated to be about 4.1810 21 cm -3 .UV-Vis diffuse absorbance spectra were recorded and displayed in Figure 7a.Compared with CeO 2-x , all the Cu/CeO 2-x samples show an enhanced and red-shifted absorption.Among them, the sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the strongest UV-Visible light absorption.The result indicates that the introduction of Cu can greatly improve the photo-absorption within UV-Visible spectrum, which favors the Xenon-light-induced photo-catalytic activity.Moreover, there is a shoulder peak at about 430 nm, which may be consistent with the defect energy level.The shoulder peak became broadened and intensified after the addition of Cu, implying the increased defect concentration by Cu incorporation in CeO 2 .Photoluminescence (PL) spectra are displayed in Figure S7.All the catalysts show a broad peak about 460 nm, which extends to 700 nm and a small peak at about 560 nm.The emission intensity might associate with the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes while its emission photo energy might correspond to the band-gap.The sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the lowest PL intensity, which indicates the largely facilitated charge transfer between CeO 2 and Cu species and the effectively suppressed electron-hole recombination.This result was further confirmed by the transient photoluminescence lifetime analysis under 420 nm excitation of deuterium lamp (Figure 7b and Table S3).The average carriers' lifetime in CeO 2-x is about 74.87 ns and that in Cu/CeO 2-x is about 266.04 ns, indicating that Cu can extremely prolong the carriers' lifetime in CeO 2-x .These findings are in well accordance with the catalytic activity as shown above.EIS Nyquist plots of the as-obtained samples in dark demonstrate that Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is much higher conductive than CeO 2 and CeO 2-x (Figure 7c), suggesting that it can efficiently promote photo-excited carriers' separation and greatly accelerate the transmission of interfacial charger.The photocurrent responses of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 were further investigated for 10 on-off cycles.An instantaneous and uniform photocurrent response can be observed accompanying the light on and off process (Figure 7d).Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows much higher photocurrent intensity than CeO 2 and CeO 2-x , indicating its most efficient electron-hole separation /transfer and highest photoreduction activity.These photoelectrochemical results are well in accordance with the catalytic activity test. In order to further certify the role of Cu in stabilizing O vacancies, the O 2p XPS and Raman spectra were used to check the changes of O vacancies.O 2p XPS spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions are shown in Figure 8a.The peak of the adsorbed O (533.1 eV) on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 has kept unchanged after the reaction (irradiation for 5 h in wet CO 2 atmosphere).Raman shift of O vacancies has changed a little after 5 h CO 2 photoreduction process, which indicates that O vacancies are basically stable dur ing the process of photocatalysis (Figure 8b andS6).The half width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the peak at 458 cm -1 is narrowed to about 24.7 cm -1 .According to the same calculation method used above, the calculated O vacancy concentration on the surface of used Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is about 3.40 10 21 cm -3 , which is still in the same magnitude with that on the fresh sample surface.Based on the above all evidences, we can conclude that Cu presence benefits the stabilization of O vacancies in CeO 2-x. with CO 2 ; the other possible way is to oxidize Ce 3 to Ce 4 . 23But these speculations are still very difficult to be proved by experimental methods. To further understand the reaction path of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction on the catalysts, in-situ FT-IR spectroscopy was used to investigate the adsorption, activation and conversion process of CO 2 on Cu/CeO 2-x and CeO 2-x .The FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 swept by N 2 after CO 2 and H 2 O adsorption in dark were collected and shown in Figure 9b, which indicates that several carbonates have formed on the samples' surface after the humid CO 2 adsorption.The peak at about 1200 cm -1 corresponds to hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -) 24 , and those at about 1367 and 1280 cm -1 are corresponding to monodentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) 25 .The others at about 1470 cm -1 and 2000-2350 cm -1 are corresponding to monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-) 5,26 and the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 27 , respectively.Additionally, the peaks at about 1963, 1670 and 1640 cm -1 are assigned to bending vibration of carbonxylate (CO 2 -) 21,28 .The existence of -CO 3 2-can be attributed to the formation of carbonic acid or/and the adsorbed CO 2 on the catalyst surface 20 21 .It should also be noted that the absorption peaks of CO 2 -, m-CO 3 2-and b-CO 3 2-on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 have shifted to higher wavenumbers, owing to the intensified surface basicity after Cu introduction. 21igure 10 shows the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 collected every 5 min under irradiation in CO 2 and H 2 O. Clearly, several positive and negative peaks can be found during the photocatalytic reaction, which correspond to the species formation and consumption, respectively.The negative peak at about 2000-2350 cm -1 is corresponding to the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 29 , and those at about 1963, 1670 and 1640 are corresponding to the bending vibration of carbonxylate (CO 2 -) 26,28,29 .The positive peaks at about 1604, 1485, 1367 and 1186 cm -1 are attributed to formate (HCOO -), monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-), bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) and hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -), respectively 24,25,28 .Almost all the bands of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 show much stronger intensity and moresignificant changes than those of CeO 2-x .These results suggest that during the photocatalytic reduction, CO 2 and CO 2 -were consumed and the intermediates such as carbonate species, HCO 3 -and HCOO -were generated more quickly on Cu/CeO 2-x than CeO 2-x .Notably, a new peak at 1735 cm -1 can be observed and corresponding to chelating-bridged carbonate (c-CO 3 2-), which implies that the increased amounts of Ce 3 and O vacancies will provide more adsorption sites for CO 2 and influences the chemical bonding of adsorbed CO 2 molecules 28 .Moreover, a clear signal of CO can be found on Cu/CeO 2- x -0.1, which cannot be observed on CeO 2-x , indicating the accelerated conversion of the intermediates to the final product, CO, and the increased yield of CO on catalyst's surface.And the CO peak is located at about 2160 cm -1 , which is in between the absorption peak at about 2127 cm -1 of CO-Ce 3 and the one at about 2110/2092 cm -1 of CO-Cu / Cu 0 . 5,25,27,30,31 hus CO is supposed to be generated at the interface of Cu and CeO 2-x .Therefore, the introduction of Cu has greatly increased amount of active sites and elevated CO 2 conversion rate, i.e. enhanced the photocatlaytic activity of the catalyst on CO 2 reduction.Compared with the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1, the peak intensity of carbonates and HCOO -all increased and accumulated on the surface of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 during the photocatalytic reaction, suggesting the possible reaction pathway on these two samples may be similar (CO 2 CO 2 -HCOO - CO).In contrast, the negative peaks of CO 2 -on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 changed more significantly than that on the surface of CeO 2-x , indicating that Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 might have provided more active sites or lowered the adsorption energy of CO 2 thus make CO 2 adsorption and reduction much easier.According to the different absorption bands of CO 2 -, the different adsorption modes of CO 2 on the catalysts' surface is believed to be crucial in CO 2 reduction. 21,28,31However, the bands belonging to carbonates on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 are also of enhanced intensity, manifesting the continuous accumulation of carbonates on its surface and the gradual deactivation of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "Cu/CeO 2-x", "source": "On Cu/CeO 2-x , the CO is produced remarkably, indicating that Cu-introduction contributes greatly in CO 2 photoreduction reaction.", "context": "In this work, the main gas product of CO 2 reduction was CO.Trace CH 4 was also detected.The unit of CO yield was mol g -1 .

According to the literatures 18a, 19 , the O vacancy concentration on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 can be calculated to be about 4.1810 21 cm -3 .UV-Vis diffuse absorbance spectra were recorded and displayed in Figure 7a.Compared with CeO 2-x , all the Cu/CeO 2-x samples show an enhanced and red-shifted absorption.Among them, the sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the strongest UV-Visible light absorption.The result indicates that the introduction of Cu can greatly improve the photo-absorption within UV-Visible spectrum, which favors the Xenon-light-induced photo-catalytic activity.Moreover, there is a shoulder peak at about 430 nm, which may be consistent with the defect energy level.The shoulder peak became broadened and intensified after the addition of Cu, implying the increased defect concentration by Cu incorporation in CeO 2 .Photoluminescence (PL) spectra are displayed in Figure S7.All the catalysts show a broad peak about 460 nm, which extends to 700 nm and a small peak at about 560 nm.The emission intensity might associate with the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes while its emission photo energy might correspond to the band-gap.The sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the lowest PL intensity, which indicates the largely facilitated charge transfer between CeO 2 and Cu species and the effectively suppressed electron-hole recombination.This result was further confirmed by the transient photoluminescence lifetime analysis under 420 nm excitation of deuterium lamp (Figure 7b and Table S3).The average carriers' lifetime in CeO 2-x is about 74.87 ns and that in Cu/CeO 2-x is about 266.04 ns, indicating that Cu can extremely prolong the carriers' lifetime in CeO 2-x .These findings are in well accordance with the catalytic activity as shown above.EIS Nyquist plots of the as-obtained samples in dark demonstrate that Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is much higher conductive than CeO 2 and CeO 2-x (Figure 7c), suggesting that it can efficiently promote photo-excited carriers' separation and greatly accelerate the transmission of interfacial charger.The photocurrent responses of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 were further investigated for 10 on-off cycles.An instantaneous and uniform photocurrent response can be observed accompanying the light on and off process (Figure 7d).Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows much higher photocurrent intensity than CeO 2 and CeO 2-x , indicating its most efficient electron-hole separation /transfer and highest photoreduction activity.These photoelectrochemical results are well in accordance with the catalytic activity test. In order to further certify the role of Cu in stabilizing O vacancies, the O 2p XPS and Raman spectra were used to check the changes of O vacancies.O 2p XPS spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions are shown in Figure 8a.The peak of the adsorbed O (533.1 eV) on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 has kept unchanged after the reaction (irradiation for 5 h in wet CO 2 atmosphere).Raman shift of O vacancies has changed a little after 5 h CO 2 photoreduction process, which indicates that O vacancies are basically stable dur ing the process of photocatalysis (Figure 8b andS6).The half width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the peak at 458 cm -1 is narrowed to about 24.7 cm -1 .According to the same calculation method used above, the calculated O vacancy concentration on the surface of used Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is about 3.40 10 21 cm -3 , which is still in the same magnitude with that on the fresh sample surface.Based on the above all evidences, we can conclude that Cu presence benefits the stabilization of O vacancies in CeO 2-x. with CO 2 ; the other possible way is to oxidize Ce 3 to Ce 4 . 23But these speculations are still very difficult to be proved by experimental methods. To further understand the reaction path of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction on the catalysts, in-situ FT-IR spectroscopy was used to investigate the adsorption, activation and conversion process of CO 2 on Cu/CeO 2-x and CeO 2-x .The FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 swept by N 2 after CO 2 and H 2 O adsorption in dark were collected and shown in Figure 9b, which indicates that several carbonates have formed on the samples' surface after the humid CO 2 adsorption.The peak at about 1200 cm -1 corresponds to hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -) 24 , and those at about 1367 and 1280 cm -1 are corresponding to monodentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) 25 .The others at about 1470 cm -1 and 2000-2350 cm -1 are corresponding to monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-) 5,26 and the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 27 , respectively.Additionally, the peaks at about 1963, 1670 and 1640 cm -1 are assigned to bending vibration of carbonxylate (CO 2 -) 21,28 .The existence of -CO 3 2-can be attributed to the formation of carbonic acid or/and the adsorbed CO 2 on the catalyst surface 20 21 .It should also be noted that the absorption peaks of CO 2 -, m-CO 3 2-and b-CO 3 2-on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 have shifted to higher wavenumbers, owing to the intensified surface basicity after Cu introduction. 21igure 10 shows the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 collected every 5 min under irradiation in CO 2 and H 2 O. Clearly, several positive and negative peaks can be found during the photocatalytic reaction, which correspond to the species formation and consumption, respectively.The negative peak at about 2000-2350 cm -1 is corresponding to the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 29 , and those at about 1963, 1670 and 1640 are corresponding to the bending vibration of carbonxylate (CO 2 -) 26,28,29 .The positive peaks at about 1604, 1485, 1367 and 1186 cm -1 are attributed to formate (HCOO -), monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-), bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) and hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -), respectively 24,25,28 .Almost all the bands of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 show much stronger intensity and moresignificant changes than those of CeO 2-x .These results suggest that during the photocatalytic reduction, CO 2 and CO 2 -were consumed and the intermediates such as carbonate species, HCO 3 -and HCOO -were generated more quickly on Cu/CeO 2-x than CeO 2-x .Notably, a new peak at 1735 cm -1 can be observed and corresponding to chelating-bridged carbonate (c-CO 3 2-), which implies that the increased amounts of Ce 3 and O vacancies will provide more adsorption sites for CO 2 and influences the chemical bonding of adsorbed CO 2 molecules 28 .Moreover, a clear signal of CO can be found on Cu/CeO 2- x -0.1, which cannot be observed on CeO 2-x , indicating the accelerated conversion of the intermediates to the final product, CO, and the increased yield of CO on catalyst's surface.And the CO peak is located at about 2160 cm -1 , which is in between the absorption peak at about 2127 cm -1 of CO-Ce 3 and the one at about 2110/2092 cm -1 of CO-Cu / Cu 0 . 5,25,27,30,31 hus CO is supposed to be generated at the interface of Cu and CeO 2-x .Therefore, the introduction of Cu has greatly increased amount of active sites and elevated CO 2 conversion rate, i.e. enhanced the photocatlaytic activity of the catalyst on CO 2 reduction.Compared with the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1, the peak intensity of carbonates and HCOO -all increased and accumulated on the surface of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 during the photocatalytic reaction, suggesting the possible reaction pathway on these two samples may be similar (CO 2 CO 2 -HCOO - CO).In contrast, the negative peaks of CO 2 -on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 changed more significantly than that on the surface of CeO 2-x , indicating that Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 might have provided more active sites or lowered the adsorption energy of CO 2 thus make CO 2 adsorption and reduction much easier.According to the different absorption bands of CO 2 -, the different adsorption modes of CO 2 on the catalysts' surface is believed to be crucial in CO 2 reduction. 21,28,31However, the bands belonging to carbonates on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 are also of enhanced intensity, manifesting the continuous accumulation of carbonates on its surface and the gradual deactivation of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "CeO 2", "source": "Figure 2a, little CO was detected on pure CeO 2 , and trace CO was produced on CeO 2-x .", "context": "In this work, the main gas product of CO 2 reduction was CO.Trace CH 4 was also detected.The unit of CO yield was mol g -1 . At first, the similar catalytic experiments were carried out under the same conditions without light irradiation or photocatalysts.No products were detected, hinting that the product of CO was derived from CO 2 photoreduction.To eliminate the impact of containments, the carbon isotope analysis ( 13 C) was performed and the result is shown in Figure 1.The relative content of 13 CO is about 93, which indicates that the influence of containments could be negligible.And there was trace 13 CH 4 having been detected, further implying the main product on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is CO.As displayed in Figure 1 The 13 C isotope analysis spectrum of the products on Cu/CeO 2-x after 2 h Xenon-light irradiation under humid CO 2 atmosphere.Figure 2a, little CO was detected on pure CeO 2 , and trace CO was produced on CeO 2-x .On Cu/CeO 2-x , the CO is produced remarkably, indicating that Cu-introduction contributes greatly in CO 2 photoreduction reaction.With the increase of Cu content, the CO 2 photocatalytic activity decreased.Among the as-obtained catalysts, the sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the best CO 2 photoreduction activity and the CO yield is about 8.25 mol g -1 under 5 h irradiation, which is about 26 times higher than that on CeO 2-x (Figure 2a).As is shown in Figure S1, the CO generation decreases in per hour irradiation, which possibly results from the untimely conversion of intermediate or delayed desorption of CO from the active sites, resulting in the gradual deactivation of the active sites.After a mild heat treatment at 448 K for 2 h in N 2 flowing, the adsorbed CO or intermediates on the active sites was removed and the photocatalytic activity of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 was recovered.And after several cycles with heat treating after each cycle, Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 still maintained the original high activity, demonstrating that the as-prepared catalysts have good chemical stability (Figure 2b).To understand the relationship between the O vacancies and catalytic stability of Cu/CeO 2-x in more detail, the photocatalytic activity of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 was retested for five cycles, during which the catalyst was just swept by N 2 gas at room temperature after each cycle.As displayed in Figure 2c, the yield of CO shows slight decline, implying that the adsorbents on the catalyst surface is the main reason of the decreased CO yield by covering catalytic active sites.The result clearly illustrates that the introduction of Cu can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic activity of CeO 2-x in CO 2 reduction and also helps to maintain the photocatalytic stability of the catalyst.(denoted as Cu/CeO 2-x ).TEM iamges show that CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x composites are both in the morphology of nanoparticles of below 50 nm in particle size (Figure 4a and 4b).HRTEM image gives the lattice spacing values of 0.28, 0.31 and 0.18 nm, which are indexed to the exposed CeO 2 (1 0 0), CeO 2 (1 1 1), and (2 0 0) facets of Cu, respectively.The SAED pattern shows clear and highly regular diffraction spots and diffraction rings, indicating the polycrystalline feature of the as-obtained samples.According to the elements mapping of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 (Figure S11), Cu is uniformly dispersed in the catalyst. XPS spectra were collected to investigate the chemical composition and chemical state on the surface of the asobtained samples.The survey spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 (Figure S3) shows that the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 has Cu, Ce and O atoms.The Ce 3d spectra are rather complicated as shown in Figure 5a.The peaks located at 916.9, 907.4,901.4 eV and 898.4,889.1 and 882.7 eV (spinorbit splitting peaks) are corresponding to Ce 4 final states: 3d 9 4f 1 , 3d 9 4f 2 and 3d 9 4f 0 , respectively 15 .There are two peaks at 903.4 and 899.4 eV, which attributing to Ce 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 of Ce 3 with 3d 9 4f 1 and 3d 9 4f 2 final states, respectively 5 , indicating that Ce species exist with mixed valences of Ce 3 and Ce 4 in Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1.The Cu 2p XPS spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is shown in Figure 5b, which contains two peaks at 932.4 and 952.6 eV assigned to Cu 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Cu 0 (or Cu ), respectively.Furthermore, the O 1s spectra of the samples (Figure 6) show two peaks (529.5, 531.6 eV) corresponding to the O atoms in CeO 2 lattice and the adsorbed oxygen on its surface.After Ar ion beam etching, the contents of lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen on the subsurface of CeO 2 and Cu/CeO 2- x -0.1 are found to be different from those on their surface.As displayed in Figure 6 and Table S1, the content of adsorbed oxygen on their subsurface is lower than that on their surface, which suggests there are more oxygen vacancies on their surface.And as shown in Figure S9 and Table S2, the atom content of Cu is stable, but the ratio of Cu/(CeCu) decreases with Ar ion etching time.

At first, the similar catalytic experiments were carried out under the same conditions without light irradiation or photocatalysts.No products were detected, hinting that the product of CO was derived from CO 2 photoreduction.To eliminate the impact of containments, the carbon isotope analysis ( 13 C) was performed and the result is shown in Figure 1.The relative content of 13 CO is about 93, which indicates that the influence of containments could be negligible.And there was trace 13 CH 4 having been detected, further implying the main product on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is CO.As displayed in Figure 1 The 13 C isotope analysis spectrum of the products on Cu/CeO 2-x after 2 h Xenon-light irradiation under humid CO 2 atmosphere.Figure 2a, little CO was detected on pure CeO 2 , and trace CO was produced on CeO 2-x .On Cu/CeO 2-x , the CO is produced remarkably, indicating that Cu-introduction contributes greatly in CO 2 photoreduction reaction.With the increase of Cu content, the CO 2 photocatalytic activity decreased.Among the as-obtained catalysts, the sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the best CO 2 photoreduction activity and the CO yield is about 8.25 mol g -1 under 5 h irradiation, which is about 26 times higher than that on CeO 2-x (Figure 2a).As is shown in Figure S1, the CO generation decreases in per hour irradiation, which possibly results from the untimely conversion of intermediate or delayed desorption of CO from the active sites, resulting in the gradual deactivation of the active sites.After a mild heat treatment at 448 K for 2 h in N 2 flowing, the adsorbed CO or intermediates on the active sites was removed and the photocatalytic activity of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 was recovered.And after several cycles with heat treating after each cycle, Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 still maintained the original high activity, demonstrating that the as-prepared catalysts have good chemical stability (Figure 2b).To understand the relationship between the O vacancies and catalytic stability of Cu/CeO 2-x in more detail, the photocatalytic activity of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 was retested for five cycles, during which the catalyst was just swept by N 2 gas at room temperature after each cycle.As displayed in Figure 2c, the yield of CO shows slight decline, implying that the adsorbents on the catalyst surface is the main reason of the decreased CO yield by covering catalytic active sites.The result clearly illustrates that the introduction of Cu can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic activity of CeO 2-x in CO 2 reduction and also helps to maintain the photocatalytic stability of the catalyst.(denoted as Cu/CeO 2-x ).TEM iamges show that CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x composites are both in the morphology of nanoparticles of below 50 nm in particle size (Figure 4a and 4b).HRTEM image gives the lattice spacing values of 0.28, 0.31 and 0.18 nm, which are indexed to the exposed CeO 2 (1 0 0), CeO 2 (1 1 1), and (2 0 0) facets of Cu, respectively.The SAED pattern shows clear and highly regular diffraction spots and diffraction rings, indicating the polycrystalline feature of the as-obtained samples.According to the elements mapping of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 (Figure S11), Cu is uniformly dispersed in the catalyst. XPS spectra were collected to investigate the chemical composition and chemical state on the surface of the asobtained samples.The survey spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 (Figure S3) shows that the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 has Cu, Ce and O atoms.The Ce 3d spectra are rather complicated as shown in Figure 5a.The peaks located at 916.9, 907.4,901.4 eV and 898.4,889.1 and 882.7 eV (spinorbit splitting peaks) are corresponding to Ce 4 final states: 3d 9 4f 1 , 3d 9 4f 2 and 3d 9 4f 0 , respectively 15 .There are two peaks at 903.4 and 899.4 eV, which attributing to Ce 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 of Ce 3 with 3d 9 4f 1 and 3d 9 4f 2 final states, respectively 5 , indicating that Ce species exist with mixed valences of Ce 3 and Ce 4 in Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1.The Cu 2p XPS spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is shown in Figure 5b, which contains two peaks at 932.4 and 952.6 eV assigned to Cu 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Cu 0 (or Cu ), respectively.Furthermore, the O 1s spectra of the samples (Figure 6) show two peaks (529.5, 531.6 eV) corresponding to the O atoms in CeO 2 lattice and the adsorbed oxygen on its surface.After Ar ion beam etching, the contents of lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen on the subsurface of CeO 2 and Cu/CeO 2- x -0.1 are found to be different from those on their surface.As displayed in Figure 6 and Table S1, the content of adsorbed oxygen on their subsurface is lower than that on their surface, which suggests there are more oxygen vacancies on their surface.And as shown in Figure S9 and Table S2, the atom content of Cu is stable, but the ratio of Cu/(CeCu) decreases with Ar ion etching time. Combining the results of XRD and TEM, Cu may not only for clusters on ceria surface, but also been doped in ceria lattice.And the Cu atom content on its surface is higher than that on its subsurface.Compared with CeO 2 , the content of adsorbed oxygen is much higher on the surface and subsurface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1, implying that Cu introduction has increased the concentration of O vacancies in CeO 2-x via charge transfer and activated adsorbed oxygen 16 .This phenomenon is similar with Wang's result 12b .From the XPS results, O vacancies are verified to exist on the surface of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 but after the introduction of Cu species (Cu 0 or Cu ), the change of O vacancy amount cannot been verified.To further confirm the valences of Cu species and the O vacancies, Raman spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 was collected and shown in Figure 5c.No peaks appeared at 220 and 290 cm -1 corresponding to Cu 2 O and CuO, suggesting that Cu exists as Cu 17 .In addition, a hump peak is observed in the Raman spectrum, which can be fitted into two peaks.According to The bands at 458 cm -1 and 592 cm -1 are respectively assigned to F 2g Raman active mode of cubic CeO 2 and O vacancies 18 .Compared to Raman spectra of CeO 2-x , the intensity of peak at 458 cm -1 decreases and the peak at 592 cm -1 is intensified after the introduction of Cu, suggesting that the Cu incorporation has led to the increased disorder of CeO 2 and more O vacancies has been produced in CeO 2 .The half width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the peak at 458 cm -1 is about 30.2 cm -1 . According to the literatures 18a, 19 , the O vacancy concentration on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 can be calculated to be about 4.1810 21 cm -3 .UV-Vis diffuse absorbance spectra were recorded and displayed in Figure 7a.Compared with CeO 2-x , all the Cu/CeO 2-x samples show an enhanced and red-shifted absorption.Among them, the sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the strongest UV-Visible light absorption.The result indicates that the introduction of Cu can greatly improve the photo-absorption within UV-Visible spectrum, which favors the Xenon-light-induced photo-catalytic activity.Moreover, there is a shoulder peak at about 430 nm, which may be consistent with the defect energy level.The shoulder peak became broadened and intensified after the addition of Cu, implying the increased defect concentration by Cu incorporation in CeO 2 .Photoluminescence (PL) spectra are displayed in Figure S7.All the catalysts show a broad peak about 460 nm, which extends to 700 nm and a small peak at about 560 nm.The emission intensity might associate with the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes while its emission photo energy might correspond to the band-gap.The sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the lowest PL intensity, which indicates the largely facilitated charge transfer between CeO 2 and Cu species and the effectively suppressed electron-hole recombination.This result was further confirmed by the transient photoluminescence lifetime analysis under 420 nm excitation of deuterium lamp (Figure 7b and Table S3).The average carriers' lifetime in CeO 2-x is about 74.87 ns and that in Cu/CeO 2-x is about 266.04 ns, indicating that Cu can extremely prolong the carriers' lifetime in CeO 2-x .These findings are in well accordance with the catalytic activity as shown above.EIS Nyquist plots of the as-obtained samples in dark demonstrate that Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is much higher conductive than CeO 2 and CeO 2-x (Figure 7c), suggesting that it can efficiently promote photo-excited carriers' separation and greatly accelerate the transmission of interfacial charger.The photocurrent responses of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 were further investigated for 10 on-off cycles.An instantaneous and uniform photocurrent response can be observed accompanying the light on and off process (Figure 7d).Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows much higher photocurrent intensity than CeO 2 and CeO 2-x , indicating its most efficient electron-hole separation /transfer and highest photoreduction activity.These photoelectrochemical results are well in accordance with the catalytic activity test. In order to further certify the role of Cu in stabilizing O vacancies, the O 2p XPS and Raman spectra were used to check the changes of O vacancies.O 2p XPS spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions are shown in Figure 8a.The peak of the adsorbed O (533.1 eV) on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 has kept unchanged after the reaction (irradiation for 5 h in wet CO 2 atmosphere).Raman shift of O vacancies has changed a little after 5 h CO 2 photoreduction process, which indicates that O vacancies are basically stable dur ing the process of photocatalysis (Figure 8b andS6).The half width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the peak at 458 cm -1 is narrowed to about 24.7 cm -1 .According to the same calculation method used above, the calculated O vacancy concentration on the surface of used Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is about 3.40 10 21 cm -3 , which is still in the same magnitude with that on the fresh sample surface.Based on the above all evidences, we can conclude that Cu presence benefits the stabilization of O vacancies in CeO 2-x. with CO 2 ; the other possible way is to oxidize Ce 3 to Ce 4 . 23But these speculations are still very difficult to be proved by experimental methods. To further understand the reaction path of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction on the catalysts, in-situ FT-IR spectroscopy was used to investigate the adsorption, activation and conversion process of CO 2 on Cu/CeO 2-x and CeO 2-x .The FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 swept by N 2 after CO 2 and H 2 O adsorption in dark were collected and shown in Figure 9b, which indicates that several carbonates have formed on the samples' surface after the humid CO 2 adsorption.The peak at about 1200 cm -1 corresponds to hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -) 24 , and those at about 1367 and 1280 cm -1 are corresponding to monodentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) 25 .The others at about 1470 cm -1 and 2000-2350 cm -1 are corresponding to monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-) 5,26 and the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 27 , respectively.Additionally, the peaks at about 1963, 1670 and 1640 cm -1 are assigned to bending vibration of carbonxylate (CO 2 -) 21,28 .The existence of -CO 3 2-can be attributed to the formation of carbonic acid or/and the adsorbed CO 2 on the catalyst surface 20 21 .It should also be noted that the absorption peaks of CO 2 -, m-CO 3 2-and b-CO 3 2-on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 have shifted to higher wavenumbers, owing to the intensified surface basicity after Cu introduction. 21igure 10 shows the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 collected every 5 min under irradiation in CO 2 and H 2 O. Clearly, several positive and negative peaks can be found during the photocatalytic reaction, which correspond to the species formation and consumption, respectively.The negative peak at about 2000-2350 cm -1 is corresponding to the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 29 , and those at about 1963, 1670 and 1640 are corresponding to the bending vibration of carbonxylate (CO 2 -) 26,28,29 .The positive peaks at about 1604, 1485, 1367 and 1186 cm -1 are attributed to formate (HCOO -), monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-), bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) and hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -), respectively 24,25,28 .Almost all the bands of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 show much stronger intensity and moresignificant changes than those of CeO 2-x .These results suggest that during the photocatalytic reduction, CO 2 and CO 2 -were consumed and the intermediates such as carbonate species, HCO 3 -and HCOO -were generated more quickly on Cu/CeO 2-x than CeO 2-x .Notably, a new peak at 1735 cm -1 can be observed and corresponding to chelating-bridged carbonate (c-CO 3 2-), which implies that the increased amounts of Ce 3 and O vacancies will provide more adsorption sites for CO 2 and influences the chemical bonding of adsorbed CO 2 molecules 28 .Moreover, a clear signal of CO can be found on Cu/CeO 2- x -0.1, which cannot be observed on CeO 2-x , indicating the accelerated conversion of the intermediates to the final product, CO, and the increased yield of CO on catalyst's surface.And the CO peak is located at about 2160 cm -1 , which is in between the absorption peak at about 2127 cm -1 of CO-Ce 3 and the one at about 2110/2092 cm -1 of CO-Cu / Cu 0 . 5,25,27,30,31 hus CO is supposed to be generated at the interface of Cu and CeO 2-x .Therefore, the introduction of Cu has greatly increased amount of active sites and elevated CO 2 conversion rate, i.e. enhanced the photocatlaytic activity of the catalyst on CO 2 reduction.Compared with the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1, the peak intensity of carbonates and HCOO -all increased and accumulated on the surface of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 during the photocatalytic reaction, suggesting the possible reaction pathway on these two samples may be similar (CO 2 CO 2 -HCOO - CO).In contrast, the negative peaks of CO 2 -on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 changed more significantly than that on the surface of CeO 2-x , indicating that Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 might have provided more active sites or lowered the adsorption energy of CO 2 thus make CO 2 adsorption and reduction much easier.According to the different absorption bands of CO 2 -, the different adsorption modes of CO 2 on the catalysts' surface is believed to be crucial in CO 2 reduction. 21,28,31However, the bands belonging to carbonates on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 are also of enhanced intensity, manifesting the continuous accumulation of carbonates on its surface and the gradual deactivation of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "Cu/CeO2-x", "source": "In summary, Cu has been introduced to generate and stabilize O vacancy in CeO 2 , resulting in greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction reaction.", "context": "In summary, Cu has been introduced to generate and stabilize O vacancy in CeO 2 , resulting in greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction reaction.Cu introduction favors the photo-absorption of the catalyst within UV-Visible light spectrum, promotes the electronhole separation/transfer, prolongs the carriers' lifetime, and eventually provides more active sites and alters the configurations of the adsorbed CO 2 on CeO 2-x .Mixed valences of Ce 3 and Ce 4 are formed in the Cu/CeO 2-x nanocomposites and Cu exists as Cu 0 , accompanying the generation of surface O vacancies due to the Cu introduction.The sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the highest photocatalytic activity with a CO yield of about 8.25 mol g -1 during 5 h of Xe-light irradiation, which is about 26 times higher than that on CeO 2-x .The O vacancies in Cu/CeO 2-x keep stable after the CO 2 photocatalytic reaction owing to the Cu presence, which results in the enhanced photocatalytic stability of Cu/CeO 2-x in CO 2 reduction reaction.

At first, the similar catalytic experiments were carried out under the same conditions without light irradiation or photocatalysts.No products were detected, hinting that the product of CO was derived from CO 2 photoreduction.To eliminate the impact of containments, the carbon isotope analysis ( 13 C) was performed and the result is shown in Figure 1.The relative content of 13 CO is about 93, which indicates that the influence of containments could be negligible.And there was trace 13 CH 4 having been detected, further implying the main product on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is CO.As displayed in Figure 1 The 13 C isotope analysis spectrum of the products on Cu/CeO 2-x after 2 h Xenon-light irradiation under humid CO 2 atmosphere.Figure 2a, little CO was detected on pure CeO 2 , and trace CO was produced on CeO 2-x .On Cu/CeO 2-x , the CO is produced remarkably, indicating that Cu-introduction contributes greatly in CO 2 photoreduction reaction.With the increase of Cu content, the CO 2 photocatalytic activity decreased.Among the as-obtained catalysts, the sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the best CO 2 photoreduction activity and the CO yield is about 8.25 mol g -1 under 5 h irradiation, which is about 26 times higher than that on CeO 2-x (Figure 2a).As is shown in Figure S1, the CO generation decreases in per hour irradiation, which possibly results from the untimely conversion of intermediate or delayed desorption of CO from the active sites, resulting in the gradual deactivation of the active sites.After a mild heat treatment at 448 K for 2 h in N 2 flowing, the adsorbed CO or intermediates on the active sites was removed and the photocatalytic activity of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 was recovered.And after several cycles with heat treating after each cycle, Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 still maintained the original high activity, demonstrating that the as-prepared catalysts have good chemical stability (Figure 2b).To understand the relationship between the O vacancies and catalytic stability of Cu/CeO 2-x in more detail, the photocatalytic activity of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 was retested for five cycles, during which the catalyst was just swept by N 2 gas at room temperature after each cycle.As displayed in Figure 2c, the yield of CO shows slight decline, implying that the adsorbents on the catalyst surface is the main reason of the decreased CO yield by covering catalytic active sites.The result clearly illustrates that the introduction of Cu can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic activity of CeO 2-x in CO 2 reduction and also helps to maintain the photocatalytic stability of the catalyst.(denoted as Cu/CeO 2-x ).TEM iamges show that CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x composites are both in the morphology of nanoparticles of below 50 nm in particle size (Figure 4a and 4b).HRTEM image gives the lattice spacing values of 0.28, 0.31 and 0.18 nm, which are indexed to the exposed CeO 2 (1 0 0), CeO 2 (1 1 1), and (2 0 0) facets of Cu, respectively.The SAED pattern shows clear and highly regular diffraction spots and diffraction rings, indicating the polycrystalline feature of the as-obtained samples.According to the elements mapping of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 (Figure S11), Cu is uniformly dispersed in the catalyst. XPS spectra were collected to investigate the chemical composition and chemical state on the surface of the asobtained samples.The survey spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 (Figure S3) shows that the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 has Cu, Ce and O atoms.The Ce 3d spectra are rather complicated as shown in Figure 5a.The peaks located at 916.9, 907.4,901.4 eV and 898.4,889.1 and 882.7 eV (spinorbit splitting peaks) are corresponding to Ce 4 final states: 3d 9 4f 1 , 3d 9 4f 2 and 3d 9 4f 0 , respectively 15 .There are two peaks at 903.4 and 899.4 eV, which attributing to Ce 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 of Ce 3 with 3d 9 4f 1 and 3d 9 4f 2 final states, respectively 5 , indicating that Ce species exist with mixed valences of Ce 3 and Ce 4 in Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1.The Cu 2p XPS spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is shown in Figure 5b, which contains two peaks at 932.4 and 952.6 eV assigned to Cu 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Cu 0 (or Cu ), respectively.Furthermore, the O 1s spectra of the samples (Figure 6) show two peaks (529.5, 531.6 eV) corresponding to the O atoms in CeO 2 lattice and the adsorbed oxygen on its surface.After Ar ion beam etching, the contents of lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen on the subsurface of CeO 2 and Cu/CeO 2- x -0.1 are found to be different from those on their surface.As displayed in Figure 6 and Table S1, the content of adsorbed oxygen on their subsurface is lower than that on their surface, which suggests there are more oxygen vacancies on their surface.And as shown in Figure S9 and Table S2, the atom content of Cu is stable, but the ratio of Cu/(CeCu) decreases with Ar ion etching time. Combining the results of XRD and TEM, Cu may not only for clusters on ceria surface, but also been doped in ceria lattice.And the Cu atom content on its surface is higher than that on its subsurface.Compared with CeO 2 , the content of adsorbed oxygen is much higher on the surface and subsurface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1, implying that Cu introduction has increased the concentration of O vacancies in CeO 2-x via charge transfer and activated adsorbed oxygen 16 .This phenomenon is similar with Wang's result 12b .From the XPS results, O vacancies are verified to exist on the surface of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 but after the introduction of Cu species (Cu 0 or Cu ), the change of O vacancy amount cannot been verified.To further confirm the valences of Cu species and the O vacancies, Raman spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 was collected and shown in Figure 5c.No peaks appeared at 220 and 290 cm -1 corresponding to Cu 2 O and CuO, suggesting that Cu exists as Cu 17 .In addition, a hump peak is observed in the Raman spectrum, which can be fitted into two peaks.According to The bands at 458 cm -1 and 592 cm -1 are respectively assigned to F 2g Raman active mode of cubic CeO 2 and O vacancies 18 .Compared to Raman spectra of CeO 2-x , the intensity of peak at 458 cm -1 decreases and the peak at 592 cm -1 is intensified after the introduction of Cu, suggesting that the Cu incorporation has led to the increased disorder of CeO 2 and more O vacancies has been produced in CeO 2 .The half width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the peak at 458 cm -1 is about 30.2 cm -1 . According to the literatures 18a, 19 , the O vacancy concentration on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 can be calculated to be about 4.1810 21 cm -3 .UV-Vis diffuse absorbance spectra were recorded and displayed in Figure 7a.Compared with CeO 2-x , all the Cu/CeO 2-x samples show an enhanced and red-shifted absorption.Among them, the sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the strongest UV-Visible light absorption.The result indicates that the introduction of Cu can greatly improve the photo-absorption within UV-Visible spectrum, which favors the Xenon-light-induced photo-catalytic activity.Moreover, there is a shoulder peak at about 430 nm, which may be consistent with the defect energy level.The shoulder peak became broadened and intensified after the addition of Cu, implying the increased defect concentration by Cu incorporation in CeO 2 .Photoluminescence (PL) spectra are displayed in Figure S7.All the catalysts show a broad peak about 460 nm, which extends to 700 nm and a small peak at about 560 nm.The emission intensity might associate with the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes while its emission photo energy might correspond to the band-gap.The sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the lowest PL intensity, which indicates the largely facilitated charge transfer between CeO 2 and Cu species and the effectively suppressed electron-hole recombination.This result was further confirmed by the transient photoluminescence lifetime analysis under 420 nm excitation of deuterium lamp (Figure 7b and Table S3).The average carriers' lifetime in CeO 2-x is about 74.87 ns and that in Cu/CeO 2-x is about 266.04 ns, indicating that Cu can extremely prolong the carriers' lifetime in CeO 2-x .These findings are in well accordance with the catalytic activity as shown above.EIS Nyquist plots of the as-obtained samples in dark demonstrate that Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is much higher conductive than CeO 2 and CeO 2-x (Figure 7c), suggesting that it can efficiently promote photo-excited carriers' separation and greatly accelerate the transmission of interfacial charger.The photocurrent responses of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 were further investigated for 10 on-off cycles.An instantaneous and uniform photocurrent response can be observed accompanying the light on and off process (Figure 7d).Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows much higher photocurrent intensity than CeO 2 and CeO 2-x , indicating its most efficient electron-hole separation /transfer and highest photoreduction activity.These photoelectrochemical results are well in accordance with the catalytic activity test. In order to further certify the role of Cu in stabilizing O vacancies, the O 2p XPS and Raman spectra were used to check the changes of O vacancies.O 2p XPS spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions are shown in Figure 8a.The peak of the adsorbed O (533.1 eV) on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 has kept unchanged after the reaction (irradiation for 5 h in wet CO 2 atmosphere).Raman shift of O vacancies has changed a little after 5 h CO 2 photoreduction process, which indicates that O vacancies are basically stable dur ing the process of photocatalysis (Figure 8b andS6).The half width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the peak at 458 cm -1 is narrowed to about 24.7 cm -1 .According to the same calculation method used above, the calculated O vacancy concentration on the surface of used Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is about 3.40 10 21 cm -3 , which is still in the same magnitude with that on the fresh sample surface.Based on the above all evidences, we can conclude that Cu presence benefits the stabilization of O vacancies in CeO 2-x. with CO 2 ; the other possible way is to oxidize Ce 3 to Ce 4 . 23But these speculations are still very difficult to be proved by experimental methods. To further understand the reaction path of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction on the catalysts, in-situ FT-IR spectroscopy was used to investigate the adsorption, activation and conversion process of CO 2 on Cu/CeO 2-x and CeO 2-x .The FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 swept by N 2 after CO 2 and H 2 O adsorption in dark were collected and shown in Figure 9b, which indicates that several carbonates have formed on the samples' surface after the humid CO 2 adsorption.The peak at about 1200 cm -1 corresponds to hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -) 24 , and those at about 1367 and 1280 cm -1 are corresponding to monodentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) 25 .The others at about 1470 cm -1 and 2000-2350 cm -1 are corresponding to monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-) 5,26 and the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 27 , respectively.Additionally, the peaks at about 1963, 1670 and 1640 cm -1 are assigned to bending vibration of carbonxylate (CO 2 -) 21,28 .The existence of -CO 3 2-can be attributed to the formation of carbonic acid or/and the adsorbed CO 2 on the catalyst surface 20 21 .It should also be noted that the absorption peaks of CO 2 -, m-CO 3 2-and b-CO 3 2-on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 have shifted to higher wavenumbers, owing to the intensified surface basicity after Cu introduction. 21igure 10 shows the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 collected every 5 min under irradiation in CO 2 and H 2 O. Clearly, several positive and negative peaks can be found during the photocatalytic reaction, which correspond to the species formation and consumption, respectively.The negative peak at about 2000-2350 cm -1 is corresponding to the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 29 , and those at about 1963, 1670 and 1640 are corresponding to the bending vibration of carbonxylate (CO 2 -) 26,28,29 .The positive peaks at about 1604, 1485, 1367 and 1186 cm -1 are attributed to formate (HCOO -), monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-), bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) and hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -), respectively 24,25,28 .Almost all the bands of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 show much stronger intensity and moresignificant changes than those of CeO 2-x .These results suggest that during the photocatalytic reduction, CO 2 and CO 2 -were consumed and the intermediates such as carbonate species, HCO 3 -and HCOO -were generated more quickly on Cu/CeO 2-x than CeO 2-x .Notably, a new peak at 1735 cm -1 can be observed and corresponding to chelating-bridged carbonate (c-CO 3 2-), which implies that the increased amounts of Ce 3 and O vacancies will provide more adsorption sites for CO 2 and influences the chemical bonding of adsorbed CO 2 molecules 28 .Moreover, a clear signal of CO can be found on Cu/CeO 2- x -0.1, which cannot be observed on CeO 2-x , indicating the accelerated conversion of the intermediates to the final product, CO, and the increased yield of CO on catalyst's surface.And the CO peak is located at about 2160 cm -1 , which is in between the absorption peak at about 2127 cm -1 of CO-Ce 3 and the one at about 2110/2092 cm -1 of CO-Cu / Cu 0 . 5,25,27,30,31 hus CO is supposed to be generated at the interface of Cu and CeO 2-x .Therefore, the introduction of Cu has greatly increased amount of active sites and elevated CO 2 conversion rate, i.e. enhanced the photocatlaytic activity of the catalyst on CO 2 reduction.Compared with the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1, the peak intensity of carbonates and HCOO -all increased and accumulated on the surface of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 during the photocatalytic reaction, suggesting the possible reaction pathway on these two samples may be similar (CO 2 CO 2 -HCOO - CO).In contrast, the negative peaks of CO 2 -on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 changed more significantly than that on the surface of CeO 2-x , indicating that Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 might have provided more active sites or lowered the adsorption energy of CO 2 thus make CO 2 adsorption and reduction much easier.According to the different absorption bands of CO 2 -, the different adsorption modes of CO 2 on the catalysts' surface is believed to be crucial in CO 2 reduction. 21,28,31However, the bands belonging to carbonates on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 are also of enhanced intensity, manifesting the continuous accumulation of carbonates on its surface and the gradual deactivation of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the highest photocatalytic activity with a CO yield of about 8.25 mol g -1 during 5 h of Xe-light irradiation, which is about 26 times higher than that on CeO 2-x .", "context": "In summary, Cu has been introduced to generate and stabilize O vacancy in CeO 2 , resulting in greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction reaction.Cu introduction favors the photo-absorption of the catalyst within UV-Visible light spectrum, promotes the electronhole separation/transfer, prolongs the carriers' lifetime, and eventually provides more active sites and alters the configurations of the adsorbed CO 2 on CeO 2-x .Mixed valences of Ce 3 and Ce 4 are formed in the Cu/CeO 2-x nanocomposites and Cu exists as Cu 0 , accompanying the generation of surface O vacancies due to the Cu introduction.The sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the highest photocatalytic activity with a CO yield of about 8.25 mol g -1 during 5 h of Xe-light irradiation, which is about 26 times higher than that on CeO 2-x .The O vacancies in Cu/CeO 2-x keep stable after the CO 2 photocatalytic reaction owing to the Cu presence, which results in the enhanced photocatalytic stability of Cu/CeO 2-x in CO 2 reduction reaction.

Clearly, compared to CeO 2-x , different CO 2 -species and higher intensity of the CO 2 -signals can be found on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1.Moreover, the signals of carbonates (b-CO 3 2-, m-CO 3 2-) on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 are much more intensive than on CeO 2-x .These results imply that the existence of Cu and O vacancies have not only provided more active sites for CO 2 adsorption/activation, but also altered the adsorption/activation modes of CO 2 .Interestingly, on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1, the intermediate HCO 3 -exhibits a band with high intensity, suggesting the introduction of Cu and the abundant O vacancies further facilitate the reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O Figure 10, In-situ FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x (a: separated, b: overlapped) and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1(c: separated, d: overlapped) collected every 5 min under the irradiation in the presences of CO 2 and H 2 O (The spectra collected at 0 min of irradiation in CO 2 and H 2 O was used as background.In b and d, the upward and downward arrows indicate the formation and consumption of intermediate species, respectively.)

Electrochemical measurements were conducted on a CHI660A electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode cell.Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) deposited with photocatalysts, graphite carbon paper and Ag/AgCl act as working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively.The electrolyte was 0.2M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution.The preparation process of working electrodes by electrophoretic deposition as follows:sample powder (20 mg) and iodine (40 mg) were mixed and well milled in an agate mortar, then well-dispersed in acetone (30 mL).Thus the plating solution was obtained.At a potentiostat bias of 10 V for 10 min, a thin film of the sample was uniformly deposited on FTO and then calcined in a drying oven at 423 K for 2 h.During the electrochemical measurement, the coated area of all the samples was controlled at 1 cm 2 .Nyquist plots were tested in dark with the bias voltage of -0.4 V versus Ag/AgCl.With irradiation from a 300 W of Xenon-arc lamp, the transient photocurrent densities were obtained at 0.3 V versus Ag/AgCl. The light source was a 300 W of Xenon-arc lamp from Aulight CEL-HX, Beijing.The gas products (CO, CH 4 ) were analyzed by GC-2060 gas chromatograph (FID detector), which is equipped with a 5A molecular column and a TDX-01 packed column.The photocatalysis test was conducted typically as follows: 50 mg of photo-catalyst was uniformly dispersed on a 2.5 cm2.5 cm glass, treated at 423 K for 2 h in air and put at the bottom of a 500 mL sealed glass reactor equipped with an optical quartz window at the top.The temperature of reactor was kept at 298 K by cooling water circulation.To exclude the possible influence of contaminants, the sealed reactor was full of N 2 and under the irradiation of Xe lamp for 2 h.Subsequently, CO 2 (99.99 of purity) passed through a water bubbler was filled in the reactor and stabilized for 30 min,.During the photoreaction, 1 mL of sample gas was continually extracted from the reactor per hour and analyzed on GC based on external standard method.Before each (or cycle) activity test, the photocatalyst was first heat-treated at 423 K for 2 h, removing the organic impurities and adsorbed carbon species on catalysts' surface."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "As displayed in Figure 1 The 13 C isotope analysis spectrum of the products on Cu/CeO 2-x after 2 h Xenon-light irradiation under humid CO 2 atmosphere.", "context": "In this work, the main gas product of CO 2 reduction was CO.Trace CH 4 was also detected.The unit of CO yield was mol g -1 .

XPS spectra were collected to investigate the chemical composition and chemical state on the surface of the asobtained samples.The survey spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 (Figure S3) shows that the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 has Cu, Ce and O atoms.The Ce 3d spectra are rather complicated as shown in Figure 5a.The peaks located at 916.9, 907.4,901.4 eV and 898.4,889.1 and 882.7 eV (spinorbit splitting peaks) are corresponding to Ce 4 final states: 3d 9 4f 1 , 3d 9 4f 2 and 3d 9 4f 0 , respectively 15 .There are two peaks at 903.4 and 899.4 eV, which attributing to Ce 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 of Ce 3 with 3d 9 4f 1 and 3d 9 4f 2 final states, respectively 5 , indicating that Ce species exist with mixed valences of Ce 3 and Ce 4 in Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1.The Cu 2p XPS spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is shown in Figure 5b, which contains two peaks at 932.4 and 952.6 eV assigned to Cu 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Cu 0 (or Cu ), respectively.Furthermore, the O 1s spectra of the samples (Figure 6) show two peaks (529.5, 531.6 eV) corresponding to the O atoms in CeO 2 lattice and the adsorbed oxygen on its surface.After Ar ion beam etching, the contents of lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen on the subsurface of CeO 2 and Cu/CeO 2- x -0.1 are found to be different from those on their surface.As displayed in Figure 6 and Table S1, the content of adsorbed oxygen on their subsurface is lower than that on their surface, which suggests there are more oxygen vacancies on their surface.And as shown in Figure S9 and Table S2, the atom content of Cu is stable, but the ratio of Cu/(CeCu) decreases with Ar ion etching time. Combining the results of XRD and TEM, Cu may not only for clusters on ceria surface, but also been doped in ceria lattice.And the Cu atom content on its surface is higher than that on its subsurface.Compared with CeO 2 , the content of adsorbed oxygen is much higher on the surface and subsurface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1, implying that Cu introduction has increased the concentration of O vacancies in CeO 2-x via charge transfer and activated adsorbed oxygen 16 .This phenomenon is similar with Wang's result 12b .From the XPS results, O vacancies are verified to exist on the surface of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 but after the introduction of Cu species (Cu 0 or Cu ), the change of O vacancy amount cannot been verified.To further confirm the valences of Cu species and the O vacancies, Raman spectrum of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 was collected and shown in Figure 5c.No peaks appeared at 220 and 290 cm -1 corresponding to Cu 2 O and CuO, suggesting that Cu exists as Cu 17 .In addition, a hump peak is observed in the Raman spectrum, which can be fitted into two peaks.According to The bands at 458 cm -1 and 592 cm -1 are respectively assigned to F 2g Raman active mode of cubic CeO 2 and O vacancies 18 .Compared to Raman spectra of CeO 2-x , the intensity of peak at 458 cm -1 decreases and the peak at 592 cm -1 is intensified after the introduction of Cu, suggesting that the Cu incorporation has led to the increased disorder of CeO 2 and more O vacancies has been produced in CeO 2 .The half width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the peak at 458 cm -1 is about 30.2 cm -1 . According to the literatures 18a, 19 , the O vacancy concentration on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 can be calculated to be about 4.1810 21 cm -3 .UV-Vis diffuse absorbance spectra were recorded and displayed in Figure 7a.Compared with CeO 2-x , all the Cu/CeO 2-x samples show an enhanced and red-shifted absorption.Among them, the sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the strongest UV-Visible light absorption.The result indicates that the introduction of Cu can greatly improve the photo-absorption within UV-Visible spectrum, which favors the Xenon-light-induced photo-catalytic activity.Moreover, there is a shoulder peak at about 430 nm, which may be consistent with the defect energy level.The shoulder peak became broadened and intensified after the addition of Cu, implying the increased defect concentration by Cu incorporation in CeO 2 .Photoluminescence (PL) spectra are displayed in Figure S7.All the catalysts show a broad peak about 460 nm, which extends to 700 nm and a small peak at about 560 nm.The emission intensity might associate with the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes while its emission photo energy might correspond to the band-gap.The sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the lowest PL intensity, which indicates the largely facilitated charge transfer between CeO 2 and Cu species and the effectively suppressed electron-hole recombination.This result was further confirmed by the transient photoluminescence lifetime analysis under 420 nm excitation of deuterium lamp (Figure 7b and Table S3).The average carriers' lifetime in CeO 2-x is about 74.87 ns and that in Cu/CeO 2-x is about 266.04 ns, indicating that Cu can extremely prolong the carriers' lifetime in CeO 2-x .These findings are in well accordance with the catalytic activity as shown above.EIS Nyquist plots of the as-obtained samples in dark demonstrate that Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is much higher conductive than CeO 2 and CeO 2-x (Figure 7c), suggesting that it can efficiently promote photo-excited carriers' separation and greatly accelerate the transmission of interfacial charger.The photocurrent responses of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 were further investigated for 10 on-off cycles.An instantaneous and uniform photocurrent response can be observed accompanying the light on and off process (Figure 7d).Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows much higher photocurrent intensity than CeO 2 and CeO 2-x , indicating its most efficient electron-hole separation /transfer and highest photoreduction activity.These photoelectrochemical results are well in accordance with the catalytic activity test. In order to further certify the role of Cu in stabilizing O vacancies, the O 2p XPS and Raman spectra were used to check the changes of O vacancies.O 2p XPS spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions are shown in Figure 8a.The peak of the adsorbed O (533.1 eV) on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 has kept unchanged after the reaction (irradiation for 5 h in wet CO 2 atmosphere).Raman shift of O vacancies has changed a little after 5 h CO 2 photoreduction process, which indicates that O vacancies are basically stable dur ing the process of photocatalysis (Figure 8b andS6).The half width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the peak at 458 cm -1 is narrowed to about 24.7 cm -1 .According to the same calculation method used above, the calculated O vacancy concentration on the surface of used Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 is about 3.40 10 21 cm -3 , which is still in the same magnitude with that on the fresh sample surface.Based on the above all evidences, we can conclude that Cu presence benefits the stabilization of O vacancies in CeO 2-x. with CO 2 ; the other possible way is to oxidize Ce 3 to Ce 4 . 23But these speculations are still very difficult to be proved by experimental methods. To further understand the reaction path of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction on the catalysts, in-situ FT-IR spectroscopy was used to investigate the adsorption, activation and conversion process of CO 2 on Cu/CeO 2-x and CeO 2-x .The FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 swept by N 2 after CO 2 and H 2 O adsorption in dark were collected and shown in Figure 9b, which indicates that several carbonates have formed on the samples' surface after the humid CO 2 adsorption.The peak at about 1200 cm -1 corresponds to hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -) 24 , and those at about 1367 and 1280 cm -1 are corresponding to monodentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) 25 .The others at about 1470 cm -1 and 2000-2350 cm -1 are corresponding to monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-) 5,26 and the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 27 , respectively.Additionally, the peaks at about 1963, 1670 and 1640 cm -1 are assigned to bending vibration of carbonxylate (CO 2 -) 21,28 .The existence of -CO 3 2-can be attributed to the formation of carbonic acid or/and the adsorbed CO 2 on the catalyst surface 20 21 .It should also be noted that the absorption peaks of CO 2 -, m-CO 3 2-and b-CO 3 2-on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 have shifted to higher wavenumbers, owing to the intensified surface basicity after Cu introduction. 21igure 10 shows the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 collected every 5 min under irradiation in CO 2 and H 2 O. Clearly, several positive and negative peaks can be found during the photocatalytic reaction, which correspond to the species formation and consumption, respectively.The negative peak at about 2000-2350 cm -1 is corresponding to the asymmetric stretching of CO 2 29 , and those at about 1963, 1670 and 1640 are corresponding to the bending vibration of carbonxylate (CO 2 -) 26,28,29 .The positive peaks at about 1604, 1485, 1367 and 1186 cm -1 are attributed to formate (HCOO -), monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-), bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) and hydrocarboxylate (HCO 3 -), respectively 24,25,28 .Almost all the bands of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 show much stronger intensity and moresignificant changes than those of CeO 2-x .These results suggest that during the photocatalytic reduction, CO 2 and CO 2 -were consumed and the intermediates such as carbonate species, HCO 3 -and HCOO -were generated more quickly on Cu/CeO 2-x than CeO 2-x .Notably, a new peak at 1735 cm -1 can be observed and corresponding to chelating-bridged carbonate (c-CO 3 2-), which implies that the increased amounts of Ce 3 and O vacancies will provide more adsorption sites for CO 2 and influences the chemical bonding of adsorbed CO 2 molecules 28 .Moreover, a clear signal of CO can be found on Cu/CeO 2- x -0.1, which cannot be observed on CeO 2-x , indicating the accelerated conversion of the intermediates to the final product, CO, and the increased yield of CO on catalyst's surface.And the CO peak is located at about 2160 cm -1 , which is in between the absorption peak at about 2127 cm -1 of CO-Ce 3 and the one at about 2110/2092 cm -1 of CO-Cu / Cu 0 . 5,25,27,30,31 hus CO is supposed to be generated at the interface of Cu and CeO 2-x .Therefore, the introduction of Cu has greatly increased amount of active sites and elevated CO 2 conversion rate, i.e. enhanced the photocatlaytic activity of the catalyst on CO 2 reduction.Compared with the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1, the peak intensity of carbonates and HCOO -all increased and accumulated on the surface of CeO 2-x and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 during the photocatalytic reaction, suggesting the possible reaction pathway on these two samples may be similar (CO 2 CO 2 -HCOO - CO).In contrast, the negative peaks of CO 2 -on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 changed more significantly than that on the surface of CeO 2-x , indicating that Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 might have provided more active sites or lowered the adsorption energy of CO 2 thus make CO 2 adsorption and reduction much easier.According to the different absorption bands of CO 2 -, the different adsorption modes of CO 2 on the catalysts' surface is believed to be crucial in CO 2 reduction. 21,28,31However, the bands belonging to carbonates on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 are also of enhanced intensity, manifesting the continuous accumulation of carbonates on its surface and the gradual deactivation of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "In-situ FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x (a: separated, b: overlapped) and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1(c: separated, d: overlapped) collected every 5 min under the irradiation in the presences of CO 2 and H 2 O", "context": "In summary, Cu has been introduced to generate and stabilize O vacancy in CeO 2 , resulting in greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction reaction.Cu introduction favors the photo-absorption of the catalyst within UV-Visible light spectrum, promotes the electronhole separation/transfer, prolongs the carriers' lifetime, and eventually provides more active sites and alters the configurations of the adsorbed CO 2 on CeO 2-x .Mixed valences of Ce 3 and Ce 4 are formed in the Cu/CeO 2-x nanocomposites and Cu exists as Cu 0 , accompanying the generation of surface O vacancies due to the Cu introduction.The sample Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 shows the highest photocatalytic activity with a CO yield of about 8.25 mol g -1 during 5 h of Xe-light irradiation, which is about 26 times higher than that on CeO 2-x .The O vacancies in Cu/CeO 2-x keep stable after the CO 2 photocatalytic reaction owing to the Cu presence, which results in the enhanced photocatalytic stability of Cu/CeO 2-x in CO 2 reduction reaction.

Clearly, compared to CeO 2-x , different CO 2 -species and higher intensity of the CO 2 -signals can be found on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1.Moreover, the signals of carbonates (b-CO 3 2-, m-CO 3 2-) on the surface of Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1 are much more intensive than on CeO 2-x .These results imply that the existence of Cu and O vacancies have not only provided more active sites for CO 2 adsorption/activation, but also altered the adsorption/activation modes of CO 2 .Interestingly, on Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1, the intermediate HCO 3 -exhibits a band with high intensity, suggesting the introduction of Cu and the abundant O vacancies further facilitate the reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O Figure 10, In-situ FT-IR spectra of CeO 2-x (a: separated, b: overlapped) and Cu/CeO 2-x -0.1(c: separated, d: overlapped) collected every 5 min under the irradiation in the presences of CO 2 and H 2 O (The spectra collected at 0 min of irradiation in CO 2 and H 2 O was used as background.In b and d, the upward and downward arrows indicate the formation and consumption of intermediate species, respectively.)
