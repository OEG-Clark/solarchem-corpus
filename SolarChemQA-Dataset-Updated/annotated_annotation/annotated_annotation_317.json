In a typical process, 1 g of the as-obtained bulk g-C 3 N 4 was added into 200 mL of HCl aqueous solution (0.5 mol L A 1 ) and ultrasound-treated for 1 h.After that, the exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 in the acid suspension was vigorously stirred for another 4 h at room temperature for its further protonation.The mixture was filtered and repeatedly washed with DI water to remove superfluous HCl until the pH of the filtrate water became neutral.Finally, the pCN product was dried at 70 1C for 12 h and then ground into powder. Synthesis of rGO-modified pCN (rGO/pCN) hybrid photocatalysts GO was synthesized from natural graphite using the modified Hummers' method as reported previously 25,33.The detail of GO synthesis is elucidated in Supporting Information.Firstly, a measured amount of graphite oxide was dispersed in 150 mL of DI water and ultrasonicated for 30 min to fully exfoliate graphite oxide into GO sheets.0.5 g of the as-prepared pCN was then added into the GO suspension and ultrasound-treated for additional 30 min.After that, the mixture was vigorously stirred for 1 h to achieve homogeneous suspension.To reduce GO in the synthesis mixture, a pre-determined amount of NaBH 4 was subsequently added.The resulting mixture was stirred at 80 1C for 3 h, after which the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and washed several times with ethanol and DI water to remove excess NaBH 4 .Finally, the asobtained precipitate was dried at 70 1C in an oven for 12 h.For optimization, rGO/pCN hybrid nanocomposites with various ratios of rGO were also constructed, in which the weight fractions of rGO in the samples were 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt.The resulting samples were denoted as xrGO/ pCN, where x 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20, respectively.For comparison, 15rGO/CN nanocomposite synthesized without the surface charge modification of g-C 3 N 4 was prepared under the similar experimental conditions. Zeta potential measurements were obtained by dynamic light-scattering analysis using the Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments).In brief, 20 mg of the sample was dispersed in 50 mL of DI water by sonication at room temperature.The surface morphology of the as-developed samples was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Hitachi SU8010) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).High resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope (accelerating voltage 200 kV).The TEM sample was prepared by placing a drop of diluted ethanol suspension on a lacey-filmcoated copper grid.Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken over the diffraction angle range (2) 5-45 o using a Bruker D8 Discover X-Ray Diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu K radiation ( 0.154056 nm) at a scan rate of 0.021 s A 1 operated at 40 kV and 40 mA.The molecular structural information was determined from a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Thermo-Nicolet iS10) using a standard KBr pellet method.Each spectrum was recorded as the average of 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm A 1 from 4000 to 400 cm A 1 .The absorbance spectra of the samples were analyzed by a Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 100) equipped with an integrated sphere.The optical properties were measured at ambient temperature in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm.The Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Kratos Axis-Ultra DLD instrument with the Al K X-ray source (15 kV, 200 W) at a pressure of 7.6 A 10 A 9 Torr and a pass energy of 20 eV.The C 1 s peak at 284.6 eV of the surface carbon was used as an internal standard.Peak deconvolution was performed using OriginPro 8.5.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was done on a TA Instrument Q50 from room temperature to 900 1C at a constant heating rate of 10 1C min A 1 under N 2 condition.The specific surface area of the samples was evaluated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) of N 2 sorption at 77 K using the Micrometrics ASAP 2020.The samples were degassed at 180 1C for 4 h prior to the adsorption measurement.The photoluminescence (PL) measurements were recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, LS55) at room temperature.The samples were excited at a wavelength of 370 nm with a scanning speed of 600 nm min A 1 .The widths of excitation slit and emission slit were fixed at 10 nm. The catalytic activities were evaluated by the photoreduction of CO 2 at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure in a continuous, homemade gas flow photoreactor as reported in our previous work 45625,32.A 15 W energy-saving daylight lamp (Philips, TORNADO 15 W WW E27 220-240 V 1CT) was used as a visible light source and its light spectrum was provided in the previous reports 4,6,25.High purity of CO 2 (99.99) was bubbled in the water forming a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor into the reactor.Prior to light irradiation, wet CO 2 at a flow rate of 5 mL/min using a mass flow controller was purged inside the reactor loaded with 100 mg of photocatalysts for 30 min to ensure that the air in the reactor system was totally eliminated and also to achieve complete adsorption of gas molecules.After 30 min of purging, the light was turned on to initiate the photocatalytic reaction.The temperature in the reactor was closely monitored with a thermocouple attached to a digital temperature reader.The average focused intensity of the light was 8.5 mW cm A 2 by measuring with a pyranometer (Kipp and Zonen type CMP 6).The distance between the light source and the reactor was separated by 5 cm.During the reaction process, the product gases were collected every hour and then analyzed by a gas chromatography (GC) (Agilent 7890A) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) to determine the production rate of CH 4 .The entire reactor was enclosed in a black box to avoid any light interference from the surroundings.The photocatalytic experiments were conducted at least two times under the same experimental conditions to confirm the reproducibility of the photoactivity, in which concordant results with substantial small discrepancies (percentage errors of less than 5) were acquired.A detailed schematic diagram of the experimental set-up was depicted in Figure S2.The total evolution of CH 4 after 10 h of reaction was calculated based on Eq. 1.

The protonation pretreatment resulted in the positively charged g-C 3 N 4 , which was beneficial for improved interaction with negatively charged GO sheets.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 under a low-power energy-saving daylight lamp was considerably enhanced after the hybridization of rGO with pCN.For comparison, rGO/CN synthesized without any modification of surface charge of g-C 3 N 4 has also been prepared.The results indicated that the 15rGO/pCN produced remarkable 5.4-and 1.7-folds enhancement of CH 4 evolution over pCN and 15rGO/CN nanocomposites, respectively.The enhanced photocatalytic activity of 15rGO/pCN was attributed to the addition of rGO with pCN in a controlled manner and adequate intimate contact between rGO and pCN for effective charge transfer across the 2D/2D rGO/pCN layered heterojunction to retard the recombination of electron-hole pairs as supported by TEM, HRTEM, XPS and PL studies.Furthermore, the asprepared 15rGO/pCN photocatalyst demonstrated a high stability even after three test cycles under visible light irradiation without significant change in the CH 4 production.As a whole, our results highlight the significance of wellcontacted heterojunction interface between semiconductor and rGO, which could be engineered by a facile surface charge mediated self-assembly route.It is expected that our current work provides a new doorway on the fabrication of 2D/2D layered heterojunction with efficient charge separation.We hope that the simple charge modification strategy herein could be extended to the development of other rGO-based semiconductor photocatalysts and various multicomponent nanocomposites toward diverse photoredox processes for environmental remediation and energy conversion to combat the ever-increasing environmental alarms and fossil fuel depletion crisis.
