the CO 2 reduction photocatalyst.CuAlGaO 4 was prepared by the solid-state fusion method 13.First, powders of CuO, Al 2 O 3 , and Ga 2 O 3 were well mixed in the molar ratio of Cu:Al:Ga 1:1:1 and pulverized in a mortar to well disperse the mixed powders.The well-mixed powder was calcined at 1150 C for 12 h at a rate of 2 C/min in an oven.The calcined powder was then cooled to room temperature and further pulverized to obtain CuAlGaO 4 .Platinum (Pt) was loaded on CuAlGaO 4 by the photo-deposition method as described in the following steps.The H 2 PtCl 6 solution of required concentration was mixed with CuAlGaO 4 powder to give various wt of Pt loading (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 wt).The well-mixed solution was irradiated by an UV light, which was from the OmniCure series 1500 (USA) with output intensity 5 W/cm 2 , for 1.5 h to perform the photo-deposition process.During the process, the solution changed from light-yellow color to colorless, indicating the completion of Pt deposition.The solid product, Pt/CuAlGaO 4 , was centrifuged and washed by DI water several times to ensure that there was no residual Cl -on the material.Finally, the washed material was dried at 80 C in an oven to give Pt/CuAlGaO 4 powder. Pt/SrTiO 3 :Rh was used as the H 2 -generating photocatalyst.It was prepared by the sol-gel method similar to the one reported by Wang et al. 14.First, citric acid solution (3.1521 g of citric acid in 50 mL DI water) was mixed with RhCl 3 solution (0.0209 g of RhCl 3 in 20 mL DI water).Sr(NO) 3 powder was added into the above mixture in the molar ratio of citric acid:Sr(NO) 3 1:1.5 and well mixed.Few drops of glycol were then added into the mixture to stabilize the reaction while the pH of the mixture was maintained at 1.5.At this time, 4.2387 g of Ti(OBu) 4 was added into the mixture to start the sol-gel reaction.The mixture was allowed to react inside a dry glove box for 25 h to obtain the sol.The sol was then dried in an oven at 80 C and calcined at 1000 C for 10 h at a rate of 10 C/min under air condition.Finally, the calcined powder was then cooled to room temperature and further pulverized to obtain SrTiO 3 :Rh.Platinum (Pt) was loaded on SrTiO 3 :Rh by the photo-deposition method as described previously for the preparation of Pt/CuAlGaO 4 where the H 2 PtCl 6 solution of known concentration was mixed with SrTiO 3 :Rh powder to give 0.8 wt of Pt loading.Commercial WO 3 (99.9)supplied from Hayashi Pure Chemical was used as the O 2 -generating photocatalyst and pulverized prior to application. For photocatalyst characterization, the crystallinity of photocatalysts was obtained with a Bruker-D8-ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer (XRD) in the diffraction angle (2A) between 20 and 80 , using Cu K radiation as the source.The X-ray (wavelength 1.5405A) tube equipped with copper target was operated at 40 kV and 30 mA.The scanning rate was 3 /min.The crystal size was calculated using Scherrer's equation.The UV-vis absorption spectra of photocatalysts were measured by a diffusive reflectance UV-vis spectrometer (Varian Cary-100) in the wavelength range between 200 and 800 nm at a scanning rate of 120 nm/min.Field emission scanning electron micrograph (FE-SEM) was carried out on a Hitachi model S-800.The photocatalyst was sputtered with a thin film of Pt to prevent surface charging and to protect the surface material from thermal damage by the electron beam.Specific surface area of photocatalyst was identified by Brumauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method based on the Langmuir isotherm absorption.Before the BET measurement by Micromeritics ASAP2020/C5-05, the photocatalysts were heated at 300 C to remove water vapor and then nitrogen was introduced as the absorbate.For surface analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to identify the composition of photocatalysts by using Thermo Scientific, Theta probe X-ray with Mg target as the source to generate energy of 1253.6 eV.The passing energy was 200 eV with 30 scanning cycles. For the water splitting combined CO 2 photoreduction reaction, two sets of experiment were performed.In the first set, 0.30 g of Pt/CuAlGaO 4 in 2 mM FeCl 2 solution and 0.30 g of WO 3 in 2 mM FeCl 3 solution were placed respectively in the H 2 -generating compartment and the O 2 -generating compartment of a connected twin reactor separated by a circular Nafion membrane as shown in Fig. 2. The volume of solution in each compartment was 225 mL and the pH of solution was adjusted to 2.6 by adding sulfuric acid to prevent precipitation of the iron solution 15.During the photoreaction, the solution in each compartment was stirred and irradiated with a 300 W xenon (Xe) lamp placed at equal-distance from both compartments so that both solutions have received the same amount of light intensity (mostly visible light), which was around 270 mW/cm 2 .The purpose of performing the first set of experiment is to determine the optimum loading of Pt for Pt/CuAlGaO 4 which acted as both H 2 -generation and CO 2 reduction photocatalysts.In the second set of experiment, the conditions were the same as above except that 0.15 g of Pt/CuAlGaO 4 and 0.15 g of Pt/SrTiO 3 :Rh, acting as CO 2 reduction and H 2 -generating photocatalyst respectively, were placed in the H 2 -generating compartment.In addition, the light source used was a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with an AM1.5 G filter to give a light intensity of approximately 90 mW/cm 2 .Before light irradiation, ultra-pure Ar gas was introduced to purge the solution in the O 2 -generating compartment of the reactor system for 12 h to remove any dissolved gas while ultra-pure CO 2 gas was introduced to purge the solution in the H 2 -generating compartment.The produced oxygen and hydrogen gases in each compartment of the reactor system were collected separately every 2 h by an on-line sampling loop (1 mL) and further analyzed by the gas chromatography (China GC 2000) system equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and 3.5 m long molecular sieve 5A packed column to determine the concentration.Ultra-pure Ar (99.9995 v) was used as the carrier gas for GC.Moreover, the solution in the H 2 -generating compartment of the reactor system was sampled every 2 h and analyzed by another gas chromatography (China GC 2000) system equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and 2 m long Porapak QS packed column to determine the concentration of organic products or byproducts.A liquid sample of 1-10 L was taken from the reactor then injected in GC after filtering catalyst.Analysis results indicated that methanol was the dominant hydrocarbon.A calibration curve of methanol was established, and used to calculate the concentration from the GC integration area of FID peak.The concentration of methanol was converted to the total amount in the reactor based on the volume ratio of reactor and injected sample.To further increase the detection limit of CO, the GC was also connected to a methanizer which selectively transforms CO to CH 4 with H 2 at 360 C using a Ni catalyst.The injected sample was separated by the GC column first, and then carried by helium into the methanizer.After the CO signal appeared on the GC spectrum, the sample stream was switched to another exit to avoid high concentration CO 2 being carried into the methanizer.Then the sample stream was switched back to analyze other products after purging out CO 2 .Thus CO can be quantitatively measured indirectly by the FID in the GC."}, {"llm generation": "CuGaAlO 4", "source": "Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of (a) CuGaAlO 4 , (b) Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , (c) WO 3 and (d) Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh with 10 K magnification.", "context": "Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of (a) CuGaAlO 4 , (b) Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , (c) WO 3 and (d) Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh with 10 K magnification.It is apparent that CuGaAlO 4 has cubelike shape and smooth surfaces, while WO 3 has sphere-like shape and smaller particle size comparing with CuGaAlO 4 .In contrary, SrTiO 3 :Rh has irregular shape compared with other photocatalysts.It is also noted that loading of Pt on CuGaAlO 4 or SrTiO 3 :Rh could not be observed and did not change the shape and morphology of the photocatalyst (image of SrTiO 3 :Rh is not shown) after the Pt photo-deposition.To further investigate the chemical composition of the prepared photocatalysts, EDS analysis was performed and the results are shown in Table 1.For CuGaAlO 4 based photocatalysts, the ratio of Cu:Ga:Al:O is roughly near the stoichiometric ratio, confirming the presence of CuGaAlO 4 .Moreover, signal of Pt was observed for Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , suggesting that Pt was successfully loaded on the photocatalyst.For WO 3 , the ratio of W to O detected is consistent with its stoichiometric ratio, which is 1 to 3. As for Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh, the ratio of Sr:Ti:O is approximately to the stoichiometric ratio 1:1:3, suggesting the presence of SrTiO 3 .However, photo-deposited Pt and doped Rh were not detectable by EDS due to very small amounts.Another evidence for the existence of Pt particles on the surface of Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 and Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh is revealed from the XPS analysis.The XPS spectra of Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 and Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh shown in Fig. 4 elucidate the chemical status of Pt on the surface of CuGaAlO 4 and SrTiO 3 :Rh.Two binding-energy peaks are observed in the XPS spectra of Pt for both photocatalysts.The peaks at To investigate the crystallinity of the prepared photocatalysts, X-ray diffraction spectrometry was conducted.Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of CuGaAlO 4 , Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh and WO 3 .For CuGaAlO 4 , its XRD pattern is identical to that reported in the literature 13.The loading of Pt did not change the XRD pattern of CuGaAlO 4 because only small amount of Pt was present.The crystallinity of Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh The activity of prepared photocatalyst toward oxygen, hydrogen and hydrocarbon generation is demonstrated by conducting the water splitting combined CO 2 photoreduction in the twin reactor under visible-light irradiation.Fig. 7(a) shows the hydrogen produced per gram of photocatalyst in the H 2 -generating compartment of the twin reactor for different Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalysts with various Pt loadings.After 6 h of reaction, the total amount of hydrogen produced seems to increase with the amount of Pt loaded on the CuGaAlO 4 photocatalyst up to Pt loading of 1.0.This implies that loading of Pt can improve the activity of photocatalyst by trapping photogenerated electrons to minimize electron-hole recombination 17.However, as Pt loading reaches 1.5, the loaded Pt particles may aggregate on the surface of the CuGaAlO 4 , leading to reduced surface area of active sites on the photocatalyst and lower photoactivity.The Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalyst used in this set of experiment can act not only as H 2 -generating photocatalyst, but also as CO 2 reduction photocatalyst.for different Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalysts.Apparently, the trend of methanol produced is similar to that of hydrogen generated, i.e., the amount of methanol produced is directly proportional to the amount of Pt loaded on CuGaAlO 4 , with the exception of Pt loading of 1.5.The result confirms that Pt/CuGaAlO 4 indeed can be a H 2 -generating photocatalyst and a CO 2 reduction photocatalyst.Moreover, the hydrogen generated via water splitting can facilitate CO 2 photoreduction to form methanol.It is noteworthy that the rate of methanol production starts to decrease after 2 h of photoreaction.We had detected trace amount of acetaldehyde in some experiments.Thus one possibility is that methanol converts to 2carbon compounds by the secondary reaction although we did not measured them quantitatively.The other reason may be attributed the oxidization by the photogenerated holes on Pt/CuGaAlO 4 , while photogenerated electrons are used to reduce protons to form hydrogen.However, the holes on Pt/CuGaAlO 4 (or Pt/SrTiO3:Rh) should have much higher possibility to be quickly neutralized by the Fe 2 than to oxidize methanol because of high concentration of Fe 2 (2 mM) in the H 2 -generating compartment.Fig. 7(c) shows the amount of CO produced, an intermediate of CO 2 photoreduction, in the H 2 -generating compartment of the twin reactor for different Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalysts.In general, the yield of CO increases initially, and then decreases as the photoreaction goes on.This is because CO is an intermediate species.As the reaction proceeds, CO produced will be further reduced to methanol.Again, Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 exhibits the most drastic change in CO concentration, implying that Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 is the most active photocatalyst among those tested.Based on the results above, it is concluded that the optimal loading of Pt on CuGaAlO 4 in this study is 1.0 and hydrogen has a positive effect on methanol yield. To further improve the efficiency of CO 2 photoreduction, Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , as the optimal CO 2 reduction photocatalyst, was combined with a highly efficient H 2 -generating photocatalyst, Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh 15, and placed in the H 2 -generating compartment of the twin reactor to carry out the same photoreaction again.This time, the light source used was a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with AM1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight.The yields of oxygen (in O 2 -generating compartment), hydrogen (in H 2 -generating compartment), methanol (in H 2 -generating compartment) and CO (in H 2 -generating compartment) are shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b).It is interesting to note that the yield of hydrogen is lower than that of oxygen, different from the result of typical water splitting.This is due to the fact that part of the hydrogen produced was consumed by the CO 2 reduction reaction.Furthermore, the trend of methanol production is inversely correlated with the trend of CO production as expected, meaning that CO as an intermediate was oxidized and consumed to form methanol.To compare the photoreduction efficiency of single photocatalyst system (Pt/CuGaAlO 4 only as the reduction photocatalyst) with that of dual photocatalyst system (Pt/CuGaAlO 4 and Pt/SrTiO 3 :Rh as the reduction photocatalyst), a term called photoreduction quantum efficiency (PQE) is defined as shown in Eq. ( 4): where n e is the number of moles of electrons needed to reduce 1 mole of reactant to 1 mole of product.The rate of incident photon can be calculated by Eq. ( 5): hc/ (J/ of photon) Incident photon rate (5) where I int is the incident light intensity, A proj is the area of light irradiation projected on the reactor (3.89 10 -3 m 2 ), h is the Plank constant, c is the speed of light and is the wavelength of light (assume 555 nm, the wavelength used by the light meter for intensity measurement).The results of product formation rates, incident photon rates and total PQEs for single photocatalyst system and dual photocatalyst system are summarized in Product amount (umol) further promotes the efficiency of CO 2 photoreduction.To further prove that hydrogen produced was utilized to carry out the CO 2 reduction reaction, molar ratio of the generated hydrogen to oxygen was calculated by Eq. ( 6): where nH 2 is the number of moles of hydrogen produced, n CH 3 OH is the number of methanol produced and n CO is the number of oxygen produced.The above equation assumes that hydrogenation of CO 2 carried out in this study is most likely to form methanol and carbon monoxide according to Eqs. ( 2) and (3), which is reasonable due to their negative Gibbs free energy values.In fact, methanol and carbon monoxide are the two major species detected in this study.Eq. ( 6) also assumes that 1 mole of methanol produced will consume 3 moles of hydrogen, whereas 1 mole of carbon monoxide produced will only consume 1 mole of hydrogen.The calculated hydrogen-to-oxygen molar ratio is 2.05 and 1.89 for single and dual photocatalyst system respectively (Table 2), nearly matching with the ideal hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio in water which is 2.This implies that most of the hydrogen produced during the water splitting indeed was used by the CO 2 reduction reaction to form methanol and carbon monoxide."}, {"llm generation": "WO 3", "source": "Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of (a) CuGaAlO 4 , (b) Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , (c) WO 3 and (d) Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh with 10 K magnification.", "context": "Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of (a) CuGaAlO 4 , (b) Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , (c) WO 3 and (d) Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh with 10 K magnification.It is apparent that CuGaAlO 4 has cubelike shape and smooth surfaces, while WO 3 has sphere-like shape and smaller particle size comparing with CuGaAlO 4 .In contrary, SrTiO 3 :Rh has irregular shape compared with other photocatalysts.It is also noted that loading of Pt on CuGaAlO 4 or SrTiO 3 :Rh could not be observed and did not change the shape and morphology of the photocatalyst (image of SrTiO 3 :Rh is not shown) after the Pt photo-deposition.To further investigate the chemical composition of the prepared photocatalysts, EDS analysis was performed and the results are shown in Table 1.For CuGaAlO 4 based photocatalysts, the ratio of Cu:Ga:Al:O is roughly near the stoichiometric ratio, confirming the presence of CuGaAlO 4 .Moreover, signal of Pt was observed for Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , suggesting that Pt was successfully loaded on the photocatalyst.For WO 3 , the ratio of W to O detected is consistent with its stoichiometric ratio, which is 1 to 3.

As for Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh, the ratio of Sr:Ti:O is approximately to the stoichiometric ratio 1:1:3, suggesting the presence of SrTiO 3 .However, photo-deposited Pt and doped Rh were not detectable by EDS due to very small amounts.Another evidence for the existence of Pt particles on the surface of Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 and Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh is revealed from the XPS analysis.The XPS spectra of Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 and Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh shown in Fig. 4 elucidate the chemical status of Pt on the surface of CuGaAlO 4 and SrTiO 3 :Rh.Two binding-energy peaks are observed in the XPS spectra of Pt for both photocatalysts.The peaks at To investigate the crystallinity of the prepared photocatalysts, X-ray diffraction spectrometry was conducted.Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of CuGaAlO 4 , Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh and WO 3 .For CuGaAlO 4 , its XRD pattern is identical to that reported in the literature 13.The loading of Pt did not change the XRD pattern of CuGaAlO 4 because only small amount of Pt was present.The crystallinity of Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh The activity of prepared photocatalyst toward oxygen, hydrogen and hydrocarbon generation is demonstrated by conducting the water splitting combined CO 2 photoreduction in the twin reactor under visible-light irradiation.Fig. 7(a) shows the hydrogen produced per gram of photocatalyst in the H 2 -generating compartment of the twin reactor for different Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalysts with various Pt loadings.After 6 h of reaction, the total amount of hydrogen produced seems to increase with the amount of Pt loaded on the CuGaAlO 4 photocatalyst up to Pt loading of 1.0.This implies that loading of Pt can improve the activity of photocatalyst by trapping photogenerated electrons to minimize electron-hole recombination 17.However, as Pt loading reaches 1.5, the loaded Pt particles may aggregate on the surface of the CuGaAlO 4 , leading to reduced surface area of active sites on the photocatalyst and lower photoactivity.The Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalyst used in this set of experiment can act not only as H 2 -generating photocatalyst, but also as CO 2 reduction photocatalyst.for different Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalysts.Apparently, the trend of methanol produced is similar to that of hydrogen generated, i.e., the amount of methanol produced is directly proportional to the amount of Pt loaded on CuGaAlO 4 , with the exception of Pt loading of 1.5.The result confirms that Pt/CuGaAlO 4 indeed can be a H 2 -generating photocatalyst and a CO 2 reduction photocatalyst.Moreover, the hydrogen generated via water splitting can facilitate CO 2 photoreduction to form methanol.It is noteworthy that the rate of methanol production starts to decrease after 2 h of photoreaction.We had detected trace amount of acetaldehyde in some experiments.Thus one possibility is that methanol converts to 2carbon compounds by the secondary reaction although we did not measured them quantitatively.The other reason may be attributed the oxidization by the photogenerated holes on Pt/CuGaAlO 4 , while photogenerated electrons are used to reduce protons to form hydrogen.However, the holes on Pt/CuGaAlO 4 (or Pt/SrTiO3:Rh) should have much higher possibility to be quickly neutralized by the Fe 2 than to oxidize methanol because of high concentration of Fe 2 (2 mM) in the H 2 -generating compartment.Fig. 7(c) shows the amount of CO produced, an intermediate of CO 2 photoreduction, in the H 2 -generating compartment of the twin reactor for different Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalysts.In general, the yield of CO increases initially, and then decreases as the photoreaction goes on.This is because CO is an intermediate species.As the reaction proceeds, CO produced will be further reduced to methanol.Again, Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 exhibits the most drastic change in CO concentration, implying that Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 is the most active photocatalyst among those tested.Based on the results above, it is concluded that the optimal loading of Pt on CuGaAlO 4 in this study is 1.0 and hydrogen has a positive effect on methanol yield. To further improve the efficiency of CO 2 photoreduction, Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , as the optimal CO 2 reduction photocatalyst, was combined with a highly efficient H 2 -generating photocatalyst, Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh 15, and placed in the H 2 -generating compartment of the twin reactor to carry out the same photoreaction again.This time, the light source used was a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with AM1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight.The yields of oxygen (in O 2 -generating compartment), hydrogen (in H 2 -generating compartment), methanol (in H 2 -generating compartment) and CO (in H 2 -generating compartment) are shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b).It is interesting to note that the yield of hydrogen is lower than that of oxygen, different from the result of typical water splitting.This is due to the fact that part of the hydrogen produced was consumed by the CO 2 reduction reaction.Furthermore, the trend of methanol production is inversely correlated with the trend of CO production as expected, meaning that CO as an intermediate was oxidized and consumed to form methanol.To compare the photoreduction efficiency of single photocatalyst system (Pt/CuGaAlO 4 only as the reduction photocatalyst) with that of dual photocatalyst system (Pt/CuGaAlO 4 and Pt/SrTiO 3 :Rh as the reduction photocatalyst), a term called photoreduction quantum efficiency (PQE) is defined as shown in Eq. ( 4): where n e is the number of moles of electrons needed to reduce 1 mole of reactant to 1 mole of product.The rate of incident photon can be calculated by Eq. ( 5): hc/ (J/ of photon) Incident photon rate (5) where I int is the incident light intensity, A proj is the area of light irradiation projected on the reactor (3.89 10 -3 m 2 ), h is the Plank constant, c is the speed of light and is the wavelength of light (assume 555 nm, the wavelength used by the light meter for intensity measurement).The results of product formation rates, incident photon rates and total PQEs for single photocatalyst system and dual photocatalyst system are summarized in Product amount (umol) further promotes the efficiency of CO 2 photoreduction.To further prove that hydrogen produced was utilized to carry out the CO 2 reduction reaction, molar ratio of the generated hydrogen to oxygen was calculated by Eq. ( 6): where nH 2 is the number of moles of hydrogen produced, n CH 3 OH is the number of methanol produced and n CO is the number of oxygen produced.The above equation assumes that hydrogenation of CO 2 carried out in this study is most likely to form methanol and carbon monoxide according to Eqs.

( 6): where nH 2 is the number of moles of hydrogen produced, n CH 3 OH is the number of methanol produced and n CO is the number of oxygen produced.The above equation assumes that hydrogenation of CO 2 carried out in this study is most likely to form methanol and carbon monoxide according to Eqs. ( 2) and (3), which is reasonable due to their negative Gibbs free energy values.In fact, methanol and carbon monoxide are the two major species detected in this study.Eq. ( 6) also assumes that 1 mole of methanol produced will consume 3 moles of hydrogen, whereas 1 mole of carbon monoxide produced will only consume 1 mole of hydrogen.The calculated hydrogen-to-oxygen molar ratio is 2.05 and 1.89 for single and dual photocatalyst system respectively (Table 2), nearly matching with the ideal hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio in water which is 2.This implies that most of the hydrogen produced during the water splitting indeed was used by the CO 2 reduction reaction to form methanol and carbon monoxide."}, {"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "This time, the light source used was a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with AM1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight.", "context": "Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of (a) CuGaAlO 4 , (b) Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , (c) WO 3 and (d) Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh with 10 K magnification.It is apparent that CuGaAlO 4 has cubelike shape and smooth surfaces, while WO 3 has sphere-like shape and smaller particle size comparing with CuGaAlO 4 .In contrary, SrTiO 3 :Rh has irregular shape compared with other photocatalysts.It is also noted that loading of Pt on CuGaAlO 4 or SrTiO 3 :Rh could not be observed and did not change the shape and morphology of the photocatalyst (image of SrTiO 3 :Rh is not shown) after the Pt photo-deposition.To further investigate the chemical composition of the prepared photocatalysts, EDS analysis was performed and the results are shown in Table 1.For CuGaAlO 4 based photocatalysts, the ratio of Cu:Ga:Al:O is roughly near the stoichiometric ratio, confirming the presence of CuGaAlO 4 .Moreover, signal of Pt was observed for Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , suggesting that Pt was successfully loaded on the photocatalyst.For WO 3 , the ratio of W to O detected is consistent with its stoichiometric ratio, which is 1 to 3.

( 5): hc/ (J/ of photon) Incident photon rate (5) where I int is the incident light intensity, A proj is the area of light irradiation projected on the reactor (3.89 10 -3 m 2 ), h is the Plank constant, c is the speed of light and is the wavelength of light (assume 555 nm, the wavelength used by the light meter for intensity measurement).The results of product formation rates, incident photon rates and total PQEs for single photocatalyst system and dual photocatalyst system are summarized in Product amount (umol) further promotes the efficiency of CO 2 photoreduction.To further prove that hydrogen produced was utilized to carry out the CO 2 reduction reaction, molar ratio of the generated hydrogen to oxygen was calculated by Eq. ( 6): where nH 2 is the number of moles of hydrogen produced, n CH 3 OH is the number of methanol produced and n CO is the number of oxygen produced.The above equation assumes that hydrogenation of CO 2 carried out in this study is most likely to form methanol and carbon monoxide according to Eqs. ( 2) and (3), which is reasonable due to their negative Gibbs free energy values.In fact, methanol and carbon monoxide are the two major species detected in this study.Eq. ( 6) also assumes that 1 mole of methanol produced will consume 3 moles of hydrogen, whereas 1 mole of carbon monoxide produced will only consume 1 mole of hydrogen.The calculated hydrogen-to-oxygen molar ratio is 2.05 and 1.89 for single and dual photocatalyst system respectively (Table 2), nearly matching with the ideal hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio in water which is 2.This implies that most of the hydrogen produced during the water splitting indeed was used by the CO 2 reduction reaction to form methanol and carbon monoxide."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "First part of this study was to evaluate the activity of various Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalysts under visible light.", "context": "In this study, a novel twin reactor was used to mimic natural photosynthesis, which is the best way to convert CO 2 into energy and simultaneously reduce the global CO 2 level.The advantage of twin reactor is that O 2 is isolated from the reduction reaction so the backward oxidation of H 2 and hydrocarbons can be prevented.First part of this study was to evaluate the activity of various Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalysts under visible light.It was found that Pt loading of 1.0 wt gave the highest photoactivity in terms of hydrogen and methanol production.In the second part of this study, Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 was selected and combined with a highly efficient H 2 -generating photocatalyst, Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh to perform the same photoreaction again under AM1.5G.The incorporation of a H 2 -generating photocatalyst significantly improved the efficiency of the photoreduction reaction.The PQE has been increased by more than 2-fold from 0.0019 to 0.0051.The improvement is mainly due to the fact that Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh is a better H 2 -generating photocatalyst than Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 and the enhanced H 2 yield further promotes the efficiency of CO 2 photoreduction.Currently the overall quantum efficiency of CO 2 photoreduction is still low compared with nature photosynthesis.However, the twin-reactor system is not optimized to achieve a maximum efficiency, e.g., the best combination of H 2 -generation and CO 2 reduction catalysts.We expect the PQE of twin reactor can be significantly improved by further study. g) 2H 2 O(l) CH 3 OH(l) 3/2O 2 (g) G o , H o 701, 727 kJ/mol (1) CO 2 (g) 3H 2 (g) CH 3 OH(l) H 2 O(l) G o , H o -10.7,-137.8 kJ/mol (2) CO 2 (g) H 2 (g) CO(g) H 2 O(l) G o , H o -1.06,107.7 kJ/mol (3) Fig. 1.Concept of photosynthesis.

The volume of solution in each compartment was 225 mL and the pH of solution was adjusted to 2.6 by adding sulfuric acid to prevent precipitation of the iron solution 15.During the photoreaction, the solution in each compartment was stirred and irradiated with a 300 W xenon (Xe) lamp placed at equal-distance from both compartments so that both solutions have received the same amount of light intensity (mostly visible light), which was around 270 mW/cm 2 .The purpose of performing the first set of experiment is to determine the optimum loading of Pt for Pt/CuAlGaO 4 which acted as both H 2 -generation and CO 2 reduction photocatalysts.In the second set of experiment, the conditions were the same as above except that 0.15 g of Pt/CuAlGaO 4 and 0.15 g of Pt/SrTiO 3 :Rh, acting as CO 2 reduction and H 2 -generating photocatalyst respectively, were placed in the H 2 -generating compartment.In addition, the light source used was a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with an AM1.5 G filter to give a light intensity of approximately 90 mW/cm 2 .Before light irradiation, ultra-pure Ar gas was introduced to purge the solution in the O 2 -generating compartment of the reactor system for 12 h to remove any dissolved gas while ultra-pure CO 2 gas was introduced to purge the solution in the H 2 -generating compartment.The produced oxygen and hydrogen gases in each compartment of the reactor system were collected separately every 2 h by an on-line sampling loop (1 mL) and further analyzed by the gas chromatography (China GC 2000) system equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and 3.5 m long molecular sieve 5A packed column to determine the concentration.Ultra-pure Ar (99.9995 v) was used as the carrier gas for GC.Moreover, the solution in the H 2 -generating compartment of the reactor system was sampled every 2 h and analyzed by another gas chromatography (China GC 2000) system equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and 2 m long Porapak QS packed column to determine the concentration of organic products or byproducts.A liquid sample of 1-10 L was taken from the reactor then injected in GC after filtering catalyst.Analysis results indicated that methanol was the dominant hydrocarbon.A calibration curve of methanol was established, and used to calculate the concentration from the GC integration area of FID peak.The concentration of methanol was converted to the total amount in the reactor based on the volume ratio of reactor and injected sample.To further increase the detection limit of CO, the GC was also connected to a methanizer which selectively transforms CO to CH 4 with H 2 at 360 C using a Ni catalyst.The injected sample was separated by the GC column first, and then carried by helium into the methanizer.After the CO signal appeared on the GC spectrum, the sample stream was switched to another exit to avoid high concentration CO 2 being carried into the methanizer.Then the sample stream was switched back to analyze other products after purging out CO 2 .Thus CO can be quantitatively measured indirectly by the FID in the GC."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "This time, the light source used was a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with AM1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight.", "context": "Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of (a) CuGaAlO 4 , (b) Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , (c) WO 3 and (d) Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh with 10 K magnification.It is apparent that CuGaAlO 4 has cubelike shape and smooth surfaces, while WO 3 has sphere-like shape and smaller particle size comparing with CuGaAlO 4 .In contrary, SrTiO 3 :Rh has irregular shape compared with other photocatalysts.It is also noted that loading of Pt on CuGaAlO 4 or SrTiO 3 :Rh could not be observed and did not change the shape and morphology of the photocatalyst (image of SrTiO 3 :Rh is not shown) after the Pt photo-deposition.To further investigate the chemical composition of the prepared photocatalysts, EDS analysis was performed and the results are shown in Table 1.For CuGaAlO 4 based photocatalysts, the ratio of Cu:Ga:Al:O is roughly near the stoichiometric ratio, confirming the presence of CuGaAlO 4 .Moreover, signal of Pt was observed for Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , suggesting that Pt was successfully loaded on the photocatalyst.For WO 3 , the ratio of W to O detected is consistent with its stoichiometric ratio, which is 1 to 3. As for Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh, the ratio of Sr:Ti:O is approximately to the stoichiometric ratio 1:1:3, suggesting the presence of SrTiO 3 .However, photo-deposited Pt and doped Rh were not detectable by EDS due to very small amounts.Another evidence for the existence of Pt particles on the surface of Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 and Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh is revealed from the XPS analysis.The XPS spectra of Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 and Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh shown in Fig. 4 elucidate the chemical status of Pt on the surface of CuGaAlO 4 and SrTiO 3 :Rh.Two binding-energy peaks are observed in the XPS spectra of Pt for both photocatalysts.The peaks at To investigate the crystallinity of the prepared photocatalysts, X-ray diffraction spectrometry was conducted.Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of CuGaAlO 4 , Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh and WO 3 .For CuGaAlO 4 , its XRD pattern is identical to that reported in the literature 13.The loading of Pt did not change the XRD pattern of CuGaAlO 4 because only small amount of Pt was present.The crystallinity of Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh The activity of prepared photocatalyst toward oxygen, hydrogen and hydrocarbon generation is demonstrated by conducting the water splitting combined CO 2 photoreduction in the twin reactor under visible-light irradiation.Fig. 7(a) shows the hydrogen produced per gram of photocatalyst in the H 2 -generating compartment of the twin reactor for different Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalysts with various Pt loadings.After 6 h of reaction, the total amount of hydrogen produced seems to increase with the amount of Pt loaded on the CuGaAlO 4 photocatalyst up to Pt loading of 1.0.This implies that loading of Pt can improve the activity of photocatalyst by trapping photogenerated electrons to minimize electron-hole recombination 17.However, as Pt loading reaches 1.5, the loaded Pt particles may aggregate on the surface of the CuGaAlO 4 , leading to reduced surface area of active sites on the photocatalyst and lower photoactivity.The Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalyst used in this set of experiment can act not only as H 2 -generating photocatalyst, but also as CO 2 reduction photocatalyst.for different Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalysts.Apparently, the trend of methanol produced is similar to that of hydrogen generated, i.e., the amount of methanol produced is directly proportional to the amount of Pt loaded on CuGaAlO 4 , with the exception of Pt loading of 1.5.The result confirms that Pt/CuGaAlO 4 indeed can be a H 2 -generating photocatalyst and a CO 2 reduction photocatalyst.Moreover, the hydrogen generated via water splitting can facilitate CO 2 photoreduction to form methanol.It is noteworthy that the rate of methanol production starts to decrease after 2 h of photoreaction.We had detected trace amount of acetaldehyde in some experiments.Thus one possibility is that methanol converts to 2carbon compounds by the secondary reaction although we did not measured them quantitatively.The other reason may be attributed the oxidization by the photogenerated holes on Pt/CuGaAlO 4 , while photogenerated electrons are used to reduce protons to form hydrogen.However, the holes on Pt/CuGaAlO 4 (or Pt/SrTiO3:Rh) should have much higher possibility to be quickly neutralized by the Fe 2 than to oxidize methanol because of high concentration of Fe 2 (2 mM) in the H 2 -generating compartment.Fig. 7(c) shows the amount of CO produced, an intermediate of CO 2 photoreduction, in the H 2 -generating compartment of the twin reactor for different Pt/CuGaAlO 4 photocatalysts.In general, the yield of CO increases initially, and then decreases as the photoreaction goes on.This is because CO is an intermediate species.As the reaction proceeds, CO produced will be further reduced to methanol.Again, Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 exhibits the most drastic change in CO concentration, implying that Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 is the most active photocatalyst among those tested.Based on the results above, it is concluded that the optimal loading of Pt on CuGaAlO 4 in this study is 1.0 and hydrogen has a positive effect on methanol yield. To further improve the efficiency of CO 2 photoreduction, Pt(1.0 wt)/CuGaAlO 4 , as the optimal CO 2 reduction photocatalyst, was combined with a highly efficient H 2 -generating photocatalyst, Pt(0.8 wt)/SrTiO 3 :Rh 15, and placed in the H 2 -generating compartment of the twin reactor to carry out the same photoreaction again.This time, the light source used was a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with AM1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight.The yields of oxygen (in O 2 -generating compartment), hydrogen (in H 2 -generating compartment), methanol (in H 2 -generating compartment) and CO (in H 2 -generating compartment) are shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b).It is interesting to note that the yield of hydrogen is lower than that of oxygen, different from the result of typical water splitting.This is due to the fact that part of the hydrogen produced was consumed by the CO 2 reduction reaction.Furthermore, the trend of methanol production is inversely correlated with the trend of CO production as expected, meaning that CO as an intermediate was oxidized and consumed to form methanol.To compare the photoreduction efficiency of single photocatalyst system (Pt/CuGaAlO 4 only as the reduction photocatalyst) with that of dual photocatalyst system (Pt/CuGaAlO 4 and Pt/SrTiO 3 :Rh as the reduction photocatalyst), a term called photoreduction quantum efficiency (PQE) is defined as shown in Eq. ( 4): where n e is the number of moles of electrons needed to reduce 1 mole of reactant to 1 mole of product.The rate of incident photon can be calculated by Eq. ( 5): hc/ (J/ of photon) Incident photon rate (5) where I int is the incident light intensity, A proj is the area of light irradiation projected on the reactor (3.89 10 -3 m 2 ), h is the Plank constant, c is the speed of light and is the wavelength of light (assume 555 nm, the wavelength used by the light meter for intensity measurement).The results of product formation rates, incident photon rates and total PQEs for single photocatalyst system and dual photocatalyst system are summarized in Product amount (umol) further promotes the efficiency of CO 2 photoreduction.To further prove that hydrogen produced was utilized to carry out the CO 2 reduction reaction, molar ratio of the generated hydrogen to oxygen was calculated by Eq. ( 6): where nH 2 is the number of moles of hydrogen produced, n CH 3 OH is the number of methanol produced and n CO is the number of oxygen produced.The above equation assumes that hydrogenation of CO 2 carried out in this study is most likely to form methanol and carbon monoxide according to Eqs. ( 2) and (3), which is reasonable due to their negative Gibbs free energy values.In fact, methanol and carbon monoxide are the two major species detected in this study.Eq. ( 6) also assumes that 1 mole of methanol produced will consume 3 moles of hydrogen, whereas 1 mole of carbon monoxide produced will only consume 1 mole of hydrogen.The calculated hydrogen-to-oxygen molar ratio is 2.05 and 1.89 for single and dual photocatalyst system respectively (Table 2), nearly matching with the ideal hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio in water which is 2.This implies that most of the hydrogen produced during the water splitting indeed was used by the CO 2 reduction reaction to form methanol and carbon monoxide."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "In the first set, 0.30 g of Pt/CuAlGaO 4 in 2 mM FeCl 2 solution and 0.30 g of WO 3 in 2 mM FeCl 3 solution were placed respectively in the H 2 -generating compartment and the O 2 -generating compartment of a connected twin reactor separated by a circular Nafion membrane as shown in Fig. 2.", "context": "In this study, Pt/CuAlGaO 4 was used mainly as the CO 2 reduction photocatalyst.CuAlGaO 4 was prepared by the solid-state fusion method 13.First, powders of CuO, Al 2 O 3 , and Ga 2 O 3 were well mixed in the molar ratio of Cu:Al:Ga 1:1:1 and pulverized in a mortar to well disperse the mixed powders.The well-mixed powder was calcined at 1150 C for 12 h at a rate of 2 C/min in an oven.The calcined powder was then cooled to room temperature and further pulverized to obtain CuAlGaO 4 .Platinum (Pt) was loaded on CuAlGaO 4 by the photo-deposition method as described in the following steps.The H 2 PtCl 6 solution of required concentration was mixed with CuAlGaO 4 powder to give various wt of Pt loading (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 wt).The well-mixed solution was irradiated by an UV light, which was from the OmniCure series 1500 (USA) with output intensity 5 W/cm 2 , for 1.5 h to perform the photo-deposition process.During the process, the solution changed from light-yellow color to colorless, indicating the completion of Pt deposition.The solid product, Pt/CuAlGaO 4 , was centrifuged and washed by DI water several times to ensure that there was no residual Cl -on the material.Finally, the washed material was dried at 80 C in an oven to give Pt/CuAlGaO 4 powder.
