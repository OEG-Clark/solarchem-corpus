through a sol-gel method modified from the work reported by Collazzo et al. 46.In this work, titanium (IV) isopropoxide (Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 : Aldrich, 97 purity) was used as a TiO 2 precursor.A certain volume of ammonia solution (QReC, 28 w/w) was added dropwise into titanium (IV) isopropoxide solution at a rate of 1 ml min -1 to initiate the hydrolysis process, and then the obtained mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min.After that, the mixture was dried at 100 C for 2 h and calcined in air at 400 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 C min -1 .The yellow powder catalyst was obtained.The nitrogen concentrations based on titanium in the catalyst were varied in the range of 5-15 wt N. The second step was the modification of N-doped TiO 2 by commercial Spirulina using incipient wetness impregnation method.Briefly, Spirulina pellets (the biological and chemical composition of Spirulina are shown in Table S1) were ground and dissolved in deionized water and then added onto N-TiO 2 catalyst.The loading amount of Spirulina was based on chlorophyll a in Spirulina, which can be calculated from Eq. ( 1) 47: where A 645 and A 663 are absorbances at 645 and 663 nm, respectively, measured by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer.The obtained mixture was continuously stirred at 40 C overnight until water was completely evaporated.The percentages of chlorophyll a in Spirulina-modified TiO 2 catalysts used in this study were 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 wt.The obtained catalysts was labeled as xSp/yN-TiO 2 , where x and y are the weight percentages of chlorophyll a in Spirulina and nitrogen, respectively.For comparison, the undoped TiO 2 was also prepared by titanium (IV) isopropoxide hydrolysis with deionized water using the same procedure as that of N-doped catalyst. Nitrogen sorption isotherms of the catalysts were measured at -196 C using a Quantachrome Autosorp-1C instrument.Prior to sorption measurements, the catalysts were degassed at 200 C. The specific surface area of the catalysts was obtained by using Brunauer-Emmert-Teller (BET) analysis in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range between 0.05 and 0.3.Pore size distribution was calculated by using Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.The specific pore volumes were measured at a relative pressure of 0.995. The crystalline phase of TiO 2 catalysts was analyzed by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD: Bruker D8 Advance) operated with monochromated Cu K radiation (40 kV to 40 mA) at room temperature.TiO 2 crystallite size was calculated by means of the Scherrer equation. The morphology, size, and lattice structure of the catalysts were examined by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM: JEOL JEM-2010 instrument) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM: JEOL, JSM-7600F) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS: OXFORD, X-Max N ) operated at 15 keV with Pt-coated was performed to examine the catalyst morphologies and to map surface elements of the catalysts. The functional groups of the catalysts were examined by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR: Bruker TENSOR 27) equipped with a DTGS detector in the range of 4000-400 cm -1 . The optical property and band gap energy of the catalysts were recorded with UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS: JASCO, V-670) using BaSO 4 as a reflectance standard.To obtain the band gap energy, the original reflectance spectra were transformed to the plot of ( h ) 1/2 as a function of photon energy (h ) to be in accordance with the theoretical equation as shown below: where is the absorption coefficient, A is a constant, and E g is the band gap energy.The band gap energy was determined from the cross point of the tangent line through the maximum slope with its lower curve baseline. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), carried out at beamline 3.2a of the synchrotron light research institute (SLRI), Thailand, was used to identify the surface atomic concentrations and chemical states of the catalysts.The photoelectron spectra were collected through a Thermo VG Scientific Alpha110 energy analyzer with the maximum photon energy of 600 eV and the energy step of 0.1 eV.The C 1s peak at 284.6 eV was used as a reference peak for all binding energies. Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL: AvaSpec-2048TEC, Avantes) was carried out at room temperature in the range of 300-700 nm using an excitation wavelength of 255 nm to examine the charge transfer process of catalysts. The local geometry of Ti in the modified-TiO 2 catalysts was examined by using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) at beamline 8 of the SLRI, Thailand.A Ge (220) double crystal monochromator was used for photon energy selection.XANES spectra were recorded at room temperature in the transmission mode using ionization chambers with the energy range of 4940-5050 eV and the step of 0.2 eV.Titanium metallic foil was used for calibration at the Ti k-edge at 4966 eV.The obtained spectra were corrected for background absorptions and normalized by Athena program. The experiments on CO 2 photoreduction with water over the modified TiO 2 catalysts were carried out in a photoreactor system as shown in Fig. 1.The compact fluorescent integrated bulbs (Philips Tornado: 6 bulbs, 13 watt) located around a continuous flow stirred slurry reactor (CFSSR) were used as the visible light source.The light intensity at the catalyst zone was approximately 0.37 0.05 mW cm -2 , and wavelengths were in the range of 400-800 nm.Prior to experiment, 0.25 g of each catalyst was loaded into the CFSSR which contained 250 ml distilled water.The catalyst concentration was fixed as 1 g-dm -3 to avoid the effect of light scattering and achieve the maximum ability of light to reach every catalyst particle 28,48,49.A magnetic stirrer placed at the bottom of the reactor vessel helped to generate a continuously-stirred slurry system, resulting in the uniform distribution of catalyst particles in the slurry.CO 2 (99.9purity) was continuously introduced into the CFSSR by using a mass flow controller at a flow rate of 60 ml min -1 for 1 h to purge air and saturate the solution.After that, the flow rate of CO 2 was decreased and maintained at 10 ml min -1 throughout the experiment.The photocatalytic reaction was started by turned on the light from the compact fluorescent integrated bulbs, and irradiation was continued for 6 h.The effluent gaseous products were analyzed by using a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Unibead-C column for H 2 , CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 analysis, as well as a Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a Porapak-Q column for hydrocarbon analysis."}, {"llm generation": "N-doped TiO 2", "source": "The first step was the synthesis of N-doped TiO 2 through a sol-gel method modified from the work reported by Collazzo et al. 46.", "context": "A two-step process was used to prepare Spirulina-modified Ndoped TiO 2 catalysts.The first step was the synthesis of N-doped TiO 2 through a sol-gel method modified from the work reported by Collazzo et al. 46.In this work, titanium (IV) isopropoxide (Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 : Aldrich, 97 purity) was used as a TiO 2 precursor.A certain volume of ammonia solution (QReC, 28 w/w) was added dropwise into titanium (IV) isopropoxide solution at a rate of 1 ml min -1 to initiate the hydrolysis process, and then the obtained mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min.After that, the mixture was dried at 100 C for 2 h and calcined in air at 400 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 C min -1 .The yellow powder catalyst was obtained.The nitrogen concentrations based on titanium in the catalyst were varied in the range of 5-15 wt N.

The experiments on CO 2 photoreduction with water over the modified TiO 2 catalysts were carried out in a photoreactor system as shown in Fig. 1.The compact fluorescent integrated bulbs (Philips Tornado: 6 bulbs, 13 watt) located around a continuous flow stirred slurry reactor (CFSSR) were used as the visible light source.The light intensity at the catalyst zone was approximately 0.37 0.05 mW cm -2 , and wavelengths were in the range of 400-800 nm.Prior to experiment, 0.25 g of each catalyst was loaded into the CFSSR which contained 250 ml distilled water.The catalyst concentration was fixed as 1 g-dm -3 to avoid the effect of light scattering and achieve the maximum ability of light to reach every catalyst particle 28,48,49.A magnetic stirrer placed at the bottom of the reactor vessel helped to generate a continuously-stirred slurry system, resulting in the uniform distribution of catalyst particles in the slurry.CO 2 (99.9purity) was continuously introduced into the CFSSR by using a mass flow controller at a flow rate of 60 ml min -1 for 1 h to purge air and saturate the solution.After that, the flow rate of CO 2 was decreased and maintained at 10 ml min -1 throughout the experiment.The photocatalytic reaction was started by turned on the light from the compact fluorescent integrated bulbs, and irradiation was continued for 6 h.The effluent gaseous products were analyzed by using a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Unibead-C column for H 2 , CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 analysis, as well as a Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a Porapak-Q column for hydrocarbon analysis."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "The compact fluorescent integrated bulbs (Philips Tornado: 6 bulbs, 13 watt) located around a continuous flow stirred slurry reactor (CFSSR) were used as the visible light source.", "context": "A two-step process was used to prepare Spirulina-modified Ndoped TiO 2 catalysts.The first step was the synthesis of N-doped TiO 2 through a sol-gel method modified from the work reported by Collazzo et al. 46.In this work, titanium (IV) isopropoxide (Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 : Aldrich, 97 purity) was used as a TiO 2 precursor.A certain volume of ammonia solution (QReC, 28 w/w) was added dropwise into titanium (IV) isopropoxide solution at a rate of 1 ml min -1 to initiate the hydrolysis process, and then the obtained mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min.After that, the mixture was dried at 100 C for 2 h and calcined in air at 400 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 C min -1 .The yellow powder catalyst was obtained.The nitrogen concentrations based on titanium in the catalyst were varied in the range of 5-15 wt N. The second step was the modification of N-doped TiO 2 by commercial Spirulina using incipient wetness impregnation method.Briefly, Spirulina pellets (the biological and chemical composition of Spirulina are shown in Table S1) were ground and dissolved in deionized water and then added onto N-TiO 2 catalyst.The loading amount of Spirulina was based on chlorophyll a in Spirulina, which can be calculated from Eq.
