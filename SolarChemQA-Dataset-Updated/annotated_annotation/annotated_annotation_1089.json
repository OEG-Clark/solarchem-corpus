The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of all three samples show irregular shapes of a plate-like morphology (Figures 1a andS1a,c).A closer examination of the Cu 0.1 -ZnS nanoplates reveals their rough surfaces, displaying multiple parallel stripes (Figure 1b).The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Figure 1c shows typical stacking faults (SF, red circles) and twin boundaries (T, yellow lines).Interestingly, two distinct lattice fringes of d 0.331 and 0.312 nm are observable, which correspond to the (100) facet of hexagonal wurtzite ZnS and the (111) facet of cubic sphalerite ZnS, respectively. 15The coexistence of the two phases is also supported by the two sets of diffraction spots in the selectedarea electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in Figure 1d.Similar surface features of stacking faults and twin boundaries are observed in Cu 0.05 -ZnS and ZnS (Figure S1b,d).Both wurtzite and sphalerite phases are identified in the HRTEM image of Cu 0.05 -ZnS, whereas only the wurtzite phase is visible from ZnS. Elemental mapping images in Figure S2 show Zn, Cu, and S elements homogeneously distributed in Cu 0.1 -ZnS.Energy-dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) data verify that Cu 0.05 -ZnS and Cu 0.1 -ZnS contain 7.28 and 11.60 atom Cu, respectively (Table S1). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy was used to investigate the crystal structure of samples (Figure 2a).Pristine ZnS exhibits a diffraction pattern of hexagonal wurtzite phase ZnS (JCPDS 36-1450) with the characteristic peaks at 26.9, 28.8, 30.5, 39.6, 47.6, 51.8, 55.5, 56.4,72.9, and 77.8, which are assigned to the (100), (002), ( 101), ( 102), ( 110), ( 103), ( 200), ( 112), (203), and (211) planes, respectively.The Cu-ZnS samples display XRD patterns similar to those of ZnS; however, the peak at 28.6is much more intensified, especially for Cu 0.1 -ZnS.Moreover, three new peaks at 32.9, 69.2, and 79.8are observed from both Cu-ZnS samples, which correspond to the (200), (400), and (311) planes of the cubic sphalerite ZnS phase (JCPDS 05-0566), respectively, confirming the coexistence of wurtzite and sphalerite phases in the Cu-ZnS samples.It is worth noting that the diffraction peaks in the Cu-ZnS samples show an obvious positive shift of 0.3.This shift is caused by the insertion of Cu atoms that have a smaller radius (0.57 A) than Zn atoms (0.60 A), 22,32 indicating the successful incorporation of Cu in the ZnS sphalerite-wurtzite (S-W) crystal phase.A further increase in the Cu doping level to 15 and 20 wt (Cu 0.15 -ZnS and Cu 0.2 -ZnS, respectively) resulted in the formation of a Cu 1.96 S phase (JCPDS 12-0174), as indicated by diffraction peaks at 26.9, 31.3,44.9, and 53.2in Figure S3.This suggests that the highest Cu doping level that preserves the original ZnS crystal structure is 10 wt . The composition and structure of the Cu-ZnS samples are well supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data.The XPS survey spectra of both Cu-ZnS samples identify the peaks in the C 1s, Zn 2p, Cu 2p, and S 2p regions, while the peaks in the Cu 2p region are absent from pristine ZnS (Figure S4). Figure 2b compares the high-resolution XPS spectra of ZnS and Cu 0.1 -ZnS in the Zn 2p region.The pristine ZnS exhibits a typical pair of peaks at 1021.98 and 1045.05eV, corresponding to 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 states of Zn 2 species, respectively. 33,34These peaks in Cu 0.1 -ZnS are positively shifted to 1022.52 and 1045.47 eV, respectively, indicating the electron redistribution in Zn atoms due to Cu incorporation. 22Similar yet opposite peak shifts are seen in the S 2p region (Figure 2c).The S 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 peaks of Cu 0.1 -ZnS are shifted to 161.33 and 162.51 eV compared with 161.57and 162.79 eV of ZnS, respectively, balancing the electron distribution in Cu 0.1 -ZnS. 35In the high-resolution Cu 2p XPS spectrum, two symmetric peaks are observed at 933.02 and 952.81 eV, which is clear evidence of Cu doping and suggests that Cu 2 is the major species 30 (Figure 2d). Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was employed to verify the existence of defect sites indicated by TEM analysis of Cu 0.1 -ZnS, and the results are presented in Figure 2e.Both Cu-ZnS samples clearly show six sharp peaks located at the gfactor values of 1.911, 1.941, 1.982, 2.022, 2.064, and 2.106, which are the characteristics of the sphalerite-phase ZnS. 15 In contrast, pristine ZnS displays no such sharp peaks, confirming its pure wurtzite phase.Another ESR signal at 2.001 is evident in all samples, which, agreeing well with the TEM observations, can be attributed to the defect species of stacking faults and twin crystals (Figure 1). 15Because the intensity of an ESR signal is directly related to the density of defects, 36 Cu 0.01 -ZnS, with the most intense peak at 2.001, contains the highest density of defects, while pristine ZnS has only trace amounts of defect sites.The relationship among Cu doping, S-W phase junctions, and defects could be understood by considering the synthesis conditions.A ZnS nanocrystal was prepared in a twostep reaction that involves an ethylenediamine-intercalated ZnS precursor (Zn(en) 0.5 S).The high surface energy of Zn(en) 0.5 S under hydrothermal conditions drives its surface atomic rearrangements, rendering the stacking faults and twin boundaries on the surface of the resultant ZnS. 15,19The incorporation of Cu atoms disturbs the atomic arrangement of Zn(en) 0.5 S, making the surface more unstable, which eventually induces more defective sites or even partial phase transformation to form the S-W junctions in Cu-ZnS. 22he optical properties of ZnS and Cu-ZnS are studied using UV-vis diffraction reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) to investigate the influence of metal doping and defect sites on the band structure (Figure 2f).Pristine ZnS exhibits a typical absorption edge at 370 nm in the UV region with the corresponding band gap energy (E g ) of 3.64 eV (Figure S5). 19,21Upon the incorporation of Cu, the absorption edges of Cu-ZnS shift to a longer wavelength and the band gap is decreased to 3.37 eV (Figure S5).Such a red shift of the absorption band was reported to arise from Cu 2 doping or S-W junctions. 19,37In addition, both Cu-ZnS samples display an absorption tail in the visible-light region (600-800 nm), which can be visualized with an apparent color change from white to brown (insets in Figure S5).It has been suggested that the CuS domains formed by preferential Cu 2 doping could exert a strong localized surface plasmon resonance effect, 38 leading to the enhanced light absorption at wavelengths over 600 nm. Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction Reaction Performance.The photocatalytic activities of ZnS and Cu-ZnS toward the CO 2 reduction reaction (CRR) were compared to understand the effect of Cu-ion doping and S-W phase junction, as well as the altered optical property.The reduction products were analyzed by gas chromatography and 1 H NMR, and the results are summarized in Figure 3a.Both ZnS and Cu-ZnS samples mainly produce CO and H 2 , and no liquid products are detected.Pristine ZnS shows a CO production rate of 39.7 mol g -1 h -1 with 95.0 of CO selectivity.As the only side product, H 2 is generated with a production rate of 2.1 mol g -1 h -1 .Both the CO production rate and CO selectivity are enhanced with the increase in the level of Cu doping onto the ZnS.Particularly, a high CO selectivity of 99.9 with a production rate of 68.9 mol g -1 h -1 is achieved with Cu 0.1 -ZnS.The competing H 2 generation is almost completely suppressed and only a trace amount of H 2 is detected.The Cu 0.1 -ZnS maintains the photocatalytic CO production rate in five consecutive 2 h reactions with no apparent loss of activity, demonstrating its excellent stability against photocorrosion (Figure 3b).The XRD pattern and TEM images of Cu 0.1 -ZnS collected after the catalysis confirm that its crystal structure and morphology remain unchanged (Figures 3c andS6).Several control experiments were conducted to ensure the production of CO by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 (Figure 3d). 39When Ar is purged instead of CO 2 gas under the same conditions, no detectable amount of CO is produced.Other tests conducted without irradiation or a catalyst show no CO production activity, verifying that CO is generated from photocatalytic CRR. Effect of the Phase Junction and Cu Doping on CO 2 Reduction.The incorporation of a Cu ion and a S-W phase junction in ZnS apparently promoted the photocatalytic activity and CO selectivity of Cu-ZnS samples.The S-W phase junction was reported to contain abundant sulfur vacancies, 12 which is also supported by the ESR result (Figure 2e).It was previously reported that vacant sites near the phase junction could effectively facilitate the separation of charge carriers and localization of photoelectrons for surface catalysis, thus promoting photocatalytic performance. 15,19However, it has never been reported how the internal S-W phase junctions affect the CRR process in terms of product selectivity.To clarify the role of Cu doping and S-W phase junctions in photocatalytic CRR, a control sample of ZnS containing the S-W mixed phase (SW-ZnS) was prepared following the procedure of a previous report 16 (for details, see the Experimental Section).Both sphalerite and wurtzite peaks are evident in the XRD pattern of SW-ZnS (Figure 4a) and the ESR spectrum of SW-ZnS suggests the coexistence of the mixed phase and comparable density of defects to Cu-ZnS (Figure S7c).In the photocatalytic CRR test, SW-ZnS achieves the CO and H 2 production rates of 57.9 and 16.0 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, showing an overall improvement in photocatalytic activity by S-W phase junctions (Figure 4b).The CO selectivity of SW-ZnS, however, decreases to 78.4 from 95.0 of ZnS, indicating that the formation of the S-W phase junction is more favorable for HER than for CRR. Cu-ion doping is believed to play an important role in the tuning of the surface property to favor CO production.To further elucidate the role of a Cu ion in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity and CO selectivity, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out.Three models, Cu-doped ZnS (Cu-W-ZnS), sphalerite-wurtzite-mixed ZnS (SW-ZnS), and Cu-doped mixed-phased ZnS (Cu-ZnS), are developed, as illustrated in Figure 4c, and the corresponding projected density of states (PDOS) are shown in Figure 4d.Among the three types of ZnS, the calculated band gap of Cu-ZnS, consistent with the experimental results, is the smallest.Comparison of the PDOS plots between SW-ZnS and Cu-ZnS clearly shows that the incorporation of Cu contributes to the electron density at the Fermi level, suggesting a promoted reactivity on the Cu site (Figure 4d, middle and bottom). 40eanwhile, such promotional effect on the electron density at the Fermi level also enhances the bonding of the catalyst surface with absorbates, a CO intermediate in this case, thus leading to an increased CO selectivity with Cu doping. 41owever, without the S-W internal phase, this contribution to the Fermi level from Cu atoms is much weaker in the Cudoped pure wurtzite phase (Figure 4d, top), indicating the synergistic effect of the introduction of Cu and the S-W internal phase junction."}, {"llm generation": "ZnS nanocrystals with homogenous Cu doping", "source": "In summary, ZnS nanocrystals with homogenous Cu doping and abundant internal S-W phase junctions were prepared as a CO 2 reduction photocatalyst.", "context": "In summary, ZnS nanocrystals with homogenous Cu doping and abundant internal S-W phase junctions were prepared as a CO 2 reduction photocatalyst.The formation of an internal phase junction is closely related to Cu doping and can be regulated by controlling the Cu doping level.Compared with pristine ZnS, Cu 0.1 -ZnS shows an enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction rate and CO selectivity.Both Cu doping and the S-W phase junction promote light absorption and thus contribute to photocatalytic activity.The highly improved CO selectivity of Cu 0.1 -ZnS is due to the doped Cu ions that increase the bonding between the catalyst surface and the CO intermediate, according to the DFT calculations.This work provides an effective strategy for tailoring the property of metal sulfides to realize an enhanced CO 2 reduction reaction with high product selectivity.

Material Characterization.Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku SmartLab 9kW X-ray diffractometer at a scan rate of 3min -1 .Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEOL model JEM-2100F operated with a field-emission gun at 200 kV.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were measured using a Cary 4000 UV-vis spectrophotometer from 200 to 800 nm wavelength.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) with a 12 kV Al K radiation source.XPS data were treated with CasaXPS software using a background type of Shirley and the peak profile of Gaussian-Lorentzian GL (30).Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was conducted using an ANANI SPINSCAN X spectrometer at room temperature. Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction Reaction.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was carried out in a closed system using a Pyrex reaction cell (50 mL).First, the as-prepared catalyst (5 mg) was dispersed in a solution containing chloroform (18 mL) and 2-propanol (2 mL) and degassed with high-purity CO 2 for 30 min.The solution was then irradiated with a xenon lamp (Ceaulight, 300 W, 1 sun).The distance from the lamp to the center of the photoreactor was fixed at 20 cm, and the average light intensity irradiated on the photoreactor was ca. 100 mW cm -2 .Gaseous products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph system (Agilent 7890 B) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID).Liquid products were detected by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker Advance-III).For the stability test, five consecutive 2 h reactions were carried out under the same conditions.The reaction cell was purged with CO 2 for 30 min before each run without adding more catalysts. Computational Calculations.Density function theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the CP2K package. 25The system was described by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional 26 with Grimme D3 correction. 27Kohn-Sham DFT was employed as the electronic structure method in the framework of Gaussian and plane waves method. 28,29The molecules were described by the Goedecker-Teter-Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials 30,31 and DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH basis sets. 28The electronic structure analysis was carried out in terms of the projected density of states (PDOS).In the calculations, the wurtzite phase was modeled with a 4 4 3 supercell in a 15.515 15.515 18.7821 hexagonal box and the sphalerite phase was modeled with a 3 3 supercell in a 16.400 cubic box.The sphalerite-wurtzite mixed phase was modeled with a 15.515 15.515 24.6428 box where top of four layers was associated with the wurtzite phase while the bottom layers were the sphalerite phase."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "For the stability test, five consecutive 2 h reactions were carried out under the same conditions.", "context": "Materials and Chemicals.Zinc acetate (Zn(OAc) 2 , 99.99), copper(II) acetate (Cu(OAc) 2 , 99.99), ethylenediamine (en, 99), L-cystine (98), Nafion 117 solution (5 wt ), chloroform (99.8), 2-proponal (99.9), and ethanol (96) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.All chemicals and solvents were used without further purification.
