(2) To confirm the oxidation and reduction states of Mn and Pt species, XPS spectra were recorded.As shown in Figure 4a, Mn 2p peaks were observed from the survey spectrum of sample TM.The high-resolution spectrum of Mn 2p (Figure 4d) presented two peaks located at 641.9 and 653.5 eV, designated Forum Article to Mn 2p 3/2 and Mn 2p 1/2 , respectively.The spin-orbit splitting value of Mn 2p was 11.6 eV.The Mn species can be labeled as MnO x .This was attributed to the oxidation of Mn 2 by the photogenerated holes accumulated on 001 facets.Similarly, Pt 4f peaks can be easily found in the survey spectrum of sample TP (Figure 4a).The high-resolution spectrum of Pt 4f (Figure 4e) exhibited two peaks centered at 71.1 and 74.5 eV, which were assigned to Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 , respectively, substantiating the existence of metallic platinum. 56This was due to the assembled photogenerated electrons on 101 facets that can reduce PtCl 6 2-into Pt metallic nanoparticles.After the two-step selective deposition, it was observed that Mn 2p and Pt 4f peaks in sample TMP coexisted, located at the same position with that of TM and TP, demonstrating that both MnO x and Pt were successfully deposited on 001 and 101 facets of TiO 2 nanosheets films, respectively.Thus, the trijunction (surface junction between 001 and 101 facets, m-s junction between Pt nanoparticles and TiO 2 nanosheets, and p-n junction between n-type TiO 2 and p-type MnO x ) was successfully constructed on the surface of TiO 2 .The formed multi-heterojunctions at the interface of photocatalysts were beneficial for accelerating the charge separation and improving the photocatalytic performance. The optical absorption properties were obtained by the UV-vis reflectance spectroscopy.Figure 5a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) and corresponding colors of four samples.For bare TiO 2 , an absorption onset at ca. 390 nm was observed, which corresponded to the bandgap energy of intrinsic anatase TiO 2 , that is, 3.2 eV.After MnO x nanoflakes were deposited, an obvious absorption increase in the wavelength of 400-700 nm emerged, indicating the enhanced absorption in the visible range.Moreover, an absorption edge at 730 nm was also observed.According to the fact that MnO x is an indirect band gap semiconductor, the corresponding Kubelka-Munk function was used to calculate the band gap energy (E g ) of MnO x . 57,58Tauc plot of sample TMP was shown in Figure 5b. A layer of photocatalyst on top of FTO glass will enhance the reflectance intensity and the light harvesting of bare FTO glass.Thus, in our case, the original baseline in the bandgap calculation does not apply to the TiO 2 -deposited FTO, and this issue has already been addressed in literature. 59To eliminate the interference of the increased light scattering, the intrinsic absorption edges of samples were determined as the point of intersection of two tangent lines rather than the x-intercept.The obtained bandgap value was 1.7 eV, falling into the range of the band gap of MnO x . 60When Pt nanoparticles were deposited on TiO 2 nanosheets, the light absorption was slightly enhanced.After the simultaneous deposition of MnO x and Pt, the visible absorption in the range of 400-700 nm was improved.The enhanced light harvesting was favorable for promoting the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity. Forum Article 3.3.Photocatalytic CO 2 -Reduction Performance.The CO 2 photoreduction activities of sample T, TM, TP, and TMP nanosheet films were evaluated.Considering that the film photocatalysts were difficult to detach from FTO glass, we investigated the photocatalytic activities of photocatalysts in film form.Therefore, we use the unit mol/m 2 rather than the frequently used mol/g.Figure 6a shows the yields of CH 4 and CH 3 OH for four samples after irradiation for 3 h.For sample T, the yields of CH 4 and CH 3 OH after 3 h of irradiation were 28 and 31 mol m -2 , respectively.After MnO x nanoflakes were deposited on TiO 2 001 facets, the yield of the CH 4 and CH 3 OH exhibited a small increment.After Pt nanoparticles were deposited on TiO 2 101 facets, the CH 4 yield rose to 85 mol m -2 , even over tripled than that of bare TiO 2 nanosheets films.Meanwhile, the yield of CH 3 OH also showed an increase.When both MnO x and Pt were loaded on the two facets of TiO 2 surface, the yields of two products further increased.The different growth rate indicated that the photocatalytic reactions on the four photocatalysts followed complex and distinguishable pathways for CH 4 and CH 3 OH formation.To inspect the photocatalytic stability of sample TMP, the cycling activity of TMP was measured and plotted in Figure 6b.A linear relationship between the yields of products and the irradiation time was manifested.And the highest value for CH 4 and CH 3 OH yields reached 104 and 91 mol m -2 , respectively. 3.4.Photoelectrochemical Performance.The PEC performance of all the prepared samples was evaluated in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte.Figure 7a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of T, TM, TP, and TMP photoanodes under irradiation.The onset potentials at the current density of 1 mA cm -2 for T, TM, TP, and TMP were -0.69, -0.67, -0.43, and -0.41 V, respectively.The trend indicated that the addition of MnO x and Pt was beneficial for the catalytic reaction.Notably, it can be observed that Pt was more efficient than MnO x in the onset potential decrement, which is reasonable, because Pt is recognized as the best electrocatalyst and cocatalyst.Photocurrent-time (I-t) curves of these samples are shown in Figure 7b.A hike in photocurrent was witnessed when the light was turned on.When the light was turned off, the photocurrent dropped steeply to nearly zero.The photocurrent response to the onoff cycles was reproducible over the chopped light illumination.The photocurrent density of TMP (0.16 mA/cm 2 ) was 1.1, 2.7, and 3.5 times higher than that of sample TP (0.15 mA/ cm 2 ), TM (0.06 mA/cm 2 ), and T (0.045 mA/cm 2 ), respectively, demonstrating the promoted charge migration efficiency contributed by the selective coloading of Pt and MnO x .The photo-irradiation stability of samples was also investigated (Figure 7c).Under UV light illumination, a quick drop of photocurrent density was observed initially.Afterward, the photocurrent densities of four samples leveled off, suggesting the remarkable stability of the prepared sample as photonaodes. 3.5.M-S Measurement.Mott-Schottky (M-S) plots of samples were measured in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution as electrolyte.In Figure 8, as for samples T and TP, the slopes of the tangent line were always positive in the whole range of potential, suggesting that the as-obtained TiO 2 photocatalyst was an n-type semiconductor.However, for sample TM and TMP, positive (R1) and negative (R2) slopes coexisted, indicating that the capacitance response in R1 was controlled by an n-type semiconductor, while R2 was controlled by a ptype semiconductor. 61,62Therefore, it was deduced that the prepared MnO x nanoflake was of p-type.Thus, a p-n junction between TiO 2 and MnO x was formed.Furthermore, the qualitative analysis of slopes of M-S plots showed that the introduction of Pt and MnO x led to a smaller slope, indicating a higher charge carrier density.Quantitative calculation of the slopes of M-S plots was also conducted to investigate the charge carrier densities of samples. 63,64 where N d is the donor density; represents the dielectric constant of TiO 2 ; 0 represents permittivity of vacuum; e 0 represents electron charge; and V means the applied bias at the electrode.For TiO 2 , the value of is 170.The calculated charge densities of T, TM, TP, and TMP were 5.52 10 17 , 7.61 10 17 , 8.7 10 18 , and 2.1 10 19 cm -3 , respectively.For sample TM, the enhanced charge density was due to the accelerating electron-hole transfer across the p-n junction.For sample TP, the m-s junction between Pt and TiO 2 was formed, and the electrons would flow from TiO 2 to Pt owing to the larger work function of Pt, and thus suppressed the recombination of electrons and holes on TiO 2 , leading to a higher electron density.For sample TMP, the p-n junction on TiO 2 001 facets and m-s junction on TiO 2 101 facets collaboratively facilitated the migration of electrons and holes.The improved charge separation and migration were deemed responsible for the enhancement of PEC and photocatalytic performance. 3.6.Photocatalytic Mechanism.On the basis of the above results, the charge separation and migration process of ternary TiO 2 -MnO x -Pt heterojunction structure was proposed in Figure 9.The relative conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) positions of anatase TiO 2 , MnO x , and Pt were illustrated in Figure 9a.According to the previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations, there was a slight difference between the valence band and conduction band for 101 and 001 facets of anatase TiO 2 nanosheets. 51The CB bottom and VB top of 101 facets are lower than those of 001 facets.This difference demonstrates the feasibility of charge migration.The bandgap energy of MnO x obtained from the UV-vis spectrum was ca.1.7 eV.The positions of CB and VB of MnO x at the point of zero charge were reckoned using the following empirical equations: where is the bulk electronegativity of the MnO x (5.95 eV); 65 E 0 is the energy of free electrons versus the normal hydrogen electrode (ca.4.5 eV); and E g is the band gap of MnO x .The calculated results showed that the CB bottom and VB top of MnO x were located at 0.6 and 2.3 eV versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.Considering that acid gas (CO 2 and H 2 O) was adsorbed on the surface of photocatalyst films when evaluating the photocatalytic activities, we assume TiO 2 -MnO x -Pt heterojunction worked at pH 6.For TiO 2 , its band edge calculated from Equation 6did not have to convert, because the point of zero zeta potential (pzzp) of TiO 2 is pH 5.8, which can be approximately considered as pH 6. 66For MnO x , its isoelectric point is pH 4. 67 We assume the pzzp of MnO x is also pH 4, because there are no additional potentialdetermining ions except for OH -and H .For MnO x , eq 6 can be modified into Herein, pH is the potential drop across the Helmholtz layer due to specific adsorption of OH -and H ions.Finally, the calculated CB bottom and VB top of MnO x are 0.48 and 2.18 eV, respectively, which were shown in Figure 9a.The Fermi level of MnO x , located near the VB, was lower than that of TiO 2 .When the p-type MnO x was deposited on the 001 facet of n-type anatase TiO 2 nanosheet, a p-n junction at the interface of MnO x and TiO 2 001 facet was formed.When TiO 2 and MnO x integrated, the Fermi level of TiO 2 decreased, whereas the Fermi level of MnO x ascended until their Fermi levels reached equilibrium.Moreover, the whole energy band of MnO x shifted upward, while that of TiO 2 shifted downward.On the one hand, during the dynamic process of electron migration, the negative charges accumulated on the MnO x side at the interface between TiO 2 and MnO x , while the positive charges aggregated on the other side (TiO 2 ), and a built-in electric field from TiO 2 to MnO x was formed.On the other hand, the Fermi level of Pt located at 1.1 eV versus NHE, which was lower than that of TiO 2 . 52Therefore, when Pt nanoparticles were intimately attached on the 101 facets of TiO 2 , m-s junctions at the interface of Pt and TiO 2 101 facets were formed.The electron transfer from TiO 2 to Pt was expedited by the Schottky barrier.When light irradiation was introduced in the ternary TiO 2 -MnO x -Pt photocatalytic system, the photogenerated electrons were excited from TiO 2 VB to CB, leaving the holes in the VB.After that, the photoinduced holes and electrons migrated to 001 and 101 facets of TiO 2 nanosheets, respectively, in virtue of the surface heterojunction. 51On 001 facets, the accumulated holes further transferred to MnO x , the driving force of built-in electric field derived from the as-formed p-n junction, while the photogenerated electrons tended to migrate oppositely.In the meantime, on 101 facets, the abundant electrons would migrate toward Pt nanoparticles under the effect of the Schottky barrier formed between n-type TiO 2 and Pt.Then Pt nanoparticles served as the reactive sites, and henceforth the accumulated electrons on Pt nanoparticles participated in the conversion of CO 2 into fuels.As a result, the photogenerated charge carriers can be spatially separated by the cross-coupling effect of surface heterojunction between 001 and 101 facets, p-n junction between p-type MnO x and ntype TiO 2 001 facet, and m-s junction between metallic Pt and TiO 2 101 facet.The collective contribution of three heterojunctions suppresses the recombination of charge carriers and improves the photocatalytic performance."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The solution was irradiated under a 350 W xenon lamp at room temperature.", "context": "2.1.Preparation.Preparation of TiO 2 Nanosheets Film.FTO glass was cleaned ultrasonically in water, ethanol, and acetone for 20 min, respectively.In a typical procedure, a mixed solution containing 15 mL of water and 15 mL of hydrochloric acid was stirred for 10 min in a Teflon-lined autoclave, and then 0.5 mL of tetrabutyl titanate and 0.25 g of ammonium hexafluorotitanate were added into the mixed solution with stirring for another 10 min.Subsequently, two pieces of FTO glass were placed at the bottom of autoclave with the conductive side facing up.The stainless steel autoclave was then put into a vacuum oven for 12 h at 180 C.After the reaction, the FTO glass was taken out, washed, and dried for further use.The obtained TiO 2 /FTO was denoted as T.
