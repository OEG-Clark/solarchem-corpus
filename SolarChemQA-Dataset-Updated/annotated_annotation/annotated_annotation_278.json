FESEM image shown in Fig. 2a reveals that the obtained TiO 2 -0 1 0 is mainly composed of nanorods with particle size of ca.1000 100 nm and ca.93 exposed percentage of 0 1 0 facets, and its HRTEM image (the inset in Fig. 2b) shows the 0 1 0 orientation of the nanorod and the clear lattice fringes with lattice spacing of 0.48 and 0.35 nm, corresponding to the 0 0 2 and 1 0 1 facets of anatase TiO 2 , respectively.The angles of 1 0 1-1 0 -1 facets and 1 0 1-0 0 2 facets can be estimated to be ca.44 and 68 , which are in agreement with the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (the inset in Fig. 2b).Therefore, it can be concluded that the four rectangle facets of the nanorod are 0 1 0 facets of anatase TiO 2 since 0 1 0 and 1 0 0 facets have the same surface construction.Similarly, FESEM image shown in Fig. 2c indicates that TiO 2 -0 0 1 is composed of nanosheets with size of ca.200 10 nm and ca.91 exposed percentage of 0 1 0 facets, and its HRTEM image (the inset in Fig. 2d) displays the 0 0 1 orientation and two clear lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.20 nm, corresponding to the 0 2 0 and 2 0 0 facets, and the angle between them is 90 , which agrees well with the FFT pattern (the inset in Fig. 2d).Therefore, the two square facets (top and bottom facets) of the TiO 2 nanosheets are 0 0 1 facets. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained to analyze the oxidization state and the surface chemical composition of TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt.As can be seen from the survey XPS spectra in Fig. 3a, there are Ti, O, C and Pt elements existing in both the samples.The binding energy (BE) values were corrected by assigning the value of 284.6 eV to the C 1s peak of adventitious hydrocarbons; it can be found that there is a very weak peak of C 1s located at 284.6 eV The binding energy values of Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 can be observed to be 72.1 and 75.3 eV as shown in Fig. 3b, which are almost equal to the standard binding energy of metallic Pt, indicating that Pt metal particles loaded on TiO 2 surfaces for TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt by using the present photodeposition method.Moreover, the TiO 2 -0 0 1 is shown to be fluoride-free crystals as can be observed from the XPS spectra in Fig. 3c 17,20,21, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of TiO 2 -0 0 1 and TiO 2 -0 1 0 are measured to be 67.4 and 32.9 m 2 g -1 , respectively. Control experiments showed no appreciable reduced C1 or C2 products detected in the absence of either photocatalyst or light irradiation, illustrating that both photocatalyst and light irradiation are necessary for the present gaseous photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, and the primary experimental results showed CH 4 was the main product from the gaseous photocatalytic CO 2 reduction systems by using TiO 2 -0 0 1, TiO 2 -0 1 0, TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt or TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt as photocatalyst in the presence of H 2 O vapor.Moreover, when the photocatalytic system was illuminated by introducing N 2 instead of CO 2 into the reactor, neither CH 4 /CO nor other carbon-containing organic compounds can be observed.The above results demonstrated that the generation of CH 4 product was stemmed from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, and the selective formation of CH 4 rather than other hydrocarbons (such as CH 3 OH and CO) might be ascribed to its more feasible thermodynamics because the redox potential of CO 2 /CH 4 E (CO 2 /CH 4 ) -0.24V vs. NHE, pH7.00 is much lower than that of CO 2 /CO E (CO 2 /CO) -0.53V vs. NHE, pH7.00 or CO 2 /CH 3 OH E (CO 2 /CH 3 OH) -0.38V vs. NHE, pH 7.00 15,21. Fig. 4 depicts the CH 4 production amount from the above photocatalytic system containing different photocatalysts under UV-light irradiation for 2 h.As can be seen, TiO 2 -0 0 1 shows a lower photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity for CH 4 production than TiO 2 -0 1 0, and 1 wt Pt-loading leads to a significant increment in the CH 4 production for TiO 2 -0 0 1.However, the 1 wt Pt-loading obviously retards the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of TiO 2 -0 1 0, rendering its photoactivity inferior to the Pt-loaded TiO 2 -0 0 1.Namely, Pt-loading can reverse the photoactivity order of anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets during the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 . To further confirm this phenomenon on Pt-loading, the CH 4 evolution efficiency over 5 wt Pt-loaded samples (TiO 2 -0 0 1-5Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0-5Pt) under UV-light irradiation for 4 h were estimated and shown in Fig. 5, and a similar reversing trend in the photoactivity order of anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets can also be observed.Therefore, it might be conjectured that the above effect of Pt-loading on the photoactivity is largely attributed to the difference of crystal facets rather than the Pt-loaded level. In order to reveal the origin of the reversed photoactivity order of TiO 2 -0 0 1 and TiO 2 -0 1 0 after the Pt-loading, ATR-IR, CO 2 -TPD shown in Fig. 6b, which is usually applied to survey the adsorption amount and the base strength of catalysts.The desorption peaks in the temperature region between 250 and 450 C may be attributed to the CO 2 desorption from weak bases sites such as bicarbonates, while the main peak in the range of 500-600 C may be due to the decomposition of the strongly adsorbed carbonates 2627282930. By comparing the peak areas of those CO 2 desorption and the variance of peak maximum temperature, it can be concluded that the CO 2 adsorbed amount on TiO 2 -0 1 0 is larger than that on TiO 2 -0 0 1.This leads to the judgement that TiO 2 -0 1 0 surfaces is more favorable to the coverage and adsorption of CO 2 -derived species, which then would result in its better photoactivity for the CO 2 photoreduction as compared to TiO 2 -0 0 1.Furthermore, the charge lifetime (0.71 ns) of TiO 2 -0 1 0 is slightly longer than that (0.65 ns) of TiO 2 -0 0 1 according to the time-resolved PL spectra shown in Fig. 6c, indicating that TiO 2 -0 1 0 has more efficient photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than TiO 2 -0 0 1.Usually, the criteria used to predict the photoactivity of crystal facets is the surface unsaturated coordinated atom density 17,20.Among the three fundamental low-index facets (0 0 1, 0 1 0 and 1 0 1) of the anatase TiO 2 crystals, both 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets containing 100 unsaturated five-coordinated Ti (Ti5c) atoms at their surfaces are theoretically considered more reactive than 1 0 1 facets containing 50 Ti5c atoms and 50 saturated coordinated Ti (Ti6c) atoms in terms of the surface Ti5c atom percentage 20.On the contrary, 0 1 0 and 1 0 1 facets should have photoreactivity superior to 0 0 1 facets when considering that more strongly reductive electrons can be generated on 0 1 0 and 1 0 1 facets because their CB minimum in the order 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 20.Obviously, 0 1 0 facets have both a favorable surface atomic structure and a surface electronic structure, so that the more strongly reducing electrons in the CB of the 0 1 0 facets can be transferred via the surface Ti5c atoms as active reaction sites 20.The efficient consumption of excited electrons in the photoreduction reactions can simultaneously promote the holes involved in photooxidation reactions 20, and then resulting in the above longer charge lifetime of TiO 2 -0 1 0 as compared to the TiO 2 -0 0 1.Such a collaborative mechanism existing on 0 1 0 facets is responsible for the higher reactivity than the 0 0 1 facets.It therefore can be concluded that the better photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of TiO 2 -0 1 0 might stem from its higher CO 2 adsorption capability and more efficient charge transfer capability than TiO 2 -0 0 1. Nevertheless, all these observations on ATR-IR, CO 2 -TPD and time-resolved PL spectra were reversed after 1 wt Pt-loading on those facets.As can be seen from Fig. 7a, TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt was still dominated by m-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -, while bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) with very strong peak in addition to the m-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -were mainly formed on the TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt, which is significantly different from the unloaded TiO 2 -0 1 0 as shown in Fig. 6a. According to the previous reports 31323334, the above changes may be due to the surface reconstruction of different facets under the present intense UV-light irradiation during the Pt deposition process because it has been reported that the possible influence of surface reconstruction on the photoactivity of different facets 20. Of course, the different TiO 2 facets may also influence the morphology, size and distribution of the Pt nanoparticles loaded on their surfaces as mentioned above 15,16, and then resulting in different photoreactivities, which will be further discussed in the following sections. As for 0 1 0 facets, it has been reported that the reconstruction should introduce a surface with 1 0 1 microfaceted grooves running in the 0 1 0 direction on 0 1 0 facets 32,33.As a result, some saturated Ti6c atoms would form on the reconstructed 0 1 0 facets because an ideal 1 0 1 facet contain 50 Ti5c and 50 Ti6c atoms, and the percentage of unsaturated Ti5c atoms on the reconstructed 0 1 0 facets would be lower than that on an ideal 0 1 0 ones containing 100 Ti5c atoms 20,35.It is conventional understanding that those facets with a higher percentage of unsaturated coordinated atoms are usually more reactive in heterogeneous reactions, hence the reconstructed 0 1 0 facets should have lower photoactivity than the unreconstructed 0 1 0 ones, this hypothesis is consistent with the above experimental data shown in Figs. 4 and5.Namely, Pt-loading under the present intense UV-light irradiation can retard the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of the 0 1 0 facets (TiO 2 -0 1 0).Moreover, it has been proved that the b-CO 3 2-is easily formed when the CO 2 molecule is bonded to two Ti6c and one O3c surface atoms on the 1 0 1 facets 35, which also can be observed from the ATR-IR spectra shown in Figs.6a and7a.As can be seen, the ATR-IR spectrum (Fig. 7a) of the TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt shows obviously IR peaks of the adsorbed b-CO 3 2-, while the corresponding peaks of b-CO 3 2-are very weak as shown in the ATR-IR spectrum (Fig. 6a) of the TiO 2 -0 1 0 because there are none of those saturated Ti6c atoms formed in this sample without Pt-loading.This phenomenon can validate the hypothesis on the surface reconstruction of 0 1 0 facets under the present intense UV-light irradiation as mentioned above. As for TiO 2 -0 0 1 facets, it has been theoretically discussed in the 1 4 reconstruction on 0 0 1 in terms of the \"ad-molecule\" (ADM) model, in which rows of bridging oxygen atoms are replaced with rows of TiO 3 species forming a chain, which gives rise to more additional under-coordinated Ti4c atoms formed on the 0 0 1 facets surface besides its original 100 Ti5c atoms 20.As mentioned above, a higher percentage of unsaturated coordinated atoms usually mean more reactivity in heterogeneous reaction 20, and therefore the reconstructed 0 0 1 facets should have higher photoactivity than the unreconstructed 0 0 1 ones.This assumption is also confirmed by the experimental results shown in Figs. 4 and5.Namely, Pt-loading under the present intense UV-light irradiation can significantly promote the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of TiO 2 -0 0 1.Moreover, the ATR-IR spectrum (Fig. 7a) of TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt was still dominated by m-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -adsorption but without obvious b-CO 3 2-adsorption peaks due to the absence of Ti6c, which is different from the situation of the reconstruction of 0 1 0 facets as mentioned above. Up to now, the above discussion on the effects of the facet reconstruction on the photoactivity is supported by the comparison of the experimental results between the corresponding facets with and without Pt-loading.To eliminate the effects of the Ptloading, both 0 1 0 and 0 0 1 facets without Pt-loading were also prepared by using the same intensive UV-light illumination as the Pt-loading process but without addition of H 2 PtCl 6 solution.These irradiated facets (without Pt-loading) were also used as photocatalyst to determine their photoactivity at the same condition, and the corresponding results are also listed in Fig. 5.As compared to the corresponding unirradiated one, the irradiated 0 0 1 facets without Pt-loading still show a higher photoactivity (Fig. 5a), while the irradiated 0 1 0 facets have a slightly lower one (Fig. 5b).These changing trends in photoactivity for the irradiated facets are similar to the above observation though the change degrees are much lower as compared to the corresponding Pt-loaded products.Moreover, the ATR-IR spectra (Fig. 7d) of the irradiated TiO 2 -0 0 1 and TiO 2 -0 1 0 are also very similar to that of their corresponding Pt-loaded ones (Fig. 7a), but obviously different from the unirradiated ones (Fig. 6a), also implying that the reconstruction of those facets lead to the differences in the adsorption of CO 2 regardless of Pt-loading or not.Although there is no direct proof on the reconstruction of the anatase facets under irradiation up till now, the present results give strong evidences on the above assumption that the surface reconstruction could improve the photoactivity of 0 0 1 facets but restrain the photoactivity of 0 1 0 facets. After comparing and analyzing the IR peak intensities of ATR-IR and the CO 2 desorption peak areas of the CO 2 -TPD curves shown in Fig. 7a andb, it can be found that there is no obvious difference between TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt on the CO 2 adsorption capability.Therefore, the different effects of Pt-loading on the photoactivity for the two facets should stem from the changes in the photogenerated charge lifetimes as shown in Fig. 7c.By carefully checking the TEM images (Fig. 8) of those Pt-loaded TiO 2 samples, it can be found that the Pt nanoparticles were uniformly and regularly deposited on TiO 2 -0 0 1 surfaces (Fig. 8a andc), while the Pt nanoparticles agglomerated on TiO 2 -0 1 0 surfaces (Fig. 8b andd).The average diameter of the Pt nanoparticles on TiO 2 -0 0 1 can be estimated to be ca.4-5 nm, much smaller than that (20 nm) of the Pt agglomeration on TiO 2 -0 1 0. It has been reported that noble metals such as Au nanoparticles showed a similar size effect on the Fermi level equilibration of semiconductors, where smaller Au nanoparticles can shift the Fermi level of TiO 2 to more negative potentials, leading to an enhanced photocatalytic performance 36,37.Therefore, the highly uniform Pt nanoparticles on TiO 2 -0 0 1 surfaces can effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons and restrain the photogenerated carrier recombination, resulting in the improved photoactivity, while those Pt aggregates on the 0 1 0 facets may not only trap the photogenerated electrons but also consume the holes, and thus serve as recombination centres to restrain the photoactivity 15,16. By considering that those Pt aggregates on the 0 1 0 facets may stem from the high Pt-loading amount (1 wt) and H 2 PtCl 6 (0.077 M) concentration during the present Pt deposition process, much lower Pt-loading amount (0.2 wt) and H 2 PtCl 6 (0.008 M) concentration were tried to deposit smaller not aggregated Pt particles on 0 1 0 facets (TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Pt).For comparison, TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Pt was also prepared through the same process.TEM images (Fig. 8e andg) of TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Pt are similar to the situation observed from TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt (Fig. 8a andc), its surfaces also contain uniformly deposited Pt nanoparticles but with fewer and smaller (ca.2-3 nm) sizes; while TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Pt also shows uniformly deposited Pt nanoparticles with small sizes (ca.4-6 nm) on TiO 2 -0 1 0 surfaces (Fig. 8e andh), which is significantly different from the TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt (Fig. 8b andd).Namely, highly uniform Pt nanoparticles with fewer amount and smaller sizes can be successfully loaded on both the facets.Therefore, the resultant products were also used as photocatalyst to evaluate their photoactivity at the same condition, and the corresponding results are listed in Fig. 5.As can be seen, TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Ptshows an obvious enhancement in the photoactivity as compared to the unloaded one, which is similar to TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 0 1-5Pt (Fig. 5a); whereas TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Pt has the highest photoactivity among the tested samples such as TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt, TiO 2 -0 1 0-5Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0 (Fig. 5b).Obviously, the opposite change in the photoactivity for the 0.2 wt Pt-loaded TiO 2 -0 1 0 as compared to the 1 wt and 5 wt Ptloaded ones can be ascribed to their different morphology and sizes of the loaded Pt particles as shown in Fig. 8. Namely, highly uniform Pt nanoparticles loaded on the 0 1 0 facets can also effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons and restrain the photogenerated carrier recombination, and then improve its photoactivity.Although 0.2 wt Pt-loading is not reverse of the photoactivity order of 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets for the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 since TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Ptshows a slightly higher activity than TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Pt, the difference in the photoactivity between the two facets is significantly reduced as compared to the unloaded ones (Fig. 5).That is, highly uniform Pt nanoparticles are more benefited to the improvement of the photoactivity of the 0 0 1 facets as compared to the 0 1 0 ones.Moreover, as compared to 0 0 1 facets, 0 1 0 facets with a Pt-loading amount larger than 1 wt are easier to form Pt aggregates on the surfaces due to their different surface electronic structures and reconstructions during the Pt deposition process, and the Pt aggregates on 0 1 0 facets may serve as recombination centres to depress the photoactivity as mentioned above. The time-resolved PL spectra of the samples shown in Figs.6c and7c can further validate the above suggestion.As can be seen, 1 wt Pt-loading does not obviously enhance the photogenerated charge lifetime for TiO 2 -0 1 0 (only 0.02 ns increment), while there is 29 increment (from 0.65 ns to 0.84 ns) of the charge lifetimes for TiO 2 -0 0 1 after Pt-loading.It indicates that an appropriate size of the loaded Pt nanoparticles is beneficial for enhancing the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency, resulting in a much Scheme 1. Possible mechanism of the reversed photoactivity order of anatase TiO2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets due to the Pt-loading during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process.longer charge lifetime.According to the CO 2 -TPD curves shown in Figs.6b and7b, the adsorption peak maximum temperature and the peak areas of the CO 2 desorption from TiO 2 -0 0 1 obviously increase after 1 wt Pt-loading; whereas the corresponding maximum temperature and peak areas of TiO 2 -0 1 0 do not increase significantly, indicating that the CO 2 adsorption capability on TiO 2 -0 0 1 was enhanced after the Pt-loading, resulting in TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt showing a higher photoactivity for the CO 2 reduction.Namely, the above reversed photoactivity order of anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets for the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 can be ascribed to changes in the CO 2 adsorption capability and photogenerated carrier separation efficiency on both anatase TiO 2 facets after the Pt-loading. On the bases of the above-mentioned results on the CO 2 adsorption capability and charge transfer properties on anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 or 0 1 0 facets, the reversed effect of Pt-loading on the anatase TiO 2 with different facets for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was summarized in Scheme 1.The 0 1 0 facets without Pt-loading can strongly adsorb CO 2 molecules with more amount and possesses longer photogenerated charge lifetime than the 0 0 1 facets, resulting in the 0 1 0 facets showing a higher photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 to CH 4 .After the 1 wt Pt-loading, the 0 0 1 facets show uniformly and regularly Pt nanoparticles deposited on its surfaces, while the 0 1 0 facets contain Pt nanoparticles agglomerated on the surfaces due to their different surface electronic structures 15,16, and the smaller Pt nanoparticles well-distributed on 0 0 1 facets can more efficiently enhance the photogenerated carrier lifetimes as compared to the agglomerated Pt nanoparticles loaded on 0 1 0 facets, and therefore the TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt showed a higher photoactivity for the CO 2 reduction than TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt.Moreover, the changes in the CO 2 adsorption capability on anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets caused by the reconstruction of the facets during the Pt deposition process also contribute to the above reversed photoactivity order for the CO 2 photoreduction.The present novel phenomenon on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity over anatase TiO 2 with different exposed facets shed light on the fabrication of new photocatalyst with efficient solar energy conversion efficiency for the organic fuel production."}, {"llm generation": "anatase TiO2", "source": "In conclusion, the reversed effect of Pt-loading on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity for selectively producing CH 4 over anatase TiO 2 with different facets was demonstrated.", "context": "In conclusion, the reversed effect of Pt-loading on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity for selectively producing CH 4 over anatase TiO 2 with different facets was demonstrated.The CO 2 adsorption capability and the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency of anatase TiO 2 with 0 1 0 and 0 0 1 facets were discussed to explain the above reversed effect of Pt-loading.Without the Pt-loading, the anatase TiO 2 0 1 0 facets can strongly adsorb more CO 2 molecules and show longer photogenerated charge lifetime than 0 0 1 facets, and therefore demonstrated a higher photocatalytic reduction efficiency of CO 2 to CH 4 .After 1 wt Pt-loading, the small Pt nanoparticles loaded on TiO 2 0 1 0 facets can more efficiently enhance the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency as compared to the agglomerated Pt nanoparticles loaded on TiO 2 0 0 1 facets, and therefore, TiO 2 -0 0 1 with 1 wt Pt-loaded showed a higher photoactivity than TiO 2 -0 1 0 loaded with 1wtPt.The present results provide an important indication about the effects of Pt-loading on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of anatase TiO 2 with different exposed facets, and shed light on the fabrication of new photocatalyst with efficient solar energy conversion efficiency for the organic fuel production.

the obtained TiO 2 samples with or without 1 wt Pt-loading.As can be seen, the reflection peaks located at 2A 25.4 , 37.8 , 48.5 , 54.0 , 55.4 and 62.9 for those four samples can be indexed to (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 1 1) and (2 0 4) crystal facets of tetragonal anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272), respectively.Moreover, no diffraction peak for any other crystal phase of TiO 2 can be observed in those XRD patterns, demonstrating the formation of pure anatase TiO 2 .Nevertheless, there is no reflection peak attributable to the Pt for the TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt, which may be due to the low content and high dispersity of the loaded Pt particles. FESEM image shown in Fig. 2a reveals that the obtained TiO 2 -0 1 0 is mainly composed of nanorods with particle size of ca.1000 100 nm and ca.93 exposed percentage of 0 1 0 facets, and its HRTEM image (the inset in Fig. 2b) shows the 0 1 0 orientation of the nanorod and the clear lattice fringes with lattice spacing of 0.48 and 0.35 nm, corresponding to the 0 0 2 and 1 0 1 facets of anatase TiO 2 , respectively.The angles of 1 0 1-1 0 -1 facets and 1 0 1-0 0 2 facets can be estimated to be ca.44 and 68 , which are in agreement with the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (the inset in Fig. 2b).Therefore, it can be concluded that the four rectangle facets of the nanorod are 0 1 0 facets of anatase TiO 2 since 0 1 0 and 1 0 0 facets have the same surface construction.Similarly, FESEM image shown in Fig. 2c indicates that TiO 2 -0 0 1 is composed of nanosheets with size of ca.200 10 nm and ca.91 exposed percentage of 0 1 0 facets, and its HRTEM image (the inset in Fig. 2d) displays the 0 0 1 orientation and two clear lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.20 nm, corresponding to the 0 2 0 and 2 0 0 facets, and the angle between them is 90 , which agrees well with the FFT pattern (the inset in Fig. 2d).Therefore, the two square facets (top and bottom facets) of the TiO 2 nanosheets are 0 0 1 facets. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained to analyze the oxidization state and the surface chemical composition of TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt.As can be seen from the survey XPS spectra in Fig. 3a, there are Ti, O, C and Pt elements existing in both the samples.The binding energy (BE) values were corrected by assigning the value of 284.6 eV to the C 1s peak of adventitious hydrocarbons; it can be found that there is a very weak peak of C 1s located at 284.6 eV The binding energy values of Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 can be observed to be 72.1 and 75.3 eV as shown in Fig. 3b, which are almost equal to the standard binding energy of metallic Pt, indicating that Pt metal particles loaded on TiO 2 surfaces for TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt by using the present photodeposition method.Moreover, the TiO 2 -0 0 1 is shown to be fluoride-free crystals as can be observed from the XPS spectra in Fig. 3c 17,20,21, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of TiO 2 -0 0 1 and TiO 2 -0 1 0 are measured to be 67.4 and 32.9 m 2 g -1 , respectively. Control experiments showed no appreciable reduced C1 or C2 products detected in the absence of either photocatalyst or light irradiation, illustrating that both photocatalyst and light irradiation are necessary for the present gaseous photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, and the primary experimental results showed CH 4 was the main product from the gaseous photocatalytic CO 2 reduction systems by using TiO 2 -0 0 1, TiO 2 -0 1 0, TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt or TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt as photocatalyst in the presence of H 2 O vapor.Moreover, when the photocatalytic system was illuminated by introducing N 2 instead of CO 2 into the reactor, neither CH 4 /CO nor other carbon-containing organic compounds can be observed.The above results demonstrated that the generation of CH 4 product was stemmed from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, and the selective formation of CH 4 rather than other hydrocarbons (such as CH 3 OH and CO) might be ascribed to its more feasible thermodynamics because the redox potential of CO 2 /CH 4 E (CO 2 /CH 4 ) -0.24V vs. NHE, pH7.00 is much lower than that of CO 2 /CO E (CO 2 /CO) -0.53V vs. NHE, pH7.00 or CO 2 /CH 3 OH E (CO 2 /CH 3 OH) -0.38V vs. NHE, pH 7.00 15,21. Fig. 4 depicts the CH 4 production amount from the above photocatalytic system containing different photocatalysts under UV-light irradiation for 2 h.As can be seen, TiO 2 -0 0 1 shows a lower photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity for CH 4 production than TiO 2 -0 1 0, and 1 wt Pt-loading leads to a significant increment in the CH 4 production for TiO 2 -0 0 1.However, the 1 wt Pt-loading obviously retards the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of TiO 2 -0 1 0, rendering its photoactivity inferior to the Pt-loaded TiO 2 -0 0 1.Namely, Pt-loading can reverse the photoactivity order of anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets during the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 . To further confirm this phenomenon on Pt-loading, the CH 4 evolution efficiency over 5 wt Pt-loaded samples (TiO 2 -0 0 1-5Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0-5Pt) under UV-light irradiation for 4 h were estimated and shown in Fig. 5, and a similar reversing trend in the photoactivity order of anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets can also be observed.Therefore, it might be conjectured that the above effect of Pt-loading on the photoactivity is largely attributed to the difference of crystal facets rather than the Pt-loaded level. In order to reveal the origin of the reversed photoactivity order of TiO 2 -0 0 1 and TiO 2 -0 1 0 after the Pt-loading, ATR-IR, CO 2 -TPD shown in Fig. 6b, which is usually applied to survey the adsorption amount and the base strength of catalysts.The desorption peaks in the temperature region between 250 and 450 C may be attributed to the CO 2 desorption from weak bases sites such as bicarbonates, while the main peak in the range of 500-600 C may be due to the decomposition of the strongly adsorbed carbonates 2627282930. By comparing the peak areas of those CO 2 desorption and the variance of peak maximum temperature, it can be concluded that the CO 2 adsorbed amount on TiO 2 -0 1 0 is larger than that on TiO 2 -0 0 1.This leads to the judgement that TiO 2 -0 1 0 surfaces is more favorable to the coverage and adsorption of CO 2 -derived species, which then would result in its better photoactivity for the CO 2 photoreduction as compared to TiO 2 -0 0 1.Furthermore, the charge lifetime (0.71 ns) of TiO 2 -0 1 0 is slightly longer than that (0.65 ns) of TiO 2 -0 0 1 according to the time-resolved PL spectra shown in Fig. 6c, indicating that TiO 2 -0 1 0 has more efficient photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than TiO 2 -0 0 1.Usually, the criteria used to predict the photoactivity of crystal facets is the surface unsaturated coordinated atom density 17,20.Among the three fundamental low-index facets (0 0 1, 0 1 0 and 1 0 1) of the anatase TiO 2 crystals, both 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets containing 100 unsaturated five-coordinated Ti (Ti5c) atoms at their surfaces are theoretically considered more reactive than 1 0 1 facets containing 50 Ti5c atoms and 50 saturated coordinated Ti (Ti6c) atoms in terms of the surface Ti5c atom percentage 20.On the contrary, 0 1 0 and 1 0 1 facets should have photoreactivity superior to 0 0 1 facets when considering that more strongly reductive electrons can be generated on 0 1 0 and 1 0 1 facets because their CB minimum in the order 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 20.Obviously, 0 1 0 facets have both a favorable surface atomic structure and a surface electronic structure, so that the more strongly reducing electrons in the CB of the 0 1 0 facets can be transferred via the surface Ti5c atoms as active reaction sites 20.The efficient consumption of excited electrons in the photoreduction reactions can simultaneously promote the holes involved in photooxidation reactions 20, and then resulting in the above longer charge lifetime of TiO 2 -0 1 0 as compared to the TiO 2 -0 0 1.Such a collaborative mechanism existing on 0 1 0 facets is responsible for the higher reactivity than the 0 0 1 facets.It therefore can be concluded that the better photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of TiO 2 -0 1 0 might stem from its higher CO 2 adsorption capability and more efficient charge transfer capability than TiO 2 -0 0 1. Nevertheless, all these observations on ATR-IR, CO 2 -TPD and time-resolved PL spectra were reversed after 1 wt Pt-loading on those facets.As can be seen from Fig. 7a, TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt was still dominated by m-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -, while bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) with very strong peak in addition to the m-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -were mainly formed on the TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt, which is significantly different from the unloaded TiO 2 -0 1 0 as shown in Fig. 6a. According to the previous reports 31323334, the above changes may be due to the surface reconstruction of different facets under the present intense UV-light irradiation during the Pt deposition process because it has been reported that the possible influence of surface reconstruction on the photoactivity of different facets 20. Of course, the different TiO 2 facets may also influence the morphology, size and distribution of the Pt nanoparticles loaded on their surfaces as mentioned above 15,16, and then resulting in different photoreactivities, which will be further discussed in the following sections. As for 0 1 0 facets, it has been reported that the reconstruction should introduce a surface with 1 0 1 microfaceted grooves running in the 0 1 0 direction on 0 1 0 facets 32,33.As a result, some saturated Ti6c atoms would form on the reconstructed 0 1 0 facets because an ideal 1 0 1 facet contain 50 Ti5c and 50 Ti6c atoms, and the percentage of unsaturated Ti5c atoms on the reconstructed 0 1 0 facets would be lower than that on an ideal 0 1 0 ones containing 100 Ti5c atoms 20,35.It is conventional understanding that those facets with a higher percentage of unsaturated coordinated atoms are usually more reactive in heterogeneous reactions, hence the reconstructed 0 1 0 facets should have lower photoactivity than the unreconstructed 0 1 0 ones, this hypothesis is consistent with the above experimental data shown in Figs. 4 and5.Namely, Pt-loading under the present intense UV-light irradiation can retard the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of the 0 1 0 facets (TiO 2 -0 1 0).Moreover, it has been proved that the b-CO 3 2-is easily formed when the CO 2 molecule is bonded to two Ti6c and one O3c surface atoms on the 1 0 1 facets 35, which also can be observed from the ATR-IR spectra shown in Figs.6a and7a.As can be seen, the ATR-IR spectrum (Fig. 7a) of the TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt shows obviously IR peaks of the adsorbed b-CO 3 2-, while the corresponding peaks of b-CO 3 2-are very weak as shown in the ATR-IR spectrum (Fig. 6a) of the TiO 2 -0 1 0 because there are none of those saturated Ti6c atoms formed in this sample without Pt-loading.This phenomenon can validate the hypothesis on the surface reconstruction of 0 1 0 facets under the present intense UV-light irradiation as mentioned above. As for TiO 2 -0 0 1 facets, it has been theoretically discussed in the 1 4 reconstruction on 0 0 1 in terms of the \"ad-molecule\" (ADM) model, in which rows of bridging oxygen atoms are replaced with rows of TiO 3 species forming a chain, which gives rise to more additional under-coordinated Ti4c atoms formed on the 0 0 1 facets surface besides its original 100 Ti5c atoms 20.As mentioned above, a higher percentage of unsaturated coordinated atoms usually mean more reactivity in heterogeneous reaction 20, and therefore the reconstructed 0 0 1 facets should have higher photoactivity than the unreconstructed 0 0 1 ones.This assumption is also confirmed by the experimental results shown in Figs. 4 and5.Namely, Pt-loading under the present intense UV-light irradiation can significantly promote the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of TiO 2 -0 0 1.Moreover, the ATR-IR spectrum (Fig. 7a) of TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt was still dominated by m-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -adsorption but without obvious b-CO 3 2-adsorption peaks due to the absence of Ti6c, which is different from the situation of the reconstruction of 0 1 0 facets as mentioned above. Up to now, the above discussion on the effects of the facet reconstruction on the photoactivity is supported by the comparison of the experimental results between the corresponding facets with and without Pt-loading.To eliminate the effects of the Ptloading, both 0 1 0 and 0 0 1 facets without Pt-loading were also prepared by using the same intensive UV-light illumination as the Pt-loading process but without addition of H 2 PtCl 6 solution.These irradiated facets (without Pt-loading) were also used as photocatalyst to determine their photoactivity at the same condition, and the corresponding results are also listed in Fig. 5.As compared to the corresponding unirradiated one, the irradiated 0 0 1 facets without Pt-loading still show a higher photoactivity (Fig. 5a), while the irradiated 0 1 0 facets have a slightly lower one (Fig. 5b).These changing trends in photoactivity for the irradiated facets are similar to the above observation though the change degrees are much lower as compared to the corresponding Pt-loaded products.Moreover, the ATR-IR spectra (Fig. 7d) of the irradiated TiO 2 -0 0 1 and TiO 2 -0 1 0 are also very similar to that of their corresponding Pt-loaded ones (Fig. 7a), but obviously different from the unirradiated ones (Fig. 6a), also implying that the reconstruction of those facets lead to the differences in the adsorption of CO 2 regardless of Pt-loading or not.Although there is no direct proof on the reconstruction of the anatase facets under irradiation up till now, the present results give strong evidences on the above assumption that the surface reconstruction could improve the photoactivity of 0 0 1 facets but restrain the photoactivity of 0 1 0 facets. After comparing and analyzing the IR peak intensities of ATR-IR and the CO 2 desorption peak areas of the CO 2 -TPD curves shown in Fig. 7a andb, it can be found that there is no obvious difference between TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt on the CO 2 adsorption capability.Therefore, the different effects of Pt-loading on the photoactivity for the two facets should stem from the changes in the photogenerated charge lifetimes as shown in Fig. 7c.By carefully checking the TEM images (Fig. 8) of those Pt-loaded TiO 2 samples, it can be found that the Pt nanoparticles were uniformly and regularly deposited on TiO 2 -0 0 1 surfaces (Fig. 8a andc), while the Pt nanoparticles agglomerated on TiO 2 -0 1 0 surfaces (Fig. 8b andd).The average diameter of the Pt nanoparticles on TiO 2 -0 0 1 can be estimated to be ca.4-5 nm, much smaller than that (20 nm) of the Pt agglomeration on TiO 2 -0 1 0. It has been reported that noble metals such as Au nanoparticles showed a similar size effect on the Fermi level equilibration of semiconductors, where smaller Au nanoparticles can shift the Fermi level of TiO 2 to more negative potentials, leading to an enhanced photocatalytic performance 36,37.Therefore, the highly uniform Pt nanoparticles on TiO 2 -0 0 1 surfaces can effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons and restrain the photogenerated carrier recombination, resulting in the improved photoactivity, while those Pt aggregates on the 0 1 0 facets may not only trap the photogenerated electrons but also consume the holes, and thus serve as recombination centres to restrain the photoactivity 15,16. By considering that those Pt aggregates on the 0 1 0 facets may stem from the high Pt-loading amount (1 wt) and H 2 PtCl 6 (0.077 M) concentration during the present Pt deposition process, much lower Pt-loading amount (0.2 wt) and H 2 PtCl 6 (0.008 M) concentration were tried to deposit smaller not aggregated Pt particles on 0 1 0 facets (TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Pt).For comparison, TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Pt was also prepared through the same process.TEM images (Fig. 8e andg) of TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Pt are similar to the situation observed from TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt (Fig. 8a andc), its surfaces also contain uniformly deposited Pt nanoparticles but with fewer and smaller (ca.2-3 nm) sizes; while TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Pt also shows uniformly deposited Pt nanoparticles with small sizes (ca.4-6 nm) on TiO 2 -0 1 0 surfaces (Fig. 8e andh), which is significantly different from the TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt (Fig. 8b andd).Namely, highly uniform Pt nanoparticles with fewer amount and smaller sizes can be successfully loaded on both the facets.Therefore, the resultant products were also used as photocatalyst to evaluate their photoactivity at the same condition, and the corresponding results are listed in Fig. 5.As can be seen, TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Ptshows an obvious enhancement in the photoactivity as compared to the unloaded one, which is similar to TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 0 1-5Pt (Fig. 5a); whereas TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Pt has the highest photoactivity among the tested samples such as TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt, TiO 2 -0 1 0-5Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0 (Fig. 5b).Obviously, the opposite change in the photoactivity for the 0.2 wt Pt-loaded TiO 2 -0 1 0 as compared to the 1 wt and 5 wt Ptloaded ones can be ascribed to their different morphology and sizes of the loaded Pt particles as shown in Fig. 8. Namely, highly uniform Pt nanoparticles loaded on the 0 1 0 facets can also effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons and restrain the photogenerated carrier recombination, and then improve its photoactivity.Although 0.2 wt Pt-loading is not reverse of the photoactivity order of 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets for the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 since TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Ptshows a slightly higher activity than TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Pt, the difference in the photoactivity between the two facets is significantly reduced as compared to the unloaded ones (Fig. 5).That is, highly uniform Pt nanoparticles are more benefited to the improvement of the photoactivity of the 0 0 1 facets as compared to the 0 1 0 ones.Moreover, as compared to 0 0 1 facets, 0 1 0 facets with a Pt-loading amount larger than 1 wt are easier to form Pt aggregates on the surfaces due to their different surface electronic structures and reconstructions during the Pt deposition process, and the Pt aggregates on 0 1 0 facets may serve as recombination centres to depress the photoactivity as mentioned above. The time-resolved PL spectra of the samples shown in Figs.6c and7c can further validate the above suggestion.As can be seen, 1 wt Pt-loading does not obviously enhance the photogenerated charge lifetime for TiO 2 -0 1 0 (only 0.02 ns increment), while there is 29 increment (from 0.65 ns to 0.84 ns) of the charge lifetimes for TiO 2 -0 0 1 after Pt-loading.It indicates that an appropriate size of the loaded Pt nanoparticles is beneficial for enhancing the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency, resulting in a much Scheme 1. Possible mechanism of the reversed photoactivity order of anatase TiO2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets due to the Pt-loading during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process.longer charge lifetime.According to the CO 2 -TPD curves shown in Figs.6b and7b, the adsorption peak maximum temperature and the peak areas of the CO 2 desorption from TiO 2 -0 0 1 obviously increase after 1 wt Pt-loading; whereas the corresponding maximum temperature and peak areas of TiO 2 -0 1 0 do not increase significantly, indicating that the CO 2 adsorption capability on TiO 2 -0 0 1 was enhanced after the Pt-loading, resulting in TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt showing a higher photoactivity for the CO 2 reduction.Namely, the above reversed photoactivity order of anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets for the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 can be ascribed to changes in the CO 2 adsorption capability and photogenerated carrier separation efficiency on both anatase TiO 2 facets after the Pt-loading. On the bases of the above-mentioned results on the CO 2 adsorption capability and charge transfer properties on anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 or 0 1 0 facets, the reversed effect of Pt-loading on the anatase TiO 2 with different facets for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was summarized in Scheme 1.The 0 1 0 facets without Pt-loading can strongly adsorb CO 2 molecules with more amount and possesses longer photogenerated charge lifetime than the 0 0 1 facets, resulting in the 0 1 0 facets showing a higher photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 to CH 4 .After the 1 wt Pt-loading, the 0 0 1 facets show uniformly and regularly Pt nanoparticles deposited on its surfaces, while the 0 1 0 facets contain Pt nanoparticles agglomerated on the surfaces due to their different surface electronic structures 15,16, and the smaller Pt nanoparticles well-distributed on 0 0 1 facets can more efficiently enhance the photogenerated carrier lifetimes as compared to the agglomerated Pt nanoparticles loaded on 0 1 0 facets, and therefore the TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt showed a higher photoactivity for the CO 2 reduction than TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt.Moreover, the changes in the CO 2 adsorption capability on anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets caused by the reconstruction of the facets during the Pt deposition process also contribute to the above reversed photoactivity order for the CO 2 photoreduction.The present novel phenomenon on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity over anatase TiO 2 with different exposed facets shed light on the fabrication of new photocatalyst with efficient solar energy conversion efficiency for the organic fuel production."}, {"llm generation": "Pt nanoparticles", "source": "After 1 wt Pt-loading, the small Pt nanoparticles loaded on TiO 2 0 1 0 facets can more efficiently enhance the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency as compared to the agglomerated Pt nanoparticles loaded on TiO 2 0 0 1 facets, and therefore, TiO 2 -0 0 1 with 1 wt Pt-loaded showed a higher photoactivity than TiO 2 -0 1 0 loaded with 1wtPt.", "context": "In conclusion, the reversed effect of Pt-loading on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity for selectively producing CH 4 over anatase TiO 2 with different facets was demonstrated.The CO 2 adsorption capability and the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency of anatase TiO 2 with 0 1 0 and 0 0 1 facets were discussed to explain the above reversed effect of Pt-loading.Without the Pt-loading, the anatase TiO 2 0 1 0 facets can strongly adsorb more CO 2 molecules and show longer photogenerated charge lifetime than 0 0 1 facets, and therefore demonstrated a higher photocatalytic reduction efficiency of CO 2 to CH 4 .After 1 wt Pt-loading, the small Pt nanoparticles loaded on TiO 2 0 1 0 facets can more efficiently enhance the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency as compared to the agglomerated Pt nanoparticles loaded on TiO 2 0 0 1 facets, and therefore, TiO 2 -0 0 1 with 1 wt Pt-loaded showed a higher photoactivity than TiO 2 -0 1 0 loaded with 1wtPt.The present results provide an important indication about the effects of Pt-loading on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of anatase TiO 2 with different exposed facets, and shed light on the fabrication of new photocatalyst with efficient solar energy conversion efficiency for the organic fuel production.

FESEM image shown in Fig. 2a reveals that the obtained TiO 2 -0 1 0 is mainly composed of nanorods with particle size of ca.1000 100 nm and ca.93 exposed percentage of 0 1 0 facets, and its HRTEM image (the inset in Fig. 2b) shows the 0 1 0 orientation of the nanorod and the clear lattice fringes with lattice spacing of 0.48 and 0.35 nm, corresponding to the 0 0 2 and 1 0 1 facets of anatase TiO 2 , respectively.The angles of 1 0 1-1 0 -1 facets and 1 0 1-0 0 2 facets can be estimated to be ca.44 and 68 , which are in agreement with the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (the inset in Fig. 2b).Therefore, it can be concluded that the four rectangle facets of the nanorod are 0 1 0 facets of anatase TiO 2 since 0 1 0 and 1 0 0 facets have the same surface construction.Similarly, FESEM image shown in Fig. 2c indicates that TiO 2 -0 0 1 is composed of nanosheets with size of ca.200 10 nm and ca.91 exposed percentage of 0 1 0 facets, and its HRTEM image (the inset in Fig. 2d) displays the 0 0 1 orientation and two clear lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.20 nm, corresponding to the 0 2 0 and 2 0 0 facets, and the angle between them is 90 , which agrees well with the FFT pattern (the inset in Fig. 2d).Therefore, the two square facets (top and bottom facets) of the TiO 2 nanosheets are 0 0 1 facets. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained to analyze the oxidization state and the surface chemical composition of TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt.As can be seen from the survey XPS spectra in Fig. 3a, there are Ti, O, C and Pt elements existing in both the samples.The binding energy (BE) values were corrected by assigning the value of 284.6 eV to the C 1s peak of adventitious hydrocarbons; it can be found that there is a very weak peak of C 1s located at 284.6 eV The binding energy values of Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 can be observed to be 72.1 and 75.3 eV as shown in Fig. 3b, which are almost equal to the standard binding energy of metallic Pt, indicating that Pt metal particles loaded on TiO 2 surfaces for TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt by using the present photodeposition method.Moreover, the TiO 2 -0 0 1 is shown to be fluoride-free crystals as can be observed from the XPS spectra in Fig. 3c 17,20,21, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of TiO 2 -0 0 1 and TiO 2 -0 1 0 are measured to be 67.4 and 32.9 m 2 g -1 , respectively. Control experiments showed no appreciable reduced C1 or C2 products detected in the absence of either photocatalyst or light irradiation, illustrating that both photocatalyst and light irradiation are necessary for the present gaseous photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, and the primary experimental results showed CH 4 was the main product from the gaseous photocatalytic CO 2 reduction systems by using TiO 2 -0 0 1, TiO 2 -0 1 0, TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt or TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt as photocatalyst in the presence of H 2 O vapor.Moreover, when the photocatalytic system was illuminated by introducing N 2 instead of CO 2 into the reactor, neither CH 4 /CO nor other carbon-containing organic compounds can be observed.The above results demonstrated that the generation of CH 4 product was stemmed from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, and the selective formation of CH 4 rather than other hydrocarbons (such as CH 3 OH and CO) might be ascribed to its more feasible thermodynamics because the redox potential of CO 2 /CH 4 E (CO 2 /CH 4 ) -0.24V vs. NHE, pH7.00 is much lower than that of CO 2 /CO E (CO 2 /CO) -0.53V vs. NHE, pH7.00 or CO 2 /CH 3 OH E (CO 2 /CH 3 OH) -0.38V vs. NHE, pH 7.00 15,21. Fig. 4 depicts the CH 4 production amount from the above photocatalytic system containing different photocatalysts under UV-light irradiation for 2 h.As can be seen, TiO 2 -0 0 1 shows a lower photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity for CH 4 production than TiO 2 -0 1 0, and 1 wt Pt-loading leads to a significant increment in the CH 4 production for TiO 2 -0 0 1.However, the 1 wt Pt-loading obviously retards the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of TiO 2 -0 1 0, rendering its photoactivity inferior to the Pt-loaded TiO 2 -0 0 1.Namely, Pt-loading can reverse the photoactivity order of anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets during the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 . To further confirm this phenomenon on Pt-loading, the CH 4 evolution efficiency over 5 wt Pt-loaded samples (TiO 2 -0 0 1-5Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0-5Pt) under UV-light irradiation for 4 h were estimated and shown in Fig. 5, and a similar reversing trend in the photoactivity order of anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets can also be observed.Therefore, it might be conjectured that the above effect of Pt-loading on the photoactivity is largely attributed to the difference of crystal facets rather than the Pt-loaded level. In order to reveal the origin of the reversed photoactivity order of TiO 2 -0 0 1 and TiO 2 -0 1 0 after the Pt-loading, ATR-IR, CO 2 -TPD shown in Fig. 6b, which is usually applied to survey the adsorption amount and the base strength of catalysts.The desorption peaks in the temperature region between 250 and 450 C may be attributed to the CO 2 desorption from weak bases sites such as bicarbonates, while the main peak in the range of 500-600 C may be due to the decomposition of the strongly adsorbed carbonates 2627282930. By comparing the peak areas of those CO 2 desorption and the variance of peak maximum temperature, it can be concluded that the CO 2 adsorbed amount on TiO 2 -0 1 0 is larger than that on TiO 2 -0 0 1.This leads to the judgement that TiO 2 -0 1 0 surfaces is more favorable to the coverage and adsorption of CO 2 -derived species, which then would result in its better photoactivity for the CO 2 photoreduction as compared to TiO 2 -0 0 1.Furthermore, the charge lifetime (0.71 ns) of TiO 2 -0 1 0 is slightly longer than that (0.65 ns) of TiO 2 -0 0 1 according to the time-resolved PL spectra shown in Fig. 6c, indicating that TiO 2 -0 1 0 has more efficient photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than TiO 2 -0 0 1.Usually, the criteria used to predict the photoactivity of crystal facets is the surface unsaturated coordinated atom density 17,20.Among the three fundamental low-index facets (0 0 1, 0 1 0 and 1 0 1) of the anatase TiO 2 crystals, both 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets containing 100 unsaturated five-coordinated Ti (Ti5c) atoms at their surfaces are theoretically considered more reactive than 1 0 1 facets containing 50 Ti5c atoms and 50 saturated coordinated Ti (Ti6c) atoms in terms of the surface Ti5c atom percentage 20.On the contrary, 0 1 0 and 1 0 1 facets should have photoreactivity superior to 0 0 1 facets when considering that more strongly reductive electrons can be generated on 0 1 0 and 1 0 1 facets because their CB minimum in the order 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 20.Obviously, 0 1 0 facets have both a favorable surface atomic structure and a surface electronic structure, so that the more strongly reducing electrons in the CB of the 0 1 0 facets can be transferred via the surface Ti5c atoms as active reaction sites 20.The efficient consumption of excited electrons in the photoreduction reactions can simultaneously promote the holes involved in photooxidation reactions 20, and then resulting in the above longer charge lifetime of TiO 2 -0 1 0 as compared to the TiO 2 -0 0 1.Such a collaborative mechanism existing on 0 1 0 facets is responsible for the higher reactivity than the 0 0 1 facets.It therefore can be concluded that the better photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of TiO 2 -0 1 0 might stem from its higher CO 2 adsorption capability and more efficient charge transfer capability than TiO 2 -0 0 1. Nevertheless, all these observations on ATR-IR, CO 2 -TPD and time-resolved PL spectra were reversed after 1 wt Pt-loading on those facets.As can be seen from Fig. 7a, TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt was still dominated by m-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -, while bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) with very strong peak in addition to the m-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -were mainly formed on the TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt, which is significantly different from the unloaded TiO 2 -0 1 0 as shown in Fig. 6a. According to the previous reports 31323334, the above changes may be due to the surface reconstruction of different facets under the present intense UV-light irradiation during the Pt deposition process because it has been reported that the possible influence of surface reconstruction on the photoactivity of different facets 20. Of course, the different TiO 2 facets may also influence the morphology, size and distribution of the Pt nanoparticles loaded on their surfaces as mentioned above 15,16, and then resulting in different photoreactivities, which will be further discussed in the following sections. As for 0 1 0 facets, it has been reported that the reconstruction should introduce a surface with 1 0 1 microfaceted grooves running in the 0 1 0 direction on 0 1 0 facets 32,33.As a result, some saturated Ti6c atoms would form on the reconstructed 0 1 0 facets because an ideal 1 0 1 facet contain 50 Ti5c and 50 Ti6c atoms, and the percentage of unsaturated Ti5c atoms on the reconstructed 0 1 0 facets would be lower than that on an ideal 0 1 0 ones containing 100 Ti5c atoms 20,35.It is conventional understanding that those facets with a higher percentage of unsaturated coordinated atoms are usually more reactive in heterogeneous reactions, hence the reconstructed 0 1 0 facets should have lower photoactivity than the unreconstructed 0 1 0 ones, this hypothesis is consistent with the above experimental data shown in Figs. 4 and5.Namely, Pt-loading under the present intense UV-light irradiation can retard the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of the 0 1 0 facets (TiO 2 -0 1 0).Moreover, it has been proved that the b-CO 3 2-is easily formed when the CO 2 molecule is bonded to two Ti6c and one O3c surface atoms on the 1 0 1 facets 35, which also can be observed from the ATR-IR spectra shown in Figs.6a and7a.As can be seen, the ATR-IR spectrum (Fig. 7a) of the TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt shows obviously IR peaks of the adsorbed b-CO 3 2-, while the corresponding peaks of b-CO 3 2-are very weak as shown in the ATR-IR spectrum (Fig. 6a) of the TiO 2 -0 1 0 because there are none of those saturated Ti6c atoms formed in this sample without Pt-loading.This phenomenon can validate the hypothesis on the surface reconstruction of 0 1 0 facets under the present intense UV-light irradiation as mentioned above. As for TiO 2 -0 0 1 facets, it has been theoretically discussed in the 1 4 reconstruction on 0 0 1 in terms of the \"ad-molecule\" (ADM) model, in which rows of bridging oxygen atoms are replaced with rows of TiO 3 species forming a chain, which gives rise to more additional under-coordinated Ti4c atoms formed on the 0 0 1 facets surface besides its original 100 Ti5c atoms 20.As mentioned above, a higher percentage of unsaturated coordinated atoms usually mean more reactivity in heterogeneous reaction 20, and therefore the reconstructed 0 0 1 facets should have higher photoactivity than the unreconstructed 0 0 1 ones.This assumption is also confirmed by the experimental results shown in Figs. 4 and5.Namely, Pt-loading under the present intense UV-light irradiation can significantly promote the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of TiO 2 -0 0 1.Moreover, the ATR-IR spectrum (Fig. 7a) of TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt was still dominated by m-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -adsorption but without obvious b-CO 3 2-adsorption peaks due to the absence of Ti6c, which is different from the situation of the reconstruction of 0 1 0 facets as mentioned above. Up to now, the above discussion on the effects of the facet reconstruction on the photoactivity is supported by the comparison of the experimental results between the corresponding facets with and without Pt-loading.To eliminate the effects of the Ptloading, both 0 1 0 and 0 0 1 facets without Pt-loading were also prepared by using the same intensive UV-light illumination as the Pt-loading process but without addition of H 2 PtCl 6 solution.These irradiated facets (without Pt-loading) were also used as photocatalyst to determine their photoactivity at the same condition, and the corresponding results are also listed in Fig. 5.As compared to the corresponding unirradiated one, the irradiated 0 0 1 facets without Pt-loading still show a higher photoactivity (Fig. 5a), while the irradiated 0 1 0 facets have a slightly lower one (Fig. 5b).These changing trends in photoactivity for the irradiated facets are similar to the above observation though the change degrees are much lower as compared to the corresponding Pt-loaded products.Moreover, the ATR-IR spectra (Fig. 7d) of the irradiated TiO 2 -0 0 1 and TiO 2 -0 1 0 are also very similar to that of their corresponding Pt-loaded ones (Fig. 7a), but obviously different from the unirradiated ones (Fig. 6a), also implying that the reconstruction of those facets lead to the differences in the adsorption of CO 2 regardless of Pt-loading or not.Although there is no direct proof on the reconstruction of the anatase facets under irradiation up till now, the present results give strong evidences on the above assumption that the surface reconstruction could improve the photoactivity of 0 0 1 facets but restrain the photoactivity of 0 1 0 facets. After comparing and analyzing the IR peak intensities of ATR-IR and the CO 2 desorption peak areas of the CO 2 -TPD curves shown in Fig. 7a andb, it can be found that there is no obvious difference between TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt on the CO 2 adsorption capability.Therefore, the different effects of Pt-loading on the photoactivity for the two facets should stem from the changes in the photogenerated charge lifetimes as shown in Fig. 7c.By carefully checking the TEM images (Fig. 8) of those Pt-loaded TiO 2 samples, it can be found that the Pt nanoparticles were uniformly and regularly deposited on TiO 2 -0 0 1 surfaces (Fig. 8a andc), while the Pt nanoparticles agglomerated on TiO 2 -0 1 0 surfaces (Fig. 8b andd).The average diameter of the Pt nanoparticles on TiO 2 -0 0 1 can be estimated to be ca.4-5 nm, much smaller than that (20 nm) of the Pt agglomeration on TiO 2 -0 1 0. It has been reported that noble metals such as Au nanoparticles showed a similar size effect on the Fermi level equilibration of semiconductors, where smaller Au nanoparticles can shift the Fermi level of TiO 2 to more negative potentials, leading to an enhanced photocatalytic performance 36,37.Therefore, the highly uniform Pt nanoparticles on TiO 2 -0 0 1 surfaces can effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons and restrain the photogenerated carrier recombination, resulting in the improved photoactivity, while those Pt aggregates on the 0 1 0 facets may not only trap the photogenerated electrons but also consume the holes, and thus serve as recombination centres to restrain the photoactivity 15,16. By considering that those Pt aggregates on the 0 1 0 facets may stem from the high Pt-loading amount (1 wt) and H 2 PtCl 6 (0.077 M) concentration during the present Pt deposition process, much lower Pt-loading amount (0.2 wt) and H 2 PtCl 6 (0.008 M) concentration were tried to deposit smaller not aggregated Pt particles on 0 1 0 facets (TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Pt).For comparison, TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Pt was also prepared through the same process.TEM images (Fig. 8e andg) of TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Pt are similar to the situation observed from TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt (Fig. 8a andc), its surfaces also contain uniformly deposited Pt nanoparticles but with fewer and smaller (ca.2-3 nm) sizes; while TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Pt also shows uniformly deposited Pt nanoparticles with small sizes (ca.4-6 nm) on TiO 2 -0 1 0 surfaces (Fig. 8e andh), which is significantly different from the TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt (Fig. 8b andd).Namely, highly uniform Pt nanoparticles with fewer amount and smaller sizes can be successfully loaded on both the facets.Therefore, the resultant products were also used as photocatalyst to evaluate their photoactivity at the same condition, and the corresponding results are listed in Fig. 5.As can be seen, TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Ptshows an obvious enhancement in the photoactivity as compared to the unloaded one, which is similar to TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 0 1-5Pt (Fig. 5a); whereas TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Pt has the highest photoactivity among the tested samples such as TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt, TiO 2 -0 1 0-5Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0 (Fig. 5b).Obviously, the opposite change in the photoactivity for the 0.2 wt Pt-loaded TiO 2 -0 1 0 as compared to the 1 wt and 5 wt Ptloaded ones can be ascribed to their different morphology and sizes of the loaded Pt particles as shown in Fig. 8. Namely, highly uniform Pt nanoparticles loaded on the 0 1 0 facets can also effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons and restrain the photogenerated carrier recombination, and then improve its photoactivity.Although 0.2 wt Pt-loading is not reverse of the photoactivity order of 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets for the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 since TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Ptshows a slightly higher activity than TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Pt, the difference in the photoactivity between the two facets is significantly reduced as compared to the unloaded ones (Fig. 5).That is, highly uniform Pt nanoparticles are more benefited to the improvement of the photoactivity of the 0 0 1 facets as compared to the 0 1 0 ones.Moreover, as compared to 0 0 1 facets, 0 1 0 facets with a Pt-loading amount larger than 1 wt are easier to form Pt aggregates on the surfaces due to their different surface electronic structures and reconstructions during the Pt deposition process, and the Pt aggregates on 0 1 0 facets may serve as recombination centres to depress the photoactivity as mentioned above. The time-resolved PL spectra of the samples shown in Figs.6c and7c can further validate the above suggestion.As can be seen, 1 wt Pt-loading does not obviously enhance the photogenerated charge lifetime for TiO 2 -0 1 0 (only 0.02 ns increment), while there is 29 increment (from 0.65 ns to 0.84 ns) of the charge lifetimes for TiO 2 -0 0 1 after Pt-loading.It indicates that an appropriate size of the loaded Pt nanoparticles is beneficial for enhancing the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency, resulting in a much Scheme 1. Possible mechanism of the reversed photoactivity order of anatase TiO2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets due to the Pt-loading during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process.longer charge lifetime.According to the CO 2 -TPD curves shown in Figs.6b and7b, the adsorption peak maximum temperature and the peak areas of the CO 2 desorption from TiO 2 -0 0 1 obviously increase after 1 wt Pt-loading; whereas the corresponding maximum temperature and peak areas of TiO 2 -0 1 0 do not increase significantly, indicating that the CO 2 adsorption capability on TiO 2 -0 0 1 was enhanced after the Pt-loading, resulting in TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt showing a higher photoactivity for the CO 2 reduction.Namely, the above reversed photoactivity order of anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets for the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 can be ascribed to changes in the CO 2 adsorption capability and photogenerated carrier separation efficiency on both anatase TiO 2 facets after the Pt-loading. On the bases of the above-mentioned results on the CO 2 adsorption capability and charge transfer properties on anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 or 0 1 0 facets, the reversed effect of Pt-loading on the anatase TiO 2 with different facets for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was summarized in Scheme 1.The 0 1 0 facets without Pt-loading can strongly adsorb CO 2 molecules with more amount and possesses longer photogenerated charge lifetime than the 0 0 1 facets, resulting in the 0 1 0 facets showing a higher photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 to CH 4 .After the 1 wt Pt-loading, the 0 0 1 facets show uniformly and regularly Pt nanoparticles deposited on its surfaces, while the 0 1 0 facets contain Pt nanoparticles agglomerated on the surfaces due to their different surface electronic structures 15,16, and the smaller Pt nanoparticles well-distributed on 0 0 1 facets can more efficiently enhance the photogenerated carrier lifetimes as compared to the agglomerated Pt nanoparticles loaded on 0 1 0 facets, and therefore the TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt showed a higher photoactivity for the CO 2 reduction than TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt.Moreover, the changes in the CO 2 adsorption capability on anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets caused by the reconstruction of the facets during the Pt deposition process also contribute to the above reversed photoactivity order for the CO 2 photoreduction.The present novel phenomenon on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity over anatase TiO 2 with different exposed facets shed light on the fabrication of new photocatalyst with efficient solar energy conversion efficiency for the organic fuel production."}, {"llm generation": "UV-light", "source": "Photocatalytic reduction activity of CO2 to CH4 over TiO2-0 0 1 and TiO2-0 1 0 and their corresponding 1 wt or 5 wt Pt-loaded products under UV-light irradiation for 4 h.", "context": "In conclusion, the reversed effect of Pt-loading on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity for selectively producing CH 4 over anatase TiO 2 with different facets was demonstrated.The CO 2 adsorption capability and the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency of anatase TiO 2 with 0 1 0 and 0 0 1 facets were discussed to explain the above reversed effect of Pt-loading.Without the Pt-loading, the anatase TiO 2 0 1 0 facets can strongly adsorb more CO 2 molecules and show longer photogenerated charge lifetime than 0 0 1 facets, and therefore demonstrated a higher photocatalytic reduction efficiency of CO 2 to CH 4 .After 1 wt Pt-loading, the small Pt nanoparticles loaded on TiO 2 0 1 0 facets can more efficiently enhance the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency as compared to the agglomerated Pt nanoparticles loaded on TiO 2 0 0 1 facets, and therefore, TiO 2 -0 0 1 with 1 wt Pt-loaded showed a higher photoactivity than TiO 2 -0 1 0 loaded with 1wtPt.The present results provide an important indication about the effects of Pt-loading on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of anatase TiO 2 with different exposed facets, and shed light on the fabrication of new photocatalyst with efficient solar energy conversion efficiency for the organic fuel production.

FESEM image shown in Fig. 2a reveals that the obtained TiO 2 -0 1 0 is mainly composed of nanorods with particle size of ca.1000 100 nm and ca.93 exposed percentage of 0 1 0 facets, and its HRTEM image (the inset in Fig. 2b) shows the 0 1 0 orientation of the nanorod and the clear lattice fringes with lattice spacing of 0.48 and 0.35 nm, corresponding to the 0 0 2 and 1 0 1 facets of anatase TiO 2 , respectively.The angles of 1 0 1-1 0 -1 facets and 1 0 1-0 0 2 facets can be estimated to be ca.44 and 68 , which are in agreement with the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (the inset in Fig. 2b).Therefore, it can be concluded that the four rectangle facets of the nanorod are 0 1 0 facets of anatase TiO 2 since 0 1 0 and 1 0 0 facets have the same surface construction.Similarly, FESEM image shown in Fig. 2c indicates that TiO 2 -0 0 1 is composed of nanosheets with size of ca.200 10 nm and ca.91 exposed percentage of 0 1 0 facets, and its HRTEM image (the inset in Fig. 2d) displays the 0 0 1 orientation and two clear lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.20 nm, corresponding to the 0 2 0 and 2 0 0 facets, and the angle between them is 90 , which agrees well with the FFT pattern (the inset in Fig. 2d).Therefore, the two square facets (top and bottom facets) of the TiO 2 nanosheets are 0 0 1 facets. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained to analyze the oxidization state and the surface chemical composition of TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt.As can be seen from the survey XPS spectra in Fig. 3a, there are Ti, O, C and Pt elements existing in both the samples.The binding energy (BE) values were corrected by assigning the value of 284.6 eV to the C 1s peak of adventitious hydrocarbons; it can be found that there is a very weak peak of C 1s located at 284.6 eV The binding energy values of Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 can be observed to be 72.1 and 75.3 eV as shown in Fig. 3b, which are almost equal to the standard binding energy of metallic Pt, indicating that Pt metal particles loaded on TiO 2 surfaces for TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt by using the present photodeposition method.Moreover, the TiO 2 -0 0 1 is shown to be fluoride-free crystals as can be observed from the XPS spectra in Fig. 3c 17,20,21, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of TiO 2 -0 0 1 and TiO 2 -0 1 0 are measured to be 67.4 and 32.9 m 2 g -1 , respectively. Control experiments showed no appreciable reduced C1 or C2 products detected in the absence of either photocatalyst or light irradiation, illustrating that both photocatalyst and light irradiation are necessary for the present gaseous photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, and the primary experimental results showed CH 4 was the main product from the gaseous photocatalytic CO 2 reduction systems by using TiO 2 -0 0 1, TiO 2 -0 1 0, TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt or TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt as photocatalyst in the presence of H 2 O vapor.Moreover, when the photocatalytic system was illuminated by introducing N 2 instead of CO 2 into the reactor, neither CH 4 /CO nor other carbon-containing organic compounds can be observed.The above results demonstrated that the generation of CH 4 product was stemmed from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, and the selective formation of CH 4 rather than other hydrocarbons (such as CH 3 OH and CO) might be ascribed to its more feasible thermodynamics because the redox potential of CO 2 /CH 4 E (CO 2 /CH 4 ) -0.24V vs. NHE, pH7.00 is much lower than that of CO 2 /CO E (CO 2 /CO) -0.53V vs. NHE, pH7.00 or CO 2 /CH 3 OH E (CO 2 /CH 3 OH) -0.38V vs. NHE, pH 7.00 15,21. Fig. 4 depicts the CH 4 production amount from the above photocatalytic system containing different photocatalysts under UV-light irradiation for 2 h.As can be seen, TiO 2 -0 0 1 shows a lower photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity for CH 4 production than TiO 2 -0 1 0, and 1 wt Pt-loading leads to a significant increment in the CH 4 production for TiO 2 -0 0 1.However, the 1 wt Pt-loading obviously retards the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of TiO 2 -0 1 0, rendering its photoactivity inferior to the Pt-loaded TiO 2 -0 0 1.Namely, Pt-loading can reverse the photoactivity order of anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets during the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 . To further confirm this phenomenon on Pt-loading, the CH 4 evolution efficiency over 5 wt Pt-loaded samples (TiO 2 -0 0 1-5Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0-5Pt) under UV-light irradiation for 4 h were estimated and shown in Fig. 5, and a similar reversing trend in the photoactivity order of anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets can also be observed.Therefore, it might be conjectured that the above effect of Pt-loading on the photoactivity is largely attributed to the difference of crystal facets rather than the Pt-loaded level. In order to reveal the origin of the reversed photoactivity order of TiO 2 -0 0 1 and TiO 2 -0 1 0 after the Pt-loading, ATR-IR, CO 2 -TPD shown in Fig. 6b, which is usually applied to survey the adsorption amount and the base strength of catalysts.The desorption peaks in the temperature region between 250 and 450 C may be attributed to the CO 2 desorption from weak bases sites such as bicarbonates, while the main peak in the range of 500-600 C may be due to the decomposition of the strongly adsorbed carbonates 2627282930. By comparing the peak areas of those CO 2 desorption and the variance of peak maximum temperature, it can be concluded that the CO 2 adsorbed amount on TiO 2 -0 1 0 is larger than that on TiO 2 -0 0 1.This leads to the judgement that TiO 2 -0 1 0 surfaces is more favorable to the coverage and adsorption of CO 2 -derived species, which then would result in its better photoactivity for the CO 2 photoreduction as compared to TiO 2 -0 0 1.Furthermore, the charge lifetime (0.71 ns) of TiO 2 -0 1 0 is slightly longer than that (0.65 ns) of TiO 2 -0 0 1 according to the time-resolved PL spectra shown in Fig. 6c, indicating that TiO 2 -0 1 0 has more efficient photogenerated carrier separation efficiency than TiO 2 -0 0 1.Usually, the criteria used to predict the photoactivity of crystal facets is the surface unsaturated coordinated atom density 17,20.Among the three fundamental low-index facets (0 0 1, 0 1 0 and 1 0 1) of the anatase TiO 2 crystals, both 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets containing 100 unsaturated five-coordinated Ti (Ti5c) atoms at their surfaces are theoretically considered more reactive than 1 0 1 facets containing 50 Ti5c atoms and 50 saturated coordinated Ti (Ti6c) atoms in terms of the surface Ti5c atom percentage 20.On the contrary, 0 1 0 and 1 0 1 facets should have photoreactivity superior to 0 0 1 facets when considering that more strongly reductive electrons can be generated on 0 1 0 and 1 0 1 facets because their CB minimum in the order 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 20.Obviously, 0 1 0 facets have both a favorable surface atomic structure and a surface electronic structure, so that the more strongly reducing electrons in the CB of the 0 1 0 facets can be transferred via the surface Ti5c atoms as active reaction sites 20.The efficient consumption of excited electrons in the photoreduction reactions can simultaneously promote the holes involved in photooxidation reactions 20, and then resulting in the above longer charge lifetime of TiO 2 -0 1 0 as compared to the TiO 2 -0 0 1.Such a collaborative mechanism existing on 0 1 0 facets is responsible for the higher reactivity than the 0 0 1 facets.It therefore can be concluded that the better photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of TiO 2 -0 1 0 might stem from its higher CO 2 adsorption capability and more efficient charge transfer capability than TiO 2 -0 0 1. Nevertheless, all these observations on ATR-IR, CO 2 -TPD and time-resolved PL spectra were reversed after 1 wt Pt-loading on those facets.As can be seen from Fig. 7a, TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt was still dominated by m-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -, while bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) with very strong peak in addition to the m-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -were mainly formed on the TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt, which is significantly different from the unloaded TiO 2 -0 1 0 as shown in Fig. 6a. According to the previous reports 31323334, the above changes may be due to the surface reconstruction of different facets under the present intense UV-light irradiation during the Pt deposition process because it has been reported that the possible influence of surface reconstruction on the photoactivity of different facets 20. Of course, the different TiO 2 facets may also influence the morphology, size and distribution of the Pt nanoparticles loaded on their surfaces as mentioned above 15,16, and then resulting in different photoreactivities, which will be further discussed in the following sections. As for 0 1 0 facets, it has been reported that the reconstruction should introduce a surface with 1 0 1 microfaceted grooves running in the 0 1 0 direction on 0 1 0 facets 32,33.As a result, some saturated Ti6c atoms would form on the reconstructed 0 1 0 facets because an ideal 1 0 1 facet contain 50 Ti5c and 50 Ti6c atoms, and the percentage of unsaturated Ti5c atoms on the reconstructed 0 1 0 facets would be lower than that on an ideal 0 1 0 ones containing 100 Ti5c atoms 20,35.It is conventional understanding that those facets with a higher percentage of unsaturated coordinated atoms are usually more reactive in heterogeneous reactions, hence the reconstructed 0 1 0 facets should have lower photoactivity than the unreconstructed 0 1 0 ones, this hypothesis is consistent with the above experimental data shown in Figs. 4 and5.Namely, Pt-loading under the present intense UV-light irradiation can retard the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of the 0 1 0 facets (TiO 2 -0 1 0).Moreover, it has been proved that the b-CO 3 2-is easily formed when the CO 2 molecule is bonded to two Ti6c and one O3c surface atoms on the 1 0 1 facets 35, which also can be observed from the ATR-IR spectra shown in Figs.6a and7a.As can be seen, the ATR-IR spectrum (Fig. 7a) of the TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt shows obviously IR peaks of the adsorbed b-CO 3 2-, while the corresponding peaks of b-CO 3 2-are very weak as shown in the ATR-IR spectrum (Fig. 6a) of the TiO 2 -0 1 0 because there are none of those saturated Ti6c atoms formed in this sample without Pt-loading.This phenomenon can validate the hypothesis on the surface reconstruction of 0 1 0 facets under the present intense UV-light irradiation as mentioned above. As for TiO 2 -0 0 1 facets, it has been theoretically discussed in the 1 4 reconstruction on 0 0 1 in terms of the \"ad-molecule\" (ADM) model, in which rows of bridging oxygen atoms are replaced with rows of TiO 3 species forming a chain, which gives rise to more additional under-coordinated Ti4c atoms formed on the 0 0 1 facets surface besides its original 100 Ti5c atoms 20.As mentioned above, a higher percentage of unsaturated coordinated atoms usually mean more reactivity in heterogeneous reaction 20, and therefore the reconstructed 0 0 1 facets should have higher photoactivity than the unreconstructed 0 0 1 ones.This assumption is also confirmed by the experimental results shown in Figs. 4 and5.Namely, Pt-loading under the present intense UV-light irradiation can significantly promote the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of TiO 2 -0 0 1.Moreover, the ATR-IR spectrum (Fig. 7a) of TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt was still dominated by m-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -adsorption but without obvious b-CO 3 2-adsorption peaks due to the absence of Ti6c, which is different from the situation of the reconstruction of 0 1 0 facets as mentioned above. Up to now, the above discussion on the effects of the facet reconstruction on the photoactivity is supported by the comparison of the experimental results between the corresponding facets with and without Pt-loading.To eliminate the effects of the Ptloading, both 0 1 0 and 0 0 1 facets without Pt-loading were also prepared by using the same intensive UV-light illumination as the Pt-loading process but without addition of H 2 PtCl 6 solution.These irradiated facets (without Pt-loading) were also used as photocatalyst to determine their photoactivity at the same condition, and the corresponding results are also listed in Fig. 5.As compared to the corresponding unirradiated one, the irradiated 0 0 1 facets without Pt-loading still show a higher photoactivity (Fig. 5a), while the irradiated 0 1 0 facets have a slightly lower one (Fig. 5b).These changing trends in photoactivity for the irradiated facets are similar to the above observation though the change degrees are much lower as compared to the corresponding Pt-loaded products.Moreover, the ATR-IR spectra (Fig. 7d) of the irradiated TiO 2 -0 0 1 and TiO 2 -0 1 0 are also very similar to that of their corresponding Pt-loaded ones (Fig. 7a), but obviously different from the unirradiated ones (Fig. 6a), also implying that the reconstruction of those facets lead to the differences in the adsorption of CO 2 regardless of Pt-loading or not.Although there is no direct proof on the reconstruction of the anatase facets under irradiation up till now, the present results give strong evidences on the above assumption that the surface reconstruction could improve the photoactivity of 0 0 1 facets but restrain the photoactivity of 0 1 0 facets. After comparing and analyzing the IR peak intensities of ATR-IR and the CO 2 desorption peak areas of the CO 2 -TPD curves shown in Fig. 7a andb, it can be found that there is no obvious difference between TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt on the CO 2 adsorption capability.Therefore, the different effects of Pt-loading on the photoactivity for the two facets should stem from the changes in the photogenerated charge lifetimes as shown in Fig. 7c.By carefully checking the TEM images (Fig. 8) of those Pt-loaded TiO 2 samples, it can be found that the Pt nanoparticles were uniformly and regularly deposited on TiO 2 -0 0 1 surfaces (Fig. 8a andc), while the Pt nanoparticles agglomerated on TiO 2 -0 1 0 surfaces (Fig. 8b andd).The average diameter of the Pt nanoparticles on TiO 2 -0 0 1 can be estimated to be ca.4-5 nm, much smaller than that (20 nm) of the Pt agglomeration on TiO 2 -0 1 0. It has been reported that noble metals such as Au nanoparticles showed a similar size effect on the Fermi level equilibration of semiconductors, where smaller Au nanoparticles can shift the Fermi level of TiO 2 to more negative potentials, leading to an enhanced photocatalytic performance 36,37.Therefore, the highly uniform Pt nanoparticles on TiO 2 -0 0 1 surfaces can effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons and restrain the photogenerated carrier recombination, resulting in the improved photoactivity, while those Pt aggregates on the 0 1 0 facets may not only trap the photogenerated electrons but also consume the holes, and thus serve as recombination centres to restrain the photoactivity 15,16. By considering that those Pt aggregates on the 0 1 0 facets may stem from the high Pt-loading amount (1 wt) and H 2 PtCl 6 (0.077 M) concentration during the present Pt deposition process, much lower Pt-loading amount (0.2 wt) and H 2 PtCl 6 (0.008 M) concentration were tried to deposit smaller not aggregated Pt particles on 0 1 0 facets (TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Pt).For comparison, TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Pt was also prepared through the same process.TEM images (Fig. 8e andg) of TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Pt are similar to the situation observed from TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt (Fig. 8a andc), its surfaces also contain uniformly deposited Pt nanoparticles but with fewer and smaller (ca.2-3 nm) sizes; while TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Pt also shows uniformly deposited Pt nanoparticles with small sizes (ca.4-6 nm) on TiO 2 -0 1 0 surfaces (Fig. 8e andh), which is significantly different from the TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt (Fig. 8b andd).Namely, highly uniform Pt nanoparticles with fewer amount and smaller sizes can be successfully loaded on both the facets.Therefore, the resultant products were also used as photocatalyst to evaluate their photoactivity at the same condition, and the corresponding results are listed in Fig. 5.As can be seen, TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Ptshows an obvious enhancement in the photoactivity as compared to the unloaded one, which is similar to TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt and TiO 2 -0 0 1-5Pt (Fig. 5a); whereas TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Pt has the highest photoactivity among the tested samples such as TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt, TiO 2 -0 1 0-5Pt and TiO 2 -0 1 0 (Fig. 5b).Obviously, the opposite change in the photoactivity for the 0.2 wt Pt-loaded TiO 2 -0 1 0 as compared to the 1 wt and 5 wt Ptloaded ones can be ascribed to their different morphology and sizes of the loaded Pt particles as shown in Fig. 8. Namely, highly uniform Pt nanoparticles loaded on the 0 1 0 facets can also effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons and restrain the photogenerated carrier recombination, and then improve its photoactivity.Although 0.2 wt Pt-loading is not reverse of the photoactivity order of 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets for the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 since TiO 2 -0 1 0-0.2Ptshows a slightly higher activity than TiO 2 -0 0 1-0.2Pt, the difference in the photoactivity between the two facets is significantly reduced as compared to the unloaded ones (Fig. 5).That is, highly uniform Pt nanoparticles are more benefited to the improvement of the photoactivity of the 0 0 1 facets as compared to the 0 1 0 ones.Moreover, as compared to 0 0 1 facets, 0 1 0 facets with a Pt-loading amount larger than 1 wt are easier to form Pt aggregates on the surfaces due to their different surface electronic structures and reconstructions during the Pt deposition process, and the Pt aggregates on 0 1 0 facets may serve as recombination centres to depress the photoactivity as mentioned above. The time-resolved PL spectra of the samples shown in Figs.6c and7c can further validate the above suggestion.As can be seen, 1 wt Pt-loading does not obviously enhance the photogenerated charge lifetime for TiO 2 -0 1 0 (only 0.02 ns increment), while there is 29 increment (from 0.65 ns to 0.84 ns) of the charge lifetimes for TiO 2 -0 0 1 after Pt-loading.It indicates that an appropriate size of the loaded Pt nanoparticles is beneficial for enhancing the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency, resulting in a much Scheme 1. Possible mechanism of the reversed photoactivity order of anatase TiO2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets due to the Pt-loading during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process.longer charge lifetime.According to the CO 2 -TPD curves shown in Figs.6b and7b, the adsorption peak maximum temperature and the peak areas of the CO 2 desorption from TiO 2 -0 0 1 obviously increase after 1 wt Pt-loading; whereas the corresponding maximum temperature and peak areas of TiO 2 -0 1 0 do not increase significantly, indicating that the CO 2 adsorption capability on TiO 2 -0 0 1 was enhanced after the Pt-loading, resulting in TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt showing a higher photoactivity for the CO 2 reduction.Namely, the above reversed photoactivity order of anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets for the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 can be ascribed to changes in the CO 2 adsorption capability and photogenerated carrier separation efficiency on both anatase TiO 2 facets after the Pt-loading. On the bases of the above-mentioned results on the CO 2 adsorption capability and charge transfer properties on anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 or 0 1 0 facets, the reversed effect of Pt-loading on the anatase TiO 2 with different facets for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was summarized in Scheme 1.The 0 1 0 facets without Pt-loading can strongly adsorb CO 2 molecules with more amount and possesses longer photogenerated charge lifetime than the 0 0 1 facets, resulting in the 0 1 0 facets showing a higher photocatalytic reduction activity of CO 2 to CH 4 .After the 1 wt Pt-loading, the 0 0 1 facets show uniformly and regularly Pt nanoparticles deposited on its surfaces, while the 0 1 0 facets contain Pt nanoparticles agglomerated on the surfaces due to their different surface electronic structures 15,16, and the smaller Pt nanoparticles well-distributed on 0 0 1 facets can more efficiently enhance the photogenerated carrier lifetimes as compared to the agglomerated Pt nanoparticles loaded on 0 1 0 facets, and therefore the TiO 2 -0 0 1-1Pt showed a higher photoactivity for the CO 2 reduction than TiO 2 -0 1 0-1Pt.Moreover, the changes in the CO 2 adsorption capability on anatase TiO 2 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 facets caused by the reconstruction of the facets during the Pt deposition process also contribute to the above reversed photoactivity order for the CO 2 photoreduction.The present novel phenomenon on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity over anatase TiO 2 with different exposed facets shed light on the fabrication of new photocatalyst with efficient solar energy conversion efficiency for the organic fuel production."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Fixed-bed", "source": "In the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction system, 0.1 g of photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed onto the watch-glass with an area of 28 cm 2 , which was then put in the reaction cell (Pyrex glass) with a total volume of 350 mL.", "context": "TiO 2 -0 0 1: Anatase TiO 2 with exposed 0 0 1 facets (TiO 2 -0 0 1) was hydrothermally prepared via a procedure similar to the previous report 17.Typically, tetrabutoxytitanium (IV) (Ti(OBu) 4 , 10 mL) and hydrofluoric acid aqueous solution (37, 3 mL) were mixed in a dried Teflon-lined autoclave (50 mL) under ambient conditions, and then the autoclave was tightened and kept at 200 C for 24 h.The white product was filtrated and subsequently washed with deionized water and ethanol three times, and then dried at 60 C for 10 h to obtain anatase TiO 2 with exposed 0 0 1 facets (TiO 2 -0 0 1).Finally, the TiO 2 -0 0 1 was calcined at 600 C for 2 h to remove the surface fluorine.
