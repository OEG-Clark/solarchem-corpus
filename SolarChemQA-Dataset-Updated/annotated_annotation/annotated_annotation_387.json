Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O (0.68 g) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, 0.20 g) were added slowly into an ethylene glycol solution containing stoichiometric amounts of KBr with a Bi/Br molar ratio of 1.0.The mixture was ultrasonically treated and magnetically stirred, then transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave.The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 120 C for 12 h.After reaction, the resulting solid product was collected by filtration, and washed with deionized water and ethanol for 3 times respectively.The obtained BiOBr product was then dried at 60 C for 6 h. The Bi 2 WO 6 HHMS was prepared by a sacrificed template method.The as-prepared BiOBr (1.20 g) was suspended in the Na 2 WO 4 solution (16 mmol L -1 , 160 mL) under stirring.Then the mixture was stirred for 30 min and then transferred to Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, which were maintained at 160 C for 36 h.The product was filtered, washed with deionized water and ethanol for 3 times respectively, and dried at 80 C for 6 h to obtain the Bi 2 WO 6 HHMS. The conducting polymers modified Bi 2 WO 6 composites were prepared by an in situ chemically oxidative polymerization method.A typical synthetic procedure is as follows: 1.0 g as-prepared Bi 2 WO 6 HHMS was suspended in 50 mL of ethanol and stirred for 30 min at 0 C in the ice-water bath.Then designated amount of monomer (aniline, pyrrole, or thiophene) was added into the suspension at 0 C under stirring.After continuous stirring for 30 min, HCl aqueous solution (2.0 mL, pH 2) containing 0.135 g ferric chloride was added dropwise into the above mixture.The resulting mixture was stirred at 0 C for 6 h.Afterward, the reaction mixture was filtered, and the precipitate was washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, respectively.Finally, the obtained product (denoted as PPy/Bi 2 WO 6 , PANI/Bi 2 WO 6 , and PTh/Bi 2 WO 6 , respectively) was dried at 80 C for 12 h.The nominal weight ratio of polymer monomer to Bi 2 WO 6 is 1:100. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) of the samples was recorded on a Bruker AXS-D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu K radiation in the 2A range of 10-70 .Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations were carried out over a Nova NanoSEM 450 microscope.Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed using the INCA 250 accessory of Nova NanoSEM 450.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were performed on a JEOL JEM-2100 TEM.The FT-IR spectra were recorded using a Bruker vertex 70 FT-IR spectrophotometer.The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were performed at room temperature on a Hitachi U-3900H instrument with a collection speed of 300 nm min -1 using BaSO 4 as the reference.The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at room temperature using a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Electrochemical measurements were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI 660D Instruments) in a standard three-electrode system with the prepared samples as the working electrodes with an active area of catalyst 1.0 cm 2 , graphite as the counter electrode, and SCE (saturated calomel electrode) as a reference electrode.The Mott-Schottky measurement was performed at fixed frequency of 1000 Hz with 5 mV amplitude.As for photocurrents measurements, a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an ultraviolet cut off filter to provide visible-light with 420 nm served as the visible light source.A 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. In a typical procedure for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 , photocatalyst powder (50 mg) was suspended in 50 mL deionized water under magnetic stirring, and high purity CO 2 gas (99.995) was continuously bubbled through the solution at the rate of 50 mL min -1 .A 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE300) equipped with an ultraviolet cutoff filter to provide visible light ( 420 nm) was used as the light source.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were conducted in a closed vessel at 4 C, and the suspensions were irradiated through a quartz window.Prior to irradiation, CO 2 gas was bubbled to solution for 30 min to eliminate the dissolved oxygen in the reaction system.After turning on the lamp, 2 mL of suspensions were sampled at certain time intervals and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst particles.The solution products were qualitatively analyzed by Agilent Technologies 7890A gas chromatograph (FID detector, DB-WAX column) through observing and comparing the chromatographic peaks with those for the authentic methanol standard and ethanol standard.The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is also measured under the same photocatalytic reaction conditions.The incident light intensity of Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE300) is measured using a Radiometer (FZ-A, Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University) and the number of reacted electrons can be calculated as methanol and ethanol molecules multiplied by the corresponding reductive electronic numbers, respectively.The AQE is calculated according to the following equation:"}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
