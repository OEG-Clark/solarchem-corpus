Experiments were conducted in continuous-flow mode in a homemade reaction system (Scheme 1 in Supplementary Material).The powdered catalyst (0.1 g) was deposited on a glass microfiber filter.Illumination was carried out using four 6 W lamps with a maximum emission at 365 nm and an average irradiance of 33.9 Wm -2 (measured on top the filter by a Blue-Wave radiometer in the range 330-400 nm).Compressed CO 2 ( 99.9999, Praxair) and water (Milli-Q), were passed through a controlled evaporation and mixing unit, maintaining a molar ratio of 7.25 (CO 2 :H 2 O).The reaction conditions were set at 2 bar and T 50-150 C. In-line gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 A) analyzes were performed to detect the reaction products.The GC is equipped with two separation branches, one equipped with two semicapillary columns (BR-Q Plot and BR-Molesieve 5 A) and one thermal conductivity detector, a flame ionization detector (FID) and a methanizer.The second separation branch consists on a capillary column (CP-Sil 5B) and a second FID.Before starting the experiments, the reactor was first degassed under vacuum and then purged for 1 h using argon (100 mL min -1 ) to remove any residual organic compounds weakly adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst.Then, the reactor was flushed with the CO 2 and water mixture for 1 h to establish an adsorption-desorption balance at the reaction temperature.Analogously, photocatalytic experiments under argon, argon H 2 O, and CO 2 were performed following the same reaction procedure but changing the feeding gas.Post-reaction treatment was performed by immersing the catalyst filter in an aqueous nitric acid solution (0.1 M) for 30 min.The filter was then washed with distilled water and dried in the oven at 100 C before reaction tests. The photonic efficiency () towards CO was calculated as the ratio between the rate of reaction and the incident photon flux, according to Eq. (1). where 2 represents the number of electrons involved in the conversion of CO 2 to CO; dN/dt represents the production rate of CO, and q 0 p, is the incident spectral photon flux within a defined wavelength range (ca.330-400 nm).The superscript 0 (zero) emphasizes that the incident number of photons (prior to absorption) is considered.The incident spectral photon flux was calculated from the lamp emission spectrum (see Scheme 1d in Supplementary Material), recorded with a StellarNet UVNb-50 spectroradiometer connected to an optical fiber. Isotope tracing experiments were carried out in a 15.6 mL stainless steel reactor with a borosilicate glass window operated in batch mode.After outgassing, 13 CO 2 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., 99.2 13 C, 1 18 O) and H 2 O were introduced in the reactor at 50 C and 2 bar.After 30 min UV irradiation (four 6 W lamps, fluorescent Philips Actinic, max 365 nm), the gas was analyzed in a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OMNISTAR). Carbon content was determined using a THERMO SCIENTIFIC Flash 2000 Elemental Analyzer after sample combustion at 900 C. Samples weight loss and carbon-products desorption were monitored in a thermobalance TA Instruments SDT Q-600, coupled to an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OMNISTAR).Further characterization (N adsorption-desorption isotherms XRD, TEM) can be found in a previous study 24 and is also summarized in Fig. S1. To identify the acid and basic sites on the TiO 2 surface, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were carried out using an AUTOCHEM II 2910 instrument (Micromeritics), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).For NH 3 -TPD tests, the catalyst sample (0.1 g) was degassed under He flow at 350 C for 30 min, cooled down to three different temperatures (50, 100 and 150 C) in He flow, and then treated with 5 vol NH 3 /He until the material was saturated at those temperatures.Then, the sample was purged at the same temperature under He flow in order to remove the weakly physisorbed ammonia until only He was detected in the TCD signal.Finally, the NH 3 -TPD profile was subsequently recorded increasing the temperature from 50, 100 or 150-550 C using a ramp rate of 5 C min -1 .A final isotherm at 550 C of 30 min was added in order to ensure a complete NH desorption.The experimental procedure for CO 2 -TPD measurements was similar to that followed for the NH 3 -TPD test at 50 C, but changing the probe molecule to CO 2 . Theoretical calculations by periodic density functional theory (DFT) were carried out using a 114-atom TiO 2 nanoparticle with anatase structure 27.Geometry and electronic structure were performed using the projected augmented wave method implemented in Viena ab initio simulation package (VASP) 28,29.The total energies corresponding to the optimized geometries of all samples were calculated using the spin polarized version of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) 30.The Heyd-Scuseria-Enzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06) 31, with a mixing parameter of 0.325, was used to fit a more accurate energy gap.The cut-off for the kinetic energy of the plane-waves was set to 450 eV to ensure a total energy convergence better than 10 -4 eV.The cut-off for the kinetic energy of the plane-waves was set to 500 eV to ensure a total energy and force convergence better than 10 -4 eV and 0.01 eV/A 3 , respectively. Theoretical optoelectronic properties of TiO 2 were calculated using time dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) 32,33 implemented in the software Gaussian 09 34, employing a CAM-B3LYP functional 35 and using a DGDZVP2 basis set 36,37.A fixed number of 150 states was selected for a proper comparison between all configurations and models.The interactions between reagents and intermediates with surface sites were explored by molecular dynamics using a hydroxylated TiO 2 nanoparticle (40 nm) and CO 2 , H 2 O, CO 3 2-, HCO 3 -molecules.The system was equilibrated for 10 ps using a 1 fs timestep at 323 K.A Berendsen thermostat controlled the ionic temperature (dt/ 1/50). Measurements were performed on a Thermo-Nicolet FTIR instrument, which housed a Harrick DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy) reaction cell with three quartz windows, in which the gas stream passed through the powdered sample.Spectra were collected at a resolution of 4 cm -1 with 32 co-added scans in the range 650-4000 cm -1 using a liquid N 2 -cooled MCT detector.A step with argon flow (10 mL min -1 ) at 50 C was performed for 1 h, after acquiring a spectrum of the fresh sample in air as background.Then, a 5 sccm flow of 0.1 CO 2 in humid Ar (saturated with water using a thermostated bubbler) was introduced to the cell.Illumination was carried out using a 365 nm LED lamp. Spectra were recorded using a JASCO NRS-5000/7000 series laser spectrometer equipped with a Linkam CCR1000 in situ cell with a quartz window in which the gas stream passed through the powdered sample.Excitation was performed with a 532 nm laser.The reaction conditions were the same as those used for in situ DRIFTS.Illumination was carried out using a 365 nm LED lamp. A PHOIBOS 150 NAP energy analyzer at the NAPP branch from CIRCE beamline of the ALBA synchrotron light source was used to perform these experiments.The CIRCE beamline is an undulator beamline with a photon energy range 100-2000 eV.In this work, data was acquired with photon energy h 900 eV, using an analyzer pass energy of 10 and 20 eV.The beam spot size at the sample is around 100 90 m 2 (HxV).Powdered samples were pressed into round disks.Ti 2p NAP-XPS spectra were recorded in UHV and under both dark and illumination conditions.In addition, C 1s and O 1s were acquired in UHV and under a CO 2 and H 2 O mixture.NAP-XPS experiments under illumination were performed using a UV LED (Hamamatsu Co.) with a maximum emission centered at 365 nm.The Au 4 f 7/2 peak at 84.0 eV from a Au foil was taken as energy reference.These studies were performed as follows: ultrapure water (LC-MS CHROMASOLV grade, Sigma-Aldrich) was introduced into the chamber through a variable high precision leak valve after being degassed by multiple freeze--pump-thaw cycles.CO 2 (purity 99.995, Abello Linde) was introduced into the chamber directly from a commercial cylinder through a variable high precision leak valve.The gases were dosed into the chamber until reaching a base pressure of 5 10 -2 mbar (CO 2 :H 2 O 7:1).Data were collected using SpecsLab software. 2.9.In-situ 1 H and 13 C solid state NMR Analyzes were conducted in a Bruker AvanceTM 400 spectrometer equipped with a 9.4 T superconducting magnet ( 1 H and 13 C Larmor frequencies at 400.14 MHz and 100.61MHz, respectively).For the measurements, calcined TiO 2 powder (0.1 g) was loaded in a 10 mm glass tube and degassed at 150 C for 5-8 h.Samples were allowed to cool down to room temperature under vacuum, and then 13 CO 2 was loaded at 1.3-2.0bar.In water co-feeding experiments, TiO 2 powder was cooled to -60 C (mixture of dry ice and isopropanol) before injecting 0.1-0.2L of distilled water in the glass tube.Samples were irradiated under UV light (6 W lamp, max 365 nm) at different time intervals.Analyzes were performed using a NMR probe head with a 10 mm radiofrequency (rf) insert tuned to the 13 C Larmor frequency. 13C NMR spectra were acquired using a single pulse excitation with solutionlike NMR conditions and keeping the samples static.After this, a fraction of the sample (about 0.07 g of 0.7 g) was transferred under dry nitrogen to a 4 mm zirconia rotor, and analyzed using a standard Bruker double resonance 4 mm cross-polarization (CP)/magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR probe head. 1 H and 13 C MAS spectra were acquired using spinning rates of 5-6.5 kHz and a single pulse excitation with recycle delays of and 3 s, respectively.The 13 C CP/MAS spectra were acquired with 2 ms CP contact time, a repetition rate of 3 s and high-power proton decoupling of 75 kHz. 1 H and 13 C chemical shifts were externally referenced to adamantane (29.5 ppm relative to tetramethylsilane, 0.0 ppm).All freeinduction decays were subjected to standard Fourier transformation with 20-100 Hz line broadening and phasing.NMR spectra were evaluated using the software package XWIN NMR provided by the spectrometer manufacturer.Each spectrum was deconvoluted using Gaussian/Lorentzian fits, taking into consideration available information in the literature and our experimental observations for initial peaks assignments to carboxylated species in the region of interest.The peak areas were normalized to sample weight."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "Fig. 1c depicts the photoactivity of the TiO 2 catalyst (Fig. S1) in a gas phase photoreactor (Scheme S1) using a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor and UV illumination.", "context": "Fig. 1c depicts the photoactivity of the TiO 2 catalyst (Fig. S1) in a gas phase photoreactor (Scheme S1) using a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor and UV illumination.CO and H 2 were obtained as main products, reaching maximum formation rates of 25.5 and 7.6 mol g cat respectively, and a photonic efficiency towards CO of 0.21 (Table S2).Besides, minor amounts of CH 3 OH, CH 4 and C 2 H 6 were also detected with evolution rates increasing when CO and H 2 yields decreased (Table S3).These values are comparable to other studies reported under similar conditions (Table S1), although significant differences have also been found in the literature (see Fig. 1a).To understand the dispersion in TiO 2 reactivity it is necessary to dig deeper into the mechanism that controls this reaction.In addition, 13 CO 2 reduction batch reactions performed under similar reaction conditions 38 showed the production of 13 CO, while other products were below the detection limit of our equipment. Activity and selectivity are governed by two main kinetic processes related to the charge dynamics of photogenerated e -/h pairs 24,25 and to the surface adsorption-desorption rates, which are intimately associated with the acid/base properties of the catalyst surface.TiO presents a weakly acidic surface (PZC 6) (Fig. 2), bearing Lewis acid sites (LAS) such as Ti cations, and Bronsted acidic and basic sites (BAS and BBS) such as bridging and terminal hydroxyl groups (OH B and OH T , respectively) 39,40.NH 3 -and CO 2 -TPD measurements (Fig. S2) confirmed that TiO 2 (PC500) mainly contains weak acid sites and intermediate basic sites, under our tested conditions, bearing an overall acidity and basicity of 0.85 and 0.37 mmol g -1 , respectively. The electronic structure of TiO 2 (Fig. 2b) shows that the valence band (VB) is composed by O 2p bonding (at 7.6 eV) and non-bonding orbitals (at 5.6 eV), while the conduction band (CB) consists of Ti 3d orbitals.Upon bandgap (Eg 3.2 eV) excitation, photogenerated electrons are transferred from non-bonding O 2p to Ti 3d orbitals 41,42, leading to the formation of less acidic LAS Ti 3 states (Fig. 2a bottom) and charge deficient oxygen ions (trapped holes O -), as confirmed by TD-DFT calculations (Fig. 2c).TD-DFT calculations show that this optical electronic transition implies a charge transfer from the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) principally constituted by O2p, to the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), mainly formed by Ti 3d contributions (Fig. 2c). In addition, the evaluation of CO 2 photoreduction cannot discard other additional carbon source coming from impurities initially adsorbed on the catalyst, which may contribute to the production of CO through carbon gasification or a reverse Boudouard reaction 18.To evaluate this contribution, prior to photocatalytic experiments, we confirmed by elemental analysis and thermogravimetric studies (Fig. S3) that the calcined TiO 2 surface was relatively free of organic residues ( 0.1 wt.carbon content).XPS C 1 s spectra (Fig. S4 S4), while carbonate species remain stable on the surface and only decompose partially at high temperatures ( 900 C) (Fig. S3b).These photochemical processes are fast and occur during the first stages of the reaction.On the other hand, water oxidation competes with C-decomposition over the surface oxidation sites.UV irradiation causes a loss of physisorbed water and a slight increase in surface OH groups (Fig. S5 and Table S5), which is associated with the photoinduced superhydrophilicity of TiO 2 21,46,47 that may contribute to the formation of bicarbonate and peroxocarbonate species. To ascertain the influence of reactants and surface carbon species on the photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 , and considering the aforementioned scenario, we carried out a series of photocatalytic experiments under different reaction atmospheres: (1) humid argon, (2) argon, and (3) dry CO 2 , which led to different product distributions (see Fig. 3 and Fig. S6a).Analogously to CO 2 H 2 O experiments, tests under humid argon predominantly yielded CO and H 2 (Fig. 3a), although productions decreased by half (Table S3).Photocatalytic experiments under humid argon have been proposed in the literature as a possible pretreatment to avoid the effect of C-residues 12 .On this basis, we performed two consecutive experiments: (i) humid argon and (ii) subsequent CO 2 H 2 O feeding (Fig. S6b), and we did not observe the recovering of the initial production.In-situ DRIFTS experiments (Fig. S6c) showed that the production under humid argon mainly comes from inherent surface carbon species (both organics and carbonates), which corroborates XPS findings (Fig. S4).On the other hand, photocatalytic tests conducted under dry argon and CO 2 atmospheres mainly yielded CH 4 with minor amounts of CO (Fig. 3b,c).It is worth noting that CH 4 productions surpassed that obtained in the CO 2 H 2 O experiment, being 3 and 7times higher under dry Ar and CO 2 atmosphere, respectively (Table S3).This increase in CH 4 production is related to the absence of water adsorption competition, as well as the mediation of surface hydroxyl groups and H atoms from dissociated water 18,21 from adsorbed ambient moisture.The formation of carbon-containing products in the absence of CO 2 co-feeding is associated with the photoinduced decomposition of adsorbed carbonate-and bicarbonate-like species or other carbon residues 18, which cannot be removed by calcination due to their high decomposing temperature (see Fig. S3b). With the aim of drawing a complete picture of the reaction mechanism, we further studied the potential back-reactions of intermediates and products.To do so, TiO 2 reactivity was evaluated in a hydrocarbon standard gas mixture (containing 100 ppm of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane and butane) under dry and humid Ar atmosphere (Fig. S7).Photocatalytic experiments mainly conduced to the formation of CH 4 and CO, respectively.These results show that surface carbon species, OH groups and adsorbed water contribute to the evolution of CO and hydrocarbons (e.g.CH 4 ), as later confirmed by in-situ DRIFT experiments.The photocatalytic tests under low humidity conditions and reaction temperatures higher than 100 C (Fig. 3e-f) showed an unusually high selectivity to CH 4 , despite most of the adsorbed water layers are removed.This suggests that the presence of water layers play a critical role in the reaction mechanism, particularly promoting CO formation. A combination of in-situ surface studies was employed to get a deeper understanding of the influence of reactants and intermediates on CO 2 photoreduction.In-situ DRIFTS has already established itself as a powerful tool to study the reaction intermediates, and therefore it has been extensively reported in the literature (see Table S6).However, from our point of view, these studies can only illustrate the complex surface chemistry of the process, rather than provide conclusive evidence of the reaction mechanism.Fig. 4a compiles a thorough literature review of the vibrations of the main intermediates species detected in CO 2 photoreduction with TiO 2 .The evident overlapping of signals, derived from the high dispersion of reported data, complicates an unambiguous identification of surface species.The most plausible interpretation of our results (Fig. 4b) suggests that CO 2 and H 2 O dosing promotes the formation of carbonate, bicarbonate and CO 2 -species (ca. 1250-1620 cm -1 ) in different adsorption modes.Under UV illumination, there is a partial loss of the surface water layer that is accompanied by a decrease in HCO 3 -species (ca.1210-1230 cm -1 ), and a parallel increase in b-CO 3 2-and CO 2 -species (ca.1275 cm -1 ).To confirm DRIFTS observations, we carried out further in-situ spectroscopic studies to undoubtedly identify the evolution of carbonate-like species and the formation of reaction intermediates.Raman studies under UV illumination corroborated the significant formation of b-CO 3 2-and m-CO 3 2-from HCO 3 -species (Fig. S8a).Irradiation also conduced to the formation of formates (ca.1371 and 1565 cm -1 ) and interestingly led to the appearance of peroxocarbonates and superoxo-like species (ca.988 and 1130 cm -1 , respectively).The formation of peroxocarbonates may follow two pathways: (i) perhydration (reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O 2 ), followed by deprotonation to form HCO 4 -; and/or (ii) direct reaction of CO 2 with a hydroperoxide ion (HO 2 -).The latter pathway dominates at mild basic pH due to the higher contribution of the conjugate base HO 2 -, while more acidic pH increases the dehydration of bicarbonates toward CO 2 to form HCO 4 - 48. Near Ambient Pressure XPS (NAP-XPS) in the C1s region also unveiled an increase in carbonate/bicarbonate species, especially bicarbonates, after exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O atmosphere (Fig. 4c and Table S7) 43,44.An increase in C--O/COO -groups (ca.286.2 eV) was also observed, most probably corresponding to carboxylates of formate species.On the contrary, the signal of C-O groups (ca.285.3 eV) increased, in good agreement with the appearance of a new component in O 1 s spectra (Fig. S9) associated to carbon-oxygen groups (ca.532.3 eV), such as methoxy species.This suggests that, even in dark conditions, the surface acidity of TiO 2 (protons over the surface) favors the conversion of formate to methoxy species. Under UV illumination, C 1s spectra (Fig. 4c) showed an overall depletion of bicarbonates, carbonyl/carboxylates and methoxy groups, 13 C MAS NMR spectra of TiO 2 after the following treatment: 5 h at 150 C under vacuum; exposed to 13 CO 2 and moist; and exposed to 13 CO 2 , moist and UV irradiation (365 nm) during 6 h.The expanded spectral regions show the peak assignment to various carboxylated species, and the inset graph illustrates the corresponding individual peak areas calculated by deconvolution of the NMR spectra and the total signal normalized to sample weight.Sequence of colors in the contour plots from red to blue correspond to high to low intensity, respectively.in good agreement with a decrease in the C-O signal in O 1s spectra (see Tables S7 -S8).In addition, two new components appeared in the C 1s spectra attributed to CO 2 -and/or gas-phase CO (291.1 eV), and photodesorbed gas-phase CO 2 49,50 (292.1 eV) (Fig. 4c).The O 1s spectra also revealed a new peak at ca. 536.1 eV that can be assigned to the formation of both gas phase CO and/or CH 3 OH 43,50,51 (Fig. S9).It should be noted that CH 3 OH could not be identified in C 1 s spectra due to an overlapping with the carbonate region (ca.288-290 eV) 43,51.Moreover, a decrease in OH groups was observed along the reaction in O 1s spectra (Table S8), suggesting the contribution of these species in the photoredox process.This observation agrees well with the depletion of hydroxyl groups and adsorbed H 2 O under illumination, observed in 1 H MAS NMR spectra (Fig. S10) and DRIFTS (Fig. S11) under reaction conditions.In-situ 13 C MAS NMR measurements, upon H 2 O and CO 2 dosage (Fig. 4d), showed a narrow signal characteristic of physisorbed 13 CO 2 at 125 ppm, together with two broad features at ca. 160 and 170 ppm.The presence of wide bands is representative of disordered water in different chemical environments 52.A more detailed study of this region led to the identification of four resonances, which can be tentatively assigned to: (i) bidentate carbonates (171.3 ppm), (ii) carbonates (168.3 ppm) interacting with OH -or H 2 O via H-bridge interactions (i.e.hydroxycarbonates), (iii) formates (164.8 ppm) and (iv) bicarbonates (161.7 ppm) (Table S9). 13CP/MAS NMR (Cross Polarization/Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectra, which show carbon atoms with protons in their vicinity, allowed to distinguish bicarbonates, formates and hydroxycarbonates (Fig. S12a).The new contribution at 171.8 ppm can be associated with carboxylates close to OH surface groups. In addition, 13 CO 2 static NMR spectra revealed a resonance at 49 ppm attributed to methoxy groups (Fig. S12b), which increased upon illumination.These findings agree with NAP-XPS observations and confirm the catalytic conversion of formates to methoxy species via by an acid mechanism over TiO 2 , even in the dark 53.These observations are consistent with 1 H MAS NMR spectra (Fig. S10), which showed a small contribution at ca. 3-5 ppm region that could be tentatively assigned to the formation of CH 3 or CH 3 O -intermediates under prolonged UV illumination.We note that the broadening of this signal may also suggest the presence of peroxide species (see Table S9). 13C CP/MAS NMR, NAP-XPS and Raman studies (Fig. S13 and Fig. S8) further revealed that a prolonged light exposure leads to the stabilization of an overlayer of unreactive carbonates and peroxocarbonates that contributes to the blockage of TiO 2 active sites, leading to its deactivation. Based on our observations from in-situ surface studies and photocatalytic experiments, we propose a CO 2 photoreduction mechanism based on multiple parallel reactions with consecutive steps, which strongly depend on the experimental conditions and the dynamic changes occurring on the surface along the reaction (Fig. 5). Initially, calcined TiO 2 surface contains traces of unspecific carbon species (principally organic residues, carbonate-like species and methoxy/carboxylate groups), coming from the synthesis or the adsorption from air.After CO 2 :H 2 O dosage, the surface is covered by a thin layer of water in which CO 2 is partially solvated/dissolved (0.2 -1 as carbonic acid), 21 causing a surface acidification below the point of zero charge of TiO 2 (pH PZC 6).This promotes the formation of carbonates (CO 3 ) with different coordination geometries on titanium sites (Fig. S14).Surface hydroxyl groups (OH -) interact with reagents and intermediates in the reaction medium (see video S1 in Supplementary Material).Thus, the interaction of carbonic acid with surface OH -leads to dehydration and binding of bicarbonates (HCO 3 -) 21,48. Undercoordinated titanium sites (Lewis acid sites) and vicinal hydroxyl groups (Lewis basic sites) can likely form metastable surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLP), which enhance the formation of adsorbed/activated CO 2 (CO 2 -) or carboxylates 14151654,55.These species are preferentially formed in the absence of water.It is also important to highlight that the nature and concentration of surface carbon species vary depending on the reaction conditions, such as temperature and water content, the latter also influencing the pH of both the reaction medium and the catalyst surface. UV illumination promotes a charge transfer from oxygen to titanium atoms, leading to titanium reduction (O - Ti 3 ) and the formation of surface oxygen vacancies (O V ) 46,565758, which are the main active sites for redox reactions.Besides, illumination induces changes on the acidity of the hydroxyl groups (Fig. 5a), stimulating the protonation of Ti-O-Ti sites (acidic OH groups) rather than promoting the direct bonding of OH -to 5-coordinated Ti ions (basic Ti-OH species) 59.The photogenerated less acidic Lewis sites (Ti 3 ) favor the conversion of monodentate carbonates (m-CO 3 ) into bidentate-like carbonates through oxygen vacancies filling 60.This reaction is also favored by a partial water desorption (Fig. S6 and Fig. S11). In addition, in the first reaction steps CO 2 -is protonated to carboxylic acid (COOH), which can be reductively dissociated in acidic media to CO and H 2 O (Fig. 5, Eq. 1, 2 respectively).In contrast, the formation of formates (HCOO -), can be directly promoted by reaction of CO 2 -with neighboring Ti-H 61 (acidic mechanism) or by a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process (equations 3, respectively).Formates can also be formed by a direct two-electron reduction of adsorbed bicarbonate HCO In our study, we have confirmed that reaction pathways strongly depend on the interaction between condensed water and the catalyst surface.Under low surface moisture conditions (Fig. 3b,c) or high temperature (Fig. 3e,f), formate species preferentially dissociate on O V to methyl radicals 22, leading to the formation of CH 4 and further coupling to form other hydrocarbons (mainly C 2 H 6 ) 23,63 (Fig. 5, equation 12).On the contrary, higher amounts of water (Fig. 3a) leads to the formation of a condensed water layer over the catalyst surface.As previously commented, the acidic/basic properties of the solvent/catalyst interface change along the reaction, thus modifying the reaction mechanism.Namely, favoring the direct dissociation of formate to CO, or in minor extent to methoxy species, due to a competitive adsorption of water on O V 21,55. Furthermore, our experiments (Fig. S7, Fig. S15-16) have shown that other competitive backward reactions can occur in the presence of O 2 : a) oxidation of CO to CO 2 (Fig. 5, equation 14); b) partial oxidation of CH to methanol or syngas (equations 15, 16); or in the presence of water: c) photoreforming of CH 4 or CH 3 OH towards CO and H 2 23,64 (Fig. 5, equations 17,18).Therefore, water content influences both the production and selectivity of TiO 2 , suggesting that CO 2 adsorption may be a rate limiting step. Stability studies show that reactions leading to catalyst deactivation are promoted by both photoinduced charges and acid/base properties.Thus, bicarbonates can act as hole scavengers 21 leading to the formation of carbonates that will be strongly adsorbed on the TiO 2 surface (Fig. 5, equation 19).In addition, 13 C CP/MAS NMR measurements (Fig. S13) unveiled the formation of adsorbed peroxocarbonates by a slight broadening of the bicarbonate resonance (ca.159.2 ppm), as previously revealed in Raman studies (Fig. S8).These species are formed in a series of consecutive steps.First, peroxo species (H 2 O 2 , HO 2 -) are formed by the reaction of water or O 2 with holes or electrons, respectively 11,65,66 (Fig. 5, equations 20-23).Peroxo species induce a light yellowish color on the TiO 2 surface (Fig. S8c), which disappears under UV illumination by decomposition to OH radicals with surface-trapped electrons (Ti 3 ).The oxygen consumption in the formation of peroxo-species and the partial oxidation of products explains the lack of net O 2 production during CO 2 photoreduction (Fig. S15-S16).This study evidences that prolonged UV irradiation leads to the stabilization of surface carbonate, peroxo-and peroxocarbonate species that, together with the slow desorption of products, contribute to the blocking of TiO 2 active sites and its deactivation.The deactivation of TiO 2 centers seems to occur in the first stages of the reaction and is mostly irreversible, constituting the main drawback of this catalyst.We explored two regeneration strategies: i) Thermal treatment at temperatures higher than 900 C for the removal of surface carbonates (see Fig. S3b), which leads to small activity recoveries ( 1), an unavoidable loss of surface area and changes in the structural and chemical properties of TiO 2 ; and ii) Acid washing of the catalyst surface after reaction with a mild acid solution.This method is effective to dissolve the adsorbed carbonate species and to acidify the surface, which result in a partial TiO 2 regeneration (ca.23 for CO evolution, see Fig. S17)."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2", "source": "Based on the results and insights gained from this work, we provided clear evidences about the catalytic pathways influencing the activity, selectivity and stability of TiO 2 in CO 2 photoreduction, which are mainly governed by PCET processes.", "context": "Based on the results and insights gained from this work, we provided clear evidences about the catalytic pathways influencing the activity, selectivity and stability of TiO 2 in CO 2 photoreduction, which are mainly governed by PCET processes.In addition, the presence of acidic and basic sites leads to the formation of a significant number of intermediates and products (such as formates and methanol), which are also detected under dark conditions.UV illumination induces relevant changes not only in the redox properties of the TiO 2 active sites, but also in the acid/base character of the surface and the medium, which plays a key role in the selectivity and deactivation pathways. In addition, our results call into question some key issues that were unclear up to date, and which are highly relevant to deactivation pathways.Thus, TiO 2 deactivation is mainly initiated by the formation of carbonates and peroxo-species favored by the presence of oxygen, which also participates in the partial oxidation of products, thus explaining the lack of net O 2 production.Lastly, TiO 2 activity can be partially recovered by a post-reaction washing treatment with a mild acid solution. These findings enlighten the main shadows remaining unclear on the CO 2 photoreduction mechanism, and at the same time, shed light on the factors controlling the activity and stability.In addition, this work lays the foundation for the rational design of efficient photocatalysts, which may be of great interest for a multitude of potential applications such as water splitting, biomass photoreforming, ammonia production and other light-driven catalytic reactions for renewable energy applications.

Experiments were conducted in continuous-flow mode in a homemade reaction system (Scheme 1 in Supplementary Material).The powdered catalyst (0.1 g) was deposited on a glass microfiber filter.Illumination was carried out using four 6 W lamps with a maximum emission at 365 nm and an average irradiance of 33.9 Wm -2 (measured on top the filter by a Blue-Wave radiometer in the range 330-400 nm).Compressed CO 2 ( 99.9999, Praxair) and water (Milli-Q), were passed through a controlled evaporation and mixing unit, maintaining a molar ratio of 7.25 (CO 2 :H 2 O).The reaction conditions were set at 2 bar and T 50-150 C. In-line gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 A) analyzes were performed to detect the reaction products.The GC is equipped with two separation branches, one equipped with two semicapillary columns (BR-Q Plot and BR-Molesieve 5 A) and one thermal conductivity detector, a flame ionization detector (FID) and a methanizer.The second separation branch consists on a capillary column (CP-Sil 5B) and a second FID.Before starting the experiments, the reactor was first degassed under vacuum and then purged for 1 h using argon (100 mL min -1 ) to remove any residual organic compounds weakly adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst.Then, the reactor was flushed with the CO 2 and water mixture for 1 h to establish an adsorption-desorption balance at the reaction temperature.Analogously, photocatalytic experiments under argon, argon H 2 O, and CO 2 were performed following the same reaction procedure but changing the feeding gas.Post-reaction treatment was performed by immersing the catalyst filter in an aqueous nitric acid solution (0.1 M) for 30 min.The filter was then washed with distilled water and dried in the oven at 100 C before reaction tests. The photonic efficiency () towards CO was calculated as the ratio between the rate of reaction and the incident photon flux, according to Eq. (1). where 2 represents the number of electrons involved in the conversion of CO 2 to CO; dN/dt represents the production rate of CO, and q 0 p, is the incident spectral photon flux within a defined wavelength range (ca.330-400 nm).The superscript 0 (zero) emphasizes that the incident number of photons (prior to absorption) is considered.The incident spectral photon flux was calculated from the lamp emission spectrum (see Scheme 1d in Supplementary Material), recorded with a StellarNet UVNb-50 spectroradiometer connected to an optical fiber. Isotope tracing experiments were carried out in a 15.6 mL stainless steel reactor with a borosilicate glass window operated in batch mode.After outgassing, 13 CO 2 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., 99.2 13 C, 1 18 O) and H 2 O were introduced in the reactor at 50 C and 2 bar.After 30 min UV irradiation (four 6 W lamps, fluorescent Philips Actinic, max 365 nm), the gas was analyzed in a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OMNISTAR). Carbon content was determined using a THERMO SCIENTIFIC Flash 2000 Elemental Analyzer after sample combustion at 900 C. Samples weight loss and carbon-products desorption were monitored in a thermobalance TA Instruments SDT Q-600, coupled to an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OMNISTAR).Further characterization (N adsorption-desorption isotherms XRD, TEM) can be found in a previous study 24 and is also summarized in Fig. S1. To identify the acid and basic sites on the TiO 2 surface, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were carried out using an AUTOCHEM II 2910 instrument (Micromeritics), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).For NH 3 -TPD tests, the catalyst sample (0.1 g) was degassed under He flow at 350 C for 30 min, cooled down to three different temperatures (50, 100 and 150 C) in He flow, and then treated with 5 vol NH 3 /He until the material was saturated at those temperatures.Then, the sample was purged at the same temperature under He flow in order to remove the weakly physisorbed ammonia until only He was detected in the TCD signal.Finally, the NH 3 -TPD profile was subsequently recorded increasing the temperature from 50, 100 or 150-550 C using a ramp rate of 5 C min -1 .A final isotherm at 550 C of 30 min was added in order to ensure a complete NH desorption.The experimental procedure for CO 2 -TPD measurements was similar to that followed for the NH 3 -TPD test at 50 C, but changing the probe molecule to CO 2 . Theoretical calculations by periodic density functional theory (DFT) were carried out using a 114-atom TiO 2 nanoparticle with anatase structure 27.Geometry and electronic structure were performed using the projected augmented wave method implemented in Viena ab initio simulation package (VASP) 28,29.The total energies corresponding to the optimized geometries of all samples were calculated using the spin polarized version of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) 30.The Heyd-Scuseria-Enzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06) 31, with a mixing parameter of 0.325, was used to fit a more accurate energy gap.The cut-off for the kinetic energy of the plane-waves was set to 450 eV to ensure a total energy convergence better than 10 -4 eV.The cut-off for the kinetic energy of the plane-waves was set to 500 eV to ensure a total energy and force convergence better than 10 -4 eV and 0.01 eV/A 3 , respectively. Theoretical optoelectronic properties of TiO 2 were calculated using time dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) 32,33 implemented in the software Gaussian 09 34, employing a CAM-B3LYP functional 35 and using a DGDZVP2 basis set 36,37.A fixed number of 150 states was selected for a proper comparison between all configurations and models.The interactions between reagents and intermediates with surface sites were explored by molecular dynamics using a hydroxylated TiO 2 nanoparticle (40 nm) and CO 2 , H 2 O, CO 3 2-, HCO 3 -molecules.The system was equilibrated for 10 ps using a 1 fs timestep at 323 K.A Berendsen thermostat controlled the ionic temperature (dt/ 1/50). Measurements were performed on a Thermo-Nicolet FTIR instrument, which housed a Harrick DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy) reaction cell with three quartz windows, in which the gas stream passed through the powdered sample.Spectra were collected at a resolution of 4 cm -1 with 32 co-added scans in the range 650-4000 cm -1 using a liquid N 2 -cooled MCT detector.A step with argon flow (10 mL min -1 ) at 50 C was performed for 1 h, after acquiring a spectrum of the fresh sample in air as background.Then, a 5 sccm flow of 0.1 CO 2 in humid Ar (saturated with water using a thermostated bubbler) was introduced to the cell.Illumination was carried out using a 365 nm LED lamp. Spectra were recorded using a JASCO NRS-5000/7000 series laser spectrometer equipped with a Linkam CCR1000 in situ cell with a quartz window in which the gas stream passed through the powdered sample.Excitation was performed with a 532 nm laser.The reaction conditions were the same as those used for in situ DRIFTS.Illumination was carried out using a 365 nm LED lamp. A PHOIBOS 150 NAP energy analyzer at the NAPP branch from CIRCE beamline of the ALBA synchrotron light source was used to perform these experiments.The CIRCE beamline is an undulator beamline with a photon energy range 100-2000 eV.In this work, data was acquired with photon energy h 900 eV, using an analyzer pass energy of 10 and 20 eV.The beam spot size at the sample is around 100 90 m 2 (HxV).Powdered samples were pressed into round disks.Ti 2p NAP-XPS spectra were recorded in UHV and under both dark and illumination conditions.In addition, C 1s and O 1s were acquired in UHV and under a CO 2 and H 2 O mixture.NAP-XPS experiments under illumination were performed using a UV LED (Hamamatsu Co.) with a maximum emission centered at 365 nm.The Au 4 f 7/2 peak at 84.0 eV from a Au foil was taken as energy reference.These studies were performed as follows: ultrapure water (LC-MS CHROMASOLV grade, Sigma-Aldrich) was introduced into the chamber through a variable high precision leak valve after being degassed by multiple freeze--pump-thaw cycles.CO 2 (purity 99.995, Abello Linde) was introduced into the chamber directly from a commercial cylinder through a variable high precision leak valve.The gases were dosed into the chamber until reaching a base pressure of 5 10 -2 mbar (CO 2 :H 2 O 7:1).Data were collected using SpecsLab software. 2.9.In-situ 1 H and 13 C solid state NMR Analyzes were conducted in a Bruker AvanceTM 400 spectrometer equipped with a 9.4 T superconducting magnet ( 1 H and 13 C Larmor frequencies at 400.14 MHz and 100.61MHz, respectively).For the measurements, calcined TiO 2 powder (0.1 g) was loaded in a 10 mm glass tube and degassed at 150 C for 5-8 h.Samples were allowed to cool down to room temperature under vacuum, and then 13 CO 2 was loaded at 1.3-2.0bar.In water co-feeding experiments, TiO 2 powder was cooled to -60 C (mixture of dry ice and isopropanol) before injecting 0.1-0.2L of distilled water in the glass tube.Samples were irradiated under UV light (6 W lamp, max 365 nm) at different time intervals.Analyzes were performed using a NMR probe head with a 10 mm radiofrequency (rf) insert tuned to the 13 C Larmor frequency. 13C NMR spectra were acquired using a single pulse excitation with solutionlike NMR conditions and keeping the samples static.After this, a fraction of the sample (about 0.07 g of 0.7 g) was transferred under dry nitrogen to a 4 mm zirconia rotor, and analyzed using a standard Bruker double resonance 4 mm cross-polarization (CP)/magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR probe head. 1 H and 13 C MAS spectra were acquired using spinning rates of 5-6.5 kHz and a single pulse excitation with recycle delays of and 3 s, respectively.The 13 C CP/MAS spectra were acquired with 2 ms CP contact time, a repetition rate of 3 s and high-power proton decoupling of 75 kHz. 1 H and 13 C chemical shifts were externally referenced to adamantane (29.5 ppm relative to tetramethylsilane, 0.0 ppm).All freeinduction decays were subjected to standard Fourier transformation with 20-100 Hz line broadening and phasing.NMR spectra were evaluated using the software package XWIN NMR provided by the spectrometer manufacturer.Each spectrum was deconvoluted using Gaussian/Lorentzian fits, taking into consideration available information in the literature and our experimental observations for initial peaks assignments to carboxylated species in the region of interest.The peak areas were normalized to sample weight."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Fig. 1c depicts the photoactivity of the TiO 2 catalyst (Fig. S1) in a gas phase photoreactor (Scheme S1) using a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor and UV illumination.", "context": "Fig. 1c depicts the photoactivity of the TiO 2 catalyst (Fig. S1) in a gas phase photoreactor (Scheme S1) using a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor and UV illumination.CO and H 2 were obtained as main products, reaching maximum formation rates of 25.5 and 7.6 mol g cat respectively, and a photonic efficiency towards CO of 0.21 (Table S2).Besides, minor amounts of CH 3 OH, CH 4 and C 2 H 6 were also detected with evolution rates increasing when CO and H 2 yields decreased (Table S3).These values are comparable to other studies reported under similar conditions (Table S1), although significant differences have also been found in the literature (see Fig. 1a).To understand the dispersion in TiO 2 reactivity it is necessary to dig deeper into the mechanism that controls this reaction.In addition, 13 CO 2 reduction batch reactions performed under similar reaction conditions 38 showed the production of 13 CO, while other products were below the detection limit of our equipment. Activity and selectivity are governed by two main kinetic processes related to the charge dynamics of photogenerated e -/h pairs 24,25 and to the surface adsorption-desorption rates, which are intimately associated with the acid/base properties of the catalyst surface.TiO presents a weakly acidic surface (PZC 6) (Fig. 2), bearing Lewis acid sites (LAS) such as Ti cations, and Bronsted acidic and basic sites (BAS and BBS) such as bridging and terminal hydroxyl groups (OH B and OH T , respectively) 39,40.NH 3 -and CO 2 -TPD measurements (Fig. S2) confirmed that TiO 2 (PC500) mainly contains weak acid sites and intermediate basic sites, under our tested conditions, bearing an overall acidity and basicity of 0.85 and 0.37 mmol g -1 , respectively. The electronic structure of TiO 2 (Fig. 2b) shows that the valence band (VB) is composed by O 2p bonding (at 7.6 eV) and non-bonding orbitals (at 5.6 eV), while the conduction band (CB) consists of Ti 3d orbitals.Upon bandgap (Eg 3.2 eV) excitation, photogenerated electrons are transferred from non-bonding O 2p to Ti 3d orbitals 41,42, leading to the formation of less acidic LAS Ti 3 states (Fig. 2a bottom) and charge deficient oxygen ions (trapped holes O -), as confirmed by TD-DFT calculations (Fig. 2c).TD-DFT calculations show that this optical electronic transition implies a charge transfer from the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) principally constituted by O2p, to the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), mainly formed by Ti 3d contributions (Fig. 2c). In addition, the evaluation of CO 2 photoreduction cannot discard other additional carbon source coming from impurities initially adsorbed on the catalyst, which may contribute to the production of CO through carbon gasification or a reverse Boudouard reaction 18.To evaluate this contribution, prior to photocatalytic experiments, we confirmed by elemental analysis and thermogravimetric studies (Fig. S3) that the calcined TiO 2 surface was relatively free of organic residues ( 0.1 wt.carbon content).XPS C 1 s spectra (Fig. S4 S4), while carbonate species remain stable on the surface and only decompose partially at high temperatures ( 900 C) (Fig. S3b).These photochemical processes are fast and occur during the first stages of the reaction.On the other hand, water oxidation competes with C-decomposition over the surface oxidation sites.UV irradiation causes a loss of physisorbed water and a slight increase in surface OH groups (Fig. S5 and Table S5), which is associated with the photoinduced superhydrophilicity of TiO 2 21,46,47 that may contribute to the formation of bicarbonate and peroxocarbonate species. To ascertain the influence of reactants and surface carbon species on the photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 , and considering the aforementioned scenario, we carried out a series of photocatalytic experiments under different reaction atmospheres: (1) humid argon, (2) argon, and (3) dry CO 2 , which led to different product distributions (see Fig. 3 and Fig. S6a).Analogously to CO 2 H 2 O experiments, tests under humid argon predominantly yielded CO and H 2 (Fig. 3a), although productions decreased by half (Table S3).Photocatalytic experiments under humid argon have been proposed in the literature as a possible pretreatment to avoid the effect of C-residues 12 .On this basis, we performed two consecutive experiments: (i) humid argon and (ii) subsequent CO 2 H 2 O feeding (Fig. S6b), and we did not observe the recovering of the initial production.In-situ DRIFTS experiments (Fig. S6c) showed that the production under humid argon mainly comes from inherent surface carbon species (both organics and carbonates), which corroborates XPS findings (Fig. S4).On the other hand, photocatalytic tests conducted under dry argon and CO 2 atmospheres mainly yielded CH 4 with minor amounts of CO (Fig. 3b,c).It is worth noting that CH 4 productions surpassed that obtained in the CO 2 H 2 O experiment, being 3 and 7times higher under dry Ar and CO 2 atmosphere, respectively (Table S3).This increase in CH 4 production is related to the absence of water adsorption competition, as well as the mediation of surface hydroxyl groups and H atoms from dissociated water 18,21 from adsorbed ambient moisture.The formation of carbon-containing products in the absence of CO 2 co-feeding is associated with the photoinduced decomposition of adsorbed carbonate-and bicarbonate-like species or other carbon residues 18, which cannot be removed by calcination due to their high decomposing temperature (see Fig. S3b). With the aim of drawing a complete picture of the reaction mechanism, we further studied the potential back-reactions of intermediates and products.To do so, TiO 2 reactivity was evaluated in a hydrocarbon standard gas mixture (containing 100 ppm of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane and butane) under dry and humid Ar atmosphere (Fig. S7).Photocatalytic experiments mainly conduced to the formation of CH 4 and CO, respectively.These results show that surface carbon species, OH groups and adsorbed water contribute to the evolution of CO and hydrocarbons (e.g.CH 4 ), as later confirmed by in-situ DRIFT experiments.The photocatalytic tests under low humidity conditions and reaction temperatures higher than 100 C (Fig. 3e-f) showed an unusually high selectivity to CH 4 , despite most of the adsorbed water layers are removed.This suggests that the presence of water layers play a critical role in the reaction mechanism, particularly promoting CO formation. A combination of in-situ surface studies was employed to get a deeper understanding of the influence of reactants and intermediates on CO 2 photoreduction.In-situ DRIFTS has already established itself as a powerful tool to study the reaction intermediates, and therefore it has been extensively reported in the literature (see Table S6).However, from our point of view, these studies can only illustrate the complex surface chemistry of the process, rather than provide conclusive evidence of the reaction mechanism.Fig. 4a compiles a thorough literature review of the vibrations of the main intermediates species detected in CO 2 photoreduction with TiO 2 .The evident overlapping of signals, derived from the high dispersion of reported data, complicates an unambiguous identification of surface species.The most plausible interpretation of our results (Fig. 4b) suggests that CO 2 and H 2 O dosing promotes the formation of carbonate, bicarbonate and CO 2 -species (ca. 1250-1620 cm -1 ) in different adsorption modes.Under UV illumination, there is a partial loss of the surface water layer that is accompanied by a decrease in HCO 3 -species (ca.1210-1230 cm -1 ), and a parallel increase in b-CO 3 2-and CO 2 -species (ca.1275 cm -1 ).To confirm DRIFTS observations, we carried out further in-situ spectroscopic studies to undoubtedly identify the evolution of carbonate-like species and the formation of reaction intermediates.Raman studies under UV illumination corroborated the significant formation of b-CO 3 2-and m-CO 3 2-from HCO 3 -species (Fig. S8a).Irradiation also conduced to the formation of formates (ca.1371 and 1565 cm -1 ) and interestingly led to the appearance of peroxocarbonates and superoxo-like species (ca.988 and 1130 cm -1 , respectively).The formation of peroxocarbonates may follow two pathways: (i) perhydration (reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O 2 ), followed by deprotonation to form HCO 4 -; and/or (ii) direct reaction of CO 2 with a hydroperoxide ion (HO 2 -).The latter pathway dominates at mild basic pH due to the higher contribution of the conjugate base HO 2 -, while more acidic pH increases the dehydration of bicarbonates toward CO 2 to form HCO 4 - 48. Near Ambient Pressure XPS (NAP-XPS) in the C1s region also unveiled an increase in carbonate/bicarbonate species, especially bicarbonates, after exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O atmosphere (Fig. 4c and Table S7) 43,44.An increase in C--O/COO -groups (ca.286.2 eV) was also observed, most probably corresponding to carboxylates of formate species.On the contrary, the signal of C-O groups (ca.285.3 eV) increased, in good agreement with the appearance of a new component in O 1 s spectra (Fig. S9) associated to carbon-oxygen groups (ca.532.3 eV), such as methoxy species.This suggests that, even in dark conditions, the surface acidity of TiO 2 (protons over the surface) favors the conversion of formate to methoxy species. Under UV illumination, C 1s spectra (Fig. 4c) showed an overall depletion of bicarbonates, carbonyl/carboxylates and methoxy groups, 13 C MAS NMR spectra of TiO 2 after the following treatment: 5 h at 150 C under vacuum; exposed to 13 CO 2 and moist; and exposed to 13 CO 2 , moist and UV irradiation (365 nm) during 6 h.The expanded spectral regions show the peak assignment to various carboxylated species, and the inset graph illustrates the corresponding individual peak areas calculated by deconvolution of the NMR spectra and the total signal normalized to sample weight.Sequence of colors in the contour plots from red to blue correspond to high to low intensity, respectively.in good agreement with a decrease in the C-O signal in O 1s spectra (see Tables S7 -S8).In addition, two new components appeared in the C 1s spectra attributed to CO 2 -and/or gas-phase CO (291.1 eV), and photodesorbed gas-phase CO 2 49,50 (292.1 eV) (Fig. 4c).The O 1s spectra also revealed a new peak at ca. 536.1 eV that can be assigned to the formation of both gas phase CO and/or CH 3 OH 43,50,51 (Fig. S9).It should be noted that CH 3 OH could not be identified in C 1 s spectra due to an overlapping with the carbonate region (ca.288-290 eV) 43,51.Moreover, a decrease in OH groups was observed along the reaction in O 1s spectra (Table S8), suggesting the contribution of these species in the photoredox process.This observation agrees well with the depletion of hydroxyl groups and adsorbed H 2 O under illumination, observed in 1 H MAS NMR spectra (Fig. S10) and DRIFTS (Fig. S11) under reaction conditions.In-situ 13 C MAS NMR measurements, upon H 2 O and CO 2 dosage (Fig. 4d), showed a narrow signal characteristic of physisorbed 13 CO 2 at 125 ppm, together with two broad features at ca. 160 and 170 ppm.The presence of wide bands is representative of disordered water in different chemical environments 52.A more detailed study of this region led to the identification of four resonances, which can be tentatively assigned to: (i) bidentate carbonates (171.3 ppm), (ii) carbonates (168.3 ppm) interacting with OH -or H 2 O via H-bridge interactions (i.e.hydroxycarbonates), (iii) formates (164.8 ppm) and (iv) bicarbonates (161.7 ppm) (Table S9). 13CP/MAS NMR (Cross Polarization/Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectra, which show carbon atoms with protons in their vicinity, allowed to distinguish bicarbonates, formates and hydroxycarbonates (Fig. S12a).The new contribution at 171.8 ppm can be associated with carboxylates close to OH surface groups. In addition, 13 CO 2 static NMR spectra revealed a resonance at 49 ppm attributed to methoxy groups (Fig. S12b), which increased upon illumination.These findings agree with NAP-XPS observations and confirm the catalytic conversion of formates to methoxy species via by an acid mechanism over TiO 2 , even in the dark 53.These observations are consistent with 1 H MAS NMR spectra (Fig. S10), which showed a small contribution at ca. 3-5 ppm region that could be tentatively assigned to the formation of CH 3 or CH 3 O -intermediates under prolonged UV illumination.We note that the broadening of this signal may also suggest the presence of peroxide species (see Table S9). 13C CP/MAS NMR, NAP-XPS and Raman studies (Fig. S13 and Fig. S8) further revealed that a prolonged light exposure leads to the stabilization of an overlayer of unreactive carbonates and peroxocarbonates that contributes to the blockage of TiO 2 active sites, leading to its deactivation. Based on our observations from in-situ surface studies and photocatalytic experiments, we propose a CO 2 photoreduction mechanism based on multiple parallel reactions with consecutive steps, which strongly depend on the experimental conditions and the dynamic changes occurring on the surface along the reaction (Fig. 5). Initially, calcined TiO 2 surface contains traces of unspecific carbon species (principally organic residues, carbonate-like species and methoxy/carboxylate groups), coming from the synthesis or the adsorption from air.After CO 2 :H 2 O dosage, the surface is covered by a thin layer of water in which CO 2 is partially solvated/dissolved (0.2 -1 as carbonic acid), 21 causing a surface acidification below the point of zero charge of TiO 2 (pH PZC 6).This promotes the formation of carbonates (CO 3 ) with different coordination geometries on titanium sites (Fig. S14).Surface hydroxyl groups (OH -) interact with reagents and intermediates in the reaction medium (see video S1 in Supplementary Material).Thus, the interaction of carbonic acid with surface OH -leads to dehydration and binding of bicarbonates (HCO 3 -) 21,48. Undercoordinated titanium sites (Lewis acid sites) and vicinal hydroxyl groups (Lewis basic sites) can likely form metastable surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLP), which enhance the formation of adsorbed/activated CO 2 (CO 2 -) or carboxylates 14151654,55.These species are preferentially formed in the absence of water.It is also important to highlight that the nature and concentration of surface carbon species vary depending on the reaction conditions, such as temperature and water content, the latter also influencing the pH of both the reaction medium and the catalyst surface. UV illumination promotes a charge transfer from oxygen to titanium atoms, leading to titanium reduction (O - Ti 3 ) and the formation of surface oxygen vacancies (O V ) 46,565758, which are the main active sites for redox reactions.Besides, illumination induces changes on the acidity of the hydroxyl groups (Fig. 5a), stimulating the protonation of Ti-O-Ti sites (acidic OH groups) rather than promoting the direct bonding of OH -to 5-coordinated Ti ions (basic Ti-OH species) 59.The photogenerated less acidic Lewis sites (Ti 3 ) favor the conversion of monodentate carbonates (m-CO 3 ) into bidentate-like carbonates through oxygen vacancies filling 60.This reaction is also favored by a partial water desorption (Fig. S6 and Fig. S11). In addition, in the first reaction steps CO 2 -is protonated to carboxylic acid (COOH), which can be reductively dissociated in acidic media to CO and H 2 O (Fig. 5, Eq. 1, 2 respectively).In contrast, the formation of formates (HCOO -), can be directly promoted by reaction of CO 2 -with neighboring Ti-H 61 (acidic mechanism) or by a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process (equations 3, respectively).Formates can also be formed by a direct two-electron reduction of adsorbed bicarbonate HCO In our study, we have confirmed that reaction pathways strongly depend on the interaction between condensed water and the catalyst surface.Under low surface moisture conditions (Fig. 3b,c) or high temperature (Fig. 3e,f), formate species preferentially dissociate on O V to methyl radicals 22, leading to the formation of CH 4 and further coupling to form other hydrocarbons (mainly C 2 H 6 ) 23,63 (Fig. 5, equation 12).On the contrary, higher amounts of water (Fig. 3a) leads to the formation of a condensed water layer over the catalyst surface.As previously commented, the acidic/basic properties of the solvent/catalyst interface change along the reaction, thus modifying the reaction mechanism.Namely, favoring the direct dissociation of formate to CO, or in minor extent to methoxy species, due to a competitive adsorption of water on O V 21,55. Furthermore, our experiments (Fig. S7, Fig. S15-16) have shown that other competitive backward reactions can occur in the presence of O 2 : a) oxidation of CO to CO 2 (Fig. 5, equation 14); b) partial oxidation of CH to methanol or syngas (equations 15, 16); or in the presence of water: c) photoreforming of CH 4 or CH 3 OH towards CO and H 2 23,64 (Fig. 5, equations 17,18).Therefore, water content influences both the production and selectivity of TiO 2 , suggesting that CO 2 adsorption may be a rate limiting step. Stability studies show that reactions leading to catalyst deactivation are promoted by both photoinduced charges and acid/base properties.Thus, bicarbonates can act as hole scavengers 21 leading to the formation of carbonates that will be strongly adsorbed on the TiO 2 surface (Fig. 5, equation 19).In addition, 13 C CP/MAS NMR measurements (Fig. S13) unveiled the formation of adsorbed peroxocarbonates by a slight broadening of the bicarbonate resonance (ca.159.2 ppm), as previously revealed in Raman studies (Fig. S8).These species are formed in a series of consecutive steps.First, peroxo species (H 2 O 2 , HO 2 -) are formed by the reaction of water or O 2 with holes or electrons, respectively 11,65,66 (Fig. 5, equations 20-23).Peroxo species induce a light yellowish color on the TiO 2 surface (Fig. S8c), which disappears under UV illumination by decomposition to OH radicals with surface-trapped electrons (Ti 3 ).The oxygen consumption in the formation of peroxo-species and the partial oxidation of products explains the lack of net O 2 production during CO 2 photoreduction (Fig. S15-S16).This study evidences that prolonged UV irradiation leads to the stabilization of surface carbonate, peroxo-and peroxocarbonate species that, together with the slow desorption of products, contribute to the blocking of TiO 2 active sites and its deactivation.The deactivation of TiO 2 centers seems to occur in the first stages of the reaction and is mostly irreversible, constituting the main drawback of this catalyst.We explored two regeneration strategies: i) Thermal treatment at temperatures higher than 900 C for the removal of surface carbonates (see Fig. S3b), which leads to small activity recoveries ( 1), an unavoidable loss of surface area and changes in the structural and chemical properties of TiO 2 ; and ii) Acid washing of the catalyst surface after reaction with a mild acid solution.This method is effective to dissolve the adsorbed carbonate species and to acidify the surface, which result in a partial TiO 2 regeneration (ca.23 for CO evolution, see Fig. S17)."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "UV illumination induces relevant changes not only in the redox properties of the TiO 2 active sites, but also in the acid/base character of the surface and the medium, which plays a key role in the selectivity and deactivation pathways.", "context": "Based on the results and insights gained from this work, we provided clear evidences about the catalytic pathways influencing the activity, selectivity and stability of TiO 2 in CO 2 photoreduction, which are mainly governed by PCET processes.In addition, the presence of acidic and basic sites leads to the formation of a significant number of intermediates and products (such as formates and methanol), which are also detected under dark conditions.UV illumination induces relevant changes not only in the redox properties of the TiO 2 active sites, but also in the acid/base character of the surface and the medium, which plays a key role in the selectivity and deactivation pathways. In addition, our results call into question some key issues that were unclear up to date, and which are highly relevant to deactivation pathways.Thus, TiO 2 deactivation is mainly initiated by the formation of carbonates and peroxo-species favored by the presence of oxygen, which also participates in the partial oxidation of products, thus explaining the lack of net O 2 production.Lastly, TiO 2 activity can be partially recovered by a post-reaction washing treatment with a mild acid solution. These findings enlighten the main shadows remaining unclear on the CO 2 photoreduction mechanism, and at the same time, shed light on the factors controlling the activity and stability.In addition, this work lays the foundation for the rational design of efficient photocatalysts, which may be of great interest for a multitude of potential applications such as water splitting, biomass photoreforming, ammonia production and other light-driven catalytic reactions for renewable energy applications.

Experiments were conducted in continuous-flow mode in a homemade reaction system (Scheme 1 in Supplementary Material).The powdered catalyst (0.1 g) was deposited on a glass microfiber filter.Illumination was carried out using four 6 W lamps with a maximum emission at 365 nm and an average irradiance of 33.9 Wm -2 (measured on top the filter by a Blue-Wave radiometer in the range 330-400 nm).Compressed CO 2 ( 99.9999, Praxair) and water (Milli-Q), were passed through a controlled evaporation and mixing unit, maintaining a molar ratio of 7.25 (CO 2 :H 2 O).The reaction conditions were set at 2 bar and T 50-150 C. In-line gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 A) analyzes were performed to detect the reaction products.The GC is equipped with two separation branches, one equipped with two semicapillary columns (BR-Q Plot and BR-Molesieve 5 A) and one thermal conductivity detector, a flame ionization detector (FID) and a methanizer.The second separation branch consists on a capillary column (CP-Sil 5B) and a second FID.Before starting the experiments, the reactor was first degassed under vacuum and then purged for 1 h using argon (100 mL min -1 ) to remove any residual organic compounds weakly adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst.Then, the reactor was flushed with the CO 2 and water mixture for 1 h to establish an adsorption-desorption balance at the reaction temperature.Analogously, photocatalytic experiments under argon, argon H 2 O, and CO 2 were performed following the same reaction procedure but changing the feeding gas.Post-reaction treatment was performed by immersing the catalyst filter in an aqueous nitric acid solution (0.1 M) for 30 min.The filter was then washed with distilled water and dried in the oven at 100 C before reaction tests. The photonic efficiency () towards CO was calculated as the ratio between the rate of reaction and the incident photon flux, according to Eq. (1). where 2 represents the number of electrons involved in the conversion of CO 2 to CO; dN/dt represents the production rate of CO, and q 0 p, is the incident spectral photon flux within a defined wavelength range (ca.330-400 nm).The superscript 0 (zero) emphasizes that the incident number of photons (prior to absorption) is considered.The incident spectral photon flux was calculated from the lamp emission spectrum (see Scheme 1d in Supplementary Material), recorded with a StellarNet UVNb-50 spectroradiometer connected to an optical fiber. Isotope tracing experiments were carried out in a 15.6 mL stainless steel reactor with a borosilicate glass window operated in batch mode.After outgassing, 13 CO 2 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., 99.2 13 C, 1 18 O) and H 2 O were introduced in the reactor at 50 C and 2 bar.After 30 min UV irradiation (four 6 W lamps, fluorescent Philips Actinic, max 365 nm), the gas was analyzed in a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OMNISTAR). Carbon content was determined using a THERMO SCIENTIFIC Flash 2000 Elemental Analyzer after sample combustion at 900 C. Samples weight loss and carbon-products desorption were monitored in a thermobalance TA Instruments SDT Q-600, coupled to an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OMNISTAR).Further characterization (N adsorption-desorption isotherms XRD, TEM) can be found in a previous study 24 and is also summarized in Fig. S1. To identify the acid and basic sites on the TiO 2 surface, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were carried out using an AUTOCHEM II 2910 instrument (Micromeritics), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).For NH 3 -TPD tests, the catalyst sample (0.1 g) was degassed under He flow at 350 C for 30 min, cooled down to three different temperatures (50, 100 and 150 C) in He flow, and then treated with 5 vol NH 3 /He until the material was saturated at those temperatures.Then, the sample was purged at the same temperature under He flow in order to remove the weakly physisorbed ammonia until only He was detected in the TCD signal.Finally, the NH 3 -TPD profile was subsequently recorded increasing the temperature from 50, 100 or 150-550 C using a ramp rate of 5 C min -1 .A final isotherm at 550 C of 30 min was added in order to ensure a complete NH desorption.The experimental procedure for CO 2 -TPD measurements was similar to that followed for the NH 3 -TPD test at 50 C, but changing the probe molecule to CO 2 . Theoretical calculations by periodic density functional theory (DFT) were carried out using a 114-atom TiO 2 nanoparticle with anatase structure 27.Geometry and electronic structure were performed using the projected augmented wave method implemented in Viena ab initio simulation package (VASP) 28,29.The total energies corresponding to the optimized geometries of all samples were calculated using the spin polarized version of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) 30.The Heyd-Scuseria-Enzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06) 31, with a mixing parameter of 0.325, was used to fit a more accurate energy gap.The cut-off for the kinetic energy of the plane-waves was set to 450 eV to ensure a total energy convergence better than 10 -4 eV.The cut-off for the kinetic energy of the plane-waves was set to 500 eV to ensure a total energy and force convergence better than 10 -4 eV and 0.01 eV/A 3 , respectively. Theoretical optoelectronic properties of TiO 2 were calculated using time dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) 32,33 implemented in the software Gaussian 09 34, employing a CAM-B3LYP functional 35 and using a DGDZVP2 basis set 36,37.A fixed number of 150 states was selected for a proper comparison between all configurations and models.The interactions between reagents and intermediates with surface sites were explored by molecular dynamics using a hydroxylated TiO 2 nanoparticle (40 nm) and CO 2 , H 2 O, CO 3 2-, HCO 3 -molecules.The system was equilibrated for 10 ps using a 1 fs timestep at 323 K.A Berendsen thermostat controlled the ionic temperature (dt/ 1/50). Measurements were performed on a Thermo-Nicolet FTIR instrument, which housed a Harrick DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy) reaction cell with three quartz windows, in which the gas stream passed through the powdered sample.Spectra were collected at a resolution of 4 cm -1 with 32 co-added scans in the range 650-4000 cm -1 using a liquid N 2 -cooled MCT detector.A step with argon flow (10 mL min -1 ) at 50 C was performed for 1 h, after acquiring a spectrum of the fresh sample in air as background.Then, a 5 sccm flow of 0.1 CO 2 in humid Ar (saturated with water using a thermostated bubbler) was introduced to the cell.Illumination was carried out using a 365 nm LED lamp. Spectra were recorded using a JASCO NRS-5000/7000 series laser spectrometer equipped with a Linkam CCR1000 in situ cell with a quartz window in which the gas stream passed through the powdered sample.Excitation was performed with a 532 nm laser.The reaction conditions were the same as those used for in situ DRIFTS.Illumination was carried out using a 365 nm LED lamp. A PHOIBOS 150 NAP energy analyzer at the NAPP branch from CIRCE beamline of the ALBA synchrotron light source was used to perform these experiments.The CIRCE beamline is an undulator beamline with a photon energy range 100-2000 eV.In this work, data was acquired with photon energy h 900 eV, using an analyzer pass energy of 10 and 20 eV.The beam spot size at the sample is around 100 90 m 2 (HxV).Powdered samples were pressed into round disks.Ti 2p NAP-XPS spectra were recorded in UHV and under both dark and illumination conditions.In addition, C 1s and O 1s were acquired in UHV and under a CO 2 and H 2 O mixture.NAP-XPS experiments under illumination were performed using a UV LED (Hamamatsu Co.) with a maximum emission centered at 365 nm.The Au 4 f 7/2 peak at 84.0 eV from a Au foil was taken as energy reference.These studies were performed as follows: ultrapure water (LC-MS CHROMASOLV grade, Sigma-Aldrich) was introduced into the chamber through a variable high precision leak valve after being degassed by multiple freeze--pump-thaw cycles.CO 2 (purity 99.995, Abello Linde) was introduced into the chamber directly from a commercial cylinder through a variable high precision leak valve.The gases were dosed into the chamber until reaching a base pressure of 5 10 -2 mbar (CO 2 :H 2 O 7:1).Data were collected using SpecsLab software. 2.9.In-situ 1 H and 13 C solid state NMR Analyzes were conducted in a Bruker AvanceTM 400 spectrometer equipped with a 9.4 T superconducting magnet ( 1 H and 13 C Larmor frequencies at 400.14 MHz and 100.61MHz, respectively).For the measurements, calcined TiO 2 powder (0.1 g) was loaded in a 10 mm glass tube and degassed at 150 C for 5-8 h.Samples were allowed to cool down to room temperature under vacuum, and then 13 CO 2 was loaded at 1.3-2.0bar.In water co-feeding experiments, TiO 2 powder was cooled to -60 C (mixture of dry ice and isopropanol) before injecting 0.1-0.2L of distilled water in the glass tube.Samples were irradiated under UV light (6 W lamp, max 365 nm) at different time intervals.Analyzes were performed using a NMR probe head with a 10 mm radiofrequency (rf) insert tuned to the 13 C Larmor frequency. 13C NMR spectra were acquired using a single pulse excitation with solutionlike NMR conditions and keeping the samples static.After this, a fraction of the sample (about 0.07 g of 0.7 g) was transferred under dry nitrogen to a 4 mm zirconia rotor, and analyzed using a standard Bruker double resonance 4 mm cross-polarization (CP)/magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR probe head. 1 H and 13 C MAS spectra were acquired using spinning rates of 5-6.5 kHz and a single pulse excitation with recycle delays of and 3 s, respectively.The 13 C CP/MAS spectra were acquired with 2 ms CP contact time, a repetition rate of 3 s and high-power proton decoupling of 75 kHz. 1 H and 13 C chemical shifts were externally referenced to adamantane (29.5 ppm relative to tetramethylsilane, 0.0 ppm).All freeinduction decays were subjected to standard Fourier transformation with 20-100 Hz line broadening and phasing.NMR spectra were evaluated using the software package XWIN NMR provided by the spectrometer manufacturer.Each spectrum was deconvoluted using Gaussian/Lorentzian fits, taking into consideration available information in the literature and our experimental observations for initial peaks assignments to carboxylated species in the region of interest.The peak areas were normalized to sample weight."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Fig. 1c depicts the photoactivity of the TiO 2 catalyst (Fig. S1) in a gas phase photoreactor (Scheme S1) using a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor and UV illumination.", "context": "Fig. 1c depicts the photoactivity of the TiO 2 catalyst (Fig. S1) in a gas phase photoreactor (Scheme S1) using a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor and UV illumination.CO and H 2 were obtained as main products, reaching maximum formation rates of 25.5 and 7.6 mol g cat respectively, and a photonic efficiency towards CO of 0.21 (Table S2).Besides, minor amounts of CH 3 OH, CH 4 and C 2 H 6 were also detected with evolution rates increasing when CO and H 2 yields decreased (Table S3).These values are comparable to other studies reported under similar conditions (Table S1), although significant differences have also been found in the literature (see Fig. 1a).To understand the dispersion in TiO 2 reactivity it is necessary to dig deeper into the mechanism that controls this reaction.In addition, 13 CO 2 reduction batch reactions performed under similar reaction conditions 38 showed the production of 13 CO, while other products were below the detection limit of our equipment. Activity and selectivity are governed by two main kinetic processes related to the charge dynamics of photogenerated e -/h pairs 24,25 and to the surface adsorption-desorption rates, which are intimately associated with the acid/base properties of the catalyst surface.TiO presents a weakly acidic surface (PZC 6) (Fig. 2), bearing Lewis acid sites (LAS) such as Ti cations, and Bronsted acidic and basic sites (BAS and BBS) such as bridging and terminal hydroxyl groups (OH B and OH T , respectively) 39,40.NH 3 -and CO 2 -TPD measurements (Fig. S2) confirmed that TiO 2 (PC500) mainly contains weak acid sites and intermediate basic sites, under our tested conditions, bearing an overall acidity and basicity of 0.85 and 0.37 mmol g -1 , respectively. The electronic structure of TiO 2 (Fig. 2b) shows that the valence band (VB) is composed by O 2p bonding (at 7.6 eV) and non-bonding orbitals (at 5.6 eV), while the conduction band (CB) consists of Ti 3d orbitals.Upon bandgap (Eg 3.2 eV) excitation, photogenerated electrons are transferred from non-bonding O 2p to Ti 3d orbitals 41,42, leading to the formation of less acidic LAS Ti 3 states (Fig. 2a bottom) and charge deficient oxygen ions (trapped holes O -), as confirmed by TD-DFT calculations (Fig. 2c).TD-DFT calculations show that this optical electronic transition implies a charge transfer from the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) principally constituted by O2p, to the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), mainly formed by Ti 3d contributions (Fig. 2c). In addition, the evaluation of CO 2 photoreduction cannot discard other additional carbon source coming from impurities initially adsorbed on the catalyst, which may contribute to the production of CO through carbon gasification or a reverse Boudouard reaction 18.To evaluate this contribution, prior to photocatalytic experiments, we confirmed by elemental analysis and thermogravimetric studies (Fig. S3) that the calcined TiO 2 surface was relatively free of organic residues ( 0.1 wt.carbon content).XPS C 1 s spectra (Fig. S4 S4), while carbonate species remain stable on the surface and only decompose partially at high temperatures ( 900 C) (Fig. S3b).These photochemical processes are fast and occur during the first stages of the reaction.On the other hand, water oxidation competes with C-decomposition over the surface oxidation sites.UV irradiation causes a loss of physisorbed water and a slight increase in surface OH groups (Fig. S5 and Table S5), which is associated with the photoinduced superhydrophilicity of TiO 2 21,46,47 that may contribute to the formation of bicarbonate and peroxocarbonate species. To ascertain the influence of reactants and surface carbon species on the photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 , and considering the aforementioned scenario, we carried out a series of photocatalytic experiments under different reaction atmospheres: (1) humid argon, (2) argon, and (3) dry CO 2 , which led to different product distributions (see Fig. 3 and Fig. S6a).Analogously to CO 2 H 2 O experiments, tests under humid argon predominantly yielded CO and H 2 (Fig. 3a), although productions decreased by half (Table S3).Photocatalytic experiments under humid argon have been proposed in the literature as a possible pretreatment to avoid the effect of C-residues 12 .On this basis, we performed two consecutive experiments: (i) humid argon and (ii) subsequent CO 2 H 2 O feeding (Fig. S6b), and we did not observe the recovering of the initial production.In-situ DRIFTS experiments (Fig. S6c) showed that the production under humid argon mainly comes from inherent surface carbon species (both organics and carbonates), which corroborates XPS findings (Fig. S4).On the other hand, photocatalytic tests conducted under dry argon and CO 2 atmospheres mainly yielded CH 4 with minor amounts of CO (Fig. 3b,c).It is worth noting that CH 4 productions surpassed that obtained in the CO 2 H 2 O experiment, being 3 and 7times higher under dry Ar and CO 2 atmosphere, respectively (Table S3).This increase in CH 4 production is related to the absence of water adsorption competition, as well as the mediation of surface hydroxyl groups and H atoms from dissociated water 18,21 from adsorbed ambient moisture.The formation of carbon-containing products in the absence of CO 2 co-feeding is associated with the photoinduced decomposition of adsorbed carbonate-and bicarbonate-like species or other carbon residues 18, which cannot be removed by calcination due to their high decomposing temperature (see Fig. S3b). With the aim of drawing a complete picture of the reaction mechanism, we further studied the potential back-reactions of intermediates and products.To do so, TiO 2 reactivity was evaluated in a hydrocarbon standard gas mixture (containing 100 ppm of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane and butane) under dry and humid Ar atmosphere (Fig. S7).Photocatalytic experiments mainly conduced to the formation of CH 4 and CO, respectively.These results show that surface carbon species, OH groups and adsorbed water contribute to the evolution of CO and hydrocarbons (e.g.CH 4 ), as later confirmed by in-situ DRIFT experiments.The photocatalytic tests under low humidity conditions and reaction temperatures higher than 100 C (Fig. 3e-f) showed an unusually high selectivity to CH 4 , despite most of the adsorbed water layers are removed.This suggests that the presence of water layers play a critical role in the reaction mechanism, particularly promoting CO formation. A combination of in-situ surface studies was employed to get a deeper understanding of the influence of reactants and intermediates on CO 2 photoreduction.In-situ DRIFTS has already established itself as a powerful tool to study the reaction intermediates, and therefore it has been extensively reported in the literature (see Table S6).However, from our point of view, these studies can only illustrate the complex surface chemistry of the process, rather than provide conclusive evidence of the reaction mechanism.Fig. 4a compiles a thorough literature review of the vibrations of the main intermediates species detected in CO 2 photoreduction with TiO 2 .The evident overlapping of signals, derived from the high dispersion of reported data, complicates an unambiguous identification of surface species.The most plausible interpretation of our results (Fig. 4b) suggests that CO 2 and H 2 O dosing promotes the formation of carbonate, bicarbonate and CO 2 -species (ca. 1250-1620 cm -1 ) in different adsorption modes.Under UV illumination, there is a partial loss of the surface water layer that is accompanied by a decrease in HCO 3 -species (ca.1210-1230 cm -1 ), and a parallel increase in b-CO 3 2-and CO 2 -species (ca.1275 cm -1 ).To confirm DRIFTS observations, we carried out further in-situ spectroscopic studies to undoubtedly identify the evolution of carbonate-like species and the formation of reaction intermediates.Raman studies under UV illumination corroborated the significant formation of b-CO 3 2-and m-CO 3 2-from HCO 3 -species (Fig. S8a).Irradiation also conduced to the formation of formates (ca.1371 and 1565 cm -1 ) and interestingly led to the appearance of peroxocarbonates and superoxo-like species (ca.988 and 1130 cm -1 , respectively).The formation of peroxocarbonates may follow two pathways: (i) perhydration (reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O 2 ), followed by deprotonation to form HCO 4 -; and/or (ii) direct reaction of CO 2 with a hydroperoxide ion (HO 2 -).The latter pathway dominates at mild basic pH due to the higher contribution of the conjugate base HO 2 -, while more acidic pH increases the dehydration of bicarbonates toward CO 2 to form HCO 4 - 48. Near Ambient Pressure XPS (NAP-XPS) in the C1s region also unveiled an increase in carbonate/bicarbonate species, especially bicarbonates, after exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O atmosphere (Fig. 4c and Table S7) 43,44.An increase in C--O/COO -groups (ca.286.2 eV) was also observed, most probably corresponding to carboxylates of formate species.On the contrary, the signal of C-O groups (ca.285.3 eV) increased, in good agreement with the appearance of a new component in O 1 s spectra (Fig. S9) associated to carbon-oxygen groups (ca.532.3 eV), such as methoxy species.This suggests that, even in dark conditions, the surface acidity of TiO 2 (protons over the surface) favors the conversion of formate to methoxy species. Under UV illumination, C 1s spectra (Fig. 4c) showed an overall depletion of bicarbonates, carbonyl/carboxylates and methoxy groups, 13 C MAS NMR spectra of TiO 2 after the following treatment: 5 h at 150 C under vacuum; exposed to 13 CO 2 and moist; and exposed to 13 CO 2 , moist and UV irradiation (365 nm) during 6 h.The expanded spectral regions show the peak assignment to various carboxylated species, and the inset graph illustrates the corresponding individual peak areas calculated by deconvolution of the NMR spectra and the total signal normalized to sample weight.Sequence of colors in the contour plots from red to blue correspond to high to low intensity, respectively.in good agreement with a decrease in the C-O signal in O 1s spectra (see Tables S7 -S8).In addition, two new components appeared in the C 1s spectra attributed to CO 2 -and/or gas-phase CO (291.1 eV), and photodesorbed gas-phase CO 2 49,50 (292.1 eV) (Fig. 4c).The O 1s spectra also revealed a new peak at ca. 536.1 eV that can be assigned to the formation of both gas phase CO and/or CH 3 OH 43,50,51 (Fig. S9).It should be noted that CH 3 OH could not be identified in C 1 s spectra due to an overlapping with the carbonate region (ca.288-290 eV) 43,51.Moreover, a decrease in OH groups was observed along the reaction in O 1s spectra (Table S8), suggesting the contribution of these species in the photoredox process.This observation agrees well with the depletion of hydroxyl groups and adsorbed H 2 O under illumination, observed in 1 H MAS NMR spectra (Fig. S10) and DRIFTS (Fig. S11) under reaction conditions.In-situ 13 C MAS NMR measurements, upon H 2 O and CO 2 dosage (Fig. 4d), showed a narrow signal characteristic of physisorbed 13 CO 2 at 125 ppm, together with two broad features at ca. 160 and 170 ppm.The presence of wide bands is representative of disordered water in different chemical environments 52.A more detailed study of this region led to the identification of four resonances, which can be tentatively assigned to: (i) bidentate carbonates (171.3 ppm), (ii) carbonates (168.3 ppm) interacting with OH -or H 2 O via H-bridge interactions (i.e.hydroxycarbonates), (iii) formates (164.8 ppm) and (iv) bicarbonates (161.7 ppm) (Table S9). 13CP/MAS NMR (Cross Polarization/Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectra, which show carbon atoms with protons in their vicinity, allowed to distinguish bicarbonates, formates and hydroxycarbonates (Fig. S12a).The new contribution at 171.8 ppm can be associated with carboxylates close to OH surface groups. In addition, 13 CO 2 static NMR spectra revealed a resonance at 49 ppm attributed to methoxy groups (Fig. S12b), which increased upon illumination.These findings agree with NAP-XPS observations and confirm the catalytic conversion of formates to methoxy species via by an acid mechanism over TiO 2 , even in the dark 53.These observations are consistent with 1 H MAS NMR spectra (Fig. S10), which showed a small contribution at ca. 3-5 ppm region that could be tentatively assigned to the formation of CH 3 or CH 3 O -intermediates under prolonged UV illumination.We note that the broadening of this signal may also suggest the presence of peroxide species (see Table S9). 13C CP/MAS NMR, NAP-XPS and Raman studies (Fig. S13 and Fig. S8) further revealed that a prolonged light exposure leads to the stabilization of an overlayer of unreactive carbonates and peroxocarbonates that contributes to the blockage of TiO 2 active sites, leading to its deactivation. Based on our observations from in-situ surface studies and photocatalytic experiments, we propose a CO 2 photoreduction mechanism based on multiple parallel reactions with consecutive steps, which strongly depend on the experimental conditions and the dynamic changes occurring on the surface along the reaction (Fig. 5). Initially, calcined TiO 2 surface contains traces of unspecific carbon species (principally organic residues, carbonate-like species and methoxy/carboxylate groups), coming from the synthesis or the adsorption from air.After CO 2 :H 2 O dosage, the surface is covered by a thin layer of water in which CO 2 is partially solvated/dissolved (0.2 -1 as carbonic acid), 21 causing a surface acidification below the point of zero charge of TiO 2 (pH PZC 6).This promotes the formation of carbonates (CO 3 ) with different coordination geometries on titanium sites (Fig. S14).Surface hydroxyl groups (OH -) interact with reagents and intermediates in the reaction medium (see video S1 in Supplementary Material).Thus, the interaction of carbonic acid with surface OH -leads to dehydration and binding of bicarbonates (HCO 3 -) 21,48. Undercoordinated titanium sites (Lewis acid sites) and vicinal hydroxyl groups (Lewis basic sites) can likely form metastable surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLP), which enhance the formation of adsorbed/activated CO 2 (CO 2 -) or carboxylates 14151654,55.These species are preferentially formed in the absence of water.It is also important to highlight that the nature and concentration of surface carbon species vary depending on the reaction conditions, such as temperature and water content, the latter also influencing the pH of both the reaction medium and the catalyst surface. UV illumination promotes a charge transfer from oxygen to titanium atoms, leading to titanium reduction (O - Ti 3 ) and the formation of surface oxygen vacancies (O V ) 46,565758, which are the main active sites for redox reactions.Besides, illumination induces changes on the acidity of the hydroxyl groups (Fig. 5a), stimulating the protonation of Ti-O-Ti sites (acidic OH groups) rather than promoting the direct bonding of OH -to 5-coordinated Ti ions (basic Ti-OH species) 59.The photogenerated less acidic Lewis sites (Ti 3 ) favor the conversion of monodentate carbonates (m-CO 3 ) into bidentate-like carbonates through oxygen vacancies filling 60.This reaction is also favored by a partial water desorption (Fig. S6 and Fig. S11). In addition, in the first reaction steps CO 2 -is protonated to carboxylic acid (COOH), which can be reductively dissociated in acidic media to CO and H 2 O (Fig. 5, Eq. 1, 2 respectively).In contrast, the formation of formates (HCOO -), can be directly promoted by reaction of CO 2 -with neighboring Ti-H 61 (acidic mechanism) or by a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process (equations 3, respectively).Formates can also be formed by a direct two-electron reduction of adsorbed bicarbonate HCO In our study, we have confirmed that reaction pathways strongly depend on the interaction between condensed water and the catalyst surface.Under low surface moisture conditions (Fig. 3b,c) or high temperature (Fig. 3e,f), formate species preferentially dissociate on O V to methyl radicals 22, leading to the formation of CH 4 and further coupling to form other hydrocarbons (mainly C 2 H 6 ) 23,63 (Fig. 5, equation 12).On the contrary, higher amounts of water (Fig. 3a) leads to the formation of a condensed water layer over the catalyst surface.As previously commented, the acidic/basic properties of the solvent/catalyst interface change along the reaction, thus modifying the reaction mechanism.Namely, favoring the direct dissociation of formate to CO, or in minor extent to methoxy species, due to a competitive adsorption of water on O V 21,55. Furthermore, our experiments (Fig. S7, Fig. S15-16) have shown that other competitive backward reactions can occur in the presence of O 2 : a) oxidation of CO to CO 2 (Fig. 5, equation 14); b) partial oxidation of CH to methanol or syngas (equations 15, 16); or in the presence of water: c) photoreforming of CH 4 or CH 3 OH towards CO and H 2 23,64 (Fig. 5, equations 17,18).Therefore, water content influences both the production and selectivity of TiO 2 , suggesting that CO 2 adsorption may be a rate limiting step. Stability studies show that reactions leading to catalyst deactivation are promoted by both photoinduced charges and acid/base properties.Thus, bicarbonates can act as hole scavengers 21 leading to the formation of carbonates that will be strongly adsorbed on the TiO 2 surface (Fig. 5, equation 19).In addition, 13 C CP/MAS NMR measurements (Fig. S13) unveiled the formation of adsorbed peroxocarbonates by a slight broadening of the bicarbonate resonance (ca.159.2 ppm), as previously revealed in Raman studies (Fig. S8).These species are formed in a series of consecutive steps.First, peroxo species (H 2 O 2 , HO 2 -) are formed by the reaction of water or O 2 with holes or electrons, respectively 11,65,66 (Fig. 5, equations 20-23).Peroxo species induce a light yellowish color on the TiO 2 surface (Fig. S8c), which disappears under UV illumination by decomposition to OH radicals with surface-trapped electrons (Ti 3 ).The oxygen consumption in the formation of peroxo-species and the partial oxidation of products explains the lack of net O 2 production during CO 2 photoreduction (Fig. S15-S16).This study evidences that prolonged UV irradiation leads to the stabilization of surface carbonate, peroxo-and peroxocarbonate species that, together with the slow desorption of products, contribute to the blocking of TiO 2 active sites and its deactivation.The deactivation of TiO 2 centers seems to occur in the first stages of the reaction and is mostly irreversible, constituting the main drawback of this catalyst.We explored two regeneration strategies: i) Thermal treatment at temperatures higher than 900 C for the removal of surface carbonates (see Fig. S3b), which leads to small activity recoveries ( 1), an unavoidable loss of surface area and changes in the structural and chemical properties of TiO 2 ; and ii) Acid washing of the catalyst surface after reaction with a mild acid solution.This method is effective to dissolve the adsorbed carbonate species and to acidify the surface, which result in a partial TiO 2 regeneration (ca.23 for CO evolution, see Fig. S17)."}, {"llm generation": "Gas, Liquid", "source": "Fig. 1.(a) Literature comparison of CO 2 conversion over TiO 2 -based catalysts in reported gas and liquid-phase studies from 1970 to date; nCO 2 stands for total CO 2 converted, which is defined as (mol of carbon products x No. carbons).", "context": "Based on the results and insights gained from this work, we provided clear evidences about the catalytic pathways influencing the activity, selectivity and stability of TiO 2 in CO 2 photoreduction, which are mainly governed by PCET processes.In addition, the presence of acidic and basic sites leads to the formation of a significant number of intermediates and products (such as formates and methanol), which are also detected under dark conditions.UV illumination induces relevant changes not only in the redox properties of the TiO 2 active sites, but also in the acid/base character of the surface and the medium, which plays a key role in the selectivity and deactivation pathways. In addition, our results call into question some key issues that were unclear up to date, and which are highly relevant to deactivation pathways.Thus, TiO 2 deactivation is mainly initiated by the formation of carbonates and peroxo-species favored by the presence of oxygen, which also participates in the partial oxidation of products, thus explaining the lack of net O 2 production.Lastly, TiO 2 activity can be partially recovered by a post-reaction washing treatment with a mild acid solution. These findings enlighten the main shadows remaining unclear on the CO 2 photoreduction mechanism, and at the same time, shed light on the factors controlling the activity and stability.In addition, this work lays the foundation for the rational design of efficient photocatalysts, which may be of great interest for a multitude of potential applications such as water splitting, biomass photoreforming, ammonia production and other light-driven catalytic reactions for renewable energy applications.

In-line gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 A) analyzes were performed to detect the reaction products.The GC is equipped with two separation branches, one equipped with two semicapillary columns (BR-Q Plot and BR-Molesieve 5 A) and one thermal conductivity detector, a flame ionization detector (FID) and a methanizer.The second separation branch consists on a capillary column (CP-Sil 5B) and a second FID.Before starting the experiments, the reactor was first degassed under vacuum and then purged for 1 h using argon (100 mL min -1 ) to remove any residual organic compounds weakly adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst.Then, the reactor was flushed with the CO 2 and water mixture for 1 h to establish an adsorption-desorption balance at the reaction temperature.Analogously, photocatalytic experiments under argon, argon H 2 O, and CO 2 were performed following the same reaction procedure but changing the feeding gas.Post-reaction treatment was performed by immersing the catalyst filter in an aqueous nitric acid solution (0.1 M) for 30 min.The filter was then washed with distilled water and dried in the oven at 100 C before reaction tests. The photonic efficiency () towards CO was calculated as the ratio between the rate of reaction and the incident photon flux, according to Eq. (1). where 2 represents the number of electrons involved in the conversion of CO 2 to CO; dN/dt represents the production rate of CO, and q 0 p, is the incident spectral photon flux within a defined wavelength range (ca.330-400 nm).The superscript 0 (zero) emphasizes that the incident number of photons (prior to absorption) is considered.The incident spectral photon flux was calculated from the lamp emission spectrum (see Scheme 1d in Supplementary Material), recorded with a StellarNet UVNb-50 spectroradiometer connected to an optical fiber. Isotope tracing experiments were carried out in a 15.6 mL stainless steel reactor with a borosilicate glass window operated in batch mode.After outgassing, 13 CO 2 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., 99.2 13 C, 1 18 O) and H 2 O were introduced in the reactor at 50 C and 2 bar.After 30 min UV irradiation (four 6 W lamps, fluorescent Philips Actinic, max 365 nm), the gas was analyzed in a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OMNISTAR). Carbon content was determined using a THERMO SCIENTIFIC Flash 2000 Elemental Analyzer after sample combustion at 900 C. Samples weight loss and carbon-products desorption were monitored in a thermobalance TA Instruments SDT Q-600, coupled to an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OMNISTAR).Further characterization (N adsorption-desorption isotherms XRD, TEM) can be found in a previous study 24 and is also summarized in Fig. S1. To identify the acid and basic sites on the TiO 2 surface, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were carried out using an AUTOCHEM II 2910 instrument (Micromeritics), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).For NH 3 -TPD tests, the catalyst sample (0.1 g) was degassed under He flow at 350 C for 30 min, cooled down to three different temperatures (50, 100 and 150 C) in He flow, and then treated with 5 vol NH 3 /He until the material was saturated at those temperatures.Then, the sample was purged at the same temperature under He flow in order to remove the weakly physisorbed ammonia until only He was detected in the TCD signal.Finally, the NH 3 -TPD profile was subsequently recorded increasing the temperature from 50, 100 or 150-550 C using a ramp rate of 5 C min -1 .A final isotherm at 550 C of 30 min was added in order to ensure a complete NH desorption.The experimental procedure for CO 2 -TPD measurements was similar to that followed for the NH 3 -TPD test at 50 C, but changing the probe molecule to CO 2 . Theoretical calculations by periodic density functional theory (DFT) were carried out using a 114-atom TiO 2 nanoparticle with anatase structure 27.Geometry and electronic structure were performed using the projected augmented wave method implemented in Viena ab initio simulation package (VASP) 28,29.The total energies corresponding to the optimized geometries of all samples were calculated using the spin polarized version of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) 30.The Heyd-Scuseria-Enzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06) 31, with a mixing parameter of 0.325, was used to fit a more accurate energy gap.The cut-off for the kinetic energy of the plane-waves was set to 450 eV to ensure a total energy convergence better than 10 -4 eV.The cut-off for the kinetic energy of the plane-waves was set to 500 eV to ensure a total energy and force convergence better than 10 -4 eV and 0.01 eV/A 3 , respectively. Theoretical optoelectronic properties of TiO 2 were calculated using time dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) 32,33 implemented in the software Gaussian 09 34, employing a CAM-B3LYP functional 35 and using a DGDZVP2 basis set 36,37.A fixed number of 150 states was selected for a proper comparison between all configurations and models.The interactions between reagents and intermediates with surface sites were explored by molecular dynamics using a hydroxylated TiO 2 nanoparticle (40 nm) and CO 2 , H 2 O, CO 3 2-, HCO 3 -molecules.The system was equilibrated for 10 ps using a 1 fs timestep at 323 K.A Berendsen thermostat controlled the ionic temperature (dt/ 1/50). Measurements were performed on a Thermo-Nicolet FTIR instrument, which housed a Harrick DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy) reaction cell with three quartz windows, in which the gas stream passed through the powdered sample.Spectra were collected at a resolution of 4 cm -1 with 32 co-added scans in the range 650-4000 cm -1 using a liquid N 2 -cooled MCT detector.A step with argon flow (10 mL min -1 ) at 50 C was performed for 1 h, after acquiring a spectrum of the fresh sample in air as background.Then, a 5 sccm flow of 0.1 CO 2 in humid Ar (saturated with water using a thermostated bubbler) was introduced to the cell.Illumination was carried out using a 365 nm LED lamp. Spectra were recorded using a JASCO NRS-5000/7000 series laser spectrometer equipped with a Linkam CCR1000 in situ cell with a quartz window in which the gas stream passed through the powdered sample.Excitation was performed with a 532 nm laser.The reaction conditions were the same as those used for in situ DRIFTS.Illumination was carried out using a 365 nm LED lamp. A PHOIBOS 150 NAP energy analyzer at the NAPP branch from CIRCE beamline of the ALBA synchrotron light source was used to perform these experiments.The CIRCE beamline is an undulator beamline with a photon energy range 100-2000 eV.In this work, data was acquired with photon energy h 900 eV, using an analyzer pass energy of 10 and 20 eV.The beam spot size at the sample is around 100 90 m 2 (HxV).Powdered samples were pressed into round disks.Ti 2p NAP-XPS spectra were recorded in UHV and under both dark and illumination conditions.In addition, C 1s and O 1s were acquired in UHV and under a CO 2 and H 2 O mixture.NAP-XPS experiments under illumination were performed using a UV LED (Hamamatsu Co.) with a maximum emission centered at 365 nm.The Au 4 f 7/2 peak at 84.0 eV from a Au foil was taken as energy reference.These studies were performed as follows: ultrapure water (LC-MS CHROMASOLV grade, Sigma-Aldrich) was introduced into the chamber through a variable high precision leak valve after being degassed by multiple freeze--pump-thaw cycles.CO 2 (purity 99.995, Abello Linde) was introduced into the chamber directly from a commercial cylinder through a variable high precision leak valve.The gases were dosed into the chamber until reaching a base pressure of 5 10 -2 mbar (CO 2 :H 2 O 7:1).Data were collected using SpecsLab software. 2.9.In-situ 1 H and 13 C solid state NMR Analyzes were conducted in a Bruker AvanceTM 400 spectrometer equipped with a 9.4 T superconducting magnet ( 1 H and 13 C Larmor frequencies at 400.14 MHz and 100.61MHz, respectively).For the measurements, calcined TiO 2 powder (0.1 g) was loaded in a 10 mm glass tube and degassed at 150 C for 5-8 h.Samples were allowed to cool down to room temperature under vacuum, and then 13 CO 2 was loaded at 1.3-2.0bar.In water co-feeding experiments, TiO 2 powder was cooled to -60 C (mixture of dry ice and isopropanol) before injecting 0.1-0.2L of distilled water in the glass tube.Samples were irradiated under UV light (6 W lamp, max 365 nm) at different time intervals.Analyzes were performed using a NMR probe head with a 10 mm radiofrequency (rf) insert tuned to the 13 C Larmor frequency. 13C NMR spectra were acquired using a single pulse excitation with solutionlike NMR conditions and keeping the samples static.After this, a fraction of the sample (about 0.07 g of 0.7 g) was transferred under dry nitrogen to a 4 mm zirconia rotor, and analyzed using a standard Bruker double resonance 4 mm cross-polarization (CP)/magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR probe head. 1 H and 13 C MAS spectra were acquired using spinning rates of 5-6.5 kHz and a single pulse excitation with recycle delays of and 3 s, respectively.The 13 C CP/MAS spectra were acquired with 2 ms CP contact time, a repetition rate of 3 s and high-power proton decoupling of 75 kHz. 1 H and 13 C chemical shifts were externally referenced to adamantane (29.5 ppm relative to tetramethylsilane, 0.0 ppm).All freeinduction decays were subjected to standard Fourier transformation with 20-100 Hz line broadening and phasing.NMR spectra were evaluated using the software package XWIN NMR provided by the spectrometer manufacturer.Each spectrum was deconvoluted using Gaussian/Lorentzian fits, taking into consideration available information in the literature and our experimental observations for initial peaks assignments to carboxylated species in the region of interest.The peak areas were normalized to sample weight."}, {"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "In addition, 13 CO 2 reduction batch reactions performed under similar reaction conditions 38 showed the production of 13 CO, while other products were below the detection limit of our equipment.", "context": "Fig. 1c depicts the photoactivity of the TiO 2 catalyst (Fig. S1) in a gas phase photoreactor (Scheme S1) using a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor and UV illumination.CO and H 2 were obtained as main products, reaching maximum formation rates of 25.5 and 7.6 mol g cat respectively, and a photonic efficiency towards CO of 0.21 (Table S2).Besides, minor amounts of CH 3 OH, CH 4 and C 2 H 6 were also detected with evolution rates increasing when CO and H 2 yields decreased (Table S3).These values are comparable to other studies reported under similar conditions (Table S1), although significant differences have also been found in the literature (see Fig. 1a).To understand the dispersion in TiO 2 reactivity it is necessary to dig deeper into the mechanism that controls this reaction.In addition, 13 CO 2 reduction batch reactions performed under similar reaction conditions 38 showed the production of 13 CO, while other products were below the detection limit of our equipment. Activity and selectivity are governed by two main kinetic processes related to the charge dynamics of photogenerated e -/h pairs 24,25 and to the surface adsorption-desorption rates, which are intimately associated with the acid/base properties of the catalyst surface.TiO presents a weakly acidic surface (PZC 6) (Fig. 2), bearing Lewis acid sites (LAS) such as Ti cations, and Bronsted acidic and basic sites (BAS and BBS) such as bridging and terminal hydroxyl groups (OH B and OH T , respectively) 39,40.NH 3 -and CO 2 -TPD measurements (Fig. S2) confirmed that TiO 2 (PC500) mainly contains weak acid sites and intermediate basic sites, under our tested conditions, bearing an overall acidity and basicity of 0.85 and 0.37 mmol g -1 , respectively. The electronic structure of TiO 2 (Fig. 2b) shows that the valence band (VB) is composed by O 2p bonding (at 7.6 eV) and non-bonding orbitals (at 5.6 eV), while the conduction band (CB) consists of Ti 3d orbitals.Upon bandgap (Eg 3.2 eV) excitation, photogenerated electrons are transferred from non-bonding O 2p to Ti 3d orbitals 41,42, leading to the formation of less acidic LAS Ti 3 states (Fig. 2a bottom) and charge deficient oxygen ions (trapped holes O -), as confirmed by TD-DFT calculations (Fig. 2c).TD-DFT calculations show that this optical electronic transition implies a charge transfer from the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) principally constituted by O2p, to the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), mainly formed by Ti 3d contributions (Fig. 2c). In addition, the evaluation of CO 2 photoreduction cannot discard other additional carbon source coming from impurities initially adsorbed on the catalyst, which may contribute to the production of CO through carbon gasification or a reverse Boudouard reaction 18.To evaluate this contribution, prior to photocatalytic experiments, we confirmed by elemental analysis and thermogravimetric studies (Fig. S3) that the calcined TiO 2 surface was relatively free of organic residues ( 0.1 wt.carbon content).XPS C 1 s spectra (Fig. S4 S4), while carbonate species remain stable on the surface and only decompose partially at high temperatures ( 900 C) (Fig. S3b).These photochemical processes are fast and occur during the first stages of the reaction.On the other hand, water oxidation competes with C-decomposition over the surface oxidation sites.UV irradiation causes a loss of physisorbed water and a slight increase in surface OH groups (Fig. S5 and Table S5), which is associated with the photoinduced superhydrophilicity of TiO 2 21,46,47 that may contribute to the formation of bicarbonate and peroxocarbonate species. To ascertain the influence of reactants and surface carbon species on the photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 , and considering the aforementioned scenario, we carried out a series of photocatalytic experiments under different reaction atmospheres: (1) humid argon, (2) argon, and (3) dry CO 2 , which led to different product distributions (see Fig. 3 and Fig. S6a).Analogously to CO 2 H 2 O experiments, tests under humid argon predominantly yielded CO and H 2 (Fig. 3a), although productions decreased by half (Table S3).Photocatalytic experiments under humid argon have been proposed in the literature as a possible pretreatment to avoid the effect of C-residues 12 .On this basis, we performed two consecutive experiments: (i) humid argon and (ii) subsequent CO 2 H 2 O feeding (Fig. S6b), and we did not observe the recovering of the initial production.In-situ DRIFTS experiments (Fig. S6c) showed that the production under humid argon mainly comes from inherent surface carbon species (both organics and carbonates), which corroborates XPS findings (Fig. S4).On the other hand, photocatalytic tests conducted under dry argon and CO 2 atmospheres mainly yielded CH 4 with minor amounts of CO (Fig. 3b,c).It is worth noting that CH 4 productions surpassed that obtained in the CO 2 H 2 O experiment, being 3 and 7times higher under dry Ar and CO 2 atmosphere, respectively (Table S3).This increase in CH 4 production is related to the absence of water adsorption competition, as well as the mediation of surface hydroxyl groups and H atoms from dissociated water 18,21 from adsorbed ambient moisture.The formation of carbon-containing products in the absence of CO 2 co-feeding is associated with the photoinduced decomposition of adsorbed carbonate-and bicarbonate-like species or other carbon residues 18, which cannot be removed by calcination due to their high decomposing temperature (see Fig. S3b). With the aim of drawing a complete picture of the reaction mechanism, we further studied the potential back-reactions of intermediates and products.To do so, TiO 2 reactivity was evaluated in a hydrocarbon standard gas mixture (containing 100 ppm of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane and butane) under dry and humid Ar atmosphere (Fig. S7).Photocatalytic experiments mainly conduced to the formation of CH 4 and CO, respectively.These results show that surface carbon species, OH groups and adsorbed water contribute to the evolution of CO and hydrocarbons (e.g.CH 4 ), as later confirmed by in-situ DRIFT experiments.The photocatalytic tests under low humidity conditions and reaction temperatures higher than 100 C (Fig. 3e-f) showed an unusually high selectivity to CH 4 , despite most of the adsorbed water layers are removed.This suggests that the presence of water layers play a critical role in the reaction mechanism, particularly promoting CO formation. A combination of in-situ surface studies was employed to get a deeper understanding of the influence of reactants and intermediates on CO 2 photoreduction.In-situ DRIFTS has already established itself as a powerful tool to study the reaction intermediates, and therefore it has been extensively reported in the literature (see Table S6).However, from our point of view, these studies can only illustrate the complex surface chemistry of the process, rather than provide conclusive evidence of the reaction mechanism.Fig. 4a compiles a thorough literature review of the vibrations of the main intermediates species detected in CO 2 photoreduction with TiO 2 .The evident overlapping of signals, derived from the high dispersion of reported data, complicates an unambiguous identification of surface species.The most plausible interpretation of our results (Fig. 4b) suggests that CO 2 and H 2 O dosing promotes the formation of carbonate, bicarbonate and CO 2 -species (ca. 1250-1620 cm -1 ) in different adsorption modes.Under UV illumination, there is a partial loss of the surface water layer that is accompanied by a decrease in HCO 3 -species (ca.1210-1230 cm -1 ), and a parallel increase in b-CO 3 2-and CO 2 -species (ca.1275 cm -1 ).To confirm DRIFTS observations, we carried out further in-situ spectroscopic studies to undoubtedly identify the evolution of carbonate-like species and the formation of reaction intermediates.Raman studies under UV illumination corroborated the significant formation of b-CO 3 2-and m-CO 3 2-from HCO 3 -species (Fig. S8a).Irradiation also conduced to the formation of formates (ca.1371 and 1565 cm -1 ) and interestingly led to the appearance of peroxocarbonates and superoxo-like species (ca.988 and 1130 cm -1 , respectively).The formation of peroxocarbonates may follow two pathways: (i) perhydration (reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O 2 ), followed by deprotonation to form HCO 4 -; and/or (ii) direct reaction of CO 2 with a hydroperoxide ion (HO 2 -).The latter pathway dominates at mild basic pH due to the higher contribution of the conjugate base HO 2 -, while more acidic pH increases the dehydration of bicarbonates toward CO 2 to form HCO 4 - 48. Near Ambient Pressure XPS (NAP-XPS) in the C1s region also unveiled an increase in carbonate/bicarbonate species, especially bicarbonates, after exposure to CO 2 and H 2 O atmosphere (Fig. 4c and Table S7) 43,44.An increase in C--O/COO -groups (ca.286.2 eV) was also observed, most probably corresponding to carboxylates of formate species.On the contrary, the signal of C-O groups (ca.285.3 eV) increased, in good agreement with the appearance of a new component in O 1 s spectra (Fig. S9) associated to carbon-oxygen groups (ca.532.3 eV), such as methoxy species.This suggests that, even in dark conditions, the surface acidity of TiO 2 (protons over the surface) favors the conversion of formate to methoxy species. Under UV illumination, C 1s spectra (Fig. 4c) showed an overall depletion of bicarbonates, carbonyl/carboxylates and methoxy groups, 13 C MAS NMR spectra of TiO 2 after the following treatment: 5 h at 150 C under vacuum; exposed to 13 CO 2 and moist; and exposed to 13 CO 2 , moist and UV irradiation (365 nm) during 6 h.The expanded spectral regions show the peak assignment to various carboxylated species, and the inset graph illustrates the corresponding individual peak areas calculated by deconvolution of the NMR spectra and the total signal normalized to sample weight.Sequence of colors in the contour plots from red to blue correspond to high to low intensity, respectively.in good agreement with a decrease in the C-O signal in O 1s spectra (see Tables S7 -S8).In addition, two new components appeared in the C 1s spectra attributed to CO 2 -and/or gas-phase CO (291.1 eV), and photodesorbed gas-phase CO 2 49,50 (292.1 eV) (Fig. 4c).The O 1s spectra also revealed a new peak at ca. 536.1 eV that can be assigned to the formation of both gas phase CO and/or CH 3 OH 43,50,51 (Fig. S9).It should be noted that CH 3 OH could not be identified in C 1 s spectra due to an overlapping with the carbonate region (ca.288-290 eV) 43,51.Moreover, a decrease in OH groups was observed along the reaction in O 1s spectra (Table S8), suggesting the contribution of these species in the photoredox process.This observation agrees well with the depletion of hydroxyl groups and adsorbed H 2 O under illumination, observed in 1 H MAS NMR spectra (Fig. S10) and DRIFTS (Fig. S11) under reaction conditions.In-situ 13 C MAS NMR measurements, upon H 2 O and CO 2 dosage (Fig. 4d), showed a narrow signal characteristic of physisorbed 13 CO 2 at 125 ppm, together with two broad features at ca. 160 and 170 ppm.The presence of wide bands is representative of disordered water in different chemical environments 52.A more detailed study of this region led to the identification of four resonances, which can be tentatively assigned to: (i) bidentate carbonates (171.3 ppm), (ii) carbonates (168.3 ppm) interacting with OH -or H 2 O via H-bridge interactions (i.e.hydroxycarbonates), (iii) formates (164.8 ppm) and (iv) bicarbonates (161.7 ppm) (Table S9). 13CP/MAS NMR (Cross Polarization/Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectra, which show carbon atoms with protons in their vicinity, allowed to distinguish bicarbonates, formates and hydroxycarbonates (Fig. S12a).The new contribution at 171.8 ppm can be associated with carboxylates close to OH surface groups. In addition, 13 CO 2 static NMR spectra revealed a resonance at 49 ppm attributed to methoxy groups (Fig. S12b), which increased upon illumination.These findings agree with NAP-XPS observations and confirm the catalytic conversion of formates to methoxy species via by an acid mechanism over TiO 2 , even in the dark 53.These observations are consistent with 1 H MAS NMR spectra (Fig. S10), which showed a small contribution at ca. 3-5 ppm region that could be tentatively assigned to the formation of CH 3 or CH 3 O -intermediates under prolonged UV illumination.We note that the broadening of this signal may also suggest the presence of peroxide species (see Table S9). 13C CP/MAS NMR, NAP-XPS and Raman studies (Fig. S13 and Fig. S8) further revealed that a prolonged light exposure leads to the stabilization of an overlayer of unreactive carbonates and peroxocarbonates that contributes to the blockage of TiO 2 active sites, leading to its deactivation. Based on our observations from in-situ surface studies and photocatalytic experiments, we propose a CO 2 photoreduction mechanism based on multiple parallel reactions with consecutive steps, which strongly depend on the experimental conditions and the dynamic changes occurring on the surface along the reaction (Fig. 5). Initially, calcined TiO 2 surface contains traces of unspecific carbon species (principally organic residues, carbonate-like species and methoxy/carboxylate groups), coming from the synthesis or the adsorption from air.After CO 2 :H 2 O dosage, the surface is covered by a thin layer of water in which CO 2 is partially solvated/dissolved (0.2 -1 as carbonic acid), 21 causing a surface acidification below the point of zero charge of TiO 2 (pH PZC 6).This promotes the formation of carbonates (CO 3 ) with different coordination geometries on titanium sites (Fig. S14).Surface hydroxyl groups (OH -) interact with reagents and intermediates in the reaction medium (see video S1 in Supplementary Material).Thus, the interaction of carbonic acid with surface OH -leads to dehydration and binding of bicarbonates (HCO 3 -) 21,48. Undercoordinated titanium sites (Lewis acid sites) and vicinal hydroxyl groups (Lewis basic sites) can likely form metastable surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLP), which enhance the formation of adsorbed/activated CO 2 (CO 2 -) or carboxylates 14151654,55.These species are preferentially formed in the absence of water.It is also important to highlight that the nature and concentration of surface carbon species vary depending on the reaction conditions, such as temperature and water content, the latter also influencing the pH of both the reaction medium and the catalyst surface. UV illumination promotes a charge transfer from oxygen to titanium atoms, leading to titanium reduction (O - Ti 3 ) and the formation of surface oxygen vacancies (O V ) 46,565758, which are the main active sites for redox reactions.Besides, illumination induces changes on the acidity of the hydroxyl groups (Fig. 5a), stimulating the protonation of Ti-O-Ti sites (acidic OH groups) rather than promoting the direct bonding of OH -to 5-coordinated Ti ions (basic Ti-OH species) 59.The photogenerated less acidic Lewis sites (Ti 3 ) favor the conversion of monodentate carbonates (m-CO 3 ) into bidentate-like carbonates through oxygen vacancies filling 60.This reaction is also favored by a partial water desorption (Fig. S6 and Fig. S11). In addition, in the first reaction steps CO 2 -is protonated to carboxylic acid (COOH), which can be reductively dissociated in acidic media to CO and H 2 O (Fig. 5, Eq. 1, 2 respectively).In contrast, the formation of formates (HCOO -), can be directly promoted by reaction of CO 2 -with neighboring Ti-H 61 (acidic mechanism) or by a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process (equations 3, respectively).Formates can also be formed by a direct two-electron reduction of adsorbed bicarbonate HCO In our study, we have confirmed that reaction pathways strongly depend on the interaction between condensed water and the catalyst surface.Under low surface moisture conditions (Fig. 3b,c) or high temperature (Fig. 3e,f), formate species preferentially dissociate on O V to methyl radicals 22, leading to the formation of CH 4 and further coupling to form other hydrocarbons (mainly C 2 H 6 ) 23,63 (Fig. 5, equation 12).On the contrary, higher amounts of water (Fig. 3a) leads to the formation of a condensed water layer over the catalyst surface.As previously commented, the acidic/basic properties of the solvent/catalyst interface change along the reaction, thus modifying the reaction mechanism.Namely, favoring the direct dissociation of formate to CO, or in minor extent to methoxy species, due to a competitive adsorption of water on O V 21,55. Furthermore, our experiments (Fig. S7, Fig. S15-16) have shown that other competitive backward reactions can occur in the presence of O 2 : a) oxidation of CO to CO 2 (Fig. 5, equation 14); b) partial oxidation of CH to methanol or syngas (equations 15, 16); or in the presence of water: c) photoreforming of CH 4 or CH 3 OH towards CO and H 2 23,64 (Fig. 5, equations 17,18).Therefore, water content influences both the production and selectivity of TiO 2 , suggesting that CO 2 adsorption may be a rate limiting step. Stability studies show that reactions leading to catalyst deactivation are promoted by both photoinduced charges and acid/base properties.Thus, bicarbonates can act as hole scavengers 21 leading to the formation of carbonates that will be strongly adsorbed on the TiO 2 surface (Fig. 5, equation 19).In addition, 13 C CP/MAS NMR measurements (Fig. S13) unveiled the formation of adsorbed peroxocarbonates by a slight broadening of the bicarbonate resonance (ca.159.2 ppm), as previously revealed in Raman studies (Fig. S8).These species are formed in a series of consecutive steps.First, peroxo species (H 2 O 2 , HO 2 -) are formed by the reaction of water or O 2 with holes or electrons, respectively 11,65,66 (Fig. 5, equations 20-23).Peroxo species induce a light yellowish color on the TiO 2 surface (Fig. S8c), which disappears under UV illumination by decomposition to OH radicals with surface-trapped electrons (Ti 3 ).The oxygen consumption in the formation of peroxo-species and the partial oxidation of products explains the lack of net O 2 production during CO 2 photoreduction (Fig. S15-S16).This study evidences that prolonged UV irradiation leads to the stabilization of surface carbonate, peroxo-and peroxocarbonate species that, together with the slow desorption of products, contribute to the blocking of TiO 2 active sites and its deactivation.The deactivation of TiO 2 centers seems to occur in the first stages of the reaction and is mostly irreversible, constituting the main drawback of this catalyst.We explored two regeneration strategies: i) Thermal treatment at temperatures higher than 900 C for the removal of surface carbonates (see Fig. S3b), which leads to small activity recoveries ( 1), an unavoidable loss of surface area and changes in the structural and chemical properties of TiO 2 ; and ii) Acid washing of the catalyst surface after reaction with a mild acid solution.This method is effective to dissolve the adsorbed carbonate species and to acidify the surface, which result in a partial TiO 2 regeneration (ca.23 for CO evolution, see Fig. S17)."}]}}
