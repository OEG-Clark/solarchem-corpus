The figure additionally shows the spectrum of a clean gold film (thickness: 50 nm) prepared on a glass plate for comparison.Symmetric 4f 5/2 and 4f 7/2 emissions were observed at 87.7 and 84.0 eV in both cases which is general for metallic gold.Furthermore, a higher binding energy peak appeared on Au/TNT with Au 4f 7/2 at 85.9 eV.It is important to mention that when gold was dispersed on TiO 2 film only one 4f 7/2 emission appeared 42 . Two different explanations can be offered for the appearance of this unusually high binding energy gold state as we discussed previously 25.Core level shifts due to particle size must be considered first in the interpretation of the spectra of nanoparticles 43444546.The second possible explanation is that Au may have undergone an ion exchange process.This is not possible on TiO 2 because of the lack of cations compensating the framework charge, however, it is quite likely to happen on titanates which are well-known for their ion-exchange ability 47. TEM image on Fig. 3/A demonstrates the tubular morphology of the as-synthesized titanate nanotubes with a diameter of 7 nm and length up to 80 nm.The acidic washing process resulted in a mild destruction of the inner and outer walls of the nanotubes.The size of Au nanoparticles was between 2.0 and 8.0 nm on the H-form titanate nanotubes (Fig. 3/B).The Au particle sizes was determined by XRD, too.The average size was 5.3 nm calculated from the Scherrer equation.The TEM image of Rh decorated nanotubes and nanowires show the presence of homogeneously dispersed nanoparticles on the surface of titanate nanostructures (Fig. 3/C).The particle size distribution of Rh on TNT was calculated from TEM and resulted in 2.8 nm as the most abundant particle diameter.As small as 1 nm sized metal particles were detected too in this sample.Particles with diameters bigger than 5 nm were not observed.Unfortunately we could not observe peaks for Rh crystals in the XRD spectra probably due to low concentration of particles.We may also assume that certain part of Rh underwent ion exchange process 34.In our previous studies we observed that Au and also Rh catalyses the transformation of tube structure to nano anatase above 473 K and 573 K, respectively 32,34.In present cases the temperature of preparation and the photocatalytic test experiments are much lower. The Rh 3d 5/2 peak at 309.3 eV at 1 Rh content and at 308.3 eV at 2 metal content clearly suggest the existence of an oxidation state or morphology that is different from the bulk because the binding energy of the Rh 3d 5/2 electrons is about 307.1 eV for metallic Rh.The higher binding energy states may correspond to very small clusters stabilized in the structure of nanowires and nanotubes.The stabilization of Rh clusters in small size and the influence of Rh nanoparticles on the transformation of titanate structures can be explained also by the electronic interaction between Rh and titanate, which was observed in several cases between reduced titania and metals, including Rh 48495051. Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra of six different samples, including Au and Rh loaded titanate nanotubes. The pure titanate nanotube showed strong absorption at 3.53 eV (351 nm wavelength) in these experiments.The calculated bandgap energy from the Tauc plot is 3.07 eV.This value was 3.03 eV for pure anatase Fig.4.The reduction of AuCl 4 with NaBH 4 yields 1 or 2.5 wt Au on the surface.The bandgap of 1 wt Au/TNT slightly decreased (3.03 eV).No further significant change was observed at 2.5 wt Au content.This change was less than in the case of titanate nanowires supported Au produced in a similar way 32.The spectrum of the Au/TNT shows a strong absorption band at 2.31 eV (534 nm).This is the characteristic absorption of the surface plasmon of gold nanoparticles (d 3 nm) and arises as a result of the collective modes of oscillation of the free conduction band electrons induced by an interacting electromagnetic field 525354.Interestingly, the spectrum shows some unresolved peaks at higher energies.After deconvolution we can identify three absorptions at 2.68, 2.93, and 3.19 eV.We should emphasize for the sake of identification that small gold nanoparticles (d 3 nm) lose their bulk-like electronic properties; for example, they no longer show the plasmon excitation characteristics of relatively large gold nanocrystals 53,54.It has been demonstrated by XPS and HRTEM measurements that our titanate nanotube samples contain gold in small sizes (d 3 nm), too Figs.2 and3.Recently a multiple molecularlike transition of a thiol-protected Au 25 cluster was observed.At least three well-defined bands at 1.8, 2.75, and 3.1 eV were detected by UV-vis spectroscopy 53.Very recently a similar Au 25 cluster was identified on CeO 2 rod catalyst.It was considered that CeO 2 rods have a large amount of defect sites 555657 and if loading of Au 25 (SR) 18 nanoclusters is very low, one can reasonably expect that the rod support may be helpful to anchor the gold nanoclusters 58.As it was pointed out in previous works 22,25,27,32,34,40 the titanate nanotubes also contain a huge amount of defects and the small clusters and particles of gold can grow on the outer shell and in the inside of the tubes.Furthermore, the cluster coalescence could be prevented because the defects in titanate nanotubes were found helpful for strong bonding with metal nanoparticles 32.For comparison we prepared Au nanoparticles on anatase TiO 2 (Hombikat UV-100).In this case the intensity of plasmonic character was less and the molecular-like feature was hardly seen after deconvo-luting the UV-vis spectrum Fig.4.The ratio of the peak areas of molecular-like bands and the plasmonic band is 0.28 in the case of anatase support and is 0.36 for nanotube support.From this comparison we may conclude that titanate nanotubes have the ability to stabilize the small particles even in cluster size formation, similar to CeO 2 rod catalyst. After impregnating the titanate nanotubes with rhodiumchloride solution two new very weak bands appeared at 2.52 and 3.07 eV (492 and 404 nm, respectively).The Rh(III) salt has an effect of slightly decreasing the bandgap possibly due to the infiltration of rhodium ions into the titanate structure.The bandgap is slightly decreased in the case of 1 Rh/TNT to 3.04 eV compared to pure nanotube (3.07 eV) but does not changed at 2.5 rhodium content (not shown).A strong absorption in the visible region emerged due to reduction Fig.4.On the reduced samples the band gap does not decreased at all (3.08 eV for 1 Rh and 3.16 eV of 2.5 Rh).The deconvolution has bigger uncertainty in this case compared to the clean, protonated titanate nanotubes and the Rh(III) salt containing materials due to the high overlapping, hence the bandgap energy has bigger error, too.The new broad band has a maximum at 3.06 eV (405 nm) Fig.4. Of the noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru and Rh), a theoretical study found that only Rh has a strong UV plasmonic response 59, it was supported experimentally, too 60.Considering only the representative nanoparticle size and shape model with random orientations, the theoretically predicted peak for the dipolar mode in the tripod plane near 3.3 eV (375 nm) is in good agreement with the exper- imental data obtained on silicon substrate 61.We assume that the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) strongly depends on the nature of substrate and the resonant energy increasingly redshifted with increasing size.The observed broad band centered at 3.06 eV contains the plasmonic character of Rh on titanate nanotubes. Photocatalytic measurements revealed that methane is active towards photo-oxidation in all cases even if no other reactants are present in the feed mixture.Table 1 shows the average and maximal formation rates of the identified products and the methane conversion values.Both titanate supported catalysts exhibited one order of magnitude higher activity in methane conversion than pristine nanotubes.The Au/TiO 2 showed smaller activity in methane transformation than the nanotube supported variant. Generally the methane transforms to hydrogen, ethane, and oxidizes to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methanol.Fig. 5 shows the conversion of methane and the formation of products as a function of irradiation time. As can be seen the molar fraction of the products are increasing while the quantity of methane decreases during the UV-active sections.Decreasing in the molar fractions with time can be observed in the case of Rh/TNT.This drop is restricted to the UV active periods and is the consequence of activity loss.In the case of Au/TNT no activity loss was observed in the experiment.We can state that the supported metal catalysts are extremely active in hydrogen generation.The contribution of ethane to the hydrogen rates is small in these cases so our main process should be some kind of methane decomposition where the carbon highly oxidizes or it remains on the surface.It is important to emphasize that the formation of water was not detected, or more precisely, the rate of water formation was under the detection limit.The carbon balance ( C ) was calculated from the average formation rates by Eq. ( 1). C is positive and large in the cases of TNT supported metals which means that some carbon is missing from the product stream.Its reason can be an undetected product or some kind of surface deposit.It is important to note that the nano sized gold catalyst (Au/TNT) has higher activity in ethane generation because the rates are increased by one order of magnitude compared to the other catalysts.The introduction of carbon dioxide into the reactant stream did not result significant effects on the rates.The conversion of CO 2 was under our detection limit except one case where CO 2 was formed despite its high basic concentration.We could deduce that CO 2 is rather forms than diminishes in these cases. In the photo-induced CH 4 decomposition process CO 2 and CO (also C) appeared as products so there should be an oxygen source in the system.In the case of titanate nanotubes water is a plausible reaction partner which serves the oxygen reacting with methyl radical.It was already established that titanate nanotubes contain a large amount of H 2 O 28,34,62.We have identified adsorbed and lattice water in our XPS, DRIFTS and DTG-MS experiments.The OH and H 2 O stretching vibrations between 3000 and 3750 cm -1 could be detected up to 673 K on titanate nanotubes.The OH and H 2 O deformation signal at 1618-1648 cm -1 was present up to 600-700 K. Interestingly, a very week asymmetric infrared signal attributed to H 2 O around 3730 cm -1 was detected even at 773 K on nanotubes.An \"OH\" like photoemission emerged at 532.6-532.8eV in the O1 s XP spectrum.This peak disappeared at 573 K on nanowires while on nanotubes this emission diminished only above 673 K.In agreement with the IR and DTG-MS results the peak corresponding to water decreased sharply between 293 and 573 K. Our hypothesis that water acts as an oxygen source for methane oxidation gained strength when we introduced water instead of carbon dioxide into the reactant stream: Not only the methane consumption but also the formation rates of H 2 , CO 2 and CO and the quantity of the missing carbon were increased. One blank experiment was conducted in order to make sure that the products are not originates from surface contaminations.When only water is present on argon, no methane, ethane or hydrogen formation were observed.Only traces amount of CO 2 was evolved.This means that the products detected on the other experiments originates from the reactants. Fig. 6 shows the infrared spectra registered after one hour irradiation in the methane conversion and CH 4 CO 2 reactions performed over TNT and Rh/TNT catalysts.Peaks evolved partly due to the adsorption of reactants or products and partly due to the irradiation of the sample.The adsorption of water as reactant or contamination results in the appearance of a peak at 1638 cm -1 and a broad band between 2700 and 3700 cm -1 .The carbon dioxide adsorption resulted in strong peaks at 1558 and 1375 cm -1 which can be attributed to bidentate carbonates which bind to the surface of titanate nanotubes 63,64.The carbonate peaks have higher intensity when CO 2 is present in the feed.The remaining small peaks are the results of UV irradiation.The bands at 2968 and 2885 cm -1 are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of methyl groups on Rh surface 65.The methyl group may bond to the titanate via an O-bond forming methoxy but the s (C O) vibration mode which should appear at around 1050 cm -1 on metal-oxides 64 was not detected in our case.The deformation mode of methyl vibration at around 1350 cm -1 is possibly hidden by overlapping signals in our case 65.Physisorbed carbon dioxide can be identified at 2337 cm -1 .The Rh-bonded linear carbon-monoxide resulted in a peak at 2100 cm -1 on partially oxidized Rh, whereas bridged CO appeared at 1924 cm -1 666768.The peak at 2141 cm -1 represents the theoretical vibration energy of gas phase CO which is physisorbed on the surface like the carbon dioxide in our case.The physisorption of CO and CO 2 was not observed previously on the fresh catalysts so we can assume that some changes are occurred on the surface during the photo-induced reaction. During photo illumination a shoulder appeared at 1664 cm -1 in the CH 4 decomposition and in the CH 4 CO 2 reaction on pristine TNT.This band can be attributed to adsorbed formyl group 69 which forms in the reaction.Monodentate formate can be also identified from the bands at 1585 and 1384 cm -1 66,70.The absorption band of formyl is missing when metal is present.Very probably this intermediate is highly instable and the metal catalyses its further reaction to form CO. Monodentate formate is present in all cases which mean that its further reaction is slow. We performed Raman spectroscopy measurements in order to get information about the structure of the surface deposits discussed in the previous section.The Raman spectra are plotted in Fig. 7. Absorption bands appeared only in the 1800-100 cm -1 region.The absorption bands were located at the same wavenumbers in both cases.Only the area of the bands differs.The bands at 1598 and 1335 cm -1 correspond to the G and D bands of structured carbon layers such as graphene 71.The D and D bands at around 1620 and 1100 cm -1 were not observed.The intensity of the D band is high relative to the G band which means high defect density in the graphene plane.This peak ratio is common in the case of multiwalled carbon nanotubes.We can conclude that structured carbon with high defect density formed on the surface during methane conversion.The remaining bands in the Raman spectra belong to the titanate nanotube 34,72. High resolution XP spectra were collected in the binding energy range of carbon 1 s and rhodium 3d orbitals in order to investigate the oxidation states of these elements (Fig. 8).The Rh 3d 5/2 -3d 3/2 doublet has a shoulder at higher binding energies.The 307.3 eV peak for 3d 5/2 can be identified as Rh 0 whereas the high energy shoulder at 309.4 eV is characteristic for Rh 3 .This assignation is in accordance with the infrared spectroscopy results mentioned previously because the infrared absorption at 2100 cm -1 corresponds to carbon monoxide bonded to oxidized rhodium.The colour change of the catalyst from dark grey to brownish grey was experienced under irradiation which is the sign of re-oxidation too.The higher binding energy state of Rh 3d electrons may correspond to smaller Rh-cluster sizes on the other hand and is a consequence of the final state effect which is more dominant in the case of catalysts with less than 2 metal content 28.O 1 s at 530.4 eV represents the lattice oxygen of TNT.The photoemission peak at 532.7 eV involves CO, methoxy and carbonate like species formed during photoreaction.Adsorbed H 2 O appears at 534.9 eV 34. We could identify 3 peaks in the carbon 1 s region which correspond to different oxidation states: The peak at 286.7 eV is the characteristic binding energy for the C O and C O carbons.It can originate from the carbon-monoxide chemisorbed by Rh particles which is already revealed by infrared spectroscopy.The peak at 284.4 eV corresponds to sp 2 hybrid state carbon (C, CH and CH 2 ) which confirms the presence of structural carbon concluded from Raman results.The peak at 282.2 eV belongs to reduced carbon which means metal-carbon bonds.It means that the carbon deposits are sitting on the surface of Rh particles 73.An additional C 1 s spectrum is plotted in Fig. 8 from a freshly reduced Rh/TNT catalyst had not been used in photocatalytic reaction yet.It can be seen that the carbon content is much lower in this case than after reaction.sp 2 carbon at 284.5 eV and oxidized carbon originates from carbonates at 289.7 eV can be identified. Temperature programmed reduction experiments were carried out to investigate the quantity and the reactivity of the surface carbon assumed to be formed during the photocatalytic reactions.Two experiments were carried out on the Rh/TNT used in the CH 4 H 2 O and in the CH 4 CO 2 reactions.Two blank experiments were carried out additionally to make sure from the source of the surface carbon. No methane formation was observed at all in the first blank experiment where fresh Rh/TNT was heated up in hydrogen flow.Only trace amount of carbon dioxide was detected.This means that the freshly pretreated sample is free of reducible surface carbon.On the other hand small amount of methane formed in the second blank experiment where the catalyst was treated in methane flow for 1 h at 403 K before the TPR experiment.The formation of a large amount of methane was detected during the measurements made on the used catalysts.Casually, the formation of some ethane and the desorption of carbon-dioxide was observed in these cases.The appearance of methane and ethane is the result of the in-situ reduction of carbon containing surface deposits formed during the photocatalytic reactions.The source of the carbon dioxide is the surface carbonate or hydrogen carbonate species which decompose without reduction as the temperature rises.The formation rate of methane was calculated in all cases and was plotted against temperature in Fig. 9. The maximum of the methane formation rate occurred at the same temperature meaning that the reactivity of the surface carbon equals in all cases.The methane-water reaction resulted in more surface carbon which corresponds with larger photocatalytic methane conversions observed in this case (not shown).The time integral of the TPR curves gives us the overall formed methane related to catalyst quantity which is 354 mol/g and 528 mol/g for the used catalysts respectively.The 354 mol/g value is in good agreement with the calculated carbon deficit already showed in Table 1.because the matching is within the margin of error.38 mol/g methane formed in the blank experiment which is one order of magnitude smaller than in the other cases.We can conclude that the missing carbon is on the surface in the form of some kind of easily reducible carbon containing deposit. We can establish the mechanism of methane transformation on the basis of the previous conclusions.Electron-hole pairs were generated on metal (gold or rhodium) promoted titanate nanotubes upon absorption of UV-light irradiation Eq.( 2 After the dissociation of the exciton described by Eq. ( 3) the electron and the hole starts to migrate to the energetically favorable positions.Electrons have higher possibility to be found on the metal particles Eq.( 4). due to Fermi-level equilibration which appears between the metal and the oxide 74. TNT e - M e - In the case of continuous irradiation this process results in a potential difference that builds up between the metal and the oxide hence an additional drift current starts in the reverse direction.The charge separation reaches an equilibrium controlled by the diffusion and drift currents and strongly depends on the rates of charge carrier generation and recombination. Surface water molecules can catch the hole and produce reactive OH-radical and H which delocalises on the nearby water molecules Eq.( 5).Hydroxide radical can form from hydroxide ion, too, by the same process Eq.( 6). TNT h The as generated hydroxide radicals are very aggressive oxidants and start to oxidize methane in a radical-type reaction Eq.(7).The formed methyl radical adsorbs on the metal surface.(7) We can not exclude that methane directly reacting with holes results in methyl radicals on the titanate surface Eq.(8). The further reaction route is determined by the nature of the metal.It is generally accepted that the coupling of methyl radicals is favoured on gold 75 Eq.( 9), while the dehydrogenation process rather occurs on rhodium 63 Eq.(10). Gas phase hydrogen forms in the following coupling reaction eq.( 11): The recombination of a methyl and hydrogen radical also has to be considered eq.(12) Hydrogen radical can form from H , too, by the capture of a photoelectron at the metal-support interface: The source of the surplus CO can be mostly the reduction of carbon dioxide.During the reduction process photoelectrons and hydrogen ions brings about the CO 2 reduction via CO 2 radical anion: TNT e - CO 2(TNT) TNT CO -2(TNT) (15) TNT e - CO - Consequently both CH 4 and CO 2 are first adsorbed over the catalyst surface and then converted to CH 3 and CO 2 species.TiO 2 19 and modified TiO 2 nanocomposites 12 are also active in CO 2 photo induced activation but the presence of metal adatoms (Au or Rh) significantly increases the speed of the activation processes.Monodentate formate can form from carboxylate radical anion and hydrogen ion Eq.( 17): The formation of oxygen containing compounds can be explained by the following equations: Methanol is formed by a coupling reaction Eq.(18) on the perimeter of the metal-support interface then it recombines with a hole to oxidize further Eq.( 19). TNT h Formaldehyde most probably form on the support as concluded from infrared results Eq.( 20) but metal is needed for its further reactions Eqs.( 21)-( 22). CHO It is remarkable that there are many routes in which hydrogen is formed.As a consequence the main product of the photo-induced methane transformation is the hydrogen. The pristine titanate nanotubes showed measurable photocatalytic activity since the time scale of electron-hole recombination is commensurate with the redox reaction.In this process the increase amount of defects (Ti 3 and oxygen deficient) in titanates play also a significant role 34,76,77.Modification of the optical and electronic properties of TiO 2 results in not only the reduction of the band width via the incorporation of additional energy levels but increased lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes via effective charge carrier separation and supresson of electron-hole recombination 20.This is valid for titanate nanotubes, too.UV irradiation induces Fermi level equilibration between TiO 2 and Au via charge distribution and thereby Fermi level shift by around -22 mV 74,78.Such Fermi level shift increases the number of more reductive electrons on the metal and promotes efficient photocatalytic reaction.As we discussed above this mechanism could play a significant role in our photo-induced reactions in the CO 2methane system on titanate nanotubes modified with Au and Rh nanoparticles. The nanoparticles of Au (and some other metals) are coupled to TiO 2 (including titanate nanorods) to utilize their property of localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) in photocatalysis 42,79808182. LSPR is the collective free electron charge oscillation in the metallic nanoparticles that are excited by light 83.This phenomenon usually occurs in nanoparticles (3 nm), and strongly depends on the particle size, shape and local dielectric environment 80.During light irradiation, the electron transfer from the photoexcited Au nanoparticles to the TiO 2 conduction band may occur.The other scenario is also plausible, namely; electrons excited from metal transfer to reactant molecules.Such kind of Au mediated reduction of C 60 was demonstrated 74. We believe that similar Au and Rh mediated photo-assisted reaction occurs in CO 2 activation Eq.( 14) in the CH 4 H 2 O and CH 4 CO 2 reactions on titanate nanotubes.As it is demonstrated in Table 1 the gold containing titanate nanotubes exhibit significantly higher photocatalytic activity than Au/TiO 2 (anatase), though the pure titanate nanotubes alone do not show high activity.The intensity of plasmon absorption (at 2.31 eV) was higher on Au/TNT than on Au/TiO 2 (Fig. 4).Consequently, the electron transfer from the metal to the reactants is more favorable.It should be noted that the LSPR-induced photo effects are significantly influenced by the properties of TiO 2 (size, shape, surface area, crystallinity) 80.We believe that the titanate nanostructures have a positive feature to localize the metal nanoparticles in this point of view. The other important observation is that titanate nanotubes can stabilize gold (and also Rh) in small sizes, below 3 nm (Figs. 2 and3).In such dimension the plasmonic feature (LSPR) does not operate.At the same time multiple molecular-like transitions of the gold cluster was observed by UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 4).The intensities of these types of transitions were also significantly higher on titanate nanotubes.As we have already discussed above, the small metal clusters can strongly bond to the defect sites in titanate nanotubes.These clusters may be directly involved in the photo-induced reactions.The molecular-like clusters may form complexes with the reactants where the electron transfer directly occurs during UV irradiation. In the light of the possible photocatalytic mechanisms it seems that the types of interaction between metal and substrate (titanates) play important role.From this respect the long-range and short range interactions should be taken into account 84.While there is no significant bandgap decrease due to the metal adatoms, the Au and Rh changes the band gap population and shifting of the Fermi level.Such Fermi level shift increases the number of electrons on the metal and promotes efficient photocatalytic reaction.This shift is a consequence of charge transfer between the metal and support 48,84.Besides of this long-range interaction, short-range interaction, affecting the atoms or atom clusters (for example Au 25 in present case) at the gas-metal-support interface, could be more important.The short-range interaction can be considered as a consequence of the strong electric fields, which are present at the interface. Finally we calculated photo-conversion efficiencies from the amount of hydrogen formed in each photo-induced reactions (Table .1).The calculated values are rather low.It is well-known that the complicated charge-carrier dynamics and surface reaction kinetics mainly lead to the low quantum efficiency in the multi-step processes of heterogeneous photocatalysis 85.The suitable thermodynamic properties (including bandgaps and CB/CV levels) do not guarantee good photocatalytic efficiency.It is commonly accepted that the mechanism governing heterogeneous photocatalysis consists of four consecutive tandem steps; (1) light harvesting, (2) charge excitation/separation, (3) charge migration, transport and recombination, and (4) charge utilization 86.Therefore, the overall photocatalysis efficiency is strongly dependent on the cumulative effects of these four consecutive steps."}, {"llm generation": "Au nanoparticles on anatase TiO2 (Au/TiO2)", "source": "For comparison we prepared Au nanoparticles on anatase TiO 2 (Hombikat UV-100).", "context": "Protonated titanate nanotubes decorated with gold nanoparticles were characterized by XPS.The XP-spectrum taken in the gold 4f binding energy range is presented in Fig. 2.

Two different explanations can be offered for the appearance of this unusually high binding energy gold state as we discussed previously 25.Core level shifts due to particle size must be considered first in the interpretation of the spectra of nanoparticles 43444546.The second possible explanation is that Au may have undergone an ion exchange process.This is not possible on TiO 2 because of the lack of cations compensating the framework charge, however, it is quite likely to happen on titanates which are well-known for their ion-exchange ability 47. TEM image on Fig. 3/A demonstrates the tubular morphology of the as-synthesized titanate nanotubes with a diameter of 7 nm and length up to 80 nm.The acidic washing process resulted in a mild destruction of the inner and outer walls of the nanotubes.The size of Au nanoparticles was between 2.0 and 8.0 nm on the H-form titanate nanotubes (Fig. 3/B).The Au particle sizes was determined by XRD, too.The average size was 5.3 nm calculated from the Scherrer equation.The TEM image of Rh decorated nanotubes and nanowires show the presence of homogeneously dispersed nanoparticles on the surface of titanate nanostructures (Fig. 3/C).The particle size distribution of Rh on TNT was calculated from TEM and resulted in 2.8 nm as the most abundant particle diameter.As small as 1 nm sized metal particles were detected too in this sample.Particles with diameters bigger than 5 nm were not observed.Unfortunately we could not observe peaks for Rh crystals in the XRD spectra probably due to low concentration of particles.We may also assume that certain part of Rh underwent ion exchange process 34.In our previous studies we observed that Au and also Rh catalyses the transformation of tube structure to nano anatase above 473 K and 573 K, respectively 32,34.In present cases the temperature of preparation and the photocatalytic test experiments are much lower. The Rh 3d 5/2 peak at 309.3 eV at 1 Rh content and at 308.3 eV at 2 metal content clearly suggest the existence of an oxidation state or morphology that is different from the bulk because the binding energy of the Rh 3d 5/2 electrons is about 307.1 eV for metallic Rh.The higher binding energy states may correspond to very small clusters stabilized in the structure of nanowires and nanotubes.The stabilization of Rh clusters in small size and the influence of Rh nanoparticles on the transformation of titanate structures can be explained also by the electronic interaction between Rh and titanate, which was observed in several cases between reduced titania and metals, including Rh 48495051. Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra of six different samples, including Au and Rh loaded titanate nanotubes. The pure titanate nanotube showed strong absorption at 3.53 eV (351 nm wavelength) in these experiments.The calculated bandgap energy from the Tauc plot is 3.07 eV.This value was 3.03 eV for pure anatase Fig.4.The reduction of AuCl 4 with NaBH 4 yields 1 or 2.5 wt Au on the surface.The bandgap of 1 wt Au/TNT slightly decreased (3.03 eV).No further significant change was observed at 2.5 wt Au content.This change was less than in the case of titanate nanowires supported Au produced in a similar way 32.The spectrum of the Au/TNT shows a strong absorption band at 2.31 eV (534 nm).This is the characteristic absorption of the surface plasmon of gold nanoparticles (d 3 nm) and arises as a result of the collective modes of oscillation of the free conduction band electrons induced by an interacting electromagnetic field 525354.Interestingly, the spectrum shows some unresolved peaks at higher energies.After deconvolution we can identify three absorptions at 2.68, 2.93, and 3.19 eV.We should emphasize for the sake of identification that small gold nanoparticles (d 3 nm) lose their bulk-like electronic properties; for example, they no longer show the plasmon excitation characteristics of relatively large gold nanocrystals 53,54.It has been demonstrated by XPS and HRTEM measurements that our titanate nanotube samples contain gold in small sizes (d 3 nm), too Figs.2 and3.Recently a multiple molecularlike transition of a thiol-protected Au 25 cluster was observed.At least three well-defined bands at 1.8, 2.75, and 3.1 eV were detected by UV-vis spectroscopy 53.Very recently a similar Au 25 cluster was identified on CeO 2 rod catalyst.It was considered that CeO 2 rods have a large amount of defect sites 555657 and if loading of Au 25 (SR) 18 nanoclusters is very low, one can reasonably expect that the rod support may be helpful to anchor the gold nanoclusters 58.As it was pointed out in previous works 22,25,27,32,34,40 the titanate nanotubes also contain a huge amount of defects and the small clusters and particles of gold can grow on the outer shell and in the inside of the tubes.Furthermore, the cluster coalescence could be prevented because the defects in titanate nanotubes were found helpful for strong bonding with metal nanoparticles 32.For comparison we prepared Au nanoparticles on anatase TiO 2 (Hombikat UV-100).In this case the intensity of plasmonic character was less and the molecular-like feature was hardly seen after deconvo-luting the UV-vis spectrum Fig.4.The ratio of the peak areas of molecular-like bands and the plasmonic band is 0.28 in the case of anatase support and is 0.36 for nanotube support.From this comparison we may conclude that titanate nanotubes have the ability to stabilize the small particles even in cluster size formation, similar to CeO 2 rod catalyst. After impregnating the titanate nanotubes with rhodiumchloride solution two new very weak bands appeared at 2.52 and 3.07 eV (492 and 404 nm, respectively).The Rh(III) salt has an effect of slightly decreasing the bandgap possibly due to the infiltration of rhodium ions into the titanate structure.The bandgap is slightly decreased in the case of 1 Rh/TNT to 3.04 eV compared to pure nanotube (3.07 eV) but does not changed at 2.5 rhodium content (not shown).A strong absorption in the visible region emerged due to reduction Fig.4.On the reduced samples the band gap does not decreased at all (3.08 eV for 1 Rh and 3.16 eV of 2.5 Rh).The deconvolution has bigger uncertainty in this case compared to the clean, protonated titanate nanotubes and the Rh(III) salt containing materials due to the high overlapping, hence the bandgap energy has bigger error, too.The new broad band has a maximum at 3.06 eV (405 nm) Fig.4. Of the noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru and Rh), a theoretical study found that only Rh has a strong UV plasmonic response 59, it was supported experimentally, too 60.Considering only the representative nanoparticle size and shape model with random orientations, the theoretically predicted peak for the dipolar mode in the tripod plane near 3.3 eV (375 nm) is in good agreement with the exper- imental data obtained on silicon substrate 61.We assume that the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) strongly depends on the nature of substrate and the resonant energy increasingly redshifted with increasing size.The observed broad band centered at 3.06 eV contains the plasmonic character of Rh on titanate nanotubes. Photocatalytic measurements revealed that methane is active towards photo-oxidation in all cases even if no other reactants are present in the feed mixture.Table 1 shows the average and maximal formation rates of the identified products and the methane conversion values.Both titanate supported catalysts exhibited one order of magnitude higher activity in methane conversion than pristine nanotubes.The Au/TiO 2 showed smaller activity in methane transformation than the nanotube supported variant. Generally the methane transforms to hydrogen, ethane, and oxidizes to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methanol.Fig. 5 shows the conversion of methane and the formation of products as a function of irradiation time. As can be seen the molar fraction of the products are increasing while the quantity of methane decreases during the UV-active sections.Decreasing in the molar fractions with time can be observed in the case of Rh/TNT.This drop is restricted to the UV active periods and is the consequence of activity loss.In the case of Au/TNT no activity loss was observed in the experiment.We can state that the supported metal catalysts are extremely active in hydrogen generation.The contribution of ethane to the hydrogen rates is small in these cases so our main process should be some kind of methane decomposition where the carbon highly oxidizes or it remains on the surface.It is important to emphasize that the formation of water was not detected, or more precisely, the rate of water formation was under the detection limit.The carbon balance ( C ) was calculated from the average formation rates by Eq. ( 1). C is positive and large in the cases of TNT supported metals which means that some carbon is missing from the product stream.Its reason can be an undetected product or some kind of surface deposit.It is important to note that the nano sized gold catalyst (Au/TNT) has higher activity in ethane generation because the rates are increased by one order of magnitude compared to the other catalysts.The introduction of carbon dioxide into the reactant stream did not result significant effects on the rates.The conversion of CO 2 was under our detection limit except one case where CO 2 was formed despite its high basic concentration.We could deduce that CO 2 is rather forms than diminishes in these cases. In the photo-induced CH 4 decomposition process CO 2 and CO (also C) appeared as products so there should be an oxygen source in the system.In the case of titanate nanotubes water is a plausible reaction partner which serves the oxygen reacting with methyl radical.It was already established that titanate nanotubes contain a large amount of H 2 O 28,34,62.We have identified adsorbed and lattice water in our XPS, DRIFTS and DTG-MS experiments.The OH and H 2 O stretching vibrations between 3000 and 3750 cm -1 could be detected up to 673 K on titanate nanotubes.The OH and H 2 O deformation signal at 1618-1648 cm -1 was present up to 600-700 K. Interestingly, a very week asymmetric infrared signal attributed to H 2 O around 3730 cm -1 was detected even at 773 K on nanotubes.An \"OH\" like photoemission emerged at 532.6-532.8eV in the O1 s XP spectrum.This peak disappeared at 573 K on nanowires while on nanotubes this emission diminished only above 673 K.In agreement with the IR and DTG-MS results the peak corresponding to water decreased sharply between 293 and 573 K. Our hypothesis that water acts as an oxygen source for methane oxidation gained strength when we introduced water instead of carbon dioxide into the reactant stream: Not only the methane consumption but also the formation rates of H 2 , CO 2 and CO and the quantity of the missing carbon were increased. One blank experiment was conducted in order to make sure that the products are not originates from surface contaminations.When only water is present on argon, no methane, ethane or hydrogen formation were observed.Only traces amount of CO 2 was evolved.This means that the products detected on the other experiments originates from the reactants. Fig. 6 shows the infrared spectra registered after one hour irradiation in the methane conversion and CH 4 CO 2 reactions performed over TNT and Rh/TNT catalysts.Peaks evolved partly due to the adsorption of reactants or products and partly due to the irradiation of the sample.The adsorption of water as reactant or contamination results in the appearance of a peak at 1638 cm -1 and a broad band between 2700 and 3700 cm -1 .The carbon dioxide adsorption resulted in strong peaks at 1558 and 1375 cm -1 which can be attributed to bidentate carbonates which bind to the surface of titanate nanotubes 63,64.The carbonate peaks have higher intensity when CO 2 is present in the feed.The remaining small peaks are the results of UV irradiation.The bands at 2968 and 2885 cm -1 are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of methyl groups on Rh surface 65.The methyl group may bond to the titanate via an O-bond forming methoxy but the s (C O) vibration mode which should appear at around 1050 cm -1 on metal-oxides 64 was not detected in our case.The deformation mode of methyl vibration at around 1350 cm -1 is possibly hidden by overlapping signals in our case 65.Physisorbed carbon dioxide can be identified at 2337 cm -1 .The Rh-bonded linear carbon-monoxide resulted in a peak at 2100 cm -1 on partially oxidized Rh, whereas bridged CO appeared at 1924 cm -1 666768.The peak at 2141 cm -1 represents the theoretical vibration energy of gas phase CO which is physisorbed on the surface like the carbon dioxide in our case.The physisorption of CO and CO 2 was not observed previously on the fresh catalysts so we can assume that some changes are occurred on the surface during the photo-induced reaction. During photo illumination a shoulder appeared at 1664 cm -1 in the CH 4 decomposition and in the CH 4 CO 2 reaction on pristine TNT.This band can be attributed to adsorbed formyl group 69 which forms in the reaction.Monodentate formate can be also identified from the bands at 1585 and 1384 cm -1 66,70.The absorption band of formyl is missing when metal is present.Very probably this intermediate is highly instable and the metal catalyses its further reaction to form CO. Monodentate formate is present in all cases which mean that its further reaction is slow. We performed Raman spectroscopy measurements in order to get information about the structure of the surface deposits discussed in the previous section.The Raman spectra are plotted in Fig. 7. Absorption bands appeared only in the 1800-100 cm -1 region.The absorption bands were located at the same wavenumbers in both cases.Only the area of the bands differs.The bands at 1598 and 1335 cm -1 correspond to the G and D bands of structured carbon layers such as graphene 71.The D and D bands at around 1620 and 1100 cm -1 were not observed.The intensity of the D band is high relative to the G band which means high defect density in the graphene plane.This peak ratio is common in the case of multiwalled carbon nanotubes.We can conclude that structured carbon with high defect density formed on the surface during methane conversion.The remaining bands in the Raman spectra belong to the titanate nanotube 34,72. High resolution XP spectra were collected in the binding energy range of carbon 1 s and rhodium 3d orbitals in order to investigate the oxidation states of these elements (Fig. 8).The Rh 3d 5/2 -3d 3/2 doublet has a shoulder at higher binding energies.The 307.3 eV peak for 3d 5/2 can be identified as Rh 0 whereas the high energy shoulder at 309.4 eV is characteristic for Rh 3 .This assignation is in accordance with the infrared spectroscopy results mentioned previously because the infrared absorption at 2100 cm -1 corresponds to carbon monoxide bonded to oxidized rhodium.The colour change of the catalyst from dark grey to brownish grey was experienced under irradiation which is the sign of re-oxidation too.The higher binding energy state of Rh 3d electrons may correspond to smaller Rh-cluster sizes on the other hand and is a consequence of the final state effect which is more dominant in the case of catalysts with less than 2 metal content 28.O 1 s at 530.4 eV represents the lattice oxygen of TNT.The photoemission peak at 532.7 eV involves CO, methoxy and carbonate like species formed during photoreaction.Adsorbed H 2 O appears at 534.9 eV 34. We could identify 3 peaks in the carbon 1 s region which correspond to different oxidation states: The peak at 286.7 eV is the characteristic binding energy for the C O and C O carbons.It can originate from the carbon-monoxide chemisorbed by Rh particles which is already revealed by infrared spectroscopy.The peak at 284.4 eV corresponds to sp 2 hybrid state carbon (C, CH and CH 2 ) which confirms the presence of structural carbon concluded from Raman results.The peak at 282.2 eV belongs to reduced carbon which means metal-carbon bonds.It means that the carbon deposits are sitting on the surface of Rh particles 73.An additional C 1 s spectrum is plotted in Fig. 8 from a freshly reduced Rh/TNT catalyst had not been used in photocatalytic reaction yet.It can be seen that the carbon content is much lower in this case than after reaction.sp 2 carbon at 284.5 eV and oxidized carbon originates from carbonates at 289.7 eV can be identified. Temperature programmed reduction experiments were carried out to investigate the quantity and the reactivity of the surface carbon assumed to be formed during the photocatalytic reactions.Two experiments were carried out on the Rh/TNT used in the CH 4 H 2 O and in the CH 4 CO 2 reactions.Two blank experiments were carried out additionally to make sure from the source of the surface carbon. No methane formation was observed at all in the first blank experiment where fresh Rh/TNT was heated up in hydrogen flow.Only trace amount of carbon dioxide was detected.This means that the freshly pretreated sample is free of reducible surface carbon.On the other hand small amount of methane formed in the second blank experiment where the catalyst was treated in methane flow for 1 h at 403 K before the TPR experiment.The formation of a large amount of methane was detected during the measurements made on the used catalysts.Casually, the formation of some ethane and the desorption of carbon-dioxide was observed in these cases.The appearance of methane and ethane is the result of the in-situ reduction of carbon containing surface deposits formed during the photocatalytic reactions.The source of the carbon dioxide is the surface carbonate or hydrogen carbonate species which decompose without reduction as the temperature rises.The formation rate of methane was calculated in all cases and was plotted against temperature in Fig. 9. The maximum of the methane formation rate occurred at the same temperature meaning that the reactivity of the surface carbon equals in all cases.The methane-water reaction resulted in more surface carbon which corresponds with larger photocatalytic methane conversions observed in this case (not shown).The time integral of the TPR curves gives us the overall formed methane related to catalyst quantity which is 354 mol/g and 528 mol/g for the used catalysts respectively.The 354 mol/g value is in good agreement with the calculated carbon deficit already showed in Table 1.because the matching is within the margin of error.38 mol/g methane formed in the blank experiment which is one order of magnitude smaller than in the other cases.We can conclude that the missing carbon is on the surface in the form of some kind of easily reducible carbon containing deposit. We can establish the mechanism of methane transformation on the basis of the previous conclusions.Electron-hole pairs were generated on metal (gold or rhodium) promoted titanate nanotubes upon absorption of UV-light irradiation Eq.( 2 After the dissociation of the exciton described by Eq. ( 3) the electron and the hole starts to migrate to the energetically favorable positions.Electrons have higher possibility to be found on the metal particles Eq.( 4). due to Fermi-level equilibration which appears between the metal and the oxide 74. TNT e - M e - In the case of continuous irradiation this process results in a potential difference that builds up between the metal and the oxide hence an additional drift current starts in the reverse direction.The charge separation reaches an equilibrium controlled by the diffusion and drift currents and strongly depends on the rates of charge carrier generation and recombination. Surface water molecules can catch the hole and produce reactive OH-radical and H which delocalises on the nearby water molecules Eq.( 5).Hydroxide radical can form from hydroxide ion, too, by the same process Eq.( 6). TNT h The as generated hydroxide radicals are very aggressive oxidants and start to oxidize methane in a radical-type reaction Eq.(7).The formed methyl radical adsorbs on the metal surface.(7) We can not exclude that methane directly reacting with holes results in methyl radicals on the titanate surface Eq.(8). The further reaction route is determined by the nature of the metal.It is generally accepted that the coupling of methyl radicals is favoured on gold 75 Eq.( 9), while the dehydrogenation process rather occurs on rhodium 63 Eq.(10). Gas phase hydrogen forms in the following coupling reaction eq.( 11): The recombination of a methyl and hydrogen radical also has to be considered eq.(12) Hydrogen radical can form from H , too, by the capture of a photoelectron at the metal-support interface: The source of the surplus CO can be mostly the reduction of carbon dioxide.During the reduction process photoelectrons and hydrogen ions brings about the CO 2 reduction via CO 2 radical anion: TNT e - CO 2(TNT) TNT CO -2(TNT) (15) TNT e - CO - Consequently both CH 4 and CO 2 are first adsorbed over the catalyst surface and then converted to CH 3 and CO 2 species.TiO 2 19 and modified TiO 2 nanocomposites 12 are also active in CO 2 photo induced activation but the presence of metal adatoms (Au or Rh) significantly increases the speed of the activation processes.Monodentate formate can form from carboxylate radical anion and hydrogen ion Eq.( 17): The formation of oxygen containing compounds can be explained by the following equations: Methanol is formed by a coupling reaction Eq.(18) on the perimeter of the metal-support interface then it recombines with a hole to oxidize further Eq.( 19). TNT h Formaldehyde most probably form on the support as concluded from infrared results Eq.( 20) but metal is needed for its further reactions Eqs.( 21)-( 22). CHO It is remarkable that there are many routes in which hydrogen is formed.As a consequence the main product of the photo-induced methane transformation is the hydrogen. The pristine titanate nanotubes showed measurable photocatalytic activity since the time scale of electron-hole recombination is commensurate with the redox reaction.In this process the increase amount of defects (Ti 3 and oxygen deficient) in titanates play also a significant role 34,76,77.Modification of the optical and electronic properties of TiO 2 results in not only the reduction of the band width via the incorporation of additional energy levels but increased lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes via effective charge carrier separation and supresson of electron-hole recombination 20.This is valid for titanate nanotubes, too.UV irradiation induces Fermi level equilibration between TiO 2 and Au via charge distribution and thereby Fermi level shift by around -22 mV 74,78.Such Fermi level shift increases the number of more reductive electrons on the metal and promotes efficient photocatalytic reaction.As we discussed above this mechanism could play a significant role in our photo-induced reactions in the CO 2methane system on titanate nanotubes modified with Au and Rh nanoparticles. The nanoparticles of Au (and some other metals) are coupled to TiO 2 (including titanate nanorods) to utilize their property of localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) in photocatalysis 42,79808182. LSPR is the collective free electron charge oscillation in the metallic nanoparticles that are excited by light 83.This phenomenon usually occurs in nanoparticles (3 nm), and strongly depends on the particle size, shape and local dielectric environment 80.During light irradiation, the electron transfer from the photoexcited Au nanoparticles to the TiO 2 conduction band may occur.The other scenario is also plausible, namely; electrons excited from metal transfer to reactant molecules.Such kind of Au mediated reduction of C 60 was demonstrated 74. We believe that similar Au and Rh mediated photo-assisted reaction occurs in CO 2 activation Eq.( 14) in the CH 4 H 2 O and CH 4 CO 2 reactions on titanate nanotubes.As it is demonstrated in Table 1 the gold containing titanate nanotubes exhibit significantly higher photocatalytic activity than Au/TiO 2 (anatase), though the pure titanate nanotubes alone do not show high activity.The intensity of plasmon absorption (at 2.31 eV) was higher on Au/TNT than on Au/TiO 2 (Fig. 4).Consequently, the electron transfer from the metal to the reactants is more favorable.It should be noted that the LSPR-induced photo effects are significantly influenced by the properties of TiO 2 (size, shape, surface area, crystallinity) 80.We believe that the titanate nanostructures have a positive feature to localize the metal nanoparticles in this point of view. The other important observation is that titanate nanotubes can stabilize gold (and also Rh) in small sizes, below 3 nm (Figs. 2 and3).In such dimension the plasmonic feature (LSPR) does not operate.At the same time multiple molecular-like transitions of the gold cluster was observed by UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 4).The intensities of these types of transitions were also significantly higher on titanate nanotubes.As we have already discussed above, the small metal clusters can strongly bond to the defect sites in titanate nanotubes.These clusters may be directly involved in the photo-induced reactions.The molecular-like clusters may form complexes with the reactants where the electron transfer directly occurs during UV irradiation. In the light of the possible photocatalytic mechanisms it seems that the types of interaction between metal and substrate (titanates) play important role.From this respect the long-range and short range interactions should be taken into account 84.While there is no significant bandgap decrease due to the metal adatoms, the Au and Rh changes the band gap population and shifting of the Fermi level.Such Fermi level shift increases the number of electrons on the metal and promotes efficient photocatalytic reaction.This shift is a consequence of charge transfer between the metal and support 48,84.Besides of this long-range interaction, short-range interaction, affecting the atoms or atom clusters (for example Au 25 in present case) at the gas-metal-support interface, could be more important.The short-range interaction can be considered as a consequence of the strong electric fields, which are present at the interface. Finally we calculated photo-conversion efficiencies from the amount of hydrogen formed in each photo-induced reactions (Table .1).The calculated values are rather low.It is well-known that the complicated charge-carrier dynamics and surface reaction kinetics mainly lead to the low quantum efficiency in the multi-step processes of heterogeneous photocatalysis 85.The suitable thermodynamic properties (including bandgaps and CB/CV levels) do not guarantee good photocatalytic efficiency.It is commonly accepted that the mechanism governing heterogeneous photocatalysis consists of four consecutive tandem steps; (1) light harvesting, (2) charge excitation/separation, (3) charge migration, transport and recombination, and (4) charge utilization 86.Therefore, the overall photocatalysis efficiency is strongly dependent on the cumulative effects of these four consecutive steps."}, {"llm generation": "catalysts", "source": "Fig. 6.DRIFT spectra of the catalysts collected after 1 h UV irradiation in two different reactions performed on the TNT based catalysts.", "context": "It was demonstrated in the present study that titanate nanotubes have numerous advantageous properties that play important role in the investigated reactions.It is well known that larger amount of defect sites (Ti 3 and oxygen vacancy) compared to pristine TiO 2 produces more donor levels thus makes the titanates more active in photocatalysis.Surface defect sites can stabilize nearly atomic size metal clusters, too, as we pointed out recently.We verified that the activity of gold in adsorbing molecules is strongly depending on the size of the particles.Even the second step of the photocatalytic reaction, namely the electron transfer, can occur on the gold particles due to the plasmon exciting or the molecular-like electron transitions. Titanate nanotubes basically contain a large amount of water that can not be removed without structure collapse, thus water is always present in the system.We got higher activity in the photocatalytic methane transformation with the addition of surplus water to the system, thus water has a key role in the oxidation reaction.It is important to emphasize that pure TNT was active in the examined reactions, too, but the deposition of nanostructured metal increased the rates with generally one order of magnitude and in the case of hydrogen with two orders of magnitude.We concluded that the presence of metal is important from the point of view hydrogen formation but gold nanoparticles are better for methyl coupling.The source of the surplus CO can be mostly the reduction of carbon dioxide.During the reduction process photoelectrons and hydrogen ions bring about the CO 2 reduction via CO 2 radical anion. Unlike Au/TNT, the activity of the Rh/TNT catalysts significantly decreases over irradiation time.The cause of the decreasing activity of Rh/TNT was a large amount of structured carbon deposit forms during the reactions.We can conclude that Rh is active in methane degradation hence it can stabilize methylene and methine groups.

Titanate nanotubes basically contain a large amount of water that can not be removed without structure collapse, thus water is always present in the system.We got higher activity in the photocatalytic methane transformation with the addition of surplus water to the system, thus water has a key role in the oxidation reaction.It is important to emphasize that pure TNT was active in the examined reactions, too, but the deposition of nanostructured metal increased the rates with generally one order of magnitude and in the case of hydrogen with two orders of magnitude.We concluded that the presence of metal is important from the point of view hydrogen formation but gold nanoparticles are better for methyl coupling.The source of the surplus CO can be mostly the reduction of carbon dioxide.During the reduction process photoelectrons and hydrogen ions bring about the CO 2 reduction via CO 2 radical anion. Unlike Au/TNT, the activity of the Rh/TNT catalysts significantly decreases over irradiation time.The cause of the decreasing activity of Rh/TNT was a large amount of structured carbon deposit forms during the reactions.We can conclude that Rh is active in methane degradation hence it can stabilize methylene and methine groups.
