Hence, the present study demonstrated a promising strategy to use oxygen vacancies rich heterostructure with excellent charge separation efficiency for enhanced photo-activity.

With the inclusion of Cu 2 O into SnS 2 /SnO 2 , the AQY value has increased from 7:16 to 8:62 within first four hours.A higher AQY value means catalyst should exhibit better photoactivity.Notably, the AQY value for pristine Cu 2 O is only 2.82 for four hours reaction time.For eight hours of experiment, the selectivity of CO over CH 4 ( CO CH 4 2:53 in the case of SnS 2 /SnO 2 is relatively higher compared to that of Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 ( CO CH 4 1:4: Comparing the corresponding AQY values and selectivity of CO over CH 4 for assynthesized catalysts, it is evident that Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 could have better reduction properties.Also, this could be attributed to the higher surface area of Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 than that of SnS 2 /SnO 2 , which facilitates vast adsorption of CO 2 on surface of the catalyst see Fig. 2; h is the Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, k is the average wavelength of light source. 74.The formation of N 2 H 4 implies that nitrogen triple bond weakened during the process.Based on the observation of NH 3 and other reaction intermediates, it is apparent that the assynthesized catalysts were effective for activating N N bonds in the presence of H 2 O under UV-vis illumination.Additionally, we also performed the in situ DRIFTS study for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 in the absence of H 2 O, and the results are provided in Fig.S16.Moreover, for a better insight, comparative changes in spectral features using second-order IR derivative spectra d 2 A dk 2 is provided in the range of 1000-4000 cm A1 for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 catalyst, in the presence and absence of H 2 O see Fig.S17.The result suggests that weak IR signals of reaction intermediates such as NH 4 Journal of Colloid and Interface Science xxx (xxxx) xxx The authors are thankful to the Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS) (Department of Atomic Energy), Government of India to provide partial financial support for the present work in the form of Young Scientist Research Award (YSRA project Grant No. 58/20/06/2019-BRNS).S.K. also acknowledges the financial support from Indian Institute of Technology Patna (IIT Patna) for providing instrumental facilities required to perform this work.N.O.and A.B. greatly appreciates IIT Patna for their research fellowships.Authors are also thankful to Dr. Anup K.

Fig. 2 (d,i) shows the XRD pattern for as-synthesized catalysts.XRD peaks of both catalysts can be indexed to SnS 2 (COD id 7038076 and 7038069) and SnO 2 (COD id 1000062).Based on their relative intensities, it appears that SnS 2 is in major content in both catalysts.Importantly, no peaks corresponding to Cu 2 O was observed, owing to their low amount (see Fig. S2, EDS spectrum of Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 ).Nonetheless, an apparent change in the XRD pattern was observed after the addition of Cu 2 O, which could also promote the photocatalytic activity, possibly by varying the surface area.Hence, the BET surface areas were determined via nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms Fig. 2 (e,j).Here, isotherms for all as-synthesized catalysts are alike and can be categorized as type IV with H3 hysteresis loop.The BET surface areas of the SnS 2 / SnO 2 and Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 are 55.8m 2 g A1 and 179.6m 2 g A1 , respectively.The pore-size distribution suggests that both catalysts are mesoporous Fig.S3.Moreover, Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 also showed wider pore sizes.It is likely possible that the used copper precursor could have decomposed to give gaseous vapors and NO x during thermal reduction into metallic copper or Cu 2 O. Consequently, such a process step might generate larger pores on the catalyst surface. The surface chemical composition and oxidation states of elements in as-synthesized catalysts were probed using the XPS technique Fig.3.The survey spectra confirm the presence of Sn, S, and O elements in SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Sn, S, O, and Cu in Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 Fig.S4.In case of SnS 2 /SnO 2 nanocomposites, the Sn3d spectra reveal that the binding energy (486.7 eV) of Sn 3d5/2 lies between those in SnS 2 (486.65 eV) and SnO 2 (486.9 eV) 8 Fig.3 (a) Such mixed states of Sn are suitable to generate additional active centers to promote photocatalytic activity 28.The bonding of S 2A or O 2- with Sn 4 cannot lead to discernable changes in binding energies of Sn3d; which makes it difficult to identify if any chemical bond between SnS 2 and SnO 2 was formed.However, the above XPS results at least verified that the as-synthesized catalyst was composite of SnS 2 and SnO 2 . Further, deconvolution of high-resolution XPS spectra of S2p in SnS 2 /SnO 2 nanocomposite disclosed peaks at 161.7 eV, 163.1 eV and 164.9 eV, corresponding to SnS 2 (S2p 3/2 ), L-cysteine (S2p 3/2 ) and SAS bonds, respectively 29,30 Fig.3 (b).However, for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 , the first two deconvoluted peaks at 161.4 eV (2p 3/2 ), 162.9 eV (2p 1/2 ) can be ascribed to binding energies of SnS 2 31.Moreover, the other two deconvoluted peaks correspond to SAO species (164.6 eV) and sulfate species (168.8 eV) (8.92 of the S 2p total peak area) 21.Comparing the S2p spectra of both samples, a clear shift of 0.3 eV towards lower binding energy can be observed for assigned SnS 2 peak.Such a shift could be due to the weakening of S bond with Sn or S, possibly due to the inclusion of Cu.As is known, Cu has a relatively lower electronegativity value (1.9) in comparison to that of Sn (2.5), S (1.96) or O (3.44).Therefore, in the Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 sample, the electron cloud around S should be denser and as a result, the binding energy of S2p was reduced. The narrow spectrum of O1s in Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 indicates the presence of the first peak at 531.7 eV, which corresponds to oxygen in oxygen-deficient regions of the SnO 2 matrix 32,33 Fig.3 (c).Additionally, surface-adsorbed oxygen of Cu 2 O indicative of existing surface oxygen vacancies could also contribute to the formation of the peak at 531.7 eV 34,35.The second peak at 533.1 eV can be assigned to surface hydroxyl group 36.A high-resolution narrow XPS spectrum for Cu2p in Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 was also acquired and the result is presented in Fig. 3 (d).Two clear main peaks of 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 at 932.1 eV and 952.0 eV, corresponding In this context, we also employed the FTIR technique to understand the chemical structure of as-prepared catalysts see Suppl.presence of characteristic peaks at 545 cm A1 and 625 cm A1, which could be due to stretching vibration of Sn-O and Sn-S bond, respectively 39,40.Moreover, an apparent peak at 468 cm A1 appears for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 sample which can be attributed to the stretching modes of Cu-O vibration 41; this also indicates a possible heterostructure between Cu 2 O and SnS 2 /SnO 2 . The microstructure of as-synthesized catalysts was further analyzed using a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM).Additionally, lattice spacings were determined from intensity line profiles and the corresponding planes of existing species were hence identified.The HRTEM image of SnS 2 /SnO 2 displayed clear lattice fringes, inferring their crystalline nature.The fringe interval of 0.211 nm can be ascribed to the interplanar spacing of (2 1 0) of tetragonal SnO 2 , also shown in Fig. 4(a,c,d,g) 42.Similarly, the lattice spacing of 0.158 nm, 0.163 nm and 0.185 nm corresponds to the interplanar spacing of (2 0 0), (1 0 3) and (1 1 0) of SnS 2 (Fig. 4(a) 434445.For a better understanding, live FFT and d-spacing images of (2 0 0) crystal plane of SnS 2 is provided Fig.4 (d,f).It can be observed that the characteristic lattice fringes of these nanoparticles are well inter-mixed.Fig. 4 (b) shows the interface region of a characteristic heterojunction between SnS 2 inter-mixed with SnO 2 .Some parts of the lattice fringes were distorted (indicated by yellow lines), which could arise from the lack of oxygen atoms in SnO 2 Fig.4 (e) 46,47.Further, HRTEM of Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 reveals that 0.335 nm is the characteristic lattice fringe space of (1 1 0) SnO 2 suppl.Fig. S6 31.Moreover, lattice fringe spacings of 0.2 nm and 0.148 nm can be assigned to (0 0 2) plane of CuO and (2 2 0) plane of Cu 2 O, respectively 48,49. To check the light-harvesting property of as-synthesized photocatalysts, UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra was recorded and converted into the absorption spectra using the Kubelka-Munk Function (Eqs.( 1) and ( 2)) 505152. where, F R 1 ; R; a; S are the Kubelka-Munk function, reflectance, absorption coefficient, and scattering coefficient, respectively.From Fig. 5 (a), SnS 2 /SnO 2 nanocomposite illustrates relatively higher absorption of light in the UV and visible region.On the other hand, Cu 2 O/ SnS 2 /SnO 2 showed higher absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, which could be primarily attributed to the surface plasmonic resonance behavior of copper oxide species 25.Additionally, the insertion of Cu 2 O into SnS 2 /SnO 2 significantly extended the light absorption range to even near-IR.Next, the band gaps E g of the as-prepared catalysts were determined using Eq.(3) based on the theory of optical absorption for indirect band gap semiconductors 53 ahm where, hmand B are discrete photon energy and a constant relative to the material, respectively.The result indicates that the inclusion of Cu 2 O reduced the band gap from 2.2 eV to 1.45 eV suppl.Fig. S7.Also, pristine Cu 2 O possess the band gap of 2.14 eV Fig.S7.Further, to analyze the charge carrier dynamics and charge separation efficacy, we have conducted the photoluminescence (PL) experiment for both samples at the same excitation wavelength of 350 nm in the solid phase.The PL emission originates from e A -h pair recombination events, and a lower PL intensity means efficient separation of photo-generated e A -h pairs.As presented in Fig. 5(b), the recombination events were drastically reduced for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 / SnO 2 , which indicates excellent charge separation efficiency for this catalyst.Possibly, the inclusion of Cu 2 O into SnS 2 /SnO 2 creates more vacancies which act as trapping sites for photo-generated charge carriers (e A -h ) and subsequently, recombination of charge carriers was significantly suppressed.Such properties enable the catalyst to retain electrons in its conduction band for longer, which could certainly promote their photo-catalytic activity.Additionally, a large PL intensity around 2 eV in both catalysts, can be attributed to 'O' defects 54. In the same line, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photocurrent response test were also conducted to explore the migration and recombination behaviors of charge carriers in the as-synthesized catalysts.A smaller arc radius in the EIS Nyquist plot implies a lower resistance for electron migration and in such sample, charge carriers are thus efficiently separated 55.In the present study (see Fig. 5 (c)), Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 illustrates a smaller arc radius, which makes this an efficient photocatalyst as a greater number of charge carriers would be readily available on its surface.Fig. 5 (d) exhibits the transient photocurrent response of the as-prepared catalysts.Upon illumination, Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 showed about 1.5-folds higher photocurrent response than SnS 2 /SnO 2 .This implies that photo-generated (e Ah ) pairs are efficiently separated in Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2, which is in well-agreement with the PL data Fig.5 (b).Notably, the photocurrent response remained constant even after several on/off illumination cycles, suggesting good photoelectrochemical stability for the tested catalysts.From a series of experiment about optical and electronic properties, we can conclude that the vacancies or defects in the catalyst play a significant role in improving the charge separation efficiency and also the light absorption behavior. It is indispensable to investigate the CO 2 photoreduction activity of the as-synthesized photocatalysts to unravel the role of vacancies.Hence, the reaction was performed in the gaseous phase at room temperature, while water was used as a reducing agent or source of H ions without adding any sacrificial agent.In the beginning, a set of controlled experiments was performed in the absence of photocatalyst, light, and (CO 2 H 2 O) gas.In all these experiments, no reduction products (such as CH 4 , CO) were observed Fig.S8.These products were formed only when all three components, i.e. photocatalyst, light, and (CO 2 H 2 O) gas were simultaneously available.Such results also clarify that the identified products were generated only via photocatalytic reduction steps.Moreover, these findings also infer that no adventitious hydrocarbon or sulfate species deposited on the catalyst's surface was erroneously contributed to yield of product. Fig. 6 (a-c) show formation rates of different gaseous products such as CO, CH 4, and H 2, which were obtained after four and eight hours of the experiment.Expectedly, the amount of each product increases with the irradiation time.SnS 2 /SnO 2 has shown a comparatively higher yield of CO and H 2 .In specific, the CO and H 2 formation rate of SnS 2 /SnO 2 in eight hours was 4:63 and 0:9lmolg A1 , respectively.These amounts were higher than those of the Cu 2 O and Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 samples.However, Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 exhibited a greater amount of CH 4 (2:27lmolg A1 ) due to its better reduction ability, inferred from the results provided in Fig. 6 (b). Next, it is crucial to estimate the CO 2 reduction efficiency by using the apparent quantum yield (AQY) 56.Fig S9 provides the AQY values for the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion using as-synthesized catalysts.The AQY can be calculated using Eqs.( 4)-( 7): number of incident photons 14 light absorbed by the photo catalyst average photon energy A t light absorbed by the photo catalyst where, H is the apparent light input Wm A2 , A is the geometric irradiance area m 2.Fig. 6 (c-d) suggests that using Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 , the yield for reduced products of carbon dioxide was higher with time.This implies that the excess amount of water molecules can be adsorbed over the hydrophilic surface of Cu 2 O, which can preferably reduce CO 2 .This is also evident that a relatively lower amount of CO were obtained than H 2 or CH 4 , in the case of pristine hydrophilic Cu 2 O catalyst given in Figs.S10-S12 On the contrary, SnS 2 / SnO 2 nanocomposites split water to give more hydrogen and hence, the reduced products of CO 2 were lower in amount.Next, the stability in photocatalytic performance of as-prepared Cu 2 O, SnS 2 /SnO 2, and Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 catalysts were tested for three cycles and the results are provided in Figs.S10-S12.The results illustrate high consistency in the amount of products (CO, H 2 and CH 4 ) for first three cycles. Furthermore, the spent catalysts were characterized to check their chemical and microstructural stability using FTIR and XRD techniques.Corresponding results are provided in Figs.S13 andS14.The IR results reveal no apparent change in the spectral features of the spent catalysts in comparison to the pristine catalysts, implying that the chemical structure remained same even after three cycles of experiments Fig.S13.Importantly, the XRD pattern of spent Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 reveals no change in crystal structure because no new peaks or any shift in the peak positions were noticed as compared to the freshly prepared catalysts (See Suppl.S14).This also implies that no strain was developed inside the catalyst during the process. Next, in situ DRIFTS experiments were conducted to get an insight into the involved reaction intermediates and the plausible pathways for product formation.Upon illumination, a considerable change in the absorbance values was noticed between 1600 and 1350 cm A1 region Fig.6 (e).Specifically, an increase in absorbance value of peaks related to mono-dentate carbonate (m-CO 3 ) was observed at 1550 cm A1 and 1461 cm A1 .Similarly, signals at 1506 cm A1 and 1363 cm A1 can be attributed to bi-dentate carbonate (bi-CO 3 ) and signal at 1419 cm A1 can be assigned to bi-dentate bicarbonate (bi-HCO 3 ) 575859.Several new peaks cor- responding to formate (HCOO -) species were seen at 1571 cm A1 and 1560 cm A1 ; signal at 1379 cm A1 can be ascribed to formic acid (HCOOH) 60,61.Formic acid may originate from the reaction of CO 2 with two H ions and two electrons.Most importantly, COO - peak was detected at 1538 and 1492 cm A1 57,62. Additionally, peaks at 1479 and 1437 cm A1 can be ascribed to the methoxy and formaldehyde groups, respectively.After two hours of illumination, bending vibration of the CAH group was observed at 1388 cm A1 63,64, which signifies that CO 2 was activated at an early stage and subsequently formed the intermediates which led to generating CH 4 9,65.From the above findings, it can be inferred that the as-synthesized photocatalysts have the potential to reduce CO 2 at room temperature in the gaseous phase.Carbon dioxide requires eight electrons and eight H ions to form methane (R ( 9)).Several species such as COOH, and HCHO which requires lesser electrons, are formed first to participate in intermediate reactions to eventually yield methane (R ( 10)).In the following steps, we also illustrate the reaction steps for the formation of other products such as CO ((R7) and (R8)) and H 2 (R5). The photo-activity of as-synthesized catalysts for nitrogen fixation was examined in a N 2 bubbled water system using a 300 W Xe lamp as the light source.The experiments were conducted continuously for 12 h, and the final NH 4 ion content was determined by Nessler's reagent spectrophotometry method using a UV-vis spectrophotometer Fig.7 ions dramatically increase in the presence of ethanol.Similar results were previously reported by other groups, where it is shown that how a trace amount of sacrificial agents such as ethanol, methanol and other alcohols could produce high concentration of NH 4 ions 666768.Because these sacrificial agents may possibly consume photogenerated holes, which could considerably enhance the charge separation efficiency and result in higher production rate of NH 4 ions.Also, oxidized products of sacrificial agents may be a source of interference for accurate quantification of NH 4 ions using Nessler's reagent method 69. To examine the activation of nitrogen on the surface of the catalyst, an in situ DRIFTS study was conducted to monitor the timedependent change of the N-containing functional groups on the photocatalyst under simulated reaction conditions.The corre- sponding DRIFTS result for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 is shown in Fig. 7 (d). As can be seen, the intensity of adsorption band related to -NH x species significantly enhanced with N 2 exposure and light illumination, indicating that N 2 can be efficiently adsorbed and further interact with the surface of Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 .In particular, peaks at 3555, 3167, and 2996 cm A1 can be ascribed to m (NAH) stretching mode of NH 3 70,71.A broad and weak peak located at 2876 cm A1 can be assigned to the representative adsorption of NH 4 molecules 71.Also, the peak at 1740 cm A1 is attributed to r (NAH) bending vibration of NH 3 70.Another peak at 1648 cm A1 relates to an antisymmetric deformation vibration of NH 4 72.Furthermore, peaks at 1499 and 1397 cm A1 were associated with the adsorption of NH 3 and NH 4 molecules, respectively 71.Importantly, a signal at 1111 cm A1 corresponding to hydrazine (H 2 N NH 2 ) was observed, but only under light irradiation (Fig. S15) 73.Similar results were reported by Schrauzer et al. who prepared iron-doped TiO 2 by heating iron (iii) sulfateimpregnated anatase TiO 2 ; they have also reported generation of ions were formed even in the absence of H 2 O.We believe that such weak signals could be due to the traces of surface adsorbed water molecules over the as-synthesized catalysts.In the presence of water bubbler, it is evident that excess water was predominantly the source of protons, owing to the intense IR signals of reaction intermediates.These set of experiments also helps in identifying the reaction intermediates, role of water, and subsequently elucidate a plausible reaction mechanism.In general, the reaction pathway for nitrogen fixation over oxide-based catalyst follow associative steps 75, wherein, oxygen vacancies often offer active sites for the chemisorption of nitrogen molecules.In the present contribution, we suggest that the existing oxygen vacancies in the assynthesized catalyst primarily act as an active site to chemisorb nitrogen molecules, which accepts multi-electron and multiproton to eventually generate NH 3 . We conducted ESR spectroscopy to probe the presence of intrinsic defects such as vacancies and interstitials.An ESR spectrometer examines the interaction between magnetic dipoles of unpaired electrons under an applied magnetic field and electromagnetic radiation of the appropriate wavelength 76.Here, we conducted the ESR experiment in dark as well under light at room temperature.The corresponding results are given in Fig. 8 (a).A single Lorentzian line centered at g 2.004 can be attributed to the presence of a single electron trapped in oxygen vacancies at the surface of SnS 2 /SnO 2 77.The presence of oxygen vacancies may affect the electronic structure of the SnS 2 /SnO 2 catalyst.Previous report reveals that the ionized oxygen vacancies in SnO 2 create shallow trap levels with an energy of 0.03 eV and 0.15 eV below the bottom of the conduction band (CBM) 78. As is known, oxygen vacancies tend to facilitate the adsorption as well as the reactivity of various gases such as CO, CO 2 , and O 2 79.Here, the intensity of the same ESR signal dampened upon light irradiation, which could be attributed to the trapping of photogenerated electrons in those shallow trap levels of oxygen vacancies.These trapping sites play a dual role in efficiently increasing the charge separation and also determining product distribution for the tested catalyst. Similarly, a broad ESR signal for Cu 2 indicates the presence of a high concentration of unpaired electrons in the as-prepared catalyst.The intensity of this signal was reduced upon illumination, which could be attributed to the transformation of trace amount of paramagnetic Cu 2 ions to diamagnetic Cu ions via accepting electron12Cu 2 e A !Cu (see Fig. 8 (b)).Such consumption of electrons by Cu 2 ions would considerably suppress the recombination of charge carriers over the surface of catalyst.This result is in good agreement with the above mentioned optical and electronic properties of the as-prepared catalyst Fig.5(b).Also, it should be noted that a relatively higher ESR peak area for Cu 2 O/ SnS 2 /SnO 2 could be due to the presence of intrinsic defects, which was successfully induced during its synthesis.As depicted in Fig. 8 (b), the ESR line was significantly narrowed upon irradiation, which could be primarily attributed to the strong exchange and delocalization of unpaired electrons with the catalyst 80. A favorable position of the conduction band and readily available free electrons are crucial to exhibit higher photocatalytic activity.In principle, the conduction band position should be more negative to reduce CO 2 into CO (A0.51 eV, NHE) and CH 4 (A0.24eV, NHE) as well as fix nitrogen to NH 3 (A0.28eV, NHE) 7,81.In this regard, we performed a valence band (VB) XPS Fig.S18 and Mott-Schottky (MS) analysis to identify the semiconductor type and its flat band potentialE fb (See Fig. 8 (c-d)).This calculation also required band gap values (given in Fig. S7).A possible band diagram of the as-synthesized photocatalysts is provided in Fig. 8 (e). In Fig. 8 (d), SnS 2 /SnO 2 sample shows positive slopes indicating n-type composites.On the other hand, Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 exhibited an inverted 'V-shaped' curves which were a combination of positive as well as negative slope, inferring the successful formation of a p-n heterojunction.The E fb values of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O are measured to be A0.79 and 1.36 eV (vs.Ag/AgCl) from the Mott-Schottky curve, respectively.Additionally, the E fb (vs.Ag/AgCl) of these semiconductors can be to E fb (vs.NHE) by the following formula 25 E fb vs:NHE So, the E fb (vs.NHE) values of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O are A0.593 and 1.557 eV, respectively.As is known, the conduction band (CB) of the n-type semiconductor is 0.1 eV lower thanE fb , and the valence band (VB) of the p-type semiconductor is 0.1 eV higher than E fb 82.Hence, the CB and VB of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O were A0.693 and 1.657 eV, respectively.The band gaps of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O were 2.2 eV and 2.14 eV, respectively Fig.S7.Therefore, the corresponding VB and CB can be obtained using: where, E g is the band gap, E VB is the valence band edge potential, and E CB is the conduction band edge potential.The VB and CB of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O were calculated to be 1.507 and A0.483 eV, respectively.Interestingly, when the p-n junction of Cu 2 O and SnS 2 /SnO 2 was formed, an equilibration of Fermi levels can be attained (see Fig. 8(e)).Where, light-induced charge carriers can be efficiently separated by the built-in electric field within the space charge region (evidenced from PL and ESR results).The electric field drives the transfer of electrons to the conduction band of the SnS 2 /SnO 2 (a n-type semiconductor) and holes to the valence band of the Cu 2 O (a p-type semiconductor) 82.Moreover, VB XPS also disclose that the introduction of Cu 2 O into the SnS 2 /SnO 2 sample led to the upshifting of the valence band that creates a higher driving force for reduction reaction Fig.S18.We attribute this upshift to the formation of a p-n heterojunction and also, oxygen vacancies.These vacancies created more delocalized states and also led to the formation of shallow traps.Such trapping sites readily hold electrons.Consequently, these traps efficiently separated photo-generated charge carriers and facilitate the photo-activity. Such analyses reveal two important results: (1) Conduction band position of the as-prepared catalysts was sufficiently negative to reduce CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Owing to the band structure, these catalysts were also able to convert N 2 to NH SnS 2 /SnO 2 ) significantly improved photocatalytic activity.Thus, here, composite catalyst was shown to have high reactivity and stability for continuous reduction of CO 2 by water and fixation of N 2 under light irradiation and thus would certainly be a promising strategy for other reactions."}, {"llm generation": "Xe arc lamp", "source": "Light source: 300 W Xe arc lamp.", "context": "In summary, we included Cu 2 O into SnS 2 /SnO 2 nanocomposite to extend the absorption wavelength range and reduce the recombination events.The coupling of these semiconductors formed a pn heterostructure.The photoactivity of as-synthesized catalysts was tested to reduce CO 2 by water and fix N 2 to ammonia.SnS 2 / SnO 2 has two-dimensional hierarchical flower-like morphology with a surface area of 55.8 m 2 g A1 .Morphology and surface area were different after the addition of Cu 2 O to the nanocomposite.Moreover, band gap was considerably reduced and the transient photocurrent response was about 1.5-folds higher than SnS 2 / SnO 2 .Consequently, the apparent quantum yield, a measure of photoactivity, has increased from 7:16 to 8:62.Also, the selectivity of CH 4 over CO was approximately 1.8-times higher than that of SnS 2 /SnO 2 .For the N 2 fixation experiment, in the absence of sacrificial agent, the generation rate of NH 4 was 66:35lmol:g A1 h A1 for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 , which is 1.9-fold higher than SnS 2 /SnO 2 .Conduction band position of the as-prepared catalysts was sufficiently negative to reduce CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Owing to the band structure, these catalysts were also able to convert nitrogen to ammonia.Several in situ experiments such as ESR and DRIFTS demonstrated that oxygen vacancies within the catalysts act as trapping sites for photo-induced charge carriers which strongly influenced the reactivity and selectivity of the product.Additionally, oxygen vacancies served as an active site to chemisorb nitrogen molecules, which follows associative steps to generate NH 3 . Hence, the present study demonstrated a promising strategy to use oxygen vacancies rich heterostructure with excellent charge separation efficiency for enhanced photo-activity.

With the inclusion of Cu 2 O into SnS 2 /SnO 2 , the AQY value has increased from 7:16 to 8:62 within first four hours.A higher AQY value means catalyst should exhibit better photoactivity.Notably, the AQY value for pristine Cu 2 O is only 2.82 for four hours reaction time.For eight hours of experiment, the selectivity of CO over CH 4 ( CO CH 4 2:53 in the case of SnS 2 /SnO 2 is relatively higher compared to that of Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 ( CO CH 4 1:4: Comparing the corresponding AQY values and selectivity of CO over CH 4 for assynthesized catalysts, it is evident that Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 could have better reduction properties.Also, this could be attributed to the higher surface area of Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 than that of SnS 2 /SnO 2 , which facilitates vast adsorption of CO 2 on surface of the catalyst see Fig. 2; h is the Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, k is the average wavelength of light source. 74.The formation of N 2 H 4 implies that nitrogen triple bond weakened during the process.Based on the observation of NH 3 and other reaction intermediates, it is apparent that the assynthesized catalysts were effective for activating N N bonds in the presence of H 2 O under UV-vis illumination.Additionally, we also performed the in situ DRIFTS study for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 in the absence of H 2 O, and the results are provided in Fig.S16.Moreover, for a better insight, comparative changes in spectral features using second-order IR derivative spectra d 2 A dk 2 is provided in the range of 1000-4000 cm A1 for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 catalyst, in the presence and absence of H 2 O see Fig.S17.The result suggests that weak IR signals of reaction intermediates such as NH 4 Journal of Colloid and Interface Science xxx (xxxx) xxx The authors are thankful to the Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS) (Department of Atomic Energy), Government of India to provide partial financial support for the present work in the form of Young Scientist Research Award (YSRA project Grant No. 58/20/06/2019-BRNS).S.K. also acknowledges the financial support from Indian Institute of Technology Patna (IIT Patna) for providing instrumental facilities required to perform this work.N.O.and A.B. greatly appreciates IIT Patna for their research fellowships.Authors are also thankful to Dr. Anup K.

Fig. 2 (d,i) shows the XRD pattern for as-synthesized catalysts.XRD peaks of both catalysts can be indexed to SnS 2 (COD id 7038076 and 7038069) and SnO 2 (COD id 1000062).Based on their relative intensities, it appears that SnS 2 is in major content in both catalysts.Importantly, no peaks corresponding to Cu 2 O was observed, owing to their low amount (see Fig. S2, EDS spectrum of Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 ).Nonetheless, an apparent change in the XRD pattern was observed after the addition of Cu 2 O, which could also promote the photocatalytic activity, possibly by varying the surface area.Hence, the BET surface areas were determined via nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms Fig. 2 (e,j).Here, isotherms for all as-synthesized catalysts are alike and can be categorized as type IV with H3 hysteresis loop.The BET surface areas of the SnS 2 / SnO 2 and Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 are 55.8m 2 g A1 and 179.6m 2 g A1 , respectively.The pore-size distribution suggests that both catalysts are mesoporous Fig.S3.Moreover, Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 also showed wider pore sizes.It is likely possible that the used copper precursor could have decomposed to give gaseous vapors and NO x during thermal reduction into metallic copper or Cu 2 O. Consequently, such a process step might generate larger pores on the catalyst surface. The surface chemical composition and oxidation states of elements in as-synthesized catalysts were probed using the XPS technique Fig.3.The survey spectra confirm the presence of Sn, S, and O elements in SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Sn, S, O, and Cu in Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 Fig.S4.In case of SnS 2 /SnO 2 nanocomposites, the Sn3d spectra reveal that the binding energy (486.7 eV) of Sn 3d5/2 lies between those in SnS 2 (486.65 eV) and SnO 2 (486.9 eV) 8 Fig.3 (a) Such mixed states of Sn are suitable to generate additional active centers to promote photocatalytic activity 28.The bonding of S 2A or O 2- with Sn 4 cannot lead to discernable changes in binding energies of Sn3d; which makes it difficult to identify if any chemical bond between SnS 2 and SnO 2 was formed.However, the above XPS results at least verified that the as-synthesized catalyst was composite of SnS 2 and SnO 2 . Further, deconvolution of high-resolution XPS spectra of S2p in SnS 2 /SnO 2 nanocomposite disclosed peaks at 161.7 eV, 163.1 eV and 164.9 eV, corresponding to SnS 2 (S2p 3/2 ), L-cysteine (S2p 3/2 ) and SAS bonds, respectively 29,30 Fig.3 (b).However, for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 , the first two deconvoluted peaks at 161.4 eV (2p 3/2 ), 162.9 eV (2p 1/2 ) can be ascribed to binding energies of SnS 2 31.Moreover, the other two deconvoluted peaks correspond to SAO species (164.6 eV) and sulfate species (168.8 eV) (8.92 of the S 2p total peak area) 21.Comparing the S2p spectra of both samples, a clear shift of 0.3 eV towards lower binding energy can be observed for assigned SnS 2 peak.Such a shift could be due to the weakening of S bond with Sn or S, possibly due to the inclusion of Cu.As is known, Cu has a relatively lower electronegativity value (1.9) in comparison to that of Sn (2.5), S (1.96) or O (3.44).Therefore, in the Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 sample, the electron cloud around S should be denser and as a result, the binding energy of S2p was reduced. The narrow spectrum of O1s in Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 indicates the presence of the first peak at 531.7 eV, which corresponds to oxygen in oxygen-deficient regions of the SnO 2 matrix 32,33 Fig.3 (c).Additionally, surface-adsorbed oxygen of Cu 2 O indicative of existing surface oxygen vacancies could also contribute to the formation of the peak at 531.7 eV 34,35.The second peak at 533.1 eV can be assigned to surface hydroxyl group 36.A high-resolution narrow XPS spectrum for Cu2p in Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 was also acquired and the result is presented in Fig. 3 (d).Two clear main peaks of 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 at 932.1 eV and 952.0 eV, corresponding In this context, we also employed the FTIR technique to understand the chemical structure of as-prepared catalysts see Suppl.presence of characteristic peaks at 545 cm A1 and 625 cm A1, which could be due to stretching vibration of Sn-O and Sn-S bond, respectively 39,40.Moreover, an apparent peak at 468 cm A1 appears for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 sample which can be attributed to the stretching modes of Cu-O vibration 41; this also indicates a possible heterostructure between Cu 2 O and SnS 2 /SnO 2 . The microstructure of as-synthesized catalysts was further analyzed using a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM).Additionally, lattice spacings were determined from intensity line profiles and the corresponding planes of existing species were hence identified.The HRTEM image of SnS 2 /SnO 2 displayed clear lattice fringes, inferring their crystalline nature.The fringe interval of 0.211 nm can be ascribed to the interplanar spacing of (2 1 0) of tetragonal SnO 2 , also shown in Fig. 4(a,c,d,g) 42.Similarly, the lattice spacing of 0.158 nm, 0.163 nm and 0.185 nm corresponds to the interplanar spacing of (2 0 0), (1 0 3) and (1 1 0) of SnS 2 (Fig. 4(a) 434445.For a better understanding, live FFT and d-spacing images of (2 0 0) crystal plane of SnS 2 is provided Fig.4 (d,f).It can be observed that the characteristic lattice fringes of these nanoparticles are well inter-mixed.Fig. 4 (b) shows the interface region of a characteristic heterojunction between SnS 2 inter-mixed with SnO 2 .Some parts of the lattice fringes were distorted (indicated by yellow lines), which could arise from the lack of oxygen atoms in SnO 2 Fig.4 (e) 46,47.Further, HRTEM of Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 reveals that 0.335 nm is the characteristic lattice fringe space of (1 1 0) SnO 2 suppl.Fig. S6 31.Moreover, lattice fringe spacings of 0.2 nm and 0.148 nm can be assigned to (0 0 2) plane of CuO and (2 2 0) plane of Cu 2 O, respectively 48,49. To check the light-harvesting property of as-synthesized photocatalysts, UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra was recorded and converted into the absorption spectra using the Kubelka-Munk Function (Eqs.( 1) and ( 2)) 505152. where, F R 1 ; R; a; S are the Kubelka-Munk function, reflectance, absorption coefficient, and scattering coefficient, respectively.From Fig. 5 (a), SnS 2 /SnO 2 nanocomposite illustrates relatively higher absorption of light in the UV and visible region.On the other hand, Cu 2 O/ SnS 2 /SnO 2 showed higher absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, which could be primarily attributed to the surface plasmonic resonance behavior of copper oxide species 25.Additionally, the insertion of Cu 2 O into SnS 2 /SnO 2 significantly extended the light absorption range to even near-IR.Next, the band gaps E g of the as-prepared catalysts were determined using Eq.(3) based on the theory of optical absorption for indirect band gap semiconductors 53 ahm where, hmand B are discrete photon energy and a constant relative to the material, respectively.The result indicates that the inclusion of Cu 2 O reduced the band gap from 2.2 eV to 1.45 eV suppl.Fig. S7.Also, pristine Cu 2 O possess the band gap of 2.14 eV Fig.S7.Further, to analyze the charge carrier dynamics and charge separation efficacy, we have conducted the photoluminescence (PL) experiment for both samples at the same excitation wavelength of 350 nm in the solid phase.The PL emission originates from e A -h pair recombination events, and a lower PL intensity means efficient separation of photo-generated e A -h pairs.As presented in Fig. 5(b), the recombination events were drastically reduced for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 / SnO 2 , which indicates excellent charge separation efficiency for this catalyst.Possibly, the inclusion of Cu 2 O into SnS 2 /SnO 2 creates more vacancies which act as trapping sites for photo-generated charge carriers (e A -h ) and subsequently, recombination of charge carriers was significantly suppressed.Such properties enable the catalyst to retain electrons in its conduction band for longer, which could certainly promote their photo-catalytic activity.Additionally, a large PL intensity around 2 eV in both catalysts, can be attributed to 'O' defects 54. In the same line, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photocurrent response test were also conducted to explore the migration and recombination behaviors of charge carriers in the as-synthesized catalysts.A smaller arc radius in the EIS Nyquist plot implies a lower resistance for electron migration and in such sample, charge carriers are thus efficiently separated 55.In the present study (see Fig. 5 (c)), Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 illustrates a smaller arc radius, which makes this an efficient photocatalyst as a greater number of charge carriers would be readily available on its surface.Fig. 5 (d) exhibits the transient photocurrent response of the as-prepared catalysts.Upon illumination, Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 showed about 1.5-folds higher photocurrent response than SnS 2 /SnO 2 .This implies that photo-generated (e Ah ) pairs are efficiently separated in Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2, which is in well-agreement with the PL data Fig.5 (b).Notably, the photocurrent response remained constant even after several on/off illumination cycles, suggesting good photoelectrochemical stability for the tested catalysts.From a series of experiment about optical and electronic properties, we can conclude that the vacancies or defects in the catalyst play a significant role in improving the charge separation efficiency and also the light absorption behavior. It is indispensable to investigate the CO 2 photoreduction activity of the as-synthesized photocatalysts to unravel the role of vacancies.Hence, the reaction was performed in the gaseous phase at room temperature, while water was used as a reducing agent or source of H ions without adding any sacrificial agent.In the beginning, a set of controlled experiments was performed in the absence of photocatalyst, light, and (CO 2 H 2 O) gas.In all these experiments, no reduction products (such as CH 4 , CO) were observed Fig.S8.These products were formed only when all three components, i.e. photocatalyst, light, and (CO 2 H 2 O) gas were simultaneously available.Such results also clarify that the identified products were generated only via photocatalytic reduction steps.Moreover, these findings also infer that no adventitious hydrocarbon or sulfate species deposited on the catalyst's surface was erroneously contributed to yield of product. Fig. 6 (a-c) show formation rates of different gaseous products such as CO, CH 4, and H 2, which were obtained after four and eight hours of the experiment.Expectedly, the amount of each product increases with the irradiation time.SnS 2 /SnO 2 has shown a comparatively higher yield of CO and H 2 .In specific, the CO and H 2 formation rate of SnS 2 /SnO 2 in eight hours was 4:63 and 0:9lmolg A1 , respectively.These amounts were higher than those of the Cu 2 O and Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 samples.However, Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 exhibited a greater amount of CH 4 (2:27lmolg A1 ) due to its better reduction ability, inferred from the results provided in Fig. 6 (b). Next, it is crucial to estimate the CO 2 reduction efficiency by using the apparent quantum yield (AQY) 56.Fig S9 provides the AQY values for the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion using as-synthesized catalysts.The AQY can be calculated using Eqs.( 4)-( 7): number of incident photons 14 light absorbed by the photo catalyst average photon energy A t light absorbed by the photo catalyst where, H is the apparent light input Wm A2 , A is the geometric irradiance area m 2.Fig. 6 (c-d) suggests that using Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 , the yield for reduced products of carbon dioxide was higher with time.This implies that the excess amount of water molecules can be adsorbed over the hydrophilic surface of Cu 2 O, which can preferably reduce CO 2 .This is also evident that a relatively lower amount of CO were obtained than H 2 or CH 4 , in the case of pristine hydrophilic Cu 2 O catalyst given in Figs.S10-S12 On the contrary, SnS 2 / SnO 2 nanocomposites split water to give more hydrogen and hence, the reduced products of CO 2 were lower in amount.Next, the stability in photocatalytic performance of as-prepared Cu 2 O, SnS 2 /SnO 2, and Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 catalysts were tested for three cycles and the results are provided in Figs.S10-S12.The results illustrate high consistency in the amount of products (CO, H 2 and CH 4 ) for first three cycles. Furthermore, the spent catalysts were characterized to check their chemical and microstructural stability using FTIR and XRD techniques.Corresponding results are provided in Figs.S13 andS14.The IR results reveal no apparent change in the spectral features of the spent catalysts in comparison to the pristine catalysts, implying that the chemical structure remained same even after three cycles of experiments Fig.S13.Importantly, the XRD pattern of spent Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 reveals no change in crystal structure because no new peaks or any shift in the peak positions were noticed as compared to the freshly prepared catalysts (See Suppl.S14).This also implies that no strain was developed inside the catalyst during the process. Next, in situ DRIFTS experiments were conducted to get an insight into the involved reaction intermediates and the plausible pathways for product formation.Upon illumination, a considerable change in the absorbance values was noticed between 1600 and 1350 cm A1 region Fig.6 (e).Specifically, an increase in absorbance value of peaks related to mono-dentate carbonate (m-CO 3 ) was observed at 1550 cm A1 and 1461 cm A1 .Similarly, signals at 1506 cm A1 and 1363 cm A1 can be attributed to bi-dentate carbonate (bi-CO 3 ) and signal at 1419 cm A1 can be assigned to bi-dentate bicarbonate (bi-HCO 3 ) 575859.Several new peaks cor- responding to formate (HCOO -) species were seen at 1571 cm A1 and 1560 cm A1 ; signal at 1379 cm A1 can be ascribed to formic acid (HCOOH) 60,61.Formic acid may originate from the reaction of CO 2 with two H ions and two electrons.Most importantly, COO - peak was detected at 1538 and 1492 cm A1 57,62. Additionally, peaks at 1479 and 1437 cm A1 can be ascribed to the methoxy and formaldehyde groups, respectively.After two hours of illumination, bending vibration of the CAH group was observed at 1388 cm A1 63,64, which signifies that CO 2 was activated at an early stage and subsequently formed the intermediates which led to generating CH 4 9,65.From the above findings, it can be inferred that the as-synthesized photocatalysts have the potential to reduce CO 2 at room temperature in the gaseous phase.Carbon dioxide requires eight electrons and eight H ions to form methane (R ( 9)).Several species such as COOH, and HCHO which requires lesser electrons, are formed first to participate in intermediate reactions to eventually yield methane (R ( 10)).In the following steps, we also illustrate the reaction steps for the formation of other products such as CO ((R7) and (R8)) and H 2 (R5). The photo-activity of as-synthesized catalysts for nitrogen fixation was examined in a N 2 bubbled water system using a 300 W Xe lamp as the light source.The experiments were conducted continuously for 12 h, and the final NH 4 ion content was determined by Nessler's reagent spectrophotometry method using a UV-vis spectrophotometer Fig.7 ions dramatically increase in the presence of ethanol.Similar results were previously reported by other groups, where it is shown that how a trace amount of sacrificial agents such as ethanol, methanol and other alcohols could produce high concentration of NH 4 ions 666768.Because these sacrificial agents may possibly consume photogenerated holes, which could considerably enhance the charge separation efficiency and result in higher production rate of NH 4 ions.Also, oxidized products of sacrificial agents may be a source of interference for accurate quantification of NH 4 ions using Nessler's reagent method 69. To examine the activation of nitrogen on the surface of the catalyst, an in situ DRIFTS study was conducted to monitor the timedependent change of the N-containing functional groups on the photocatalyst under simulated reaction conditions.The corre- sponding DRIFTS result for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 is shown in Fig. 7 (d). As can be seen, the intensity of adsorption band related to -NH x species significantly enhanced with N 2 exposure and light illumination, indicating that N 2 can be efficiently adsorbed and further interact with the surface of Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 .In particular, peaks at 3555, 3167, and 2996 cm A1 can be ascribed to m (NAH) stretching mode of NH 3 70,71.A broad and weak peak located at 2876 cm A1 can be assigned to the representative adsorption of NH 4 molecules 71.Also, the peak at 1740 cm A1 is attributed to r (NAH) bending vibration of NH 3 70.Another peak at 1648 cm A1 relates to an antisymmetric deformation vibration of NH 4 72.Furthermore, peaks at 1499 and 1397 cm A1 were associated with the adsorption of NH 3 and NH 4 molecules, respectively 71.Importantly, a signal at 1111 cm A1 corresponding to hydrazine (H 2 N NH 2 ) was observed, but only under light irradiation (Fig. S15) 73.Similar results were reported by Schrauzer et al. who prepared iron-doped TiO 2 by heating iron (iii) sulfateimpregnated anatase TiO 2 ; they have also reported generation of ions were formed even in the absence of H 2 O.We believe that such weak signals could be due to the traces of surface adsorbed water molecules over the as-synthesized catalysts.In the presence of water bubbler, it is evident that excess water was predominantly the source of protons, owing to the intense IR signals of reaction intermediates.These set of experiments also helps in identifying the reaction intermediates, role of water, and subsequently elucidate a plausible reaction mechanism.In general, the reaction pathway for nitrogen fixation over oxide-based catalyst follow associative steps 75, wherein, oxygen vacancies often offer active sites for the chemisorption of nitrogen molecules.In the present contribution, we suggest that the existing oxygen vacancies in the assynthesized catalyst primarily act as an active site to chemisorb nitrogen molecules, which accepts multi-electron and multiproton to eventually generate NH 3 . We conducted ESR spectroscopy to probe the presence of intrinsic defects such as vacancies and interstitials.An ESR spectrometer examines the interaction between magnetic dipoles of unpaired electrons under an applied magnetic field and electromagnetic radiation of the appropriate wavelength 76.Here, we conducted the ESR experiment in dark as well under light at room temperature.The corresponding results are given in Fig. 8 (a).A single Lorentzian line centered at g 2.004 can be attributed to the presence of a single electron trapped in oxygen vacancies at the surface of SnS 2 /SnO 2 77.The presence of oxygen vacancies may affect the electronic structure of the SnS 2 /SnO 2 catalyst.Previous report reveals that the ionized oxygen vacancies in SnO 2 create shallow trap levels with an energy of 0.03 eV and 0.15 eV below the bottom of the conduction band (CBM) 78. As is known, oxygen vacancies tend to facilitate the adsorption as well as the reactivity of various gases such as CO, CO 2 , and O 2 79.Here, the intensity of the same ESR signal dampened upon light irradiation, which could be attributed to the trapping of photogenerated electrons in those shallow trap levels of oxygen vacancies.These trapping sites play a dual role in efficiently increasing the charge separation and also determining product distribution for the tested catalyst. Similarly, a broad ESR signal for Cu 2 indicates the presence of a high concentration of unpaired electrons in the as-prepared catalyst.The intensity of this signal was reduced upon illumination, which could be attributed to the transformation of trace amount of paramagnetic Cu 2 ions to diamagnetic Cu ions via accepting electron12Cu 2 e A !Cu (see Fig. 8 (b)).Such consumption of electrons by Cu 2 ions would considerably suppress the recombination of charge carriers over the surface of catalyst.This result is in good agreement with the above mentioned optical and electronic properties of the as-prepared catalyst Fig.5(b).Also, it should be noted that a relatively higher ESR peak area for Cu 2 O/ SnS 2 /SnO 2 could be due to the presence of intrinsic defects, which was successfully induced during its synthesis.As depicted in Fig. 8 (b), the ESR line was significantly narrowed upon irradiation, which could be primarily attributed to the strong exchange and delocalization of unpaired electrons with the catalyst 80. A favorable position of the conduction band and readily available free electrons are crucial to exhibit higher photocatalytic activity.In principle, the conduction band position should be more negative to reduce CO 2 into CO (A0.51 eV, NHE) and CH 4 (A0.24eV, NHE) as well as fix nitrogen to NH 3 (A0.28eV, NHE) 7,81.In this regard, we performed a valence band (VB) XPS Fig.S18 and Mott-Schottky (MS) analysis to identify the semiconductor type and its flat band potentialE fb (See Fig. 8 (c-d)).This calculation also required band gap values (given in Fig. S7).A possible band diagram of the as-synthesized photocatalysts is provided in Fig. 8 (e). In Fig. 8 (d), SnS 2 /SnO 2 sample shows positive slopes indicating n-type composites.On the other hand, Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 exhibited an inverted 'V-shaped' curves which were a combination of positive as well as negative slope, inferring the successful formation of a p-n heterojunction.The E fb values of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O are measured to be A0.79 and 1.36 eV (vs.Ag/AgCl) from the Mott-Schottky curve, respectively.Additionally, the E fb (vs.Ag/AgCl) of these semiconductors can be to E fb (vs.NHE) by the following formula 25 E fb vs:NHE So, the E fb (vs.NHE) values of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O are A0.593 and 1.557 eV, respectively.As is known, the conduction band (CB) of the n-type semiconductor is 0.1 eV lower thanE fb , and the valence band (VB) of the p-type semiconductor is 0.1 eV higher than E fb 82.Hence, the CB and VB of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O were A0.693 and 1.657 eV, respectively.The band gaps of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O were 2.2 eV and 2.14 eV, respectively Fig.S7.Therefore, the corresponding VB and CB can be obtained using: where, E g is the band gap, E VB is the valence band edge potential, and E CB is the conduction band edge potential.The VB and CB of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O were calculated to be 1.507 and A0.483 eV, respectively.Interestingly, when the p-n junction of Cu 2 O and SnS 2 /SnO 2 was formed, an equilibration of Fermi levels can be attained (see Fig. 8(e)).Where, light-induced charge carriers can be efficiently separated by the built-in electric field within the space charge region (evidenced from PL and ESR results).The electric field drives the transfer of electrons to the conduction band of the SnS 2 /SnO 2 (a n-type semiconductor) and holes to the valence band of the Cu 2 O (a p-type semiconductor) 82.Moreover, VB XPS also disclose that the introduction of Cu 2 O into the SnS 2 /SnO 2 sample led to the upshifting of the valence band that creates a higher driving force for reduction reaction Fig.S18.We attribute this upshift to the formation of a p-n heterojunction and also, oxygen vacancies.These vacancies created more delocalized states and also led to the formation of shallow traps.Such trapping sites readily hold electrons.Consequently, these traps efficiently separated photo-generated charge carriers and facilitate the photo-activity. Such analyses reveal two important results: (1) Conduction band position of the as-prepared catalysts was sufficiently negative to reduce CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Owing to the band structure, these catalysts were also able to convert N 2 to NH SnS 2 /SnO 2 ) significantly improved photocatalytic activity.Thus, here, composite catalyst was shown to have high reactivity and stability for continuous reduction of CO 2 by water and fixation of N 2 under light irradiation and thus would certainly be a promising strategy for other reactions."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "The experiments were conducted continuously for 12 h, and the final NH 4 ion content was determined by Nessler's reagent spectrophotometry method using a UV-vis spectrophotometer Fig.7", "context": "Fig. 1 pictorially describes the synthesis procedure for hierarchical SnS 2 /SnO 2 nanocomposites and Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 heterostructure.Here, a definite amount of ethylene glycol and stannous chloride was mixed with L-cysteine and heated to 140 C for 16 h in a Teflon-lined autoclave, which was sealed in a stainless steel tank.This step resulted in the formation of twodimensional hierarchical flower-like morphology with an average diameter of 1 lm and recognized as SnS 2 /SnO 2 nanocomposite Fig. 2 (a,b).It appears that such structure results from the connection of several dozen nanopetals (10 nm thick) deeply rooted through the center to form 3D flowerlike structures.Further, a known amount of copper precursor (Cu (NO 3 ) 2 A3H 2 O) was introduced into the same solution and an identical synthesis procedure was followed Fig.1.Interestingly, the obtained morphology was of hierarchical accordion-like layered nanosheets in round globules see Fig. 2 (f,g).The sample was identified as Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 , wherein, all elements (Sn, S, Cu, and O) were homogeneously distributed Fig. 2 (h).To get a better understanding, Fig. S1 provides few more SEM images at different magnifications for the asprepared catalysts. Fig. 2 (d,i) shows the XRD pattern for as-synthesized catalysts.XRD peaks of both catalysts can be indexed to SnS 2 (COD id 7038076 and 7038069) and SnO 2 (COD id 1000062).Based on their relative intensities, it appears that SnS 2 is in major content in both catalysts.Importantly, no peaks corresponding to Cu 2 O was observed, owing to their low amount (see Fig. S2, EDS spectrum of Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 ).Nonetheless, an apparent change in the XRD pattern was observed after the addition of Cu 2 O, which could also promote the photocatalytic activity, possibly by varying the surface area.Hence, the BET surface areas were determined via nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms Fig. 2 (e,j).Here, isotherms for all as-synthesized catalysts are alike and can be categorized as type IV with H3 hysteresis loop.The BET surface areas of the SnS 2 / SnO 2 and Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 are 55.8m 2 g A1 and 179.6m 2 g A1 , respectively.The pore-size distribution suggests that both catalysts are mesoporous Fig.S3.Moreover, Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 also showed wider pore sizes.It is likely possible that the used copper precursor could have decomposed to give gaseous vapors and NO x during thermal reduction into metallic copper or Cu 2 O. Consequently, such a process step might generate larger pores on the catalyst surface. The surface chemical composition and oxidation states of elements in as-synthesized catalysts were probed using the XPS technique Fig.3.The survey spectra confirm the presence of Sn, S, and O elements in SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Sn, S, O, and Cu in Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 Fig.S4.In case of SnS 2 /SnO 2 nanocomposites, the Sn3d spectra reveal that the binding energy (486.7 eV) of Sn 3d5/2 lies between those in SnS 2 (486.65 eV) and SnO 2 (486.9 eV) 8 Fig.3 (a) Such mixed states of Sn are suitable to generate additional active centers to promote photocatalytic activity 28.The bonding of S 2A or O 2- with Sn 4 cannot lead to discernable changes in binding energies of Sn3d; which makes it difficult to identify if any chemical bond between SnS 2 and SnO 2 was formed.However, the above XPS results at least verified that the as-synthesized catalyst was composite of SnS 2 and SnO 2 . Further, deconvolution of high-resolution XPS spectra of S2p in SnS 2 /SnO 2 nanocomposite disclosed peaks at 161.7 eV, 163.1 eV and 164.9 eV, corresponding to SnS 2 (S2p 3/2 ), L-cysteine (S2p 3/2 ) and SAS bonds, respectively 29,30 Fig.3 (b).However, for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 , the first two deconvoluted peaks at 161.4 eV (2p 3/2 ), 162.9 eV (2p 1/2 ) can be ascribed to binding energies of SnS 2 31.Moreover, the other two deconvoluted peaks correspond to SAO species (164.6 eV) and sulfate species (168.8 eV) (8.92 of the S 2p total peak area) 21.Comparing the S2p spectra of both samples, a clear shift of 0.3 eV towards lower binding energy can be observed for assigned SnS 2 peak.Such a shift could be due to the weakening of S bond with Sn or S, possibly due to the inclusion of Cu.As is known, Cu has a relatively lower electronegativity value (1.9) in comparison to that of Sn (2.5), S (1.96) or O (3.44).Therefore, in the Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 sample, the electron cloud around S should be denser and as a result, the binding energy of S2p was reduced. The narrow spectrum of O1s in Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 indicates the presence of the first peak at 531.7 eV, which corresponds to oxygen in oxygen-deficient regions of the SnO 2 matrix 32,33 Fig.3 (c).Additionally, surface-adsorbed oxygen of Cu 2 O indicative of existing surface oxygen vacancies could also contribute to the formation of the peak at 531.7 eV 34,35.The second peak at 533.1 eV can be assigned to surface hydroxyl group 36.A high-resolution narrow XPS spectrum for Cu2p in Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 was also acquired and the result is presented in Fig. 3 (d).Two clear main peaks of 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 at 932.1 eV and 952.0 eV, corresponding In this context, we also employed the FTIR technique to understand the chemical structure of as-prepared catalysts see Suppl.presence of characteristic peaks at 545 cm A1 and 625 cm A1, which could be due to stretching vibration of Sn-O and Sn-S bond, respectively 39,40.Moreover, an apparent peak at 468 cm A1 appears for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 sample which can be attributed to the stretching modes of Cu-O vibration 41; this also indicates a possible heterostructure between Cu 2 O and SnS 2 /SnO 2 . The microstructure of as-synthesized catalysts was further analyzed using a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM).Additionally, lattice spacings were determined from intensity line profiles and the corresponding planes of existing species were hence identified.The HRTEM image of SnS 2 /SnO 2 displayed clear lattice fringes, inferring their crystalline nature.The fringe interval of 0.211 nm can be ascribed to the interplanar spacing of (2 1 0) of tetragonal SnO 2 , also shown in Fig. 4(a,c,d,g) 42.Similarly, the lattice spacing of 0.158 nm, 0.163 nm and 0.185 nm corresponds to the interplanar spacing of (2 0 0), (1 0 3) and (1 1 0) of SnS 2 (Fig. 4(a) 434445.For a better understanding, live FFT and d-spacing images of (2 0 0) crystal plane of SnS 2 is provided Fig.4 (d,f).It can be observed that the characteristic lattice fringes of these nanoparticles are well inter-mixed.Fig. 4 (b) shows the interface region of a characteristic heterojunction between SnS 2 inter-mixed with SnO 2 .Some parts of the lattice fringes were distorted (indicated by yellow lines), which could arise from the lack of oxygen atoms in SnO 2 Fig.4 (e) 46,47.Further, HRTEM of Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 reveals that 0.335 nm is the characteristic lattice fringe space of (1 1 0) SnO 2 suppl.Fig. S6 31.Moreover, lattice fringe spacings of 0.2 nm and 0.148 nm can be assigned to (0 0 2) plane of CuO and (2 2 0) plane of Cu 2 O, respectively 48,49. To check the light-harvesting property of as-synthesized photocatalysts, UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra was recorded and converted into the absorption spectra using the Kubelka-Munk Function (Eqs.( 1) and ( 2)) 505152. where, F R 1 ; R; a; S are the Kubelka-Munk function, reflectance, absorption coefficient, and scattering coefficient, respectively.From Fig. 5 (a), SnS 2 /SnO 2 nanocomposite illustrates relatively higher absorption of light in the UV and visible region.On the other hand, Cu 2 O/ SnS 2 /SnO 2 showed higher absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, which could be primarily attributed to the surface plasmonic resonance behavior of copper oxide species 25.Additionally, the insertion of Cu 2 O into SnS 2 /SnO 2 significantly extended the light absorption range to even near-IR.Next, the band gaps E g of the as-prepared catalysts were determined using Eq.(3) based on the theory of optical absorption for indirect band gap semiconductors 53 ahm where, hmand B are discrete photon energy and a constant relative to the material, respectively.The result indicates that the inclusion of Cu 2 O reduced the band gap from 2.2 eV to 1.45 eV suppl.Fig. S7.Also, pristine Cu 2 O possess the band gap of 2.14 eV Fig.S7.Further, to analyze the charge carrier dynamics and charge separation efficacy, we have conducted the photoluminescence (PL) experiment for both samples at the same excitation wavelength of 350 nm in the solid phase.The PL emission originates from e A -h pair recombination events, and a lower PL intensity means efficient separation of photo-generated e A -h pairs.As presented in Fig. 5(b), the recombination events were drastically reduced for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 / SnO 2 , which indicates excellent charge separation efficiency for this catalyst.Possibly, the inclusion of Cu 2 O into SnS 2 /SnO 2 creates more vacancies which act as trapping sites for photo-generated charge carriers (e A -h ) and subsequently, recombination of charge carriers was significantly suppressed.Such properties enable the catalyst to retain electrons in its conduction band for longer, which could certainly promote their photo-catalytic activity.Additionally, a large PL intensity around 2 eV in both catalysts, can be attributed to 'O' defects 54. In the same line, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photocurrent response test were also conducted to explore the migration and recombination behaviors of charge carriers in the as-synthesized catalysts.A smaller arc radius in the EIS Nyquist plot implies a lower resistance for electron migration and in such sample, charge carriers are thus efficiently separated 55.In the present study (see Fig. 5 (c)), Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 illustrates a smaller arc radius, which makes this an efficient photocatalyst as a greater number of charge carriers would be readily available on its surface.Fig. 5 (d) exhibits the transient photocurrent response of the as-prepared catalysts.Upon illumination, Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 showed about 1.5-folds higher photocurrent response than SnS 2 /SnO 2 .This implies that photo-generated (e Ah ) pairs are efficiently separated in Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2, which is in well-agreement with the PL data Fig.5 (b).Notably, the photocurrent response remained constant even after several on/off illumination cycles, suggesting good photoelectrochemical stability for the tested catalysts.From a series of experiment about optical and electronic properties, we can conclude that the vacancies or defects in the catalyst play a significant role in improving the charge separation efficiency and also the light absorption behavior. It is indispensable to investigate the CO 2 photoreduction activity of the as-synthesized photocatalysts to unravel the role of vacancies.Hence, the reaction was performed in the gaseous phase at room temperature, while water was used as a reducing agent or source of H ions without adding any sacrificial agent.In the beginning, a set of controlled experiments was performed in the absence of photocatalyst, light, and (CO 2 H 2 O) gas.In all these experiments, no reduction products (such as CH 4 , CO) were observed Fig.S8.These products were formed only when all three components, i.e. photocatalyst, light, and (CO 2 H 2 O) gas were simultaneously available.Such results also clarify that the identified products were generated only via photocatalytic reduction steps.Moreover, these findings also infer that no adventitious hydrocarbon or sulfate species deposited on the catalyst's surface was erroneously contributed to yield of product. Fig. 6 (a-c) show formation rates of different gaseous products such as CO, CH 4, and H 2, which were obtained after four and eight hours of the experiment.Expectedly, the amount of each product increases with the irradiation time.SnS 2 /SnO 2 has shown a comparatively higher yield of CO and H 2 .In specific, the CO and H 2 formation rate of SnS 2 /SnO 2 in eight hours was 4:63 and 0:9lmolg A1 , respectively.These amounts were higher than those of the Cu 2 O and Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 samples.However, Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 exhibited a greater amount of CH 4 (2:27lmolg A1 ) due to its better reduction ability, inferred from the results provided in Fig. 6 (b). Next, it is crucial to estimate the CO 2 reduction efficiency by using the apparent quantum yield (AQY) 56.Fig S9 provides the AQY values for the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion using as-synthesized catalysts.The AQY can be calculated using Eqs.( 4)-( 7): number of incident photons 14 light absorbed by the photo catalyst average photon energy A t light absorbed by the photo catalyst where, H is the apparent light input Wm A2 , A is the geometric irradiance area m 2.Fig. 6 (c-d) suggests that using Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 , the yield for reduced products of carbon dioxide was higher with time.This implies that the excess amount of water molecules can be adsorbed over the hydrophilic surface of Cu 2 O, which can preferably reduce CO 2 .This is also evident that a relatively lower amount of CO were obtained than H 2 or CH 4 , in the case of pristine hydrophilic Cu 2 O catalyst given in Figs.S10-S12 On the contrary, SnS 2 / SnO 2 nanocomposites split water to give more hydrogen and hence, the reduced products of CO 2 were lower in amount.Next, the stability in photocatalytic performance of as-prepared Cu 2 O, SnS 2 /SnO 2, and Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 catalysts were tested for three cycles and the results are provided in Figs.S10-S12.The results illustrate high consistency in the amount of products (CO, H 2 and CH 4 ) for first three cycles. Furthermore, the spent catalysts were characterized to check their chemical and microstructural stability using FTIR and XRD techniques.Corresponding results are provided in Figs.S13 andS14.The IR results reveal no apparent change in the spectral features of the spent catalysts in comparison to the pristine catalysts, implying that the chemical structure remained same even after three cycles of experiments Fig.S13.Importantly, the XRD pattern of spent Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 reveals no change in crystal structure because no new peaks or any shift in the peak positions were noticed as compared to the freshly prepared catalysts (See Suppl.S14).This also implies that no strain was developed inside the catalyst during the process. Next, in situ DRIFTS experiments were conducted to get an insight into the involved reaction intermediates and the plausible pathways for product formation.Upon illumination, a considerable change in the absorbance values was noticed between 1600 and 1350 cm A1 region Fig.6 (e).Specifically, an increase in absorbance value of peaks related to mono-dentate carbonate (m-CO 3 ) was observed at 1550 cm A1 and 1461 cm A1 .Similarly, signals at 1506 cm A1 and 1363 cm A1 can be attributed to bi-dentate carbonate (bi-CO 3 ) and signal at 1419 cm A1 can be assigned to bi-dentate bicarbonate (bi-HCO 3 ) 575859.Several new peaks cor- responding to formate (HCOO -) species were seen at 1571 cm A1 and 1560 cm A1 ; signal at 1379 cm A1 can be ascribed to formic acid (HCOOH) 60,61.Formic acid may originate from the reaction of CO 2 with two H ions and two electrons.Most importantly, COO - peak was detected at 1538 and 1492 cm A1 57,62. Additionally, peaks at 1479 and 1437 cm A1 can be ascribed to the methoxy and formaldehyde groups, respectively.After two hours of illumination, bending vibration of the CAH group was observed at 1388 cm A1 63,64, which signifies that CO 2 was activated at an early stage and subsequently formed the intermediates which led to generating CH 4 9,65.From the above findings, it can be inferred that the as-synthesized photocatalysts have the potential to reduce CO 2 at room temperature in the gaseous phase.Carbon dioxide requires eight electrons and eight H ions to form methane (R ( 9)).Several species such as COOH, and HCHO which requires lesser electrons, are formed first to participate in intermediate reactions to eventually yield methane (R ( 10)).In the following steps, we also illustrate the reaction steps for the formation of other products such as CO ((R7) and (R8)) and H 2 (R5). The photo-activity of as-synthesized catalysts for nitrogen fixation was examined in a N 2 bubbled water system using a 300 W Xe lamp as the light source.The experiments were conducted continuously for 12 h, and the final NH 4 ion content was determined by Nessler's reagent spectrophotometry method using a UV-vis spectrophotometer Fig.7 ions dramatically increase in the presence of ethanol.Similar results were previously reported by other groups, where it is shown that how a trace amount of sacrificial agents such as ethanol, methanol and other alcohols could produce high concentration of NH 4 ions 666768.Because these sacrificial agents may possibly consume photogenerated holes, which could considerably enhance the charge separation efficiency and result in higher production rate of NH 4 ions.Also, oxidized products of sacrificial agents may be a source of interference for accurate quantification of NH 4 ions using Nessler's reagent method 69. To examine the activation of nitrogen on the surface of the catalyst, an in situ DRIFTS study was conducted to monitor the timedependent change of the N-containing functional groups on the photocatalyst under simulated reaction conditions.The corre- sponding DRIFTS result for Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 is shown in Fig. 7 (d). As can be seen, the intensity of adsorption band related to -NH x species significantly enhanced with N 2 exposure and light illumination, indicating that N 2 can be efficiently adsorbed and further interact with the surface of Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 .In particular, peaks at 3555, 3167, and 2996 cm A1 can be ascribed to m (NAH) stretching mode of NH 3 70,71.A broad and weak peak located at 2876 cm A1 can be assigned to the representative adsorption of NH 4 molecules 71.Also, the peak at 1740 cm A1 is attributed to r (NAH) bending vibration of NH 3 70.Another peak at 1648 cm A1 relates to an antisymmetric deformation vibration of NH 4 72.Furthermore, peaks at 1499 and 1397 cm A1 were associated with the adsorption of NH 3 and NH 4 molecules, respectively 71.Importantly, a signal at 1111 cm A1 corresponding to hydrazine (H 2 N NH 2 ) was observed, but only under light irradiation (Fig. S15) 73.Similar results were reported by Schrauzer et al. who prepared iron-doped TiO 2 by heating iron (iii) sulfateimpregnated anatase TiO 2 ; they have also reported generation of ions were formed even in the absence of H 2 O.We believe that such weak signals could be due to the traces of surface adsorbed water molecules over the as-synthesized catalysts.In the presence of water bubbler, it is evident that excess water was predominantly the source of protons, owing to the intense IR signals of reaction intermediates.These set of experiments also helps in identifying the reaction intermediates, role of water, and subsequently elucidate a plausible reaction mechanism.In general, the reaction pathway for nitrogen fixation over oxide-based catalyst follow associative steps 75, wherein, oxygen vacancies often offer active sites for the chemisorption of nitrogen molecules.In the present contribution, we suggest that the existing oxygen vacancies in the assynthesized catalyst primarily act as an active site to chemisorb nitrogen molecules, which accepts multi-electron and multiproton to eventually generate NH 3 . We conducted ESR spectroscopy to probe the presence of intrinsic defects such as vacancies and interstitials.An ESR spectrometer examines the interaction between magnetic dipoles of unpaired electrons under an applied magnetic field and electromagnetic radiation of the appropriate wavelength 76.Here, we conducted the ESR experiment in dark as well under light at room temperature.The corresponding results are given in Fig. 8 (a).A single Lorentzian line centered at g 2.004 can be attributed to the presence of a single electron trapped in oxygen vacancies at the surface of SnS 2 /SnO 2 77.The presence of oxygen vacancies may affect the electronic structure of the SnS 2 /SnO 2 catalyst.Previous report reveals that the ionized oxygen vacancies in SnO 2 create shallow trap levels with an energy of 0.03 eV and 0.15 eV below the bottom of the conduction band (CBM) 78. As is known, oxygen vacancies tend to facilitate the adsorption as well as the reactivity of various gases such as CO, CO 2 , and O 2 79.Here, the intensity of the same ESR signal dampened upon light irradiation, which could be attributed to the trapping of photogenerated electrons in those shallow trap levels of oxygen vacancies.These trapping sites play a dual role in efficiently increasing the charge separation and also determining product distribution for the tested catalyst. Similarly, a broad ESR signal for Cu 2 indicates the presence of a high concentration of unpaired electrons in the as-prepared catalyst.The intensity of this signal was reduced upon illumination, which could be attributed to the transformation of trace amount of paramagnetic Cu 2 ions to diamagnetic Cu ions via accepting electron12Cu 2 e A !Cu (see Fig. 8 (b)).Such consumption of electrons by Cu 2 ions would considerably suppress the recombination of charge carriers over the surface of catalyst.This result is in good agreement with the above mentioned optical and electronic properties of the as-prepared catalyst Fig.5(b).Also, it should be noted that a relatively higher ESR peak area for Cu 2 O/ SnS 2 /SnO 2 could be due to the presence of intrinsic defects, which was successfully induced during its synthesis.As depicted in Fig. 8 (b), the ESR line was significantly narrowed upon irradiation, which could be primarily attributed to the strong exchange and delocalization of unpaired electrons with the catalyst 80. A favorable position of the conduction band and readily available free electrons are crucial to exhibit higher photocatalytic activity.In principle, the conduction band position should be more negative to reduce CO 2 into CO (A0.51 eV, NHE) and CH 4 (A0.24eV, NHE) as well as fix nitrogen to NH 3 (A0.28eV, NHE) 7,81.In this regard, we performed a valence band (VB) XPS Fig.S18 and Mott-Schottky (MS) analysis to identify the semiconductor type and its flat band potentialE fb (See Fig. 8 (c-d)).This calculation also required band gap values (given in Fig. S7).A possible band diagram of the as-synthesized photocatalysts is provided in Fig. 8 (e). In Fig. 8 (d), SnS 2 /SnO 2 sample shows positive slopes indicating n-type composites.On the other hand, Cu 2 O/SnS 2 /SnO 2 exhibited an inverted 'V-shaped' curves which were a combination of positive as well as negative slope, inferring the successful formation of a p-n heterojunction.The E fb values of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O are measured to be A0.79 and 1.36 eV (vs.Ag/AgCl) from the Mott-Schottky curve, respectively.Additionally, the E fb (vs.Ag/AgCl) of these semiconductors can be to E fb (vs.NHE) by the following formula 25 E fb vs:NHE So, the E fb (vs.NHE) values of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O are A0.593 and 1.557 eV, respectively.As is known, the conduction band (CB) of the n-type semiconductor is 0.1 eV lower thanE fb , and the valence band (VB) of the p-type semiconductor is 0.1 eV higher than E fb 82.Hence, the CB and VB of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O were A0.693 and 1.657 eV, respectively.The band gaps of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O were 2.2 eV and 2.14 eV, respectively Fig.S7.Therefore, the corresponding VB and CB can be obtained using: where, E g is the band gap, E VB is the valence band edge potential, and E CB is the conduction band edge potential.The VB and CB of SnS 2 /SnO 2 and Cu 2 O were calculated to be 1.507 and A0.483 eV, respectively.Interestingly, when the p-n junction of Cu 2 O and SnS 2 /SnO 2 was formed, an equilibration of Fermi levels can be attained (see Fig. 8(e)).Where, light-induced charge carriers can be efficiently separated by the built-in electric field within the space charge region (evidenced from PL and ESR results).The electric field drives the transfer of electrons to the conduction band of the SnS 2 /SnO 2 (a n-type semiconductor) and holes to the valence band of the Cu 2 O (a p-type semiconductor) 82.Moreover, VB XPS also disclose that the introduction of Cu 2 O into the SnS 2 /SnO 2 sample led to the upshifting of the valence band that creates a higher driving force for reduction reaction Fig.S18.We attribute this upshift to the formation of a p-n heterojunction and also, oxygen vacancies.These vacancies created more delocalized states and also led to the formation of shallow traps.Such trapping sites readily hold electrons.Consequently, these traps efficiently separated photo-generated charge carriers and facilitate the photo-activity. Such analyses reveal two important results: (1) Conduction band position of the as-prepared catalysts was sufficiently negative to reduce CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Owing to the band structure, these catalysts were also able to convert N 2 to NH SnS 2 /SnO 2 ) significantly improved photocatalytic activity.Thus, here, composite catalyst was shown to have high reactivity and stability for continuous reduction of CO 2 by water and fixation of N 2 under light irradiation and thus would certainly be a promising strategy for other reactions."}]}}
