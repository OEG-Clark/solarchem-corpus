The powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) patterns of as-synthesized samples are firstly explored, and all the reflections are indexed to tetragonal BiOCl (JCPDS no.06-0249) except for the (00c) peaks that shifted to the small angles after exfoliation (Fig. 1c).Besides, the dramatically decreased intensities of (00c) planes in a-BiOCl also demonstrated the reduction of stacking layer number along the c direction, illustrative of the validity of liquid exfoliation to obtain atomically thin BiOCl nanosheets.Besides, three distinct bands located at 59 cm -1 , 144 cm -1 , and 200 cm -1 are detected in the Raman spectra and separately assigned to external A 1g, A 1g, and E g internal Bi-Cl stretching modes (Fig. 1d) 24.Meanwhile, all the Bi-Cl stretching peaks of the a-BiOCl nanosheet shift towards lower frequencies due to the elongation of the Bi-Cl bonds, which result from the decrease in the interlayer van der Waals forces between chlorine atoms and adjacent planar sheets after exfoliation.Hence, both the pXRD patterns and Raman spectra confirm the validity of the liquid exfoliation strategy to obtain atomically thin BiOCl nanosheets. The morphology and size distribution for b-BiOCl and a-BiOCl are further investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. S2) and dynamic light scattering (DLS, Fig. S3).The lateral sizes of b-BiOCl and a-BiOCl are 100 and 15 nm, respectively, which indicates that the magnitude of the BiOCl nanosheet decreases after exfoliation.Besides, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Fig. S4) and corresponding selected area electron diffractions (SAED) confirm the dominant (001) planes for b-BiOCl and a-BiOCl.To further investigate the vertical morphological evolution, atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments are conducted.The average height for b-BiOCl and a-BiOCl is measured to be 14.774 and 1.483 nm, respectively (Fig. 2a-b). Considering the average height of mono-layer BiOCl (c equals 0.7369 nm in JCPDS no.06-0249, Fig. 1a), the layer numbers for b-BiOCl and a-BiOCl are separately deduced to be 20 and 2. Herein, the decreased layer number for BiOCl could bring about an enlarged bandgap due to the strong quantum confinement.The optimized structures for bulky BiOCl and non-defective 2-layer BiOCl confirmed the elongation of interlayer spacing with reduced layer numbers (Fig. S5), which corresponds to the above XRD results.The projected density of states (PDOS) of bulky BiOCl and non-defective 2-layer BiOCl is subsequently calculated (Fig. S6), which indeed reveals a theoretically enlarged bandgap after exfoliation.Besides, we employ the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra to monitor the atomic coordination environment changes involved in the BiOCl nanosheets.One single Lorentzian line centered at g 2.001 is detected, which can be assigned to the appearance of oxygen vacancy (Fig. 2c) 25.Meanwhile, the gradually increased intensity of the ESR signals illustrated that the oxygen vacancy concentration is in proportion to the exfoliation time.In addition, the surface atomic oxidation state changes between b-BiOCl and a-BiOCl are studied by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS, Fig. 2d) and the downshift of Bi 4f orbitals after exfoliation illustrates the charge accumulation on Bi atom, and its valence state quantitatively alters from 3 to 2.63.The charge redistribution is also validated by the O 1s peaks that shifted to higher binding energy to compensate the charge nonequilibrium (Fig. S7).Simultaneously, the enlarged proportion of lower charged Bi also indicated the increase of oxygen vacancies 26. Given the crystal-face-dependent characteristics of defects and their tremendous differences in photocatalytic properties, precisely securing the position of the oxygen vacancies in BiOCl is of great importance.Therefore, the morphology of BiOCl nanosheets is reconstructed according to the Bravais-Friedel-Donnay-Harker (BFDH) theory (Fig. S8) 27, and further surface energy calculations reveal that the 200 crystal planes truncated with Bi, O, and Cl atoms are the dominant lateral exposed planes (see details in Supplementary Note 1).The formation energies of oxygen vacancies in possible chemical potentials are calculated as well, which illustrated that the lateral ( 200) is an energetically more feasible crystal plane to generate oxygen vacancies under all possible chemical potentials (see details in Supplementary Note 2).To further elucidate the possible electron structures changes of BiOCl (200) with oxygen vacancies O v -BiOCl (200), the PDOS of O v -BiOCl (200) is thereby calculated (Fig. 2e), where shallow donor states mainly consisted of Bi 6p and Cl 3p orbitals appears, which probably contributes to enhance the photoabsorption and improve the separation efficiency of the photoinduced hot carriers 28.More importantly, the generation of oxygen vacancies results in the charge accumulation on the adjacent Bi atoms (Fig. 2f), which may act as dual-metal sites to generate specific stable configurations, such as Bi-C-O-Bi intermediate in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction 29, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity and selectivity. Given the coupled effect of reduced layer number and oxygen vacancy in optical and photoelectrochemical properties of BiOCl, separation of entangled variables can enable the analysis of a single influencing factor.Consequently, the ultraviolet/ozone (UVO) treatment is employed to saturate the oxygen vacancies in a-BiOCl 30.Both the ESR intensities and ratio of oxygen vacancies of UVO treated a-BiOCl gradually decrease along with the processing time (Fig. S9).Meanwhile, both the specific surface area and thickness are nearly unchanged (Fig. S10), indicating that the 2-layer BiOCl nanosheet with a small proportion of oxygen vacancy is obtained.Here, although the oxygen vacancy could not be fully compensated, even prolonging the UVO processing time to 4 h, the correlation between UVO processing time and the amount of oxygen vacancy can still be achieved. To further elucidate the effects of decreased layer numbers and oxygen vacancies in BiOCl nanosheets, we measure their optical and photoelectrochemical properties.The adsorption edges for b-BiOCl, a-BiOCl, and a-BiOCl-UVO-4 h are investigated with UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS, Fig. 3a), and distinct Urbach tails appear due to the trap stated generated by the oxygen vacancies 31.The a-BiOCl-UVO-4 h reveals a similar absorption curve as b-BiOCl, suggesting that the improved absorbance is mainly caused by oxygen vacancies.The time-resolved transient photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra are measured to probe the specific charge carrier dynamics of b-BiOCl, a-BiOCl, and a-BiOCl-UVO-4 h (Fig. 3b).A biexponential kinetics function well fits the emission decay curves, and the decreases of both the emission lifetimes assigned to nonradiative recombination (A 2 ) and average emission lifetime ( m ) for a-BiOCl illustrate the overall emission decay behaviors of BiOCl after exfoliation 32.Meanwhile, the steady-state PL spectra (Fig. S11) also confirm the decreased recombination rate for the photoinduced electron-hole pair, indicating a more efficient charge transfer in a-BiOCl.The similar average emission lifetime in a-BiOCl-UVO-4 h confirms that the oxygen vacancies are responsible for the decreased recombination rate.To more clearly illustrate the charge-transport behavior of BiOCl nanosheets after exfoliation, we further perform the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurement in the absence of light excitation.The EIS Nyquist plots are well matched to the inserted equivalent electrical circuit (Fig. 3c), and the decreased interfacial charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) suggests the enhanced charge-transfer rate in a-BiOCl.Moreover, the variation of charge-carrier density along with exfoliation is further quantitatively evaluated by Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 3d).The derived charge-carrier density value (N d ) for a-BiOCl (4.43 10 19 cm -3 ) is significantly increased compared with that of b-BiOCl (0.71 10 19 cm -3 ) and a-BiOCl-UVO-4 h (0.94 10 19 cm -3 ), indicative of the crucial role of oxygen vacancies in photoinduced charge transfer. Generally, the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts is positively correlated with its light-harvesting ability ( LH ), charge separation ( CS ), and charge injection efficiency ( CI ) 33.To illustrate the effects of layer number and oxygen vacancy on the light-harvesting ability of BiOCl, we further calculate the phonon absorption rates (J abs ) of b-BiOCl and a-BiOCl (Fig. S12).The J abs value of a-BiOCl is greatly increased relative to that of b-BiOCl (J abs -a-BiOCl/ J abs -b-BiOCl equals 2.44 integrated from 350 to 800 nm).Notably, both the enlarged theoretical bandgaps (Fig. S6) and the decreased optical absorption coefficient for theoretical non-defective 2-layer BiOCl (Fig. S13) illustrated that solely reducing the layer numbers of BiOCl nanosheets is detrimental to the light-harvesting ability.To illustrate the effect of exfoliation on CS and CI separately, we further measure the transient photocurrent responses of b-BiOCl and a-BiOCl in mixed Na 2 SO 4 /K 2 S 2 O 8 electrolyte, where K 2 S 2 O 8 serves as an electron scavenger to ensure the value of CI approaching 100 (Fig. 3e) 34.The charge separation and charge injection ratios of a-BiOCl/b-BiOCl deduced from the photocurrent responses are 0.85 and 1.82, respectively, indicating that the exfoliation process mainly contributes to the light-harvesting and charge injection processes.Photocatalysts with a large specific surface area generally can not only supply more active sites but also facilitate the surface charge injection process.However, the photocurrent of a-BiOCl-UVO-4 h (Fig. 3e) reveals no evident increase, and both the charge separation and charge injection ratios of a-BiOCl-UVO-4 h/b-BiOCl deduced from the photocurrent responses are 1.02, suggesting that the enhanced charge injection process is mainly contributed by the oxygen vacancies other than increased surface area. Besides, two-dimensional materials could reveal a strong excitonic effect due to the reduced screening effects 35.Thus, we also perform steady-state fluorescence (PF) and phosphorescence (PH) measurements to check the possible photophysical processes.As shown in Fig. 3f, both the decrease of singlet-triplet energy gap (E st ) and the increased intensity of PH peak illustrated the enhanced excitonic effect in a-BiOCl 36.Therefore, the improved excitons in a-BiOCl should be taken into account in the photocatalytic process related to singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ). On account of the dual-metal site caused by oxygen vacancy, which could generate a specific stable configuration with adsorbed molecules, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity and selectivity, we employed solar-light driven CO 2 reduction to evaluate the photocatalytic activity changes of BiOCl nanosheets.The theoretical potentials of reducing CO 2 to possible C1 compounds (CO, CH 4 , HCOOH, HCHO, and CH 3 OH) versus the energy band diagrams of b-BiOCl and a-BiOCl are plotted in Fig. S14, where the competitive proton reduction to form H 2 is also a possible process.The gaseous products, CO, CH 4 , and H 2 , as well as liquid product CH 3 OH, are detected in both b-BiOCl and a-BiOCl (Fig. 4a).Notably, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of a-BiOCl falls below the theoretical reduction potential for generating CO.In contrast, CO dominated the photoreduction species, especially in a-BiOCl, and its evolution rate is highly dependent on the UVO processing time, which illustrates the mechanism for CO evolution on a-BiOCl must be changed compared to that of b-BiOCl.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity is evaluated with a consecutive photocatalytic reduction measurement (Fig. 4b), and the solar fuel evolution rate almost grew linearly, especially in the initial 4 h, achieving a CO evolution rate of 8.99 mol g -1 h -1 for a-BiOCl, comparable to most of the other up-to-date photocatalysts without sacrificial reagent (Table S1). The correlative factors involved in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction that probably affected the reaction kinetics are further measured.Among others, the retention time of CO 2 on BiOCl nanosheets' surface should be long enough to guarantee the reaction to occur 37.As revealed in Fig. 4c, the adsorption capacities of CO 2 on BiOCl nanosheets are measured, and the CO 2 adsorption capacity is also correlated with the UVO processing time, suggesting that the adsorption capacities of CO 2 are mainly determined by oxygen vacancy rather than the surface area.Briefly, both the CO evolution rate and CO 2 adsorption capacities reveal positive dependency with oxygen vacancies.Furthermore, the mathematic relation between photocatalytic activity and oxygen vacancy is fitted to accurately explore their correspondence, where the photocatalytic activity is evaluated by solar fuel yield, and the oxygen vacancy concentration is assessed in terms of ESR intensity.As depicted in Fig. 4d, a well-fitted linear relationship is obtained, suggesting that the oxygen vacancies in a-BiOCl solely determine the enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Besides, the kinetic properties of the proton photoreduction into H 2 and proton transfer to participating in the CO 2 reduction process are generally competitive 38.Therefore, HCl molecular as a strong proton donor is employed to verify whether the photocatalytic reduction products varied or not.As shown in Fig. S15, the photocatalytic reduction products and corresponding distribution revealed little changes in the acidic environment, indicating that proton transfer to CO 2 and generate intermediates of C1 compounds are energetically more favorable than that of proton reduction to H 2 in a-BiOCl. To further demonstrate the above speculation, the energy profiles for the proton reduction into H 2 and proton transfer to an O atom of CO 2 on O v -BiOCl are calculated (Fig. S16).Both the proton reduction and proton transfer are thermodynamically exothermic processes; meanwhile, the activation energy barrier for proton transfer to CO 2 is much lower, which is in good agreement with the experimental results. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, which is recognized as the most convincing evidence to identify the reactive oxygen species (ROS), is employed to investigate the ROS generated over b-BiOCl and a-BiOCl.As shown in Fig. 4e, the superoxide radical (O 2 -) is identified by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) to reveal the typical signal of DMPO-OOH 39.The generation of O 2 -is considered to be related to hot carriers (photoinduced electrons and holes).Thus, the increased intensity for a-BiOCl relative to b-BiOCl, illustrative of its higher generation and separation efficiency of the photoinduced electron-hole pair, confirms well with the photocatalytic CO 2 activity.Besides, the intensity for a-BiOCl-UVO4 h reveals little change compared to b-BiOCl, suggesting that the improved generation of 4f) 40.The a-BiOCl-UVO4 h reveals a slightly increased intensity, mainly caused by its enhanced excitonic effect.Meanwhile, the largely increased intensity in a-BiOCl illustrates the promoting effect of oxygen vacancy and also indicates the changed pathway for 1 O 2 generation; that is, the 1 O 2 is mainly generated by -oxidation process instead of the energy transfer process in a-BiOCl 41.Herein, we focus on the photocatalytic reduction process, while the photocatalytic oxidation ability is also certainly enhanced simultaneously, as evidenced by the promoted 1 O 2 generation. To elucidate the underlying reasons for the improved photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity and the selectivity for CO conversion, we perform the in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements to detect the possible reaction intermediates involved in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.Six new peaks obviously emerge and gradually increase in b-BiOCl and a-BiOCl with illumination time from 0-60 min (Fig. 5a-b).The absorption peak located at 1150 cm -1 belonged to the CH 3 O group, and the peak around 1210 cm -1 is assigned to the COOH group, which is regarded as a crucial intermediator during CO 2 photocatalytic reduction to CO 42.Besides, the co-adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O could generate monodentate carbonate group (m-CO 3 2-) and bidentate carbonate group (b-CO 3 2-), which appeared at 1317 cm -1 and 1390 cm -1 , respectively 43.Notably, all the intermediates for generating CH 3 OH, CO, and CH 4 are detected, indicating that the pathways for intermediates combining with transferred proton-electron pairs to generate solar fuel directly or convert into other intermediates are competitive.Moreover, the significantly enhanced peak absorbance that is assigned to CO (1960 cm -1 ) in a-BiOCl confirms the above speculation 44, which illustrated the formation of CO intermediate and a stable configuration during the photocatalytic process. To further unravel the energy evolution of the intermediates involved in the photocatalytic processes, the Gibbs free energy diagrams of CO 2 photoreduction on BiOCl (200) and O v -BiOCl (200) are thereby calculated (Detailed Gibbs free energy of CO 2 photoreduction for pristine BiOCl and O v -BiOCl are supplemented in Table S2).As shown in Fig. 5c, the energy barrier for generating COOH group on O v -BiOCl (200) is decreased compared with that on BiOCl (200), facilitating the formation kinetics of COOH.Moreover, the activation energy barrier for CO desorption to generate CO is lower than that of converting to CHO as labeled by the gridlines and reduces even further in O v -BiOCl (200), which accounts for the CO dominating in the solar fuel species.To further elucidate the interaction between CO and O v -BiOCl, the differential charge density is plotted (Fig. 5d), which reveals a relatively weak charge redistribution appeared.The orbitals of the two adjacent Bi atoms in O v -BiOCl and CO molecular are plotted to analyze Bi-C-O-Bi's bonding nature (Fig. 5e).Only energy levels of Bi 6p orbitals and CO 3 and 4 orbitals are partially matched, resulting in weak p- occupied states, which could be easily broken to generate CO molecule and ascribed as the fundamental reason for the selectivity of CO.Moreover, the exfoliation process induces the lattice expansion in BiOCl, as confirmed by the XRD results, and can bring about an up-shift of the Bi d states that is highly related to the surface reactivity.Therefore, we further calculate the d-band centers of BiOCl and O v -BiOCl to confirm the intrinsic reason for the improved CO photocatalytic activity.As shown in Fig. 5f, the d-band center is nearly unchanged with oxygen vacancy, which confirms that the d orbitals in Bi do not participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.Meanwhile, the upshifted p orbitals edge of O v -BiOCl in the valence band also indicates its enhanced photooxidation activity due to oxygen vacancy.Thus, the newly generated weak p- bond involved in Bi-C-O-Bi geometry in a-BiOCl is responsible for the improved CO yield and selectivity."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
