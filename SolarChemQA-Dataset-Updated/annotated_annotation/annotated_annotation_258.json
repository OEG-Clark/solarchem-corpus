The electronic structure of the AgCl material was calculated by the WIEN2K program, 43,44 based on the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method.The exchangecorrelation (xc) energy was treated by the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew-Burke-Ernzenhof (GGA-PBE). 45The plane wave expansion cutoffs were 7.0 for the expanding wave function (RKMAX).1000 k-points were used in the complete Brillouin zone.The self-consistent calculations were considered to be converged when the energy difference is less than 10 A5 Ry.Since the GGA oen underestimates the band-gap values, the onsite Coulomb interaction or electron correlation (U) for Ag 4d was considered in the rotationally invariant way. 46A series of U values (8.00-13.92eV) had been tested.We employed the results from U 14 13.92 eV for discussion which was also adopted for Ag 3 PO 4 in a previous calculation. 47"}, {"llm generation": "Glycerol", "source": "Glycerol has been found to be a favourable reaction medium to design uniformly shaped nanomaterials due to its high viscosity at low temperatures, which herein may signicantly reduce the diffusion coefficients of both Ag and Cl A ions to slow down the precipitation reaction.", "context": "Glycerol has been found to be a favourable reaction medium to design uniformly shaped nanomaterials due to its high viscosity at low temperatures, which herein may signicantly reduce the diffusion coefficients of both Ag and Cl A ions to slow down the precipitation reaction. 28Under this principle, strongly colored Ag/AgCl NPs with a uniform coaxial tri-cubic morphology can be facilely prepared by controlling the reaction temperature and time (Fig. 1A).PVP herein serves as a capping agent to stabilize the resulting AgCl NPs and prevent agglomeration.Further, the polymeric chains of PVP also enhance the overall viscosity of the reaction solution and facilitate the morphology control of Ag/ AgCl NPs.The strong reducibility of glycerol at high temperature promotes the generation of Ag 0 species on the surface of AgCl NPs.Typical SEM images of the as-prepared Ag/AgCl NPs before and aer the photocatalysis reaction are presented in Fig. 1, S2 and S3 (see the ESI ).As shown in the SEM images, the as-prepared Ag/AgCl NPs display similar diameters of 500-600 nm and a uniform coaxial tri-cubic morphology with smooth surfaces (Fig. 1F-G).The digital image (Fig. 1E) of the dispersion of the red Ag/AgCl sample (1 mg mL A1 ) reveals the megascopic red colour of the red AgCl sample, which is remarkably different from the commonly observed milky white AgCl NPs (see the ESI, Fig. S5 ). The crystal structure of the red Ag/AgCl sample is examined by means of XRD (Fig. 2A).The XRD pattern of the Ag/AgCl sample displays distinct diffraction peaks (2q) at 27.8 (111), 32.2 (200), 46.2 (220), 54.8 (311), 57.5 (222), 67.5 (400), 74.5 (331), and 76.8 (420), which correspond well to the diffractions of crystalline AgCl (JCPDS le: 31-1238).Additionally, we note that the diffraction peaks (2q) at 38.1 (111) and 44.3 (200) are indexed to the metallic Ag (JCPDS le: 65-2871), indicating that Ag 0 nanospecies are produced on the surface of AgCl.This can be partially ascribed to the strong reducibility of glycerol at high temperatures, which facilitates the generation of Ag 0 nanospecies during the synthesis procedure.The lattice parameter of the red Ag/AgCl NPs is calculated to be 5.55 A, which is also equal to the theoretical values (5.549 A). 48Further, no characteristic peaks belonging to impurities or other phases are detected, indicating that the as-obtained product is solely composed of metallic Ag and AgCl. The surface chemical composition and chemical states of the as-prepared samples are conrmed by XPS spectroscopy (Fig. 2B-D).As shown in the survey XPS spectrum (Fig. 2B), the peaks of Ag, Cl, C, and O can be obviously detected.The carbon and oxygen peaks are largely attributed to the adventitious impurities from the XPS instrument itself.Fig. 2C presents the characteristic Ag 3d bands.The two bands at ca. 367.2 and 373.2 eV can be attributed to the Ag 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 binding energies respectively.Furthermore, the peaks of Ag 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 could be deconvoluted into peaks at 367.2, 368.2 eV, 373.2 and 374.2 eV, respectively.The peaks at 368.2 and 374.2 eV are attributed to metallic Ag 0 , whereas the peaks at 367.2 and 373.2 eV are for Ag inside AgCl.The XPS spectra of Cl 2p (Fig. 2D) display two bands at ca. 197.9 and 199.6 eV, which are tted with Cl 2p 1 and 2p 3 binding energies respectively. Generally, materials can only be strongly coloured if they strongly absorb light. 49The optical absorption of the asprepared Ag/AgCl photocatalysts is herein demonstrated by the UV-vis diffuse reectance spectra (Fig. 2E).Commonly, due to the large bandgap (about 3.2 eV), bare AgCl materials show negligible absorption in the visible region. 11,27Compared with TiO 2 (P25), however, both the two types of AgCl materials show distinct absorptions in the visible region.The enhancement could be assertively attributed to the collective electronic oscillation by LSPR of the Ag 0 species.More importantly, the asprepared red Ag/AgCl samples absorb more energy in the visible region than normal Ag/AgCl materials.The main reason could be attributed to the increased quantity of Ag 0 species on the surface of red AgCl NPs than common AgCl materials (see the ESI, Fig. S6 ).In addition, the Mie scattering effect cannot be ignored.Owing to the unique coaxial tri-cubic morphology of the red Ag/AgCl NPs, the photon path length in the surface of the semiconductor is signicantly increased, which also enhances the optical adsorption.And the Mie scattering could also facilitate the generation of metallic Ag, which supports the LSPR effect in turn.Fig. 2F reveals the corresponding bandgap estimation based on the Kubelka-Munk theory.The asprepared Ag/AgCl sample shows a smaller apparent bandgap value than normal Ag/AgCl and TiO 2 materials, which further demonstrates the enhanced optical absorption capacity. The photocatalytic oxidative and reductive performances of the as-obtained Ag/AgCl photocatalysts are evaluated quantitatively by degradation of the methyl orange (MO) dye, reduction of Cr VI and conversion of CO 2 into liquid hydrocarbon fuels under visible light irradiation (Fig. 3).The degradation dynamic curves of MO over different photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 3A.The real-time concentration variation of MO (C/C 0 , C 0 14 10 mg L A1 ) is measured by means of the normalized absorption value (A/A 0 , l 14 463 nm) at the given time intervals (see the ESI, Fig. S7 ). 10 Prior to irradiation, the reaction system was kept in the dark for 30 min to reach an adsorption equilibrium state.As the degradation process follows a pseudo-rst-order reaction, we calculated the corresponding degradation rate constant (k MO ) in terms of the sudden drop in the MO concentration occurring over the rst 2 min of irradiation.The red Ag/AgCl photocatalysts exhibit an efficient activity (k R MO 14 0.39 min A1 ), twice higher than normal Ag/AgCl materials (k N MO 14 0.16 min A1 ).As shown in Fig. 3A, the MO solution can be decolorized completely with the red Ag/AgCl NPs as catalysts aer exposure to visible-light irradiation for 8 min.The HPLC analysis further conrmed the photodegradation of MO (see the ESI, Fig. S11 ). Carcinogenic hexavalent chromium is the primary pollutant in chromium-containing waste water.As the toxicity of chromium is related to its oxidation states, transforming it to a more benign form represents an effective approach to handle pollution.As reported, reduction of Cr VI to Cr III has been This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 accomplished many times via photocatalysis. 25,50As shown in Fig. 3B, the Cr VI concentration decreased gradually with increasing irradiation time and the as-obtained red Ag/AgCl photocatalysts exhibit higher activities for Cr VI reduction than both normal Ag/AgCl and TiO 2 under visible irradiation.The real-time concentration variation of the dissolved Cr VI is determined colorimetrically by the normalized absorption value (A/A 0 , l 14 540 nm, see the ESI, Fig. S8 ) by means of the reaction with diphenylcarbazide (DCP) in acid solution.The results indicate that almost all of Cr VI was reduced aer irradiation for 12 min using the red Ag/AgCl photocatalysts, while only 78 and 15 of Cr VI was detoxied using normal AgCl and TiO 2 materials.Blank experiments without irradiation and experiments in the absence of photocatalyst demonstrate that the concentration of hexavalent chromium remained unchanged.The reduction of Cr VI manifests the efficient photocatalytic reductive activity of the as-obtained red Ag/AgCl NPs. Among the numerous methods developed so far, photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to liquid hydrocarbon fuels represents a promising strategy to deal with the greenhouse effect and energy crisis.However, the pioneering of highly efficient CO 2 photoreduction still remains a challenging task.Silver halides have been proven to be promising materials to reduce CO 2 under visible light irradiation due to the more negative conduction band (CB) edges than 4 Q (CO 2 /CH 3 OH) and 4 Q (CO 2 / C 2 H 5 OH) (A0.38 and A0.085 eV vs. NHE). 28,51Herein, the photoreductive ability of the as-prepared red Ag/AgCl NPs has also been evaluated in terms of CO 2 reduction.Comparison of the photocatalytic product yields of the as-prepared red Ag/AgCl NPs and normal AgCl materials is shown in Fig. 3C.The methanol and ethanol yields for the red Ag/AgCl samples are 146 and 223 mmol g A1 , both of which are higher than those of normal AgCl materials (106 and 163 mmol g A1 for methanol and ethanol, respectively).Furthermore, we measured the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the CO 2 reduction reaction in terms of the ferrioxalate actinometer method (Fig. 3C). 41The results show that the AQE of the red Ag/AgCl samples reaches 2.46, higher than the normal AgCl materials (1.79).For comparison, experiments without catalyst and without light irradiation were also carried out, and no organic matter could be detected. For the purpose of practical application, the stability of the as-prepared red Ag/AgCl photocatalysts was also evaluated in terms of recycling the photocatalysts several times for the three types of photocatalytic reactions (see the ESI, Fig. S9, S10 and3C).The slight shrinkage of catalytic activity can be attributed to a small loss of the catalyst during the cycling reaction.These results manifest the chemical stability of the red Ag/AgCl photocatalysts. To provide an in-depth physical perspective into the activity of the red Ag/AgCl photocatalysts, the band structure and densities of states (DOSs) of AgCl were calculated using DFT (Fig. 4, S12 and S13 ).According to the calculated DOSs (see the ESI, Fig. S12 and S13 ), both the conduction and valence band (CB and VB) of the AgCl material are composed of Cl 3p and Ag 4d states, whereas Ag 4d states contribute little to the composition of CB.And because of the participation of Ag 4d states in the construction of valence band maximum (VBM) which could induce relatively localized photoholes, the AgCl material can be referred to as a typical electron-conductive semiconductor.As shown in the energy-band diagram (Fig. 4), the AgCl material is found to be an indirect bandgap semiconductor, and the indirect electronic transition can be seen from L to G point with a bandgap value of 2.8 eV.Due to the favourable CB level, there occurs a strong electronic coupling between the CB of Ag 0 species and the AgCl semiconductor, thus greatly promoting the photoinduced electron injection from Ag into AgCl. 31As shown in Fig. 4, moreover, the highly dispersive CB and VB provide favourable support to facilitate the transport of photoinduced charge carriers, which is a signicant process for photocatalysis. The synergistic effect between metallic Ag NPs and the n-type AgCl semiconductor introduces several signicant improvements to the red Ag/AgCl photocatalytic system. 1 First, the featured LSPR brings several signicant benets: (i) drastically enhances the visible-light absorption, (ii) creates an intensive local electric eld and (iii) powers the excitation of charge carriers. 15,52Second, the Schottky junction resulted from the contact of Ag and AgCl builds up an internal electric eld in the space-charge region, which considerably enhances the separation of the photoinduced charge carriers and suppresses their recombination. 1,53Third, the surface plasmon induces the polarization effect, which enhances the adsorption, and localized heating effect, which boosts the reaction rate and benets the mass transfer. 3,5455556 To sum up, the optical absorption and utilization efficiency, local electric eld, generation and separation of photoinduced charge carriers, temperature dependence, interaction with molecules, etc. are greatly enhanced within the Ag/AgCl photocatalytic system. 57In addition to the intrinsic properties, the higher photoactivity of the red AgCl photocatalysts can also be ascribed to their larger surface area (1.673 m 2 g A1 for red AgCl and 1.382 m 2 g A1 for normal AgCl, see the ESI, Fig. S4 ). As illustrated in Fig. 4, when the red Ag/AgCl photocatalysts are subjected to visible light irradiation, generation of electrons and holes is boosted by means of LSPR.The increased electron density disequilibrates the Fermi level and thus impels the energetic electron-transfer from Ag to the CB of AgCl. 10 During the photocatalytic process, nonpolar reactant molecules (CO 2 ) are polarized and polar molecules (MO and Cr VI ) are activated for better adsorption by the surface plasmon. 56Then the adsorbed oxides are reduced directly with the electrons, while the oxidation is catalyzed directly by holes or by the reactive oxidative species (O 2 c A , H 2 O 2 and Cl 0 ) which are resulted from the electrons. 1,10"}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
