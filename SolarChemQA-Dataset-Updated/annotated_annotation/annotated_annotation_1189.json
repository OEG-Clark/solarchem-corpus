First, FeWO 4 ultrathin nanoflakes were fabricated.Then, FeWO 4 ultrathin nanoflakes were added to the solution containing the precursor of NiAl-LDH to obtain NiAl-LDH/ FeWO 4 follow-like spherical Z-scheme heterostructure. The pristine FeWO 4 nanopartiles was fabricated by adopting the strategy mentioned in previous report 34.The complex was constructed by hydrothermal strategy.In a typical process, a certain mass of as-fabricated FeWO 4 nanoparticles were dispersed in 100 mL of water and subjected to ultrasonication for 30 min.Then, 1.7447 g Ni (NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O and 0.7503 g Al (NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O were added into the above FeWO 4 suspension and ultrasonicated for another 15 min.Subsequently, 2.4024 g urea and 0.592 g NH 4 F were dissolved into the mixed solution and stirred for 30 min.The acquired suspension was thermally treated in a 100 mL sealed Teflon-lined autoclave at 120 C for 24 h.The resulting precipitate was washed with water several times until the pH reached and dried in an oven at 60 C overnight.FeWO 4 /LDH photocatalysts with different mass ratios were obtained by changing the dosage of FeWO 4 , which were marked as 5 FeWO 4 /LDH, 10 FeWO 4 /LDH, 15 FeWO 4 /LDH, respectively.Furthermore, the original LDH was constructed by the same procedure without adding FeWO 4 . The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was determined on a Bruker D8 powder diffractometer using Cu K radiation ( 0.154 nm) to analyze the crystalline structures of catalyst samples with scanning velocity of 0.02 /min.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Phillips Model, CM200) were used for analyzing the morphology of FeWO 4 /NiAl-LDH.The element distribution was determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Hitachi, S-4800).The N 2 adsorption-desorption, specific surface area, and pore structure of catalysts were detected by utilizing a Quantachrome device (Autosorb-iQ-AG).The optical properties were determined using UV-vis Diffuse Reflectance spectrum (UV-vis DRS, Shimadzu, UV3600), as well as photoluminescence spectrum on fluorescence spectrophotometer (PL, Hitachi, F-4600). The photoelectrochemical test of the photocatalysts was completed with reference to our previous work 35,36.The activity for CO photoreduction was measured at Labsolar-6A system (Perfect Light Co., China) using a 300 W Xenon-arc lamp with a 3 AM 1.5 G filter to simulate sunlight irradiation.50 mg of samples was added into the reactor in each experimental run.The acquired solution was vacuumtreated for 30 min under constantly stirring.Afterwards, the suspension was filled with CO 2 (99.999) at 100 kPa for 30 min to reach the equilibrium of adsorption-desorption. Apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the photocatalyst was calculated using the following equation 28."}]}}
