defect-rich TiO 2 catalysts show excellent photocatalytic H 2 generation and CO 2 reduction performance.On the basis of the experimental characterization and quantum chemical calculations, the introduced oxygen vacancies strongly anchored the single-atom Pt on the surface of the catalyst with enhanced Pt-substrate interactions and thereby avoiding aggregation of Pt atoms, while the loaded

"3.1.Characterization and Analysis.As displayed in Figure 1a, the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different calcination temperatures exhibited narrow and intense XRD peaks of 2 25.3, 37.8, and 48.0, which corresponds to the (101), (004), and (200) crystallographic planes of the anatase TiO 2 structure, respectively. 56With the increased annealing temperature, the corresponding diffraction peak became sharper, implying a more perfect lattice structure.The rutile phase can be observed in the sample prepared at 700 C, similar to the XRD pattern of pristine P25 TiO 2 , maybe suggesting a reduced photoactivity of the final catalyst.The influence of the heat treatment duration on the V O -rich-TiO 2 phase structures is also described in Figure S1.Although the diffraction peaks were slightly increased, a nearly negligible difference was found when the calcining time was set to 1-12 h, meaning that the calcining time had little effect on the catalyst phase structures.To assess the effect of the loaded Pt metal, we performed an XRD measurement of the 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).After Pt loading, the intensity of the diffraction peak corresponding to anatase TiO 2 was weakened drastically compared with the peak of the sample before Pt loading, indicating the decreased crystallinity of the catalyst, which may derive from the formation of more surface area oxygen vacancies that cause residual stress. 57It can be also reflected from the enlarge view of 15-35that a slightly broadening on the FWHM may be induced by the residual stress deriving from the newly generated oxygen defects and the reduced crystalline size (Figure S2).Analogical phenomena have been observed in Bi-based compounds, 58,59 ZnO and CeO 2 . 60,61This finding was consistent with ESR and DFT calculation results revealing that single Pt atom can promote the formation of the more surface oxygen vacancies (see below).Contrastingly, the intensity of the XRD peaks of the Pt-loaded P25 TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies only show slight decrement than that of P25 (Figure S3).The phase structure of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different temperatures was further studied by Raman spectra because of their strong scattering properties.In Figure 1c, the four typical characterized Raman bands at wavenumbers of 144, 397, 515, and 639 cm -1 are indexed obviously as the symmetric E g , B 1g , A 1g , and E g Raman-active modes of the anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 62The increased annealing temperature leads to the gradually decreased half peak width of the strongest peak located at 144 cm -1 , which reflects the vibration of O-Ti-O, suggesting a more perfect crystallization of the catalyst.For V O -TiO 2 -700, the weak peak located at 446 cm -1 showed the emergence of the rutile phase, similar to the peak observed in the P25 TiO 2 spectrum (445 cm -1 ).Likewise, the intensity of The Journal of Physical Chemistry C D the Raman peak of V O -TiO 2 -500 clearly decreased after the single Pt atom loading (Figure 1d), while the intensity of the Raman peak obtained for Pt-P25 TiO 2 slightly decreased (Figure S4), corresponding to the XRD results.These findings may hint a presence of an interaction between V O and the supported single Pt atom. The morphology and structure of the TAN precursor and V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 used as a representative sample were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and TEM.The TAN precursor of O-defect-rich TiO 2 has a layered structure (Figure 2a) with a distance of approximately 0.8 nm between the adjacent layers. 63After annealing at 500 C, V O -TiO 2 -500 shows irregular particles (Figure 2b) with clear (101) anatase phase titania crystallographic planes having d s 0.33 nm, indicating the formation of anatase phase titania, as confirmed by XRD (Figure 2c).When the photo-deposition method was used to decorate Pt nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO 2 , the same lattice fringes with d s 0.33 nm could be observed, indicating that the loading of Pt has no impact on the crystal structure of TiO 2 (Figure 2d).But a vague border in the V O -TiO 2 -500 sample can be found when loading Pt, which may also hint the presence of an interaction between Pt and V O .Meanwhile, no difference on the morphology was observed for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 before and after single Pt atom loading (Figures 2b andS5).It should be noted that no corresponding signals related to crystalline Pt species are detected in the XRD patterns of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).Not only that, the presence of Pt nanoparticles was not observed obviously, too (Figures 2d andS5), suggesting a high dispersion of Pt species.The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings show the uniform distribution of Pt, Ti, and O elements (Figure 2f).The Pt loading content determined by ICP-OES was about 0.36.In view of this, HAADF-STEM was carried out, where the dispersion of Pt species at the atomic scale was observed clearly as several isolated bright dots signed by red circles, indicating the existence of atomically dispersed Pt (Figures 2e andS6).From Table S1, after calcining the TANs, a clear decrease in the specific surface areas was detected from 390.6 m 2 g -1 for the TANs to 297.7, 174.2, and 128.0 m 2 g -1 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively, which is attributed to the change in the morphology from TANs to irregular nanoparticles after annealing.The increased calcination temperature leads to the decreased catalytic specific surface area because the high temperature makes the grains grow and even sinter, resulting in the serious collapse of small channels or the blockage of channels. To study the defect structure of TiO 2 , ESR spectra were collected.All the catalysts except for P25 TiO 2 (Figure S7a) exhibit a strong ESR signal at g 2.0 (Figures 3a andS7), indicating the existence of oxygen vacancies in their structure. 33,64,65Upon increasing the heat-treatment temperature, the ESR signal of 2.0 becomes much stronger, showing that more O vacancy defects are formed in the catalysts structures (Figure S7b).Conversely, prolonging the heattreatment time seems to be detrimental to the generation of more oxygen vacancies, and the annealing time of 2 h is applicable (Figure S7c).Fascinatingly, the obvious increase in the ESR signal intensity is found for Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b), indicating a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, which may be related to the inducing effect of single Pt atom, promoting more oxygen vacancy defects to form on the surface/subsurface, corresponding to DFT calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). To give further evidence of the increased oxygen vacancy defects, PALS measurements of before and after single Pt atom supporting for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 were conducted to test the lifetime of the positron.As shown in Figure 4, 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 gave longer average positron lifetime than its counterpart, which results from the positron trapped by O vacancy defects.The positron lifespan spectra of V O rich-TiO 2 sample gave two lifetime constituents, 1 and 2 , accompanied by corresponding relative intensities, I 1 and I 2 (Table S2).The shorter constituent ( 1 ) is usually ascribed to the free annihilation of positrons in a defect-free crystal, called as the The Journal of Physical Chemistry C first lifespan of positrons. 66In an unordered system, little vacancies or shallow positron trap from oxygen vacancies may result in the decreased electron density of the surrounding to increase the lifetime of 1 . 67Compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 1 0.202 ns), the prolonged 1 (0.208 ns) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 shows that large numbers of oxygen vacancy defects were incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice by Pt atoms loading.Accordingly, the relative intensity (I 1 ) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 also increased sharply from 10.63 in V O -TiO 2 -500 to 15.35 in 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500. 68The longer lifetime component 2 was ascribed to the positron annihilation captured by O vacancies, 66 hinting that the longer value of 2 (0.387 ns) for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 revealed the increase of oxygen vacancies concentration compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 2 0.365 ns).It is worth noting that the increase of 2 was 86.1 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while it is 44.7 for V O -TiO 2 -500 compared with 1 , which means the generation of a huge number of boundarylike defects after Pt atoms loading 68 clearly related to the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies corresponding to theoretical calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). The surface chemical states and constituent elements of V O -TiO 2 -T (T 400, 500, 600 C) and 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 were analyzed by means of XPS technology and the results are described in Figure 5 to further expound the interaction between the oxygen vacancies and single Pt atom.The survey spectra presented in Figure 5a show that the Ti, O, and C elements from reference exist for all the samples.No signal corresponding to the Pt element is detected in the survey spectrum of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 because of the lower practical Pt loading.In the Ti 2p spectra (Figure 5b), compared to V O -TiO 2 -400 (Ti 2p 3/2 : 458.53 eV), the Ti 2p 3/2 peaks of V O -TiO 2 -500 (458.06 eV) and V O -TiO 2 -600 (458.14 eV) shift obviously to lower binding energies, which is closely connected to the generation of the more oxygen vacancy defects in the two samples, inducing a changed chemical environment of the titanium ions, as shown by the ESR results.Surprisingly, the distinct decrease and larger shift to a high binding energy were found for the 1 Pt-loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample.The similar changes were observed in O 1 s spectra of the 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample (Figure 5c).The peaks at 531.30 and 529.80 eV can be, respectively, indexed to the oxygen atoms in the neighborhood of oxygen vacancies and O bond of Ti-O-Ti. 21After loading single Pt atom, the O 1s peaks shift to high binding energies, accompanied by a sharp decrease in the peak intensity.This finding could be explained as follows: (i) the decreasing intensity of the Ti 2p peak and O 1s peak for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 is due to the Pt loading, which impairs the detection sensitivity of the instrument for Ti and O; (ii) the shifting of the binding energy values may be related to the strong single Pt atom-TiO 2 substrate interaction, which would anchor strongly single Pt atom on the TiO 2 surface to accumulate more electrons for the photocatalytic reaction because of the strong stabilizing ability resulting from vacancies.Nevertheless, except for the aforementioned change, careful study shows that the peak corresponding to the O atoms around the oxygen vacancy defects becomes more intense upon single Pt atom loading, and the integral-area ratios of the peak at 532.60 eV (O 1s peak for the oxygen vacancies) to the peak at 530.20 eV (O 1s peak for the lattice oxygen) were determined to be 0.35 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while this is 0.095, 0.081, and 0.092 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively (Figure S8).This obviously suggested the increased content of oxygen vacancies The Journal of Physical Chemistry C F due to the interaction of the atomically dispersed Pt and oxygen vacancies promoting to generate more oxygen vacancy defects on the surface/subsurface of the catalyst by strongly decreasing the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, corresponding to ESR, PALS, and the theoretical calculation results (see the Theoretical Calculation section). 37In Figure 5d, the typical XPS spectra of Pt 4f centered at 70.26 and 73.90 eV showed the Pt metallic state.Moreover, the two peaks located at 72.60 and 75.60 eV indicates of the presence of platinum oxide. 69igure 6a gives the absorbance versus wavelength plots of the P25, TAN, and V O -rich-TiO 2 -based samples.Compared to the TAN precursor material, the absorption of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples shifts to longer wavelength, obviously because of the influence of the oxygen vacancy formation.Nevertheless, the difference between the absorptions of the different V O -rich-TiO 2 samples with different oxygen vacancy concentrations is negligible and similar to that of P25, which indicates that no obvious visible light absorption is generated by the introduced oxygen vacancies in the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples, as reported by the literature. 21Additionally, the same conclusion could also be drawn based on the absorptions of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples prepared with the different heat-treatment times (Figure S9).To get the effect of the isolated single Pt atom, the UV-vis absorption spectra of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25-TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies were obtained.Surprisingly, after Pt atom loading, significant visible-light-driven absorption is found for the Pt-loaded V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which is associated with the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies (Figure 6b). 37,38Nevertheless, almost no change is observed for the absorption of Pt-deposited P25 in comparison with that of the pristine P25 (the inset of Figure 6b).These findings show again that a strong interaction existed between single Pt atom and oxygen vacancy defects for the Pt atom-decorated V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which corresponds to To study the dynamics of electron transfer on the interface of the catalysts, the transient I-t curves were measured with light-on and light-off cycles.As displayed in Figure 7a, the introduced oxygen vacancy defects brought about higher photocurrent values for all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, especially V O -TiO 2 -500 with a maximum photocurrent of 0.45 mA, which is almost 2.7 and 16 times as high as that of the P25 and TAN samples.This could occur because the formed oxygen vacancy defects captured electrons and thus suppressed the recombination of photoinduced charges. 70Figure 7b displays Nyquist curves with arc-like distribution patterns and the corresponding equivalent circuit.The smaller arc radius at a low frequency is usually connected to the charge migration at the interface of the semiconductor and in the electrolyte of the tested electrode. 71According to the radius of the Nyquist plots, the V O -rich TiO 2 samples exhibit a smaller charge transfer resistance (R3) compared with the TAN precursor, as shown by the I-t results.Among the samples, V O -TiO 2 -500 demonstrates the smallest charge transfer resistance than the other two V O -TiO 2 samples and P25 TiO 2 , meaning that the charge transportation at the interface is faster for V O -TiO 2 -500.Figure 7c presents the PL emission spectra of the as-obtained V O -rich TiO 2 samples using P25 and TAN as references at an excited wavelength of 400 nm to prove the improved separation efficiency of the e --h pairs upon introducing oxygen vacancies.The decay of the PL signals for all the V Orich TiO 2 catalysts is sharp in comparison with that of the P25 and TAN reference samples, indicating that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies significantly inhibited the annihilation of the photoinduced electrons and holes. 72The V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample shows the weakest PL emission, demonstrating the best carrier separation efficiency, which means that a more robust photocatalytic process can occur over it.However, introducing excess oxygen vacancies leads to an enhanced PL emission (such as V O -TiO 2 -600) because the excess O defects can be viewed as the recombination centers of the e --h pairs, which impacts the photoreactivity of the sample.Generally, the carrier density could affect the dynamic performance and photocatalytic activity of the catalysts.Therefore, the Mott-Schottky tests of P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 were performed to determine the different donor densities of the two photocatalysts, as described in Figure 7d.The two samples show typical characteristics of an n-type semiconductor with a positive slope.The donor density can be reflected by the magnitude of the slope, and the slope reduces with the increased donor density. 73In comparison with P25 TiO 2 , the much smaller slope of V O -TiO 2 -500 indicated a higher donor density originating from the contribution of oxygen vacancies formed by annealing the TANs, which would significantly promote the carrier transfer and photocatalytic activity. 3.2.Theoretical Calculations.The aforementioned experimental characterization results showed that a strong synergistic effect existed between the oxygen vacancies and loaded single Pt atom.To better understand such a mechanism, we studied the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with and without V O defects in the framework of the KS DFT.Therein, configurations where that V O s exist on the surface, subsurface, and inner layers are considered (Figure S10).When a Pt atom adsorbs on a clean A-TiO 2 (101) surface, O 2c -O 3c -O 2c site is the most favorable site (Figure 8a), as proved by many reports, 747576 so we adopt this model directly (Figure 8b).The calculated adsorption energy of the single Pt atom on the clean surface is -2.89 eV (Table 1).Meanwhile, on the A-TiO 2 (101) surface with different oxygen vacancy concentrations, the adsorption energy of the single Pt atom 1).In other words, a surface V O has an anchoring effect on the loaded Pt 1 , which is consistent with the previous study that surface defects can strongly affect the stability of single atom-catalyst. 76,77ven more fascinating is that the formation energy of the V O s obviously decreases upon loading with Pt, especially for surface and subsurface V O s.In the absence of Pt loading, the formation energies of the surface and subsurface O vacancies are 3.31 and 4.00 eV, respectively, and they decreased to1.92 and 3.46 eV after loading the single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst (Table 1).Nevertheless, the deposited of the Pt atom seems to have no clear effect on the formation energies of the interior oxygen vacancies.These results indicated that, based on the formation energies, the loaded single Pt atom more strongly favors the formation of surface/subsurface oxygen vacancies than the V O s in the bulk as proved by the increased ESR signal over 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b) and PALS (Figure 4). Generally, the formation of V O s generates extra electrons in TiO 2 nanomaterials, increasing the electron concentration, which favors the improved photocatalytic efficiency.However, note that the bulk and surface/subsurface V O s have different influences on the photoreactivity.In stark contrast to bulk V O s generally served as the charge carrier recombination centers, surface/subsurface V O s have proven to be helpful for the efficient separation of the photoinduced electron and hole pairs.The surface/subsurface V O s give rise to more donor electrons localized on the surface region, facilitating the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and thereby improving the photoactivity of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples. 26ccording to our experimental result, the sample that single Pt atom with more V O s showed higher activity.To further determine how surface vacancy interplay with Pt 1 and improve photocatalytic activity, we studied the charge distribution of the Pt/TiO 2 system.Based on our Bader charge analysis, when Pt 1 react with V O 1, it obtains 0.94 e, indicating charge transfers from the substrate to Pt atom.As a comparison, when Pt reacts with a clean surface or surface with inner V O s, it will lose charge, indicating charge will migrate from the Pt atom to substate.This point can also be supported by our charge density difference analysis (Figure S11).Hence, it is reasonable that for the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with surface V O s, such defect provides more electrons and thus increases the carrier concentration.These electrons may transfer quickly to the loaded single Pt atom, the photocatalytic active site, and participate in the photocatalytic reactions on the surface and, consequently, improve photocatalytic efficiency.The Journal of Physical Chemistry C pubs.acs.org/JPCCenhanced hydrogen production rates (667, 1077, and 651 mol h -1 , respectively, for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600) compared to the P25 (344 mol h -1 ) and TAN (239 mol h -1 ) samples without oxygen vacancies.The best H 2 -production rate of 1077 mol h -1 was obtained by V O -TiO 2 -500, which is approximately three times that of P25 (Figure 9a).It is unquestionably related to the contribution of the introduced oxygen vacancies, whose existence remarkably increases the donor density in the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, thereby promoting carrier transfer to the surface and causing more electrons to participate in the photocatalysis reaction under the same irradiation.The higher concentration of V O defects does not seem to be good for H 2 evolution because excess oxygen vacancies become recombination centers of e -h pairs, impairing the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. 72dditionally, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) was also measured and calculated according to similar photocatalytic reaction conditions by using a 365 nm UV light bandpass filter (see the Supporting Information).Specifically, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample (21.7) was 3.14 times as high as that of P25 TiO 2 (6.9), implying that the oxygen vacancy defect-rich sample shows a better photocatalytic performance.To perform a systematic study, the effect of the pH, Pt deposition amount, and sacrificial agents on the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance was also studied.The maximal H 2 evolution rate was obtained at a pH 4.7 0.3 (Figure S12a).The excess deposition of Pt leads to the gradual deterioration of the hydrogen production rate, which may be due to more active surface sites covered by the Pt (Figure S12b). 22Using methyl alcohol as the electron donor, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 evolution from water was shown by the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples (Figure S12c).Figure 9b shows the photocatalytic stability of V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25, and the H 2 production by the two samples does not clearly decrease over four cycles, especially for V O -TiO 2 -500.The TON values have also been calculated to evaluate the long-term test stability of catalysts for H 2 production and the results are listed in the Supporting Information (Table S3).It should be noted that the TON of V O -TiO 2 -500 for H 2 evolution is clearly higher than that of P25 TiO 2 , suggesting that the obtained V O defect-rich TiO 2 sample in this work can serve as a practical photocatalyst to improve the photocatalytic H 2 generation activity.As increasing the annealing time, the attenuated photocatalytic H 2 formation rates may be related to the decreased V O concentration (Figure S12d). The gradually increasing emission of CO 2 into the atmosphere caused by burning fossil fuels generates problems of global warming for our society.The reduction of CO 2 with the aid of sunlight-driven photocatalysis technology not only leads to the decreased amount of CO 2 greenhouse gas, relieving global greenhouse effects but also converts CO 2 to value-added fuels, solving the energy problem. 78,79Therefore, we carried out the photoreduction test of CO 2 with H 2 O over the as-obtained catalysts using UV-vis light irradiation in pure water without any sacrificial agents to avoid interference, and the results are described in Figure 10.Clearly, the amounts of CH 4 and CO over all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples are significantly larger than those over the commercial P25 TiO 2 .In particular, V O -TiO 2 -500 exhibits the highest yields of CH 4 and CO with Pt single atoms loading as cocatalyst but without H 2 formation, which is almost 2.2 and 2.3 times higher than that achieved by P25 TiO 2 , respectively (Table S5).The higher selectivity for CH 4 than that of CO over all the catalysts is due to the Pt cocatalyst loading. 12Simultaneously, the AQE for CO 2 conversion has also been obtained.The AQE of the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst (V O -TiO 2 -500) is 0.064, which is almost 18-fold of commercial P25 TiO 2 .Figure 11 shows the cycle measurement results of the P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.During the four cycles, the generation rates of the CH 4 and CO did not show the obvious decrease, displaying a good stability for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and at the same time exhibiting a fascinating application potential for the photoconversion of CO 2 with H 2 O.The TON values of CO 2 photoreduction to generate CO and CH 4 have also been calculated (Table S4), in which the V O -TiO 2 -500 shows the clearly enhanced TON values compared to P25 TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction. CO 2 reduction to produce CH 4 is an eight-electron process, which requires gathering the more photogenerated charge carriers with a long lifetime. 80The Pt atom strongly anchored with the help of the large of oxygen vacancies can promote more electrons to accumulate on the surface of the catalyst, leading to a higher catalytic performance of the catalyst.In the work, without any sacrificial agents being added, CO 2 is the only carbon source.For it, control photocatalytic experiments were conducted under identical conditions but using N 2 as the carrier gas replacing CO 2 , in which no CO or CH 4 product could be detected, indicating that carbides in this experiment did not originate from carbon contamination.In addition, the theoretical calculation and experiment results show that CO 2 can be strongly adsorbed on V O existing on the TiO 2 surface and the activation barrier of CO 2 reduction can be greatly reduced. 81,82At the same time, the generated V O can be viewed as reactive sites to promote the activation of CO 2 to form CO 2 -, which could enhance the product rate of CO and The Journal of Physical Chemistry C CH 4 . 82The photoinduced holes in the VB can be oxidated by the adsorbed hydroxyl species to form O 2 . In a word, based on the abovementioned experimental and DFT calculation results, under the same Pt loading, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 photoreduction performance shown by the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples was undoubtedly related to the synergistic action of the O vacancies and isolated single Pt atom.The existence of surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies strongly anchored single Pt atom onto the surface of the catalyst, and in turn, the loaded single-atomic-site Pt bring about the generation of more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies, as illustrated in Figures 3b,4 and Table S2, by decreasing the formation energy of an O vacancy on the surface and subsurface, according to the DFT calculation.While the existence of more oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 increased the donor density not only promoting the carrier transfer but also making more electrons accumulate in the sink provided by single Pt atom to participate in the photoreaction, thus promoting the photoactivity.The theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the O defects on the surface of TiO 2 favor the adsorption and activation of CO 2 by the strong actions with the O atoms of CO 2 and the effective generation of CO 2 intermediates, leading to the dissociation of CO 2 . 78,79The CO 2 adsorption measurements were therefore carried out under environmental conditions of 298 K at low pressure, as presented in Figure S13.These measurements show that the CO 2 adsorption capacity at 298 K and 1 atm (760 mmHg) over V O -TiO 2 -500 could reach 10.94 cm 3 /g, while that is 7.09 cm 3 /g over P25 TiO 2 .The abovementioned result indicates that the introduced V O defects endow our prepared TiO 2 sample with an enhanced CO 2 adsorption capacity, improving its photocatalytic activity.It is just derived from the synergistic effect of V O and loaded single Pt atom, the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst obtained by us showed the enhanced H 2 product and CO 2 reduction performance."},

"3.1.Characterization and Analysis.As displayed in Figure 1a, the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different calcination temperatures exhibited narrow and intense XRD peaks of 2 25.3, 37.8, and 48.0, which corresponds to the (101), (004), and (200) crystallographic planes of the anatase TiO 2 structure, respectively. 56With the increased annealing temperature, the corresponding diffraction peak became sharper, implying a more perfect lattice structure.The rutile phase can be observed in the sample prepared at 700 C, similar to the XRD pattern of pristine P25 TiO 2 , maybe suggesting a reduced photoactivity of the final catalyst.The influence of the heat treatment duration on the V O -rich-TiO 2 phase structures is also described in Figure S1.Although the diffraction peaks were slightly increased, a nearly negligible difference was found when the calcining time was set to 1-12 h, meaning that the calcining time had little effect on the catalyst phase structures.To assess the effect of the loaded Pt metal, we performed an XRD measurement of the 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).After Pt loading, the intensity of the diffraction peak corresponding to anatase TiO 2 was weakened drastically compared with the peak of the sample before Pt loading, indicating the decreased crystallinity of the catalyst, which may derive from the formation of more surface area oxygen vacancies that cause residual stress. 57It can be also reflected from the enlarge view of 15-35that a slightly broadening on the FWHM may be induced by the residual stress deriving from the newly generated oxygen defects and the reduced crystalline size (Figure S2).Analogical phenomena have been observed in Bi-based compounds, 58,59 ZnO and CeO 2 . 60,61This finding was consistent with ESR and DFT calculation results revealing that single Pt atom can promote the formation of the more surface oxygen vacancies (see below).Contrastingly, the intensity of the XRD peaks of the Pt-loaded P25 TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies only show slight decrement than that of P25 (Figure S3).The phase structure of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different temperatures was further studied by Raman spectra because of their strong scattering properties.In Figure 1c, the four typical characterized Raman bands at wavenumbers of 144, 397, 515, and 639 cm -1 are indexed obviously as the symmetric E g , B 1g , A 1g , and E g Raman-active modes of the anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 62The increased annealing temperature leads to the gradually decreased half peak width of the strongest peak located at 144 cm -1 , which reflects the vibration of O-Ti-O, suggesting a more perfect crystallization of the catalyst.For V O -TiO 2 -700, the weak peak located at 446 cm -1 showed the emergence of the rutile phase, similar to the peak observed in the P25 TiO 2 spectrum (445 cm -1 ).Likewise, the intensity of The Journal of Physical Chemistry C D the Raman peak of V O -TiO 2 -500 clearly decreased after the single Pt atom loading (Figure 1d), while the intensity of the Raman peak obtained for Pt-P25 TiO 2 slightly decreased (Figure S4), corresponding to the XRD results.These findings may hint a presence of an interaction between V O and the supported single Pt atom. The morphology and structure of the TAN precursor and V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 used as a representative sample were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and TEM.The TAN precursor of O-defect-rich TiO 2 has a layered structure (Figure 2a) with a distance of approximately 0.8 nm between the adjacent layers. 63After annealing at 500 C, V O -TiO 2 -500 shows irregular particles (Figure 2b) with clear (101) anatase phase titania crystallographic planes having d s 0.33 nm, indicating the formation of anatase phase titania, as confirmed by XRD (Figure 2c).When the photo-deposition method was used to decorate Pt nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO 2 , the same lattice fringes with d s 0.33 nm could be observed, indicating that the loading of Pt has no impact on the crystal structure of TiO 2 (Figure 2d).But a vague border in the V O -TiO 2 -500 sample can be found when loading Pt, which may also hint the presence of an interaction between Pt and V O .Meanwhile, no difference on the morphology was observed for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 before and after single Pt atom loading (Figures 2b andS5).It should be noted that no corresponding signals related to crystalline Pt species are detected in the XRD patterns of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).Not only that, the presence of Pt nanoparticles was not observed obviously, too (Figures 2d andS5), suggesting a high dispersion of Pt species.The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings show the uniform distribution of Pt, Ti, and O elements (Figure 2f).The Pt loading content determined by ICP-OES was about 0.36.In view of this, HAADF-STEM was carried out, where the dispersion of Pt species at the atomic scale was observed clearly as several isolated bright dots signed by red circles, indicating the existence of atomically dispersed Pt (Figures 2e andS6).From Table S1, after calcining the TANs, a clear decrease in the specific surface areas was detected from 390.6 m 2 g -1 for the TANs to 297.7, 174.2, and 128.0 m 2 g -1 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively, which is attributed to the change in the morphology from TANs to irregular nanoparticles after annealing.The increased calcination temperature leads to the decreased catalytic specific surface area because the high temperature makes the grains grow and even sinter, resulting in the serious collapse of small channels or the blockage of channels. To study the defect structure of TiO 2 , ESR spectra were collected.All the catalysts except for P25 TiO 2 (Figure S7a) exhibit a strong ESR signal at g 2.0 (Figures 3a andS7), indicating the existence of oxygen vacancies in their structure. 33,64,65Upon increasing the heat-treatment temperature, the ESR signal of 2.0 becomes much stronger, showing that more O vacancy defects are formed in the catalysts structures (Figure S7b).Conversely, prolonging the heattreatment time seems to be detrimental to the generation of more oxygen vacancies, and the annealing time of 2 h is applicable (Figure S7c).Fascinatingly, the obvious increase in the ESR signal intensity is found for Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b), indicating a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, which may be related to the inducing effect of single Pt atom, promoting more oxygen vacancy defects to form on the surface/subsurface, corresponding to DFT calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). To give further evidence of the increased oxygen vacancy defects, PALS measurements of before and after single Pt atom supporting for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 were conducted to test the lifetime of the positron.As shown in Figure 4, 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 gave longer average positron lifetime than its counterpart, which results from the positron trapped by O vacancy defects.The positron lifespan spectra of V O rich-TiO 2 sample gave two lifetime constituents, 1 and 2 , accompanied by corresponding relative intensities, I 1 and I 2 (Table S2).The shorter constituent ( 1 ) is usually ascribed to the free annihilation of positrons in a defect-free crystal, called as the The Journal of Physical Chemistry C first lifespan of positrons. 66In an unordered system, little vacancies or shallow positron trap from oxygen vacancies may result in the decreased electron density of the surrounding to increase the lifetime of 1 . 67Compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 1 0.202 ns), the prolonged 1 (0.208 ns) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 shows that large numbers of oxygen vacancy defects were incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice by Pt atoms loading.Accordingly, the relative intensity (I 1 ) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 also increased sharply from 10.63 in V O -TiO 2 -500 to 15.35 in 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500. 68The longer lifetime component 2 was ascribed to the positron annihilation captured by O vacancies, 66 hinting that the longer value of 2 (0.387 ns) for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 revealed the increase of oxygen vacancies concentration compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 2 0.365 ns).It is worth noting that the increase of 2 was 86.1 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while it is 44.7 for V O -TiO 2 -500 compared with 1 , which means the generation of a huge number of boundarylike defects after Pt atoms loading 68 clearly related to the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies corresponding to theoretical calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). The surface chemical states and constituent elements of V O -TiO 2 -T (T 400, 500, 600 C) and 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 were analyzed by means of XPS technology and the results are described in Figure 5 to further expound the interaction between the oxygen vacancies and single Pt atom.The survey spectra presented in Figure 5a show that the Ti, O, and C elements from reference exist for all the samples.No signal corresponding to the Pt element is detected in the survey spectrum of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 because of the lower practical Pt loading.In the Ti 2p spectra (Figure 5b), compared to V O -TiO 2 -400 (Ti 2p 3/2 : 458.53 eV), the Ti 2p 3/2 peaks of V O -TiO 2 -500 (458.06 eV) and V O -TiO 2 -600 (458.14 eV) shift obviously to lower binding energies, which is closely connected to the generation of the more oxygen vacancy defects in the two samples, inducing a changed chemical environment of the titanium ions, as shown by the ESR results.Surprisingly, the distinct decrease and larger shift to a high binding energy were found for the 1 Pt-loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample.The similar changes were observed in O 1 s spectra of the 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample (Figure 5c).The peaks at 531.30 and 529.80 eV can be, respectively, indexed to the oxygen atoms in the neighborhood of oxygen vacancies and O bond of Ti-O-Ti. 21After loading single Pt atom, the O 1s peaks shift to high binding energies, accompanied by a sharp decrease in the peak intensity.This finding could be explained as follows: (i) the decreasing intensity of the Ti 2p peak and O 1s peak for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 is due to the Pt loading, which impairs the detection sensitivity of the instrument for Ti and O; (ii) the shifting of the binding energy values may be related to the strong single Pt atom-TiO 2 substrate interaction, which would anchor strongly single Pt atom on the TiO 2 surface to accumulate more electrons for the photocatalytic reaction because of the strong stabilizing ability resulting from vacancies.Nevertheless, except for the aforementioned change, careful study shows that the peak corresponding to the O atoms around the oxygen vacancy defects becomes more intense upon single Pt atom loading, and the integral-area ratios of the peak at 532.60 eV (O 1s peak for the oxygen vacancies) to the peak at 530.20 eV (O 1s peak for the lattice oxygen) were determined to be 0.35 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while this is 0.095, 0.081, and 0.092 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively (Figure S8).This obviously suggested the increased content of oxygen vacancies The Journal of Physical Chemistry C F due to the interaction of the atomically dispersed Pt and oxygen vacancies promoting to generate more oxygen vacancy defects on the surface/subsurface of the catalyst by strongly decreasing the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, corresponding to ESR, PALS, and the theoretical calculation results (see the Theoretical Calculation section). 37In Figure 5d, the typical XPS spectra of Pt 4f centered at 70.26 and 73.90 eV showed the Pt metallic state.Moreover, the two peaks located at 72.60 and 75.60 eV indicates of the presence of platinum oxide. 69igure 6a gives the absorbance versus wavelength plots of the P25, TAN, and V O -rich-TiO 2 -based samples.Compared to the TAN precursor material, the absorption of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples shifts to longer wavelength, obviously because of the influence of the oxygen vacancy formation.Nevertheless, the difference between the absorptions of the different V O -rich-TiO 2 samples with different oxygen vacancy concentrations is negligible and similar to that of P25, which indicates that no obvious visible light absorption is generated by the introduced oxygen vacancies in the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples, as reported by the literature. 21Additionally, the same conclusion could also be drawn based on the absorptions of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples prepared with the different heat-treatment times (Figure S9).To get the effect of the isolated single Pt atom, the UV-vis absorption spectra of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25-TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies were obtained.Surprisingly, after Pt atom loading, significant visible-light-driven absorption is found for the Pt-loaded V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which is associated with the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies (Figure 6b). 37,38Nevertheless, almost no change is observed for the absorption of Pt-deposited P25 in comparison with that of the pristine P25 (the inset of Figure 6b).These findings show again that a strong interaction existed between single Pt atom and oxygen vacancy defects for the Pt atom-decorated V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which corresponds to To study the dynamics of electron transfer on the interface of the catalysts, the transient I-t curves were measured with light-on and light-off cycles.As displayed in Figure 7a, the introduced oxygen vacancy defects brought about higher photocurrent values for all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, especially V O -TiO 2 -500 with a maximum photocurrent of 0.45 mA, which is almost 2.7 and 16 times as high as that of the P25 and TAN samples.This could occur because the formed oxygen vacancy defects captured electrons and thus suppressed the recombination of photoinduced charges. 70Figure 7b displays Nyquist curves with arc-like distribution patterns and the corresponding equivalent circuit.The smaller arc radius at a low frequency is usually connected to the charge migration at the interface of the semiconductor and in the electrolyte of the tested electrode. 71According to the radius of the Nyquist plots, the V O -rich TiO 2 samples exhibit a smaller charge transfer resistance (R3) compared with the TAN precursor, as shown by the I-t results.Among the samples, V O -TiO 2 -500 demonstrates the smallest charge transfer resistance than the other two V O -TiO 2 samples and P25 TiO 2 , meaning that the charge transportation at the interface is faster for V O -TiO 2 -500.Figure 7c presents the PL emission spectra of the as-obtained V O -rich TiO 2 samples using P25 and TAN as references at an excited wavelength of 400 nm to prove the improved separation efficiency of the e --h pairs upon introducing oxygen vacancies.The decay of the PL signals for all the V Orich TiO 2 catalysts is sharp in comparison with that of the P25 and TAN reference samples, indicating that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies significantly inhibited the annihilation of the photoinduced electrons and holes. 72The V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample shows the weakest PL emission, demonstrating the best carrier separation efficiency, which means that a more robust photocatalytic process can occur over it.However, introducing excess oxygen vacancies leads to an enhanced PL emission (such as V O -TiO 2 -600) because the excess O defects can be viewed as the recombination centers of the e --h pairs, which impacts the photoreactivity of the sample.Generally, the carrier density could affect the dynamic performance and photocatalytic activity of the catalysts.Therefore, the Mott-Schottky tests of P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 were performed to determine the different donor densities of the two photocatalysts, as described in Figure 7d.The two samples show typical characteristics of an n-type semiconductor with a positive slope.The donor density can be reflected by the magnitude of the slope, and the slope reduces with the increased donor density. 73In comparison with P25 TiO 2 , the much smaller slope of V O -TiO 2 -500 indicated a higher donor density originating from the contribution of oxygen vacancies formed by annealing the TANs, which would significantly promote the carrier transfer and photocatalytic activity. 3.2.Theoretical Calculations.The aforementioned experimental characterization results showed that a strong synergistic effect existed between the oxygen vacancies and loaded single Pt atom.To better understand such a mechanism, we studied the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with and without V O defects in the framework of the KS DFT.Therein, configurations where that V O s exist on the surface, subsurface, and inner layers are considered (Figure S10).When a Pt atom adsorbs on a clean A-TiO 2 (101) surface, O 2c -O 3c -O 2c site is the most favorable site (Figure 8a), as proved by many reports, 747576 so we adopt this model directly (Figure 8b).The calculated adsorption energy of the single Pt atom on the clean surface is -2.89 eV (Table 1).Meanwhile, on the A-TiO 2 (101) surface with different oxygen vacancy concentrations, the adsorption energy of the single Pt atom 1).In other words, a surface V O has an anchoring effect on the loaded Pt 1 , which is consistent with the previous study that surface defects can strongly affect the stability of single atom-catalyst. 76,77ven more fascinating is that the formation energy of the V O s obviously decreases upon loading with Pt, especially for surface and subsurface V O s.In the absence of Pt loading, the formation energies of the surface and subsurface O vacancies are 3.31 and 4.00 eV, respectively, and they decreased to1.92 and 3.46 eV after loading the single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst (Table 1).Nevertheless, the deposited of the Pt atom seems to have no clear effect on the formation energies of the interior oxygen vacancies.These results indicated that, based on the formation energies, the loaded single Pt atom more strongly favors the formation of surface/subsurface oxygen vacancies than the V O s in the bulk as proved by the increased ESR signal over 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b) and PALS (Figure 4). Generally, the formation of V O s generates extra electrons in TiO 2 nanomaterials, increasing the electron concentration, which favors the improved photocatalytic efficiency.However, note that the bulk and surface/subsurface V O s have different influences on the photoreactivity.In stark contrast to bulk V O s generally served as the charge carrier recombination centers, surface/subsurface V O s have proven to be helpful for the efficient separation of the photoinduced electron and hole pairs.The surface/subsurface V O s give rise to more donor electrons localized on the surface region, facilitating the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and thereby improving the photoactivity of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples. 26ccording to our experimental result, the sample that single Pt atom with more V O s showed higher activity.To further determine how surface vacancy interplay with Pt 1 and improve photocatalytic activity, we studied the charge distribution of the Pt/TiO 2 system.Based on our Bader charge analysis, when Pt 1 react with V O 1, it obtains 0.94 e, indicating charge transfers from the substrate to Pt atom.As a comparison, when Pt reacts with a clean surface or surface with inner V O s, it will lose charge, indicating charge will migrate from the Pt atom to substate.This point can also be supported by our charge density difference analysis (Figure S11).Hence, it is reasonable that for the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with surface V O s, such defect provides more electrons and thus increases the carrier concentration.These electrons may transfer quickly to the loaded single Pt atom, the photocatalytic active site, and participate in the photocatalytic reactions on the surface and, consequently, improve photocatalytic efficiency.The Journal of Physical Chemistry C pubs.acs.org/JPCCenhanced hydrogen production rates (667, 1077, and 651 mol h -1 , respectively, for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600) compared to the P25 (344 mol h -1 ) and TAN (239 mol h -1 ) samples without oxygen vacancies.The best H 2 -production rate of 1077 mol h -1 was obtained by V O -TiO 2 -500, which is approximately three times that of P25 (Figure 9a).It is unquestionably related to the contribution of the introduced oxygen vacancies, whose existence remarkably increases the donor density in the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, thereby promoting carrier transfer to the surface and causing more electrons to participate in the photocatalysis reaction under the same irradiation.The higher concentration of V O defects does not seem to be good for H 2 evolution because excess oxygen vacancies become recombination centers of e -h pairs, impairing the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. 72dditionally, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) was also measured and calculated according to similar photocatalytic reaction conditions by using a 365 nm UV light bandpass filter (see the Supporting Information).Specifically, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample (21.7) was 3.14 times as high as that of P25 TiO 2 (6.9), implying that the oxygen vacancy defect-rich sample shows a better photocatalytic performance.To perform a systematic study, the effect of the pH, Pt deposition amount, and sacrificial agents on the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance was also studied.The maximal H 2 evolution rate was obtained at a pH 4.7 0.3 (Figure S12a).The excess deposition of Pt leads to the gradual deterioration of the hydrogen production rate, which may be due to more active surface sites covered by the Pt (Figure S12b). 22Using methyl alcohol as the electron donor, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 evolution from water was shown by the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples (Figure S12c).Figure 9b shows the photocatalytic stability of V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25, and the H 2 production by the two samples does not clearly decrease over four cycles, especially for V O -TiO 2 -500.The TON values have also been calculated to evaluate the long-term test stability of catalysts for H 2 production and the results are listed in the Supporting Information (Table S3).It should be noted that the TON of V O -TiO 2 -500 for H 2 evolution is clearly higher than that of P25 TiO 2 , suggesting that the obtained V O defect-rich TiO 2 sample in this work can serve as a practical photocatalyst to improve the photocatalytic H 2 generation activity.As increasing the annealing time, the attenuated photocatalytic H 2 formation rates may be related to the decreased V O concentration (Figure S12d). The gradually increasing emission of CO 2 into the atmosphere caused by burning fossil fuels generates problems of global warming for our society.The reduction of CO 2 with the aid of sunlight-driven photocatalysis technology not only leads to the decreased amount of CO 2 greenhouse gas, relieving global greenhouse effects but also converts CO 2 to value-added fuels, solving the energy problem. 78,79Therefore, we carried out the photoreduction test of CO 2 with H 2 O over the as-obtained catalysts using UV-vis light irradiation in pure water without any sacrificial agents to avoid interference, and the results are described in Figure 10.Clearly, the amounts of CH 4 and CO over all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples are significantly larger than those over the commercial P25 TiO 2 .In particular, V O -TiO 2 -500 exhibits the highest yields of CH 4 and CO with Pt single atoms loading as cocatalyst but without H 2 formation, which is almost 2.2 and 2.3 times higher than that achieved by P25 TiO 2 , respectively (Table S5).The higher selectivity for CH 4 than that of CO over all the catalysts is due to the Pt cocatalyst loading. 12Simultaneously, the AQE for CO 2 conversion has also been obtained.The AQE of the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst (V O -TiO 2 -500) is 0.064, which is almost 18-fold of commercial P25 TiO 2 .Figure 11 shows the cycle measurement results of the P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.During the four cycles, the generation rates of the CH 4 and CO did not show the obvious decrease, displaying a good stability for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and at the same time exhibiting a fascinating application potential for the photoconversion of CO 2 with H 2 O.The TON values of CO 2 photoreduction to generate CO and CH 4 have also been calculated (Table S4), in which the V O -TiO 2 -500 shows the clearly enhanced TON values compared to P25 TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction. CO 2 reduction to produce CH 4 is an eight-electron process, which requires gathering the more photogenerated charge carriers with a long lifetime. 80The Pt atom strongly anchored with the help of the large of oxygen vacancies can promote more electrons to accumulate on the surface of the catalyst, leading to a higher catalytic performance of the catalyst.In the work, without any sacrificial agents being added, CO 2 is the only carbon source.For it, control photocatalytic experiments were conducted under identical conditions but using N 2 as the carrier gas replacing CO 2 , in which no CO or CH 4 product could be detected, indicating that carbides in this experiment did not originate from carbon contamination.In addition, the theoretical calculation and experiment results show that CO 2 can be strongly adsorbed on V O existing on the TiO 2 surface and the activation barrier of CO 2 reduction can be greatly reduced. 81,82At the same time, the generated V O can be viewed as reactive sites to promote the activation of CO 2 to form CO 2 -, which could enhance the product rate of CO and The Journal of Physical Chemistry C CH 4 . 82The photoinduced holes in the VB can be oxidated by the adsorbed hydroxyl species to form O 2 . In a word, based on the abovementioned experimental and DFT calculation results, under the same Pt loading, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 photoreduction performance shown by the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples was undoubtedly related to the synergistic action of the O vacancies and isolated single Pt atom.The existence of surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies strongly anchored single Pt atom onto the surface of the catalyst, and in turn, the loaded single-atomic-site Pt bring about the generation of more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies, as illustrated in Figures 3b,4 and Table S2, by decreasing the formation energy of an O vacancy on the surface and subsurface, according to the DFT calculation.While the existence of more oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 increased the donor density not only promoting the carrier transfer but also making more electrons accumulate in the sink provided by single Pt atom to participate in the photoreaction, thus promoting the photoactivity.The theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the O defects on the surface of TiO 2 favor the adsorption and activation of CO 2 by the strong actions with the O atoms of CO 2 and the effective generation of CO 2 intermediates, leading to the dissociation of CO 2 . 78,79The CO 2 adsorption measurements were therefore carried out under environmental conditions of 298 K at low pressure, as presented in Figure S13.These measurements show that the CO 2 adsorption capacity at 298 K and 1 atm (760 mmHg) over V O -TiO 2 -500 could reach 10.94 cm 3 /g, while that is 7.09 cm 3 /g over P25 TiO 2 .The abovementioned result indicates that the introduced V O defects endow our prepared TiO 2 sample with an enhanced CO 2 adsorption capacity, improving its photocatalytic activity.It is just derived from the synergistic effect of V O and loaded single Pt atom, the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst obtained by us showed the enhanced H 2 product and CO 2 reduction performance."}, {"llm generation": "catalysts", "source": "All the catalysts except for P25 TiO 2 (Figure S7a) exhibit a strong ESR signal at g 2.0 (Figures 3a andS7), indicating the existence of oxygen vacancies in their structure.", "context": "3.1.Characterization and Analysis.As displayed in Figure 1a, the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different calcination temperatures exhibited narrow and intense XRD peaks of 2 25.3, 37.8, and 48.0, which corresponds to the (101), (004), and (200) crystallographic planes of the anatase TiO 2 structure, respectively. 56With the increased annealing temperature, the corresponding diffraction peak became sharper, implying a more perfect lattice structure.The rutile phase can be observed in the sample prepared at 700 C, similar to the XRD pattern of pristine P25 TiO 2 , maybe suggesting a reduced photoactivity of the final catalyst.The influence of the heat treatment duration on the V O -rich-TiO 2 phase structures is also described in Figure S1.Although the diffraction peaks were slightly increased, a nearly negligible difference was found when the calcining time was set to 1-12 h, meaning that the calcining time had little effect on the catalyst phase structures.To assess the effect of the loaded Pt metal, we performed an XRD measurement of the 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).After Pt loading, the intensity of the diffraction peak corresponding to anatase TiO 2 was weakened drastically compared with the peak of the sample before Pt loading, indicating the decreased crystallinity of the catalyst, which may derive from the formation of more surface area oxygen vacancies that cause residual stress. 57It can be also reflected from the enlarge view of 15-35that a slightly broadening on the FWHM may be induced by the residual stress deriving from the newly generated oxygen defects and the reduced crystalline size (Figure S2).Analogical phenomena have been observed in Bi-based compounds, 58,59 ZnO and CeO 2 . 60,61This finding was consistent with ESR and DFT calculation results revealing that single Pt atom can promote the formation of the more surface oxygen vacancies (see below).Contrastingly, the intensity of the XRD peaks of the Pt-loaded P25 TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies only show slight decrement than that of P25 (Figure S3).The phase structure of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different temperatures was further studied by Raman spectra because of their strong scattering properties.In Figure 1c, the four typical characterized Raman bands at wavenumbers of 144, 397, 515, and 639 cm -1 are indexed obviously as the symmetric E g , B 1g , A 1g , and E g Raman-active modes of the anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 62The increased annealing temperature leads to the gradually decreased half peak width of the strongest peak located at 144 cm -1 , which reflects the vibration of O-Ti-O, suggesting a more perfect crystallization of the catalyst.For V O -TiO 2 -700, the weak peak located at 446 cm -1 showed the emergence of the rutile phase, similar to the peak observed in the P25 TiO 2 spectrum (445 cm -1 ).Likewise, the intensity of The Journal of Physical Chemistry C D the Raman peak of V O -TiO 2 -500 clearly decreased after the single Pt atom loading (Figure 1d), while the intensity of the Raman peak obtained for Pt-P25 TiO 2 slightly decreased (Figure S4), corresponding to the XRD results.These findings may hint a presence of an interaction between V O and the supported single Pt atom. The morphology and structure of the TAN precursor and V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 used as a representative sample were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and TEM.The TAN precursor of O-defect-rich TiO 2 has a layered structure (Figure 2a) with a distance of approximately 0.8 nm between the adjacent layers. 63After annealing at 500 C, V O -TiO 2 -500 shows irregular particles (Figure 2b) with clear (101) anatase phase titania crystallographic planes having d s 0.33 nm, indicating the formation of anatase phase titania, as confirmed by XRD (Figure 2c).When the photo-deposition method was used to decorate Pt nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO 2 , the same lattice fringes with d s 0.33 nm could be observed, indicating that the loading of Pt has no impact on the crystal structure of TiO 2 (Figure 2d).But a vague border in the V O -TiO 2 -500 sample can be found when loading Pt, which may also hint the presence of an interaction between Pt and V O .Meanwhile, no difference on the morphology was observed for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 before and after single Pt atom loading (Figures 2b andS5).It should be noted that no corresponding signals related to crystalline Pt species are detected in the XRD patterns of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).Not only that, the presence of Pt nanoparticles was not observed obviously, too (Figures 2d andS5), suggesting a high dispersion of Pt species.The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings show the uniform distribution of Pt, Ti, and O elements (Figure 2f).The Pt loading content determined by ICP-OES was about 0.36.In view of this, HAADF-STEM was carried out, where the dispersion of Pt species at the atomic scale was observed clearly as several isolated bright dots signed by red circles, indicating the existence of atomically dispersed Pt (Figures 2e andS6).From Table S1, after calcining the TANs, a clear decrease in the specific surface areas was detected from 390.6 m 2 g -1 for the TANs to 297.7, 174.2, and 128.0 m 2 g -1 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively, which is attributed to the change in the morphology from TANs to irregular nanoparticles after annealing.The increased calcination temperature leads to the decreased catalytic specific surface area because the high temperature makes the grains grow and even sinter, resulting in the serious collapse of small channels or the blockage of channels. To study the defect structure of TiO 2 , ESR spectra were collected.All the catalysts except for P25 TiO 2 (Figure S7a) exhibit a strong ESR signal at g 2.0 (Figures 3a andS7), indicating the existence of oxygen vacancies in their structure. 33,64,65Upon increasing the heat-treatment temperature, the ESR signal of 2.0 becomes much stronger, showing that more O vacancy defects are formed in the catalysts structures (Figure S7b).Conversely, prolonging the heattreatment time seems to be detrimental to the generation of more oxygen vacancies, and the annealing time of 2 h is applicable (Figure S7c).Fascinatingly, the obvious increase in the ESR signal intensity is found for Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b), indicating a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, which may be related to the inducing effect of single Pt atom, promoting more oxygen vacancy defects to form on the surface/subsurface, corresponding to DFT calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). To give further evidence of the increased oxygen vacancy defects, PALS measurements of before and after single Pt atom supporting for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 were conducted to test the lifetime of the positron.As shown in Figure 4, 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 gave longer average positron lifetime than its counterpart, which results from the positron trapped by O vacancy defects.The positron lifespan spectra of V O rich-TiO 2 sample gave two lifetime constituents, 1 and 2 , accompanied by corresponding relative intensities, I 1 and I 2 (Table S2).The shorter constituent ( 1 ) is usually ascribed to the free annihilation of positrons in a defect-free crystal, called as the The Journal of Physical Chemistry C first lifespan of positrons. 66In an unordered system, little vacancies or shallow positron trap from oxygen vacancies may result in the decreased electron density of the surrounding to increase the lifetime of 1 . 67Compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 1 0.202 ns), the prolonged 1 (0.208 ns) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 shows that large numbers of oxygen vacancy defects were incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice by Pt atoms loading.Accordingly, the relative intensity (I 1 ) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 also increased sharply from 10.63 in V O -TiO 2 -500 to 15.35 in 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500. 68The longer lifetime component 2 was ascribed to the positron annihilation captured by O vacancies, 66 hinting that the longer value of 2 (0.387 ns) for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 revealed the increase of oxygen vacancies concentration compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 2 0.365 ns).It is worth noting that the increase of 2 was 86.1 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while it is 44.7 for V O -TiO 2 -500 compared with 1 , which means the generation of a huge number of boundarylike defects after Pt atoms loading 68 clearly related to the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies corresponding to theoretical calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). The surface chemical states and constituent elements of V O -TiO 2 -T (T 400, 500, 600 C) and 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 were analyzed by means of XPS technology and the results are described in Figure 5 to further expound the interaction between the oxygen vacancies and single Pt atom.The survey spectra presented in Figure 5a show that the Ti, O, and C elements from reference exist for all the samples.No signal corresponding to the Pt element is detected in the survey spectrum of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 because of the lower practical Pt loading.In the Ti 2p spectra (Figure 5b), compared to V O -TiO 2 -400 (Ti 2p 3/2 : 458.53 eV), the Ti 2p 3/2 peaks of V O -TiO 2 -500 (458.06 eV) and V O -TiO 2 -600 (458.14 eV) shift obviously to lower binding energies, which is closely connected to the generation of the more oxygen vacancy defects in the two samples, inducing a changed chemical environment of the titanium ions, as shown by the ESR results.Surprisingly, the distinct decrease and larger shift to a high binding energy were found for the 1 Pt-loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample.The similar changes were observed in O 1 s spectra of the 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample (Figure 5c).The peaks at 531.30 and 529.80 eV can be, respectively, indexed to the oxygen atoms in the neighborhood of oxygen vacancies and O bond of Ti-O-Ti. 21After loading single Pt atom, the O 1s peaks shift to high binding energies, accompanied by a sharp decrease in the peak intensity.This finding could be explained as follows: (i) the decreasing intensity of the Ti 2p peak and O 1s peak for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 is due to the Pt loading, which impairs the detection sensitivity of the instrument for Ti and O; (ii) the shifting of the binding energy values may be related to the strong single Pt atom-TiO 2 substrate interaction, which would anchor strongly single Pt atom on the TiO 2 surface to accumulate more electrons for the photocatalytic reaction because of the strong stabilizing ability resulting from vacancies.Nevertheless, except for the aforementioned change, careful study shows that the peak corresponding to the O atoms around the oxygen vacancy defects becomes more intense upon single Pt atom loading, and the integral-area ratios of the peak at 532.60 eV (O 1s peak for the oxygen vacancies) to the peak at 530.20 eV (O 1s peak for the lattice oxygen) were determined to be 0.35 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while this is 0.095, 0.081, and 0.092 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively (Figure S8).This obviously suggested the increased content of oxygen vacancies The Journal of Physical Chemistry C F due to the interaction of the atomically dispersed Pt and oxygen vacancies promoting to generate more oxygen vacancy defects on the surface/subsurface of the catalyst by strongly decreasing the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, corresponding to ESR, PALS, and the theoretical calculation results (see the Theoretical Calculation section). 37In Figure 5d, the typical XPS spectra of Pt 4f centered at 70.26 and 73.90 eV showed the Pt metallic state.Moreover, the two peaks located at 72.60 and 75.60 eV indicates of the presence of platinum oxide. 69igure 6a gives the absorbance versus wavelength plots of the P25, TAN, and V O -rich-TiO 2 -based samples.Compared to the TAN precursor material, the absorption of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples shifts to longer wavelength, obviously because of the influence of the oxygen vacancy formation.Nevertheless, the difference between the absorptions of the different V O -rich-TiO 2 samples with different oxygen vacancy concentrations is negligible and similar to that of P25, which indicates that no obvious visible light absorption is generated by the introduced oxygen vacancies in the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples, as reported by the literature. 21Additionally, the same conclusion could also be drawn based on the absorptions of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples prepared with the different heat-treatment times (Figure S9).To get the effect of the isolated single Pt atom, the UV-vis absorption spectra of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25-TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies were obtained.Surprisingly, after Pt atom loading, significant visible-light-driven absorption is found for the Pt-loaded V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which is associated with the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies (Figure 6b). 37,38Nevertheless, almost no change is observed for the absorption of Pt-deposited P25 in comparison with that of the pristine P25 (the inset of Figure 6b).These findings show again that a strong interaction existed between single Pt atom and oxygen vacancy defects for the Pt atom-decorated V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which corresponds to To study the dynamics of electron transfer on the interface of the catalysts, the transient I-t curves were measured with light-on and light-off cycles.As displayed in Figure 7a, the introduced oxygen vacancy defects brought about higher photocurrent values for all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, especially V O -TiO 2 -500 with a maximum photocurrent of 0.45 mA, which is almost 2.7 and 16 times as high as that of the P25 and TAN samples.This could occur because the formed oxygen vacancy defects captured electrons and thus suppressed the recombination of photoinduced charges. 70Figure 7b displays Nyquist curves with arc-like distribution patterns and the corresponding equivalent circuit.The smaller arc radius at a low frequency is usually connected to the charge migration at the interface of the semiconductor and in the electrolyte of the tested electrode. 71According to the radius of the Nyquist plots, the V O -rich TiO 2 samples exhibit a smaller charge transfer resistance (R3) compared with the TAN precursor, as shown by the I-t results.Among the samples, V O -TiO 2 -500 demonstrates the smallest charge transfer resistance than the other two V O -TiO 2 samples and P25 TiO 2 , meaning that the charge transportation at the interface is faster for V O -TiO 2 -500.Figure 7c presents the PL emission spectra of the as-obtained V O -rich TiO 2 samples using P25 and TAN as references at an excited wavelength of 400 nm to prove the improved separation efficiency of the e --h pairs upon introducing oxygen vacancies.The decay of the PL signals for all the V Orich TiO 2 catalysts is sharp in comparison with that of the P25 and TAN reference samples, indicating that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies significantly inhibited the annihilation of the photoinduced electrons and holes. 72The V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample shows the weakest PL emission, demonstrating the best carrier separation efficiency, which means that a more robust photocatalytic process can occur over it.However, introducing excess oxygen vacancies leads to an enhanced PL emission (such as V O -TiO 2 -600) because the excess O defects can be viewed as the recombination centers of the e --h pairs, which impacts the photoreactivity of the sample.Generally, the carrier density could affect the dynamic performance and photocatalytic activity of the catalysts.Therefore, the Mott-Schottky tests of P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 were performed to determine the different donor densities of the two photocatalysts, as described in Figure 7d.The two samples show typical characteristics of an n-type semiconductor with a positive slope.The donor density can be reflected by the magnitude of the slope, and the slope reduces with the increased donor density. 73In comparison with P25 TiO 2 , the much smaller slope of V O -TiO 2 -500 indicated a higher donor density originating from the contribution of oxygen vacancies formed by annealing the TANs, which would significantly promote the carrier transfer and photocatalytic activity. 3.2.Theoretical Calculations.The aforementioned experimental characterization results showed that a strong synergistic effect existed between the oxygen vacancies and loaded single Pt atom.To better understand such a mechanism, we studied the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with and without V O defects in the framework of the KS DFT.Therein, configurations where that V O s exist on the surface, subsurface, and inner layers are considered (Figure S10).When a Pt atom adsorbs on a clean A-TiO 2 (101) surface, O 2c -O 3c -O 2c site is the most favorable site (Figure 8a), as proved by many reports, 747576 so we adopt this model directly (Figure 8b).The calculated adsorption energy of the single Pt atom on the clean surface is -2.89 eV (Table 1).Meanwhile, on the A-TiO 2 (101) surface with different oxygen vacancy concentrations, the adsorption energy of the single Pt atom 1).In other words, a surface V O has an anchoring effect on the loaded Pt 1 , which is consistent with the previous study that surface defects can strongly affect the stability of single atom-catalyst. 76,77ven more fascinating is that the formation energy of the V O s obviously decreases upon loading with Pt, especially for surface and subsurface V O s.In the absence of Pt loading, the formation energies of the surface and subsurface O vacancies are 3.31 and 4.00 eV, respectively, and they decreased to1.92 and 3.46 eV after loading the single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst (Table 1).Nevertheless, the deposited of the Pt atom seems to have no clear effect on the formation energies of the interior oxygen vacancies.These results indicated that, based on the formation energies, the loaded single Pt atom more strongly favors the formation of surface/subsurface oxygen vacancies than the V O s in the bulk as proved by the increased ESR signal over 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b) and PALS (Figure 4). Generally, the formation of V O s generates extra electrons in TiO 2 nanomaterials, increasing the electron concentration, which favors the improved photocatalytic efficiency.However, note that the bulk and surface/subsurface V O s have different influences on the photoreactivity.In stark contrast to bulk V O s generally served as the charge carrier recombination centers, surface/subsurface V O s have proven to be helpful for the efficient separation of the photoinduced electron and hole pairs.The surface/subsurface V O s give rise to more donor electrons localized on the surface region, facilitating the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and thereby improving the photoactivity of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples. 26ccording to our experimental result, the sample that single Pt atom with more V O s showed higher activity.To further determine how surface vacancy interplay with Pt 1 and improve photocatalytic activity, we studied the charge distribution of the Pt/TiO 2 system.Based on our Bader charge analysis, when Pt 1 react with V O 1, it obtains 0.94 e, indicating charge transfers from the substrate to Pt atom.As a comparison, when Pt reacts with a clean surface or surface with inner V O s, it will lose charge, indicating charge will migrate from the Pt atom to substate.This point can also be supported by our charge density difference analysis (Figure S11).Hence, it is reasonable that for the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with surface V O s, such defect provides more electrons and thus increases the carrier concentration.These electrons may transfer quickly to the loaded single Pt atom, the photocatalytic active site, and participate in the photocatalytic reactions on the surface and, consequently, improve photocatalytic efficiency.The Journal of Physical Chemistry C pubs.acs.org/JPCCenhanced hydrogen production rates (667, 1077, and 651 mol h -1 , respectively, for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600) compared to the P25 (344 mol h -1 ) and TAN (239 mol h -1 ) samples without oxygen vacancies.The best H 2 -production rate of 1077 mol h -1 was obtained by V O -TiO 2 -500, which is approximately three times that of P25 (Figure 9a).It is unquestionably related to the contribution of the introduced oxygen vacancies, whose existence remarkably increases the donor density in the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, thereby promoting carrier transfer to the surface and causing more electrons to participate in the photocatalysis reaction under the same irradiation.The higher concentration of V O defects does not seem to be good for H 2 evolution because excess oxygen vacancies become recombination centers of e -h pairs, impairing the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. 72dditionally, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) was also measured and calculated according to similar photocatalytic reaction conditions by using a 365 nm UV light bandpass filter (see the Supporting Information).Specifically, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample (21.7) was 3.14 times as high as that of P25 TiO 2 (6.9), implying that the oxygen vacancy defect-rich sample shows a better photocatalytic performance.To perform a systematic study, the effect of the pH, Pt deposition amount, and sacrificial agents on the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance was also studied.The maximal H 2 evolution rate was obtained at a pH 4.7 0.3 (Figure S12a).The excess deposition of Pt leads to the gradual deterioration of the hydrogen production rate, which may be due to more active surface sites covered by the Pt (Figure S12b). 22Using methyl alcohol as the electron donor, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 evolution from water was shown by the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples (Figure S12c).Figure 9b shows the photocatalytic stability of V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25, and the H 2 production by the two samples does not clearly decrease over four cycles, especially for V O -TiO 2 -500.The TON values have also been calculated to evaluate the long-term test stability of catalysts for H 2 production and the results are listed in the Supporting Information (Table S3).It should be noted that the TON of V O -TiO 2 -500 for H 2 evolution is clearly higher than that of P25 TiO 2 , suggesting that the obtained V O defect-rich TiO 2 sample in this work can serve as a practical photocatalyst to improve the photocatalytic H 2 generation activity.As increasing the annealing time, the attenuated photocatalytic H 2 formation rates may be related to the decreased V O concentration (Figure S12d). The gradually increasing emission of CO 2 into the atmosphere caused by burning fossil fuels generates problems of global warming for our society.The reduction of CO 2 with the aid of sunlight-driven photocatalysis technology not only leads to the decreased amount of CO 2 greenhouse gas, relieving global greenhouse effects but also converts CO 2 to value-added fuels, solving the energy problem. 78,79Therefore, we carried out the photoreduction test of CO 2 with H 2 O over the as-obtained catalysts using UV-vis light irradiation in pure water without any sacrificial agents to avoid interference, and the results are described in Figure 10.Clearly, the amounts of CH 4 and CO over all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples are significantly larger than those over the commercial P25 TiO 2 .In particular, V O -TiO 2 -500 exhibits the highest yields of CH 4 and CO with Pt single atoms loading as cocatalyst but without H 2 formation, which is almost 2.2 and 2.3 times higher than that achieved by P25 TiO 2 , respectively (Table S5).The higher selectivity for CH 4 than that of CO over all the catalysts is due to the Pt cocatalyst loading. 12Simultaneously, the AQE for CO 2 conversion has also been obtained.The AQE of the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst (V O -TiO 2 -500) is 0.064, which is almost 18-fold of commercial P25 TiO 2 .Figure 11 shows the cycle measurement results of the P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.During the four cycles, the generation rates of the CH 4 and CO did not show the obvious decrease, displaying a good stability for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and at the same time exhibiting a fascinating application potential for the photoconversion of CO 2 with H 2 O.The TON values of CO 2 photoreduction to generate CO and CH 4 have also been calculated (Table S4), in which the V O -TiO 2 -500 shows the clearly enhanced TON values compared to P25 TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction. CO 2 reduction to produce CH 4 is an eight-electron process, which requires gathering the more photogenerated charge carriers with a long lifetime. 80The Pt atom strongly anchored with the help of the large of oxygen vacancies can promote more electrons to accumulate on the surface of the catalyst, leading to a higher catalytic performance of the catalyst.In the work, without any sacrificial agents being added, CO 2 is the only carbon source.For it, control photocatalytic experiments were conducted under identical conditions but using N 2 as the carrier gas replacing CO 2 , in which no CO or CH 4 product could be detected, indicating that carbides in this experiment did not originate from carbon contamination.In addition, the theoretical calculation and experiment results show that CO 2 can be strongly adsorbed on V O existing on the TiO 2 surface and the activation barrier of CO 2 reduction can be greatly reduced. 81,82At the same time, the generated V O can be viewed as reactive sites to promote the activation of CO 2 to form CO 2 -, which could enhance the product rate of CO and The Journal of Physical Chemistry C CH 4 . 82The photoinduced holes in the VB can be oxidated by the adsorbed hydroxyl species to form O 2 . In a word, based on the abovementioned experimental and DFT calculation results, under the same Pt loading, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 photoreduction performance shown by the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples was undoubtedly related to the synergistic action of the O vacancies and isolated single Pt atom.The existence of surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies strongly anchored single Pt atom onto the surface of the catalyst, and in turn, the loaded single-atomic-site Pt bring about the generation of more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies, as illustrated in Figures 3b,4 and Table S2, by decreasing the formation energy of an O vacancy on the surface and subsurface, according to the DFT calculation.While the existence of more oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 increased the donor density not only promoting the carrier transfer but also making more electrons accumulate in the sink provided by single Pt atom to participate in the photoreaction, thus promoting the photoactivity.The theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the O defects on the surface of TiO 2 favor the adsorption and activation of CO 2 by the strong actions with the O atoms of CO 2 and the effective generation of CO 2 intermediates, leading to the dissociation of CO 2 . 78,79The CO 2 adsorption measurements were therefore carried out under environmental conditions of 298 K at low pressure, as presented in Figure S13.These measurements show that the CO 2 adsorption capacity at 298 K and 1 atm (760 mmHg) over V O -TiO 2 -500 could reach 10.94 cm 3 /g, while that is 7.09 cm 3 /g over P25 TiO 2 .The abovementioned result indicates that the introduced V O defects endow our prepared TiO 2 sample with an enhanced CO 2 adsorption capacity, improving its photocatalytic activity.It is just derived from the synergistic effect of V O and loaded single Pt atom, the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst obtained by us showed the enhanced H 2 product and CO 2 reduction performance."}, {"llm generation": "catalyst", "source": "The increased annealing temperature leads to the gradually decreased half peak width of the strongest peak located at 144 cm -1 , which reflects the vibration of O-Ti-O, suggesting a more perfect crystallization of the catalyst.", "context": "3.1.Characterization and Analysis.As displayed in Figure 1a, the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different calcination temperatures exhibited narrow and intense XRD peaks of 2 25.3, 37.8, and 48.0, which corresponds to the (101), (004), and (200) crystallographic planes of the anatase TiO 2 structure, respectively. 56With the increased annealing temperature, the corresponding diffraction peak became sharper, implying a more perfect lattice structure.The rutile phase can be observed in the sample prepared at 700 C, similar to the XRD pattern of pristine P25 TiO 2 , maybe suggesting a reduced photoactivity of the final catalyst.The influence of the heat treatment duration on the V O -rich-TiO 2 phase structures is also described in Figure S1.Although the diffraction peaks were slightly increased, a nearly negligible difference was found when the calcining time was set to 1-12 h, meaning that the calcining time had little effect on the catalyst phase structures.To assess the effect of the loaded Pt metal, we performed an XRD measurement of the 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).After Pt loading, the intensity of the diffraction peak corresponding to anatase TiO 2 was weakened drastically compared with the peak of the sample before Pt loading, indicating the decreased crystallinity of the catalyst, which may derive from the formation of more surface area oxygen vacancies that cause residual stress. 57It can be also reflected from the enlarge view of 15-35that a slightly broadening on the FWHM may be induced by the residual stress deriving from the newly generated oxygen defects and the reduced crystalline size (Figure S2).Analogical phenomena have been observed in Bi-based compounds, 58,59 ZnO and CeO 2 . 60,61This finding was consistent with ESR and DFT calculation results revealing that single Pt atom can promote the formation of the more surface oxygen vacancies (see below).Contrastingly, the intensity of the XRD peaks of the Pt-loaded P25 TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies only show slight decrement than that of P25 (Figure S3).The phase structure of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different temperatures was further studied by Raman spectra because of their strong scattering properties.In Figure 1c, the four typical characterized Raman bands at wavenumbers of 144, 397, 515, and 639 cm -1 are indexed obviously as the symmetric E g , B 1g , A 1g , and E g Raman-active modes of the anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 62The increased annealing temperature leads to the gradually decreased half peak width of the strongest peak located at 144 cm -1 , which reflects the vibration of O-Ti-O, suggesting a more perfect crystallization of the catalyst.For V O -TiO 2 -700, the weak peak located at 446 cm -1 showed the emergence of the rutile phase, similar to the peak observed in the P25 TiO 2 spectrum (445 cm -1 ).Likewise, the intensity of The Journal of Physical Chemistry C D the Raman peak of V O -TiO 2 -500 clearly decreased after the single Pt atom loading (Figure 1d), while the intensity of the Raman peak obtained for Pt-P25 TiO 2 slightly decreased (Figure S4), corresponding to the XRD results.These findings may hint a presence of an interaction between V O and the supported single Pt atom. The morphology and structure of the TAN precursor and V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 used as a representative sample were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and TEM.The TAN precursor of O-defect-rich TiO 2 has a layered structure (Figure 2a) with a distance of approximately 0.8 nm between the adjacent layers. 63After annealing at 500 C, V O -TiO 2 -500 shows irregular particles (Figure 2b) with clear (101) anatase phase titania crystallographic planes having d s 0.33 nm, indicating the formation of anatase phase titania, as confirmed by XRD (Figure 2c).When the photo-deposition method was used to decorate Pt nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO 2 , the same lattice fringes with d s 0.33 nm could be observed, indicating that the loading of Pt has no impact on the crystal structure of TiO 2 (Figure 2d).But a vague border in the V O -TiO 2 -500 sample can be found when loading Pt, which may also hint the presence of an interaction between Pt and V O .Meanwhile, no difference on the morphology was observed for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 before and after single Pt atom loading (Figures 2b andS5).It should be noted that no corresponding signals related to crystalline Pt species are detected in the XRD patterns of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).Not only that, the presence of Pt nanoparticles was not observed obviously, too (Figures 2d andS5), suggesting a high dispersion of Pt species.The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings show the uniform distribution of Pt, Ti, and O elements (Figure 2f).The Pt loading content determined by ICP-OES was about 0.36.In view of this, HAADF-STEM was carried out, where the dispersion of Pt species at the atomic scale was observed clearly as several isolated bright dots signed by red circles, indicating the existence of atomically dispersed Pt (Figures 2e andS6).From Table S1, after calcining the TANs, a clear decrease in the specific surface areas was detected from 390.6 m 2 g -1 for the TANs to 297.7, 174.2, and 128.0 m 2 g -1 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively, which is attributed to the change in the morphology from TANs to irregular nanoparticles after annealing.The increased calcination temperature leads to the decreased catalytic specific surface area because the high temperature makes the grains grow and even sinter, resulting in the serious collapse of small channels or the blockage of channels. To study the defect structure of TiO 2 , ESR spectra were collected.All the catalysts except for P25 TiO 2 (Figure S7a) exhibit a strong ESR signal at g 2.0 (Figures 3a andS7), indicating the existence of oxygen vacancies in their structure. 33,64,65Upon increasing the heat-treatment temperature, the ESR signal of 2.0 becomes much stronger, showing that more O vacancy defects are formed in the catalysts structures (Figure S7b).Conversely, prolonging the heattreatment time seems to be detrimental to the generation of more oxygen vacancies, and the annealing time of 2 h is applicable (Figure S7c).Fascinatingly, the obvious increase in the ESR signal intensity is found for Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b), indicating a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, which may be related to the inducing effect of single Pt atom, promoting more oxygen vacancy defects to form on the surface/subsurface, corresponding to DFT calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). To give further evidence of the increased oxygen vacancy defects, PALS measurements of before and after single Pt atom supporting for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 were conducted to test the lifetime of the positron.As shown in Figure 4, 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 gave longer average positron lifetime than its counterpart, which results from the positron trapped by O vacancy defects.The positron lifespan spectra of V O rich-TiO 2 sample gave two lifetime constituents, 1 and 2 , accompanied by corresponding relative intensities, I 1 and I 2 (Table S2).The shorter constituent ( 1 ) is usually ascribed to the free annihilation of positrons in a defect-free crystal, called as the The Journal of Physical Chemistry C first lifespan of positrons. 66In an unordered system, little vacancies or shallow positron trap from oxygen vacancies may result in the decreased electron density of the surrounding to increase the lifetime of 1 . 67Compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 1 0.202 ns), the prolonged 1 (0.208 ns) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 shows that large numbers of oxygen vacancy defects were incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice by Pt atoms loading.Accordingly, the relative intensity (I 1 ) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 also increased sharply from 10.63 in V O -TiO 2 -500 to 15.35 in 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500. 68The longer lifetime component 2 was ascribed to the positron annihilation captured by O vacancies, 66 hinting that the longer value of 2 (0.387 ns) for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 revealed the increase of oxygen vacancies concentration compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 2 0.365 ns).It is worth noting that the increase of 2 was 86.1 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while it is 44.7 for V O -TiO 2 -500 compared with 1 , which means the generation of a huge number of boundarylike defects after Pt atoms loading 68 clearly related to the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies corresponding to theoretical calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). The surface chemical states and constituent elements of V O -TiO 2 -T (T 400, 500, 600 C) and 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 were analyzed by means of XPS technology and the results are described in Figure 5 to further expound the interaction between the oxygen vacancies and single Pt atom.The survey spectra presented in Figure 5a show that the Ti, O, and C elements from reference exist for all the samples.No signal corresponding to the Pt element is detected in the survey spectrum of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 because of the lower practical Pt loading.In the Ti 2p spectra (Figure 5b), compared to V O -TiO 2 -400 (Ti 2p 3/2 : 458.53 eV), the Ti 2p 3/2 peaks of V O -TiO 2 -500 (458.06 eV) and V O -TiO 2 -600 (458.14 eV) shift obviously to lower binding energies, which is closely connected to the generation of the more oxygen vacancy defects in the two samples, inducing a changed chemical environment of the titanium ions, as shown by the ESR results.Surprisingly, the distinct decrease and larger shift to a high binding energy were found for the 1 Pt-loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample.The similar changes were observed in O 1 s spectra of the 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample (Figure 5c).The peaks at 531.30 and 529.80 eV can be, respectively, indexed to the oxygen atoms in the neighborhood of oxygen vacancies and O bond of Ti-O-Ti. 21After loading single Pt atom, the O 1s peaks shift to high binding energies, accompanied by a sharp decrease in the peak intensity.This finding could be explained as follows: (i) the decreasing intensity of the Ti 2p peak and O 1s peak for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 is due to the Pt loading, which impairs the detection sensitivity of the instrument for Ti and O; (ii) the shifting of the binding energy values may be related to the strong single Pt atom-TiO 2 substrate interaction, which would anchor strongly single Pt atom on the TiO 2 surface to accumulate more electrons for the photocatalytic reaction because of the strong stabilizing ability resulting from vacancies.Nevertheless, except for the aforementioned change, careful study shows that the peak corresponding to the O atoms around the oxygen vacancy defects becomes more intense upon single Pt atom loading, and the integral-area ratios of the peak at 532.60 eV (O 1s peak for the oxygen vacancies) to the peak at 530.20 eV (O 1s peak for the lattice oxygen) were determined to be 0.35 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while this is 0.095, 0.081, and 0.092 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively (Figure S8).This obviously suggested the increased content of oxygen vacancies The Journal of Physical Chemistry C F due to the interaction of the atomically dispersed Pt and oxygen vacancies promoting to generate more oxygen vacancy defects on the surface/subsurface of the catalyst by strongly decreasing the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, corresponding to ESR, PALS, and the theoretical calculation results (see the Theoretical Calculation section). 37In Figure 5d, the typical XPS spectra of Pt 4f centered at 70.26 and 73.90 eV showed the Pt metallic state.Moreover, the two peaks located at 72.60 and 75.60 eV indicates of the presence of platinum oxide. 69igure 6a gives the absorbance versus wavelength plots of the P25, TAN, and V O -rich-TiO 2 -based samples.Compared to the TAN precursor material, the absorption of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples shifts to longer wavelength, obviously because of the influence of the oxygen vacancy formation.Nevertheless, the difference between the absorptions of the different V O -rich-TiO 2 samples with different oxygen vacancy concentrations is negligible and similar to that of P25, which indicates that no obvious visible light absorption is generated by the introduced oxygen vacancies in the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples, as reported by the literature. 21Additionally, the same conclusion could also be drawn based on the absorptions of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples prepared with the different heat-treatment times (Figure S9).To get the effect of the isolated single Pt atom, the UV-vis absorption spectra of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25-TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies were obtained.Surprisingly, after Pt atom loading, significant visible-light-driven absorption is found for the Pt-loaded V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which is associated with the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies (Figure 6b). 37,38Nevertheless, almost no change is observed for the absorption of Pt-deposited P25 in comparison with that of the pristine P25 (the inset of Figure 6b).These findings show again that a strong interaction existed between single Pt atom and oxygen vacancy defects for the Pt atom-decorated V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which corresponds to To study the dynamics of electron transfer on the interface of the catalysts, the transient I-t curves were measured with light-on and light-off cycles.As displayed in Figure 7a, the introduced oxygen vacancy defects brought about higher photocurrent values for all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, especially V O -TiO 2 -500 with a maximum photocurrent of 0.45 mA, which is almost 2.7 and 16 times as high as that of the P25 and TAN samples.This could occur because the formed oxygen vacancy defects captured electrons and thus suppressed the recombination of photoinduced charges. 70Figure 7b displays Nyquist curves with arc-like distribution patterns and the corresponding equivalent circuit.The smaller arc radius at a low frequency is usually connected to the charge migration at the interface of the semiconductor and in the electrolyte of the tested electrode. 71According to the radius of the Nyquist plots, the V O -rich TiO 2 samples exhibit a smaller charge transfer resistance (R3) compared with the TAN precursor, as shown by the I-t results.Among the samples, V O -TiO 2 -500 demonstrates the smallest charge transfer resistance than the other two V O -TiO 2 samples and P25 TiO 2 , meaning that the charge transportation at the interface is faster for V O -TiO 2 -500.Figure 7c presents the PL emission spectra of the as-obtained V O -rich TiO 2 samples using P25 and TAN as references at an excited wavelength of 400 nm to prove the improved separation efficiency of the e --h pairs upon introducing oxygen vacancies.The decay of the PL signals for all the V Orich TiO 2 catalysts is sharp in comparison with that of the P25 and TAN reference samples, indicating that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies significantly inhibited the annihilation of the photoinduced electrons and holes. 72The V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample shows the weakest PL emission, demonstrating the best carrier separation efficiency, which means that a more robust photocatalytic process can occur over it.However, introducing excess oxygen vacancies leads to an enhanced PL emission (such as V O -TiO 2 -600) because the excess O defects can be viewed as the recombination centers of the e --h pairs, which impacts the photoreactivity of the sample.Generally, the carrier density could affect the dynamic performance and photocatalytic activity of the catalysts.Therefore, the Mott-Schottky tests of P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 were performed to determine the different donor densities of the two photocatalysts, as described in Figure 7d.The two samples show typical characteristics of an n-type semiconductor with a positive slope.The donor density can be reflected by the magnitude of the slope, and the slope reduces with the increased donor density. 73In comparison with P25 TiO 2 , the much smaller slope of V O -TiO 2 -500 indicated a higher donor density originating from the contribution of oxygen vacancies formed by annealing the TANs, which would significantly promote the carrier transfer and photocatalytic activity. 3.2.Theoretical Calculations.The aforementioned experimental characterization results showed that a strong synergistic effect existed between the oxygen vacancies and loaded single Pt atom.To better understand such a mechanism, we studied the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with and without V O defects in the framework of the KS DFT.Therein, configurations where that V O s exist on the surface, subsurface, and inner layers are considered (Figure S10).When a Pt atom adsorbs on a clean A-TiO 2 (101) surface, O 2c -O 3c -O 2c site is the most favorable site (Figure 8a), as proved by many reports, 747576 so we adopt this model directly (Figure 8b).The calculated adsorption energy of the single Pt atom on the clean surface is -2.89 eV (Table 1).Meanwhile, on the A-TiO 2 (101) surface with different oxygen vacancy concentrations, the adsorption energy of the single Pt atom 1).In other words, a surface V O has an anchoring effect on the loaded Pt 1 , which is consistent with the previous study that surface defects can strongly affect the stability of single atom-catalyst. 76,77ven more fascinating is that the formation energy of the V O s obviously decreases upon loading with Pt, especially for surface and subsurface V O s.In the absence of Pt loading, the formation energies of the surface and subsurface O vacancies are 3.31 and 4.00 eV, respectively, and they decreased to1.92 and 3.46 eV after loading the single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst (Table 1).Nevertheless, the deposited of the Pt atom seems to have no clear effect on the formation energies of the interior oxygen vacancies.These results indicated that, based on the formation energies, the loaded single Pt atom more strongly favors the formation of surface/subsurface oxygen vacancies than the V O s in the bulk as proved by the increased ESR signal over 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b) and PALS (Figure 4). Generally, the formation of V O s generates extra electrons in TiO 2 nanomaterials, increasing the electron concentration, which favors the improved photocatalytic efficiency.However, note that the bulk and surface/subsurface V O s have different influences on the photoreactivity.In stark contrast to bulk V O s generally served as the charge carrier recombination centers, surface/subsurface V O s have proven to be helpful for the efficient separation of the photoinduced electron and hole pairs.The surface/subsurface V O s give rise to more donor electrons localized on the surface region, facilitating the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and thereby improving the photoactivity of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples. 26ccording to our experimental result, the sample that single Pt atom with more V O s showed higher activity.To further determine how surface vacancy interplay with Pt 1 and improve photocatalytic activity, we studied the charge distribution of the Pt/TiO 2 system.Based on our Bader charge analysis, when Pt 1 react with V O 1, it obtains 0.94 e, indicating charge transfers from the substrate to Pt atom.As a comparison, when Pt reacts with a clean surface or surface with inner V O s, it will lose charge, indicating charge will migrate from the Pt atom to substate.This point can also be supported by our charge density difference analysis (Figure S11).Hence, it is reasonable that for the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with surface V O s, such defect provides more electrons and thus increases the carrier concentration.These electrons may transfer quickly to the loaded single Pt atom, the photocatalytic active site, and participate in the photocatalytic reactions on the surface and, consequently, improve photocatalytic efficiency.The Journal of Physical Chemistry C pubs.acs.org/JPCCenhanced hydrogen production rates (667, 1077, and 651 mol h -1 , respectively, for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600) compared to the P25 (344 mol h -1 ) and TAN (239 mol h -1 ) samples without oxygen vacancies.The best H 2 -production rate of 1077 mol h -1 was obtained by V O -TiO 2 -500, which is approximately three times that of P25 (Figure 9a).It is unquestionably related to the contribution of the introduced oxygen vacancies, whose existence remarkably increases the donor density in the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, thereby promoting carrier transfer to the surface and causing more electrons to participate in the photocatalysis reaction under the same irradiation.The higher concentration of V O defects does not seem to be good for H 2 evolution because excess oxygen vacancies become recombination centers of e -h pairs, impairing the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. 72dditionally, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) was also measured and calculated according to similar photocatalytic reaction conditions by using a 365 nm UV light bandpass filter (see the Supporting Information).Specifically, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample (21.7) was 3.14 times as high as that of P25 TiO 2 (6.9), implying that the oxygen vacancy defect-rich sample shows a better photocatalytic performance.To perform a systematic study, the effect of the pH, Pt deposition amount, and sacrificial agents on the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance was also studied.The maximal H 2 evolution rate was obtained at a pH 4.7 0.3 (Figure S12a).The excess deposition of Pt leads to the gradual deterioration of the hydrogen production rate, which may be due to more active surface sites covered by the Pt (Figure S12b). 22Using methyl alcohol as the electron donor, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 evolution from water was shown by the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples (Figure S12c).Figure 9b shows the photocatalytic stability of V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25, and the H 2 production by the two samples does not clearly decrease over four cycles, especially for V O -TiO 2 -500.The TON values have also been calculated to evaluate the long-term test stability of catalysts for H 2 production and the results are listed in the Supporting Information (Table S3).It should be noted that the TON of V O -TiO 2 -500 for H 2 evolution is clearly higher than that of P25 TiO 2 , suggesting that the obtained V O defect-rich TiO 2 sample in this work can serve as a practical photocatalyst to improve the photocatalytic H 2 generation activity.As increasing the annealing time, the attenuated photocatalytic H 2 formation rates may be related to the decreased V O concentration (Figure S12d). The gradually increasing emission of CO 2 into the atmosphere caused by burning fossil fuels generates problems of global warming for our society.The reduction of CO 2 with the aid of sunlight-driven photocatalysis technology not only leads to the decreased amount of CO 2 greenhouse gas, relieving global greenhouse effects but also converts CO 2 to value-added fuels, solving the energy problem. 78,79Therefore, we carried out the photoreduction test of CO 2 with H 2 O over the as-obtained catalysts using UV-vis light irradiation in pure water without any sacrificial agents to avoid interference, and the results are described in Figure 10.Clearly, the amounts of CH 4 and CO over all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples are significantly larger than those over the commercial P25 TiO 2 .In particular, V O -TiO 2 -500 exhibits the highest yields of CH 4 and CO with Pt single atoms loading as cocatalyst but without H 2 formation, which is almost 2.2 and 2.3 times higher than that achieved by P25 TiO 2 , respectively (Table S5).The higher selectivity for CH 4 than that of CO over all the catalysts is due to the Pt cocatalyst loading. 12Simultaneously, the AQE for CO 2 conversion has also been obtained.The AQE of the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst (V O -TiO 2 -500) is 0.064, which is almost 18-fold of commercial P25 TiO 2 .Figure 11 shows the cycle measurement results of the P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.During the four cycles, the generation rates of the CH 4 and CO did not show the obvious decrease, displaying a good stability for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and at the same time exhibiting a fascinating application potential for the photoconversion of CO 2 with H 2 O.The TON values of CO 2 photoreduction to generate CO and CH 4 have also been calculated (Table S4), in which the V O -TiO 2 -500 shows the clearly enhanced TON values compared to P25 TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction. CO 2 reduction to produce CH 4 is an eight-electron process, which requires gathering the more photogenerated charge carriers with a long lifetime. 80The Pt atom strongly anchored with the help of the large of oxygen vacancies can promote more electrons to accumulate on the surface of the catalyst, leading to a higher catalytic performance of the catalyst.In the work, without any sacrificial agents being added, CO 2 is the only carbon source.For it, control photocatalytic experiments were conducted under identical conditions but using N 2 as the carrier gas replacing CO 2 , in which no CO or CH 4 product could be detected, indicating that carbides in this experiment did not originate from carbon contamination.In addition, the theoretical calculation and experiment results show that CO 2 can be strongly adsorbed on V O existing on the TiO 2 surface and the activation barrier of CO 2 reduction can be greatly reduced. 81,82At the same time, the generated V O can be viewed as reactive sites to promote the activation of CO 2 to form CO 2 -, which could enhance the product rate of CO and The Journal of Physical Chemistry C CH 4 . 82The photoinduced holes in the VB can be oxidated by the adsorbed hydroxyl species to form O 2 . In a word, based on the abovementioned experimental and DFT calculation results, under the same Pt loading, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 photoreduction performance shown by the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples was undoubtedly related to the synergistic action of the O vacancies and isolated single Pt atom.The existence of surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies strongly anchored single Pt atom onto the surface of the catalyst, and in turn, the loaded single-atomic-site Pt bring about the generation of more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies, as illustrated in Figures 3b,4 and Table S2, by decreasing the formation energy of an O vacancy on the surface and subsurface, according to the DFT calculation.While the existence of more oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 increased the donor density not only promoting the carrier transfer but also making more electrons accumulate in the sink provided by single Pt atom to participate in the photoreaction, thus promoting the photoactivity.The theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the O defects on the surface of TiO 2 favor the adsorption and activation of CO 2 by the strong actions with the O atoms of CO 2 and the effective generation of CO 2 intermediates, leading to the dissociation of CO 2 . 78,79The CO 2 adsorption measurements were therefore carried out under environmental conditions of 298 K at low pressure, as presented in Figure S13.These measurements show that the CO 2 adsorption capacity at 298 K and 1 atm (760 mmHg) over V O -TiO 2 -500 could reach 10.94 cm 3 /g, while that is 7.09 cm 3 /g over P25 TiO 2 .The abovementioned result indicates that the introduced V O defects endow our prepared TiO 2 sample with an enhanced CO 2 adsorption capacity, improving its photocatalytic activity.It is just derived from the synergistic effect of V O and loaded single Pt atom, the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst obtained by us showed the enhanced H 2 product and CO 2 reduction performance."}, {"llm generation": "photocatalytic", "source": "Specifically, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample (21.7) was 3.14 times as high as that of P25 TiO 2 (6.9), implying that the oxygen vacancy defect-rich sample shows a better photocatalytic performance.", "context": "3.1.Characterization and Analysis.As displayed in Figure 1a, the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different calcination temperatures exhibited narrow and intense XRD peaks of 2 25.3, 37.8, and 48.0, which corresponds to the (101), (004), and (200) crystallographic planes of the anatase TiO 2 structure, respectively. 56With the increased annealing temperature, the corresponding diffraction peak became sharper, implying a more perfect lattice structure.The rutile phase can be observed in the sample prepared at 700 C, similar to the XRD pattern of pristine P25 TiO 2 , maybe suggesting a reduced photoactivity of the final catalyst.The influence of the heat treatment duration on the V O -rich-TiO 2 phase structures is also described in Figure S1.Although the diffraction peaks were slightly increased, a nearly negligible difference was found when the calcining time was set to 1-12 h, meaning that the calcining time had little effect on the catalyst phase structures.To assess the effect of the loaded Pt metal, we performed an XRD measurement of the 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).After Pt loading, the intensity of the diffraction peak corresponding to anatase TiO 2 was weakened drastically compared with the peak of the sample before Pt loading, indicating the decreased crystallinity of the catalyst, which may derive from the formation of more surface area oxygen vacancies that cause residual stress. 57It can be also reflected from the enlarge view of 15-35that a slightly broadening on the FWHM may be induced by the residual stress deriving from the newly generated oxygen defects and the reduced crystalline size (Figure S2).Analogical phenomena have been observed in Bi-based compounds, 58,59 ZnO and CeO 2 . 60,61This finding was consistent with ESR and DFT calculation results revealing that single Pt atom can promote the formation of the more surface oxygen vacancies (see below).Contrastingly, the intensity of the XRD peaks of the Pt-loaded P25 TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies only show slight decrement than that of P25 (Figure S3).The phase structure of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different temperatures was further studied by Raman spectra because of their strong scattering properties.In Figure 1c, the four typical characterized Raman bands at wavenumbers of 144, 397, 515, and 639 cm -1 are indexed obviously as the symmetric E g , B 1g , A 1g , and E g Raman-active modes of the anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 62The increased annealing temperature leads to the gradually decreased half peak width of the strongest peak located at 144 cm -1 , which reflects the vibration of O-Ti-O, suggesting a more perfect crystallization of the catalyst.For V O -TiO 2 -700, the weak peak located at 446 cm -1 showed the emergence of the rutile phase, similar to the peak observed in the P25 TiO 2 spectrum (445 cm -1 ).Likewise, the intensity of The Journal of Physical Chemistry C D the Raman peak of V O -TiO 2 -500 clearly decreased after the single Pt atom loading (Figure 1d), while the intensity of the Raman peak obtained for Pt-P25 TiO 2 slightly decreased (Figure S4), corresponding to the XRD results.These findings may hint a presence of an interaction between V O and the supported single Pt atom. The morphology and structure of the TAN precursor and V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 used as a representative sample were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and TEM.The TAN precursor of O-defect-rich TiO 2 has a layered structure (Figure 2a) with a distance of approximately 0.8 nm between the adjacent layers. 63After annealing at 500 C, V O -TiO 2 -500 shows irregular particles (Figure 2b) with clear (101) anatase phase titania crystallographic planes having d s 0.33 nm, indicating the formation of anatase phase titania, as confirmed by XRD (Figure 2c).When the photo-deposition method was used to decorate Pt nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO 2 , the same lattice fringes with d s 0.33 nm could be observed, indicating that the loading of Pt has no impact on the crystal structure of TiO 2 (Figure 2d).But a vague border in the V O -TiO 2 -500 sample can be found when loading Pt, which may also hint the presence of an interaction between Pt and V O .Meanwhile, no difference on the morphology was observed for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 before and after single Pt atom loading (Figures 2b andS5).It should be noted that no corresponding signals related to crystalline Pt species are detected in the XRD patterns of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).Not only that, the presence of Pt nanoparticles was not observed obviously, too (Figures 2d andS5), suggesting a high dispersion of Pt species.The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings show the uniform distribution of Pt, Ti, and O elements (Figure 2f).The Pt loading content determined by ICP-OES was about 0.36.In view of this, HAADF-STEM was carried out, where the dispersion of Pt species at the atomic scale was observed clearly as several isolated bright dots signed by red circles, indicating the existence of atomically dispersed Pt (Figures 2e andS6).From Table S1, after calcining the TANs, a clear decrease in the specific surface areas was detected from 390.6 m 2 g -1 for the TANs to 297.7, 174.2, and 128.0 m 2 g -1 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively, which is attributed to the change in the morphology from TANs to irregular nanoparticles after annealing.The increased calcination temperature leads to the decreased catalytic specific surface area because the high temperature makes the grains grow and even sinter, resulting in the serious collapse of small channels or the blockage of channels. To study the defect structure of TiO 2 , ESR spectra were collected.All the catalysts except for P25 TiO 2 (Figure S7a) exhibit a strong ESR signal at g 2.0 (Figures 3a andS7), indicating the existence of oxygen vacancies in their structure. 33,64,65Upon increasing the heat-treatment temperature, the ESR signal of 2.0 becomes much stronger, showing that more O vacancy defects are formed in the catalysts structures (Figure S7b).Conversely, prolonging the heattreatment time seems to be detrimental to the generation of more oxygen vacancies, and the annealing time of 2 h is applicable (Figure S7c).Fascinatingly, the obvious increase in the ESR signal intensity is found for Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b), indicating a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, which may be related to the inducing effect of single Pt atom, promoting more oxygen vacancy defects to form on the surface/subsurface, corresponding to DFT calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). To give further evidence of the increased oxygen vacancy defects, PALS measurements of before and after single Pt atom supporting for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 were conducted to test the lifetime of the positron.As shown in Figure 4, 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 gave longer average positron lifetime than its counterpart, which results from the positron trapped by O vacancy defects.The positron lifespan spectra of V O rich-TiO 2 sample gave two lifetime constituents, 1 and 2 , accompanied by corresponding relative intensities, I 1 and I 2 (Table S2).The shorter constituent ( 1 ) is usually ascribed to the free annihilation of positrons in a defect-free crystal, called as the The Journal of Physical Chemistry C first lifespan of positrons. 66In an unordered system, little vacancies or shallow positron trap from oxygen vacancies may result in the decreased electron density of the surrounding to increase the lifetime of 1 . 67Compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 1 0.202 ns), the prolonged 1 (0.208 ns) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 shows that large numbers of oxygen vacancy defects were incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice by Pt atoms loading.Accordingly, the relative intensity (I 1 ) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 also increased sharply from 10.63 in V O -TiO 2 -500 to 15.35 in 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500. 68The longer lifetime component 2 was ascribed to the positron annihilation captured by O vacancies, 66 hinting that the longer value of 2 (0.387 ns) for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 revealed the increase of oxygen vacancies concentration compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 2 0.365 ns).It is worth noting that the increase of 2 was 86.1 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while it is 44.7 for V O -TiO 2 -500 compared with 1 , which means the generation of a huge number of boundarylike defects after Pt atoms loading 68 clearly related to the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies corresponding to theoretical calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). The surface chemical states and constituent elements of V O -TiO 2 -T (T 400, 500, 600 C) and 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 were analyzed by means of XPS technology and the results are described in Figure 5 to further expound the interaction between the oxygen vacancies and single Pt atom.The survey spectra presented in Figure 5a show that the Ti, O, and C elements from reference exist for all the samples.No signal corresponding to the Pt element is detected in the survey spectrum of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 because of the lower practical Pt loading.In the Ti 2p spectra (Figure 5b), compared to V O -TiO 2 -400 (Ti 2p 3/2 : 458.53 eV), the Ti 2p 3/2 peaks of V O -TiO 2 -500 (458.06 eV) and V O -TiO 2 -600 (458.14 eV) shift obviously to lower binding energies, which is closely connected to the generation of the more oxygen vacancy defects in the two samples, inducing a changed chemical environment of the titanium ions, as shown by the ESR results.Surprisingly, the distinct decrease and larger shift to a high binding energy were found for the 1 Pt-loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample.The similar changes were observed in O 1 s spectra of the 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample (Figure 5c).The peaks at 531.30 and 529.80 eV can be, respectively, indexed to the oxygen atoms in the neighborhood of oxygen vacancies and O bond of Ti-O-Ti. 21After loading single Pt atom, the O 1s peaks shift to high binding energies, accompanied by a sharp decrease in the peak intensity.This finding could be explained as follows: (i) the decreasing intensity of the Ti 2p peak and O 1s peak for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 is due to the Pt loading, which impairs the detection sensitivity of the instrument for Ti and O; (ii) the shifting of the binding energy values may be related to the strong single Pt atom-TiO 2 substrate interaction, which would anchor strongly single Pt atom on the TiO 2 surface to accumulate more electrons for the photocatalytic reaction because of the strong stabilizing ability resulting from vacancies.Nevertheless, except for the aforementioned change, careful study shows that the peak corresponding to the O atoms around the oxygen vacancy defects becomes more intense upon single Pt atom loading, and the integral-area ratios of the peak at 532.60 eV (O 1s peak for the oxygen vacancies) to the peak at 530.20 eV (O 1s peak for the lattice oxygen) were determined to be 0.35 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while this is 0.095, 0.081, and 0.092 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively (Figure S8).This obviously suggested the increased content of oxygen vacancies The Journal of Physical Chemistry C F due to the interaction of the atomically dispersed Pt and oxygen vacancies promoting to generate more oxygen vacancy defects on the surface/subsurface of the catalyst by strongly decreasing the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, corresponding to ESR, PALS, and the theoretical calculation results (see the Theoretical Calculation section). 37In Figure 5d, the typical XPS spectra of Pt 4f centered at 70.26 and 73.90 eV showed the Pt metallic state.Moreover, the two peaks located at 72.60 and 75.60 eV indicates of the presence of platinum oxide. 69igure 6a gives the absorbance versus wavelength plots of the P25, TAN, and V O -rich-TiO 2 -based samples.Compared to the TAN precursor material, the absorption of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples shifts to longer wavelength, obviously because of the influence of the oxygen vacancy formation.Nevertheless, the difference between the absorptions of the different V O -rich-TiO 2 samples with different oxygen vacancy concentrations is negligible and similar to that of P25, which indicates that no obvious visible light absorption is generated by the introduced oxygen vacancies in the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples, as reported by the literature. 21Additionally, the same conclusion could also be drawn based on the absorptions of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples prepared with the different heat-treatment times (Figure S9).To get the effect of the isolated single Pt atom, the UV-vis absorption spectra of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25-TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies were obtained.Surprisingly, after Pt atom loading, significant visible-light-driven absorption is found for the Pt-loaded V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which is associated with the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies (Figure 6b). 37,38Nevertheless, almost no change is observed for the absorption of Pt-deposited P25 in comparison with that of the pristine P25 (the inset of Figure 6b).These findings show again that a strong interaction existed between single Pt atom and oxygen vacancy defects for the Pt atom-decorated V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which corresponds to To study the dynamics of electron transfer on the interface of the catalysts, the transient I-t curves were measured with light-on and light-off cycles.As displayed in Figure 7a, the introduced oxygen vacancy defects brought about higher photocurrent values for all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, especially V O -TiO 2 -500 with a maximum photocurrent of 0.45 mA, which is almost 2.7 and 16 times as high as that of the P25 and TAN samples.This could occur because the formed oxygen vacancy defects captured electrons and thus suppressed the recombination of photoinduced charges. 70Figure 7b displays Nyquist curves with arc-like distribution patterns and the corresponding equivalent circuit.The smaller arc radius at a low frequency is usually connected to the charge migration at the interface of the semiconductor and in the electrolyte of the tested electrode. 71According to the radius of the Nyquist plots, the V O -rich TiO 2 samples exhibit a smaller charge transfer resistance (R3) compared with the TAN precursor, as shown by the I-t results.Among the samples, V O -TiO 2 -500 demonstrates the smallest charge transfer resistance than the other two V O -TiO 2 samples and P25 TiO 2 , meaning that the charge transportation at the interface is faster for V O -TiO 2 -500.Figure 7c presents the PL emission spectra of the as-obtained V O -rich TiO 2 samples using P25 and TAN as references at an excited wavelength of 400 nm to prove the improved separation efficiency of the e --h pairs upon introducing oxygen vacancies.The decay of the PL signals for all the V Orich TiO 2 catalysts is sharp in comparison with that of the P25 and TAN reference samples, indicating that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies significantly inhibited the annihilation of the photoinduced electrons and holes. 72The V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample shows the weakest PL emission, demonstrating the best carrier separation efficiency, which means that a more robust photocatalytic process can occur over it.However, introducing excess oxygen vacancies leads to an enhanced PL emission (such as V O -TiO 2 -600) because the excess O defects can be viewed as the recombination centers of the e --h pairs, which impacts the photoreactivity of the sample.Generally, the carrier density could affect the dynamic performance and photocatalytic activity of the catalysts.Therefore, the Mott-Schottky tests of P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 were performed to determine the different donor densities of the two photocatalysts, as described in Figure 7d.The two samples show typical characteristics of an n-type semiconductor with a positive slope.The donor density can be reflected by the magnitude of the slope, and the slope reduces with the increased donor density. 73In comparison with P25 TiO 2 , the much smaller slope of V O -TiO 2 -500 indicated a higher donor density originating from the contribution of oxygen vacancies formed by annealing the TANs, which would significantly promote the carrier transfer and photocatalytic activity. 3.2.Theoretical Calculations.The aforementioned experimental characterization results showed that a strong synergistic effect existed between the oxygen vacancies and loaded single Pt atom.To better understand such a mechanism, we studied the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with and without V O defects in the framework of the KS DFT.Therein, configurations where that V O s exist on the surface, subsurface, and inner layers are considered (Figure S10).When a Pt atom adsorbs on a clean A-TiO 2 (101) surface, O 2c -O 3c -O 2c site is the most favorable site (Figure 8a), as proved by many reports, 747576 so we adopt this model directly (Figure 8b).The calculated adsorption energy of the single Pt atom on the clean surface is -2.89 eV (Table 1).Meanwhile, on the A-TiO 2 (101) surface with different oxygen vacancy concentrations, the adsorption energy of the single Pt atom 1).In other words, a surface V O has an anchoring effect on the loaded Pt 1 , which is consistent with the previous study that surface defects can strongly affect the stability of single atom-catalyst. 76,77ven more fascinating is that the formation energy of the V O s obviously decreases upon loading with Pt, especially for surface and subsurface V O s.In the absence of Pt loading, the formation energies of the surface and subsurface O vacancies are 3.31 and 4.00 eV, respectively, and they decreased to1.92 and 3.46 eV after loading the single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst (Table 1).Nevertheless, the deposited of the Pt atom seems to have no clear effect on the formation energies of the interior oxygen vacancies.These results indicated that, based on the formation energies, the loaded single Pt atom more strongly favors the formation of surface/subsurface oxygen vacancies than the V O s in the bulk as proved by the increased ESR signal over 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b) and PALS (Figure 4). Generally, the formation of V O s generates extra electrons in TiO 2 nanomaterials, increasing the electron concentration, which favors the improved photocatalytic efficiency.However, note that the bulk and surface/subsurface V O s have different influences on the photoreactivity.In stark contrast to bulk V O s generally served as the charge carrier recombination centers, surface/subsurface V O s have proven to be helpful for the efficient separation of the photoinduced electron and hole pairs.The surface/subsurface V O s give rise to more donor electrons localized on the surface region, facilitating the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and thereby improving the photoactivity of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples. 26ccording to our experimental result, the sample that single Pt atom with more V O s showed higher activity.To further determine how surface vacancy interplay with Pt 1 and improve photocatalytic activity, we studied the charge distribution of the Pt/TiO 2 system.Based on our Bader charge analysis, when Pt 1 react with V O 1, it obtains 0.94 e, indicating charge transfers from the substrate to Pt atom.As a comparison, when Pt reacts with a clean surface or surface with inner V O s, it will lose charge, indicating charge will migrate from the Pt atom to substate.This point can also be supported by our charge density difference analysis (Figure S11).Hence, it is reasonable that for the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with surface V O s, such defect provides more electrons and thus increases the carrier concentration.These electrons may transfer quickly to the loaded single Pt atom, the photocatalytic active site, and participate in the photocatalytic reactions on the surface and, consequently, improve photocatalytic efficiency.The Journal of Physical Chemistry C pubs.acs.org/JPCCenhanced hydrogen production rates (667, 1077, and 651 mol h -1 , respectively, for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600) compared to the P25 (344 mol h -1 ) and TAN (239 mol h -1 ) samples without oxygen vacancies.The best H 2 -production rate of 1077 mol h -1 was obtained by V O -TiO 2 -500, which is approximately three times that of P25 (Figure 9a).It is unquestionably related to the contribution of the introduced oxygen vacancies, whose existence remarkably increases the donor density in the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, thereby promoting carrier transfer to the surface and causing more electrons to participate in the photocatalysis reaction under the same irradiation.The higher concentration of V O defects does not seem to be good for H 2 evolution because excess oxygen vacancies become recombination centers of e -h pairs, impairing the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. 72dditionally, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) was also measured and calculated according to similar photocatalytic reaction conditions by using a 365 nm UV light bandpass filter (see the Supporting Information).Specifically, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample (21.7) was 3.14 times as high as that of P25 TiO 2 (6.9), implying that the oxygen vacancy defect-rich sample shows a better photocatalytic performance.To perform a systematic study, the effect of the pH, Pt deposition amount, and sacrificial agents on the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance was also studied.The maximal H 2 evolution rate was obtained at a pH 4.7 0.3 (Figure S12a).The excess deposition of Pt leads to the gradual deterioration of the hydrogen production rate, which may be due to more active surface sites covered by the Pt (Figure S12b). 22Using methyl alcohol as the electron donor, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 evolution from water was shown by the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples (Figure S12c).Figure 9b shows the photocatalytic stability of V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25, and the H 2 production by the two samples does not clearly decrease over four cycles, especially for V O -TiO 2 -500.The TON values have also been calculated to evaluate the long-term test stability of catalysts for H 2 production and the results are listed in the Supporting Information (Table S3).It should be noted that the TON of V O -TiO 2 -500 for H 2 evolution is clearly higher than that of P25 TiO 2 , suggesting that the obtained V O defect-rich TiO 2 sample in this work can serve as a practical photocatalyst to improve the photocatalytic H 2 generation activity.As increasing the annealing time, the attenuated photocatalytic H 2 formation rates may be related to the decreased V O concentration (Figure S12d). The gradually increasing emission of CO 2 into the atmosphere caused by burning fossil fuels generates problems of global warming for our society.The reduction of CO 2 with the aid of sunlight-driven photocatalysis technology not only leads to the decreased amount of CO 2 greenhouse gas, relieving global greenhouse effects but also converts CO 2 to value-added fuels, solving the energy problem. 78,79Therefore, we carried out the photoreduction test of CO 2 with H 2 O over the as-obtained catalysts using UV-vis light irradiation in pure water without any sacrificial agents to avoid interference, and the results are described in Figure 10.Clearly, the amounts of CH 4 and CO over all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples are significantly larger than those over the commercial P25 TiO 2 .In particular, V O -TiO 2 -500 exhibits the highest yields of CH 4 and CO with Pt single atoms loading as cocatalyst but without H 2 formation, which is almost 2.2 and 2.3 times higher than that achieved by P25 TiO 2 , respectively (Table S5).The higher selectivity for CH 4 than that of CO over all the catalysts is due to the Pt cocatalyst loading. 12Simultaneously, the AQE for CO 2 conversion has also been obtained.The AQE of the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst (V O -TiO 2 -500) is 0.064, which is almost 18-fold of commercial P25 TiO 2 .Figure 11 shows the cycle measurement results of the P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.During the four cycles, the generation rates of the CH 4 and CO did not show the obvious decrease, displaying a good stability for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and at the same time exhibiting a fascinating application potential for the photoconversion of CO 2 with H 2 O.The TON values of CO 2 photoreduction to generate CO and CH 4 have also been calculated (Table S4), in which the V O -TiO 2 -500 shows the clearly enhanced TON values compared to P25 TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction. CO 2 reduction to produce CH 4 is an eight-electron process, which requires gathering the more photogenerated charge carriers with a long lifetime. 80The Pt atom strongly anchored with the help of the large of oxygen vacancies can promote more electrons to accumulate on the surface of the catalyst, leading to a higher catalytic performance of the catalyst.In the work, without any sacrificial agents being added, CO 2 is the only carbon source.For it, control photocatalytic experiments were conducted under identical conditions but using N 2 as the carrier gas replacing CO 2 , in which no CO or CH 4 product could be detected, indicating that carbides in this experiment did not originate from carbon contamination.In addition, the theoretical calculation and experiment results show that CO 2 can be strongly adsorbed on V O existing on the TiO 2 surface and the activation barrier of CO 2 reduction can be greatly reduced. 81,82At the same time, the generated V O can be viewed as reactive sites to promote the activation of CO 2 to form CO 2 -, which could enhance the product rate of CO and The Journal of Physical Chemistry C CH 4 . 82The photoinduced holes in the VB can be oxidated by the adsorbed hydroxyl species to form O 2 . In a word, based on the abovementioned experimental and DFT calculation results, under the same Pt loading, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 photoreduction performance shown by the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples was undoubtedly related to the synergistic action of the O vacancies and isolated single Pt atom.The existence of surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies strongly anchored single Pt atom onto the surface of the catalyst, and in turn, the loaded single-atomic-site Pt bring about the generation of more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies, as illustrated in Figures 3b,4 and Table S2, by decreasing the formation energy of an O vacancy on the surface and subsurface, according to the DFT calculation.While the existence of more oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 increased the donor density not only promoting the carrier transfer but also making more electrons accumulate in the sink provided by single Pt atom to participate in the photoreaction, thus promoting the photoactivity.The theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the O defects on the surface of TiO 2 favor the adsorption and activation of CO 2 by the strong actions with the O atoms of CO 2 and the effective generation of CO 2 intermediates, leading to the dissociation of CO 2 . 78,79The CO 2 adsorption measurements were therefore carried out under environmental conditions of 298 K at low pressure, as presented in Figure S13.These measurements show that the CO 2 adsorption capacity at 298 K and 1 atm (760 mmHg) over V O -TiO 2 -500 could reach 10.94 cm 3 /g, while that is 7.09 cm 3 /g over P25 TiO 2 .The abovementioned result indicates that the introduced V O defects endow our prepared TiO 2 sample with an enhanced CO 2 adsorption capacity, improving its photocatalytic activity.It is just derived from the synergistic effect of V O and loaded single Pt atom, the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst obtained by us showed the enhanced H 2 product and CO 2 reduction performance."}, {"llm generation": "catalyst", "source": "It is just derived from the synergistic effect of V O and loaded single Pt atom, the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst obtained by us showed the enhanced H 2 product and CO 2 reduction performance.", "context": "3.1.Characterization and Analysis.As displayed in Figure 1a, the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different calcination temperatures exhibited narrow and intense XRD peaks of 2 25.3, 37.8, and 48.0, which corresponds to the (101), (004), and (200) crystallographic planes of the anatase TiO 2 structure, respectively. 56With the increased annealing temperature, the corresponding diffraction peak became sharper, implying a more perfect lattice structure.The rutile phase can be observed in the sample prepared at 700 C, similar to the XRD pattern of pristine P25 TiO 2 , maybe suggesting a reduced photoactivity of the final catalyst.The influence of the heat treatment duration on the V O -rich-TiO 2 phase structures is also described in Figure S1.Although the diffraction peaks were slightly increased, a nearly negligible difference was found when the calcining time was set to 1-12 h, meaning that the calcining time had little effect on the catalyst phase structures.To assess the effect of the loaded Pt metal, we performed an XRD measurement of the 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).After Pt loading, the intensity of the diffraction peak corresponding to anatase TiO 2 was weakened drastically compared with the peak of the sample before Pt loading, indicating the decreased crystallinity of the catalyst, which may derive from the formation of more surface area oxygen vacancies that cause residual stress. 57It can be also reflected from the enlarge view of 15-35that a slightly broadening on the FWHM may be induced by the residual stress deriving from the newly generated oxygen defects and the reduced crystalline size (Figure S2).Analogical phenomena have been observed in Bi-based compounds, 58,59 ZnO and CeO 2 . 60,61This finding was consistent with ESR and DFT calculation results revealing that single Pt atom can promote the formation of the more surface oxygen vacancies (see below).Contrastingly, the intensity of the XRD peaks of the Pt-loaded P25 TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies only show slight decrement than that of P25 (Figure S3).The phase structure of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different temperatures was further studied by Raman spectra because of their strong scattering properties.In Figure 1c, the four typical characterized Raman bands at wavenumbers of 144, 397, 515, and 639 cm -1 are indexed obviously as the symmetric E g , B 1g , A 1g , and E g Raman-active modes of the anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 62The increased annealing temperature leads to the gradually decreased half peak width of the strongest peak located at 144 cm -1 , which reflects the vibration of O-Ti-O, suggesting a more perfect crystallization of the catalyst.For V O -TiO 2 -700, the weak peak located at 446 cm -1 showed the emergence of the rutile phase, similar to the peak observed in the P25 TiO 2 spectrum (445 cm -1 ).Likewise, the intensity of The Journal of Physical Chemistry C D the Raman peak of V O -TiO 2 -500 clearly decreased after the single Pt atom loading (Figure 1d), while the intensity of the Raman peak obtained for Pt-P25 TiO 2 slightly decreased (Figure S4), corresponding to the XRD results.These findings may hint a presence of an interaction between V O and the supported single Pt atom. The morphology and structure of the TAN precursor and V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 used as a representative sample were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and TEM.The TAN precursor of O-defect-rich TiO 2 has a layered structure (Figure 2a) with a distance of approximately 0.8 nm between the adjacent layers. 63After annealing at 500 C, V O -TiO 2 -500 shows irregular particles (Figure 2b) with clear (101) anatase phase titania crystallographic planes having d s 0.33 nm, indicating the formation of anatase phase titania, as confirmed by XRD (Figure 2c).When the photo-deposition method was used to decorate Pt nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO 2 , the same lattice fringes with d s 0.33 nm could be observed, indicating that the loading of Pt has no impact on the crystal structure of TiO 2 (Figure 2d).But a vague border in the V O -TiO 2 -500 sample can be found when loading Pt, which may also hint the presence of an interaction between Pt and V O .Meanwhile, no difference on the morphology was observed for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 before and after single Pt atom loading (Figures 2b andS5).It should be noted that no corresponding signals related to crystalline Pt species are detected in the XRD patterns of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).Not only that, the presence of Pt nanoparticles was not observed obviously, too (Figures 2d andS5), suggesting a high dispersion of Pt species.The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings show the uniform distribution of Pt, Ti, and O elements (Figure 2f).The Pt loading content determined by ICP-OES was about 0.36.In view of this, HAADF-STEM was carried out, where the dispersion of Pt species at the atomic scale was observed clearly as several isolated bright dots signed by red circles, indicating the existence of atomically dispersed Pt (Figures 2e andS6).From Table S1, after calcining the TANs, a clear decrease in the specific surface areas was detected from 390.6 m 2 g -1 for the TANs to 297.7, 174.2, and 128.0 m 2 g -1 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively, which is attributed to the change in the morphology from TANs to irregular nanoparticles after annealing.The increased calcination temperature leads to the decreased catalytic specific surface area because the high temperature makes the grains grow and even sinter, resulting in the serious collapse of small channels or the blockage of channels. To study the defect structure of TiO 2 , ESR spectra were collected.All the catalysts except for P25 TiO 2 (Figure S7a) exhibit a strong ESR signal at g 2.0 (Figures 3a andS7), indicating the existence of oxygen vacancies in their structure. 33,64,65Upon increasing the heat-treatment temperature, the ESR signal of 2.0 becomes much stronger, showing that more O vacancy defects are formed in the catalysts structures (Figure S7b).Conversely, prolonging the heattreatment time seems to be detrimental to the generation of more oxygen vacancies, and the annealing time of 2 h is applicable (Figure S7c).Fascinatingly, the obvious increase in the ESR signal intensity is found for Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b), indicating a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, which may be related to the inducing effect of single Pt atom, promoting more oxygen vacancy defects to form on the surface/subsurface, corresponding to DFT calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). To give further evidence of the increased oxygen vacancy defects, PALS measurements of before and after single Pt atom supporting for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 were conducted to test the lifetime of the positron.As shown in Figure 4, 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 gave longer average positron lifetime than its counterpart, which results from the positron trapped by O vacancy defects.The positron lifespan spectra of V O rich-TiO 2 sample gave two lifetime constituents, 1 and 2 , accompanied by corresponding relative intensities, I 1 and I 2 (Table S2).The shorter constituent ( 1 ) is usually ascribed to the free annihilation of positrons in a defect-free crystal, called as the The Journal of Physical Chemistry C first lifespan of positrons. 66In an unordered system, little vacancies or shallow positron trap from oxygen vacancies may result in the decreased electron density of the surrounding to increase the lifetime of 1 . 67Compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 1 0.202 ns), the prolonged 1 (0.208 ns) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 shows that large numbers of oxygen vacancy defects were incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice by Pt atoms loading.Accordingly, the relative intensity (I 1 ) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 also increased sharply from 10.63 in V O -TiO 2 -500 to 15.35 in 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500. 68The longer lifetime component 2 was ascribed to the positron annihilation captured by O vacancies, 66 hinting that the longer value of 2 (0.387 ns) for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 revealed the increase of oxygen vacancies concentration compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 2 0.365 ns).It is worth noting that the increase of 2 was 86.1 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while it is 44.7 for V O -TiO 2 -500 compared with 1 , which means the generation of a huge number of boundarylike defects after Pt atoms loading 68 clearly related to the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies corresponding to theoretical calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). The surface chemical states and constituent elements of V O -TiO 2 -T (T 400, 500, 600 C) and 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 were analyzed by means of XPS technology and the results are described in Figure 5 to further expound the interaction between the oxygen vacancies and single Pt atom.The survey spectra presented in Figure 5a show that the Ti, O, and C elements from reference exist for all the samples.No signal corresponding to the Pt element is detected in the survey spectrum of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 because of the lower practical Pt loading.In the Ti 2p spectra (Figure 5b), compared to V O -TiO 2 -400 (Ti 2p 3/2 : 458.53 eV), the Ti 2p 3/2 peaks of V O -TiO 2 -500 (458.06 eV) and V O -TiO 2 -600 (458.14 eV) shift obviously to lower binding energies, which is closely connected to the generation of the more oxygen vacancy defects in the two samples, inducing a changed chemical environment of the titanium ions, as shown by the ESR results.Surprisingly, the distinct decrease and larger shift to a high binding energy were found for the 1 Pt-loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample.The similar changes were observed in O 1 s spectra of the 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample (Figure 5c).The peaks at 531.30 and 529.80 eV can be, respectively, indexed to the oxygen atoms in the neighborhood of oxygen vacancies and O bond of Ti-O-Ti. 21After loading single Pt atom, the O 1s peaks shift to high binding energies, accompanied by a sharp decrease in the peak intensity.This finding could be explained as follows: (i) the decreasing intensity of the Ti 2p peak and O 1s peak for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 is due to the Pt loading, which impairs the detection sensitivity of the instrument for Ti and O; (ii) the shifting of the binding energy values may be related to the strong single Pt atom-TiO 2 substrate interaction, which would anchor strongly single Pt atom on the TiO 2 surface to accumulate more electrons for the photocatalytic reaction because of the strong stabilizing ability resulting from vacancies.Nevertheless, except for the aforementioned change, careful study shows that the peak corresponding to the O atoms around the oxygen vacancy defects becomes more intense upon single Pt atom loading, and the integral-area ratios of the peak at 532.60 eV (O 1s peak for the oxygen vacancies) to the peak at 530.20 eV (O 1s peak for the lattice oxygen) were determined to be 0.35 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while this is 0.095, 0.081, and 0.092 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively (Figure S8).This obviously suggested the increased content of oxygen vacancies The Journal of Physical Chemistry C F due to the interaction of the atomically dispersed Pt and oxygen vacancies promoting to generate more oxygen vacancy defects on the surface/subsurface of the catalyst by strongly decreasing the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, corresponding to ESR, PALS, and the theoretical calculation results (see the Theoretical Calculation section). 37In Figure 5d, the typical XPS spectra of Pt 4f centered at 70.26 and 73.90 eV showed the Pt metallic state.Moreover, the two peaks located at 72.60 and 75.60 eV indicates of the presence of platinum oxide. 69igure 6a gives the absorbance versus wavelength plots of the P25, TAN, and V O -rich-TiO 2 -based samples.Compared to the TAN precursor material, the absorption of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples shifts to longer wavelength, obviously because of the influence of the oxygen vacancy formation.Nevertheless, the difference between the absorptions of the different V O -rich-TiO 2 samples with different oxygen vacancy concentrations is negligible and similar to that of P25, which indicates that no obvious visible light absorption is generated by the introduced oxygen vacancies in the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples, as reported by the literature. 21Additionally, the same conclusion could also be drawn based on the absorptions of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples prepared with the different heat-treatment times (Figure S9).To get the effect of the isolated single Pt atom, the UV-vis absorption spectra of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25-TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies were obtained.Surprisingly, after Pt atom loading, significant visible-light-driven absorption is found for the Pt-loaded V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which is associated with the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies (Figure 6b). 37,38Nevertheless, almost no change is observed for the absorption of Pt-deposited P25 in comparison with that of the pristine P25 (the inset of Figure 6b).These findings show again that a strong interaction existed between single Pt atom and oxygen vacancy defects for the Pt atom-decorated V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which corresponds to To study the dynamics of electron transfer on the interface of the catalysts, the transient I-t curves were measured with light-on and light-off cycles.As displayed in Figure 7a, the introduced oxygen vacancy defects brought about higher photocurrent values for all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, especially V O -TiO 2 -500 with a maximum photocurrent of 0.45 mA, which is almost 2.7 and 16 times as high as that of the P25 and TAN samples.This could occur because the formed oxygen vacancy defects captured electrons and thus suppressed the recombination of photoinduced charges. 70Figure 7b displays Nyquist curves with arc-like distribution patterns and the corresponding equivalent circuit.The smaller arc radius at a low frequency is usually connected to the charge migration at the interface of the semiconductor and in the electrolyte of the tested electrode. 71According to the radius of the Nyquist plots, the V O -rich TiO 2 samples exhibit a smaller charge transfer resistance (R3) compared with the TAN precursor, as shown by the I-t results.Among the samples, V O -TiO 2 -500 demonstrates the smallest charge transfer resistance than the other two V O -TiO 2 samples and P25 TiO 2 , meaning that the charge transportation at the interface is faster for V O -TiO 2 -500.Figure 7c presents the PL emission spectra of the as-obtained V O -rich TiO 2 samples using P25 and TAN as references at an excited wavelength of 400 nm to prove the improved separation efficiency of the e --h pairs upon introducing oxygen vacancies.The decay of the PL signals for all the V Orich TiO 2 catalysts is sharp in comparison with that of the P25 and TAN reference samples, indicating that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies significantly inhibited the annihilation of the photoinduced electrons and holes. 72The V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample shows the weakest PL emission, demonstrating the best carrier separation efficiency, which means that a more robust photocatalytic process can occur over it.However, introducing excess oxygen vacancies leads to an enhanced PL emission (such as V O -TiO 2 -600) because the excess O defects can be viewed as the recombination centers of the e --h pairs, which impacts the photoreactivity of the sample.Generally, the carrier density could affect the dynamic performance and photocatalytic activity of the catalysts.Therefore, the Mott-Schottky tests of P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 were performed to determine the different donor densities of the two photocatalysts, as described in Figure 7d.The two samples show typical characteristics of an n-type semiconductor with a positive slope.The donor density can be reflected by the magnitude of the slope, and the slope reduces with the increased donor density. 73In comparison with P25 TiO 2 , the much smaller slope of V O -TiO 2 -500 indicated a higher donor density originating from the contribution of oxygen vacancies formed by annealing the TANs, which would significantly promote the carrier transfer and photocatalytic activity. 3.2.Theoretical Calculations.The aforementioned experimental characterization results showed that a strong synergistic effect existed between the oxygen vacancies and loaded single Pt atom.To better understand such a mechanism, we studied the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with and without V O defects in the framework of the KS DFT.Therein, configurations where that V O s exist on the surface, subsurface, and inner layers are considered (Figure S10).When a Pt atom adsorbs on a clean A-TiO 2 (101) surface, O 2c -O 3c -O 2c site is the most favorable site (Figure 8a), as proved by many reports, 747576 so we adopt this model directly (Figure 8b).The calculated adsorption energy of the single Pt atom on the clean surface is -2.89 eV (Table 1).Meanwhile, on the A-TiO 2 (101) surface with different oxygen vacancy concentrations, the adsorption energy of the single Pt atom 1).In other words, a surface V O has an anchoring effect on the loaded Pt 1 , which is consistent with the previous study that surface defects can strongly affect the stability of single atom-catalyst. 76,77ven more fascinating is that the formation energy of the V O s obviously decreases upon loading with Pt, especially for surface and subsurface V O s.In the absence of Pt loading, the formation energies of the surface and subsurface O vacancies are 3.31 and 4.00 eV, respectively, and they decreased to1.92 and 3.46 eV after loading the single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst (Table 1).Nevertheless, the deposited of the Pt atom seems to have no clear effect on the formation energies of the interior oxygen vacancies.These results indicated that, based on the formation energies, the loaded single Pt atom more strongly favors the formation of surface/subsurface oxygen vacancies than the V O s in the bulk as proved by the increased ESR signal over 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b) and PALS (Figure 4). Generally, the formation of V O s generates extra electrons in TiO 2 nanomaterials, increasing the electron concentration, which favors the improved photocatalytic efficiency.However, note that the bulk and surface/subsurface V O s have different influences on the photoreactivity.In stark contrast to bulk V O s generally served as the charge carrier recombination centers, surface/subsurface V O s have proven to be helpful for the efficient separation of the photoinduced electron and hole pairs.The surface/subsurface V O s give rise to more donor electrons localized on the surface region, facilitating the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and thereby improving the photoactivity of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples. 26ccording to our experimental result, the sample that single Pt atom with more V O s showed higher activity.To further determine how surface vacancy interplay with Pt 1 and improve photocatalytic activity, we studied the charge distribution of the Pt/TiO 2 system.Based on our Bader charge analysis, when Pt 1 react with V O 1, it obtains 0.94 e, indicating charge transfers from the substrate to Pt atom.As a comparison, when Pt reacts with a clean surface or surface with inner V O s, it will lose charge, indicating charge will migrate from the Pt atom to substate.This point can also be supported by our charge density difference analysis (Figure S11).Hence, it is reasonable that for the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with surface V O s, such defect provides more electrons and thus increases the carrier concentration.These electrons may transfer quickly to the loaded single Pt atom, the photocatalytic active site, and participate in the photocatalytic reactions on the surface and, consequently, improve photocatalytic efficiency.The Journal of Physical Chemistry C pubs.acs.org/JPCCenhanced hydrogen production rates (667, 1077, and 651 mol h -1 , respectively, for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600) compared to the P25 (344 mol h -1 ) and TAN (239 mol h -1 ) samples without oxygen vacancies.The best H 2 -production rate of 1077 mol h -1 was obtained by V O -TiO 2 -500, which is approximately three times that of P25 (Figure 9a).It is unquestionably related to the contribution of the introduced oxygen vacancies, whose existence remarkably increases the donor density in the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, thereby promoting carrier transfer to the surface and causing more electrons to participate in the photocatalysis reaction under the same irradiation.The higher concentration of V O defects does not seem to be good for H 2 evolution because excess oxygen vacancies become recombination centers of e -h pairs, impairing the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. 72dditionally, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) was also measured and calculated according to similar photocatalytic reaction conditions by using a 365 nm UV light bandpass filter (see the Supporting Information).Specifically, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample (21.7) was 3.14 times as high as that of P25 TiO 2 (6.9), implying that the oxygen vacancy defect-rich sample shows a better photocatalytic performance.To perform a systematic study, the effect of the pH, Pt deposition amount, and sacrificial agents on the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance was also studied.The maximal H 2 evolution rate was obtained at a pH 4.7 0.3 (Figure S12a).The excess deposition of Pt leads to the gradual deterioration of the hydrogen production rate, which may be due to more active surface sites covered by the Pt (Figure S12b). 22Using methyl alcohol as the electron donor, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 evolution from water was shown by the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples (Figure S12c).Figure 9b shows the photocatalytic stability of V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25, and the H 2 production by the two samples does not clearly decrease over four cycles, especially for V O -TiO 2 -500.The TON values have also been calculated to evaluate the long-term test stability of catalysts for H 2 production and the results are listed in the Supporting Information (Table S3).It should be noted that the TON of V O -TiO 2 -500 for H 2 evolution is clearly higher than that of P25 TiO 2 , suggesting that the obtained V O defect-rich TiO 2 sample in this work can serve as a practical photocatalyst to improve the photocatalytic H 2 generation activity.As increasing the annealing time, the attenuated photocatalytic H 2 formation rates may be related to the decreased V O concentration (Figure S12d). The gradually increasing emission of CO 2 into the atmosphere caused by burning fossil fuels generates problems of global warming for our society.The reduction of CO 2 with the aid of sunlight-driven photocatalysis technology not only leads to the decreased amount of CO 2 greenhouse gas, relieving global greenhouse effects but also converts CO 2 to value-added fuels, solving the energy problem. 78,79Therefore, we carried out the photoreduction test of CO 2 with H 2 O over the as-obtained catalysts using UV-vis light irradiation in pure water without any sacrificial agents to avoid interference, and the results are described in Figure 10.Clearly, the amounts of CH 4 and CO over all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples are significantly larger than those over the commercial P25 TiO 2 .In particular, V O -TiO 2 -500 exhibits the highest yields of CH 4 and CO with Pt single atoms loading as cocatalyst but without H 2 formation, which is almost 2.2 and 2.3 times higher than that achieved by P25 TiO 2 , respectively (Table S5).The higher selectivity for CH 4 than that of CO over all the catalysts is due to the Pt cocatalyst loading. 12Simultaneously, the AQE for CO 2 conversion has also been obtained.The AQE of the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst (V O -TiO 2 -500) is 0.064, which is almost 18-fold of commercial P25 TiO 2 .Figure 11 shows the cycle measurement results of the P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.During the four cycles, the generation rates of the CH 4 and CO did not show the obvious decrease, displaying a good stability for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and at the same time exhibiting a fascinating application potential for the photoconversion of CO 2 with H 2 O.The TON values of CO 2 photoreduction to generate CO and CH 4 have also been calculated (Table S4), in which the V O -TiO 2 -500 shows the clearly enhanced TON values compared to P25 TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction. CO 2 reduction to produce CH 4 is an eight-electron process, which requires gathering the more photogenerated charge carriers with a long lifetime. 80The Pt atom strongly anchored with the help of the large of oxygen vacancies can promote more electrons to accumulate on the surface of the catalyst, leading to a higher catalytic performance of the catalyst.In the work, without any sacrificial agents being added, CO 2 is the only carbon source.For it, control photocatalytic experiments were conducted under identical conditions but using N 2 as the carrier gas replacing CO 2 , in which no CO or CH 4 product could be detected, indicating that carbides in this experiment did not originate from carbon contamination.In addition, the theoretical calculation and experiment results show that CO 2 can be strongly adsorbed on V O existing on the TiO 2 surface and the activation barrier of CO 2 reduction can be greatly reduced. 81,82At the same time, the generated V O can be viewed as reactive sites to promote the activation of CO 2 to form CO 2 -, which could enhance the product rate of CO and The Journal of Physical Chemistry C CH 4 . 82The photoinduced holes in the VB can be oxidated by the adsorbed hydroxyl species to form O 2 . In a word, based on the abovementioned experimental and DFT calculation results, under the same Pt loading, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 photoreduction performance shown by the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples was undoubtedly related to the synergistic action of the O vacancies and isolated single Pt atom.The existence of surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies strongly anchored single Pt atom onto the surface of the catalyst, and in turn, the loaded single-atomic-site Pt bring about the generation of more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies, as illustrated in Figures 3b,4 and Table S2, by decreasing the formation energy of an O vacancy on the surface and subsurface, according to the DFT calculation.While the existence of more oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 increased the donor density not only promoting the carrier transfer but also making more electrons accumulate in the sink provided by single Pt atom to participate in the photoreaction, thus promoting the photoactivity.The theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the O defects on the surface of TiO 2 favor the adsorption and activation of CO 2 by the strong actions with the O atoms of CO 2 and the effective generation of CO 2 intermediates, leading to the dissociation of CO 2 . 78,79The CO 2 adsorption measurements were therefore carried out under environmental conditions of 298 K at low pressure, as presented in Figure S13.These measurements show that the CO 2 adsorption capacity at 298 K and 1 atm (760 mmHg) over V O -TiO 2 -500 could reach 10.94 cm 3 /g, while that is 7.09 cm 3 /g over P25 TiO 2 .The abovementioned result indicates that the introduced V O defects endow our prepared TiO 2 sample with an enhanced CO 2 adsorption capacity, improving its photocatalytic activity.It is just derived from the synergistic effect of V O and loaded single Pt atom, the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst obtained by us showed the enhanced H 2 product and CO 2 reduction performance."}, {"llm generation": "V O defect-rich TiO 2", "source": "In summary, we developed V O defect-rich TiO 2 as an efficient catalyst toward photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 photoreduction to make a systematical study of the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and Pt using TANs as the TiO 2 source, and thus, oxygen vacancies were generated in-situ by annealing.", "context": "In summary, we developed V O defect-rich TiO 2 as an efficient catalyst toward photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 photoreduction to make a systematical study of the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and Pt using TANs as the TiO 2 source, and thus, oxygen vacancies were generated in-situ by annealing.In comparison to P25 TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies, all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples exhibit excellent abilities for photocatalytic H 2 evolution and CO 2 photoconversion, which is obviously connected to the coeffect of oxygen vacancies and the single atom Pt-supported cocatalyst.The introduced oxygen vacancy defects remarkably suppress the recombination of photoexcited charge carriers, as verified by the photocurrent and impedance measurements.On the basis of DFT calculation, the deposit single Pt atom used as cocatalysts lead to the generation of more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancy defects, which are responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance by strongly decreasing the formation energy of O vacancies.In turn, the introduced more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies can furtherly improve the adsorption of single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst by an anchoring effect of the surface V O for the loaded Pt atoms.Additionally, the existing V O defects facilitate the adsorption of CO 2 , contributing to the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO production.This work can open an avenue for studying the synergistic effect of defects and loaded metal single atom and the rational construction of novel and highly efficient photocatalysts.

An ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with an Al K (h 1486.6eV) achromatic X-ray source was used to achieve X-ray photoelectron spectra of catalysts.Using BaSO 4 as the reference, the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of the as-fabricated catalysts were collected within range of 200--800 nm by a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV/vis spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere accessory.To research the separation efficiency of the photoinduced charge carriers, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-obtained photocatalysts were recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer (TU-1900, Beijing PuXi, China) under 380 nm excitation wavelength.By means of N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, the specific surface area (BET) values of the samples were obtained on a Quadrasorb SI-4 instrument.Elemental analysis of Pt in the catalysts were detected by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) by means of Optima 2100 DV.High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image was recorded by a JEM ARM-200F high resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV.CO 2 gas adsorption tests were performed under the environmental condition of 298 K at 1 atm pressure (ASAP 2020M C), and the pressure can be changed gradually with the gas flow rate.On a spectrometer (Bruker E500), ESR spectra of the catalysts were achieved under room temperature condition and in the air atmosphere to verify the existence of the oxygen vacancies. At room temperature, with the help of a coincidence spectrometer, PALS measurements were carried by an ORTEC-583 fast-fast coincident system having a 270 ps prompt time resolution full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the -ray resulting from a 60 Co source under experimental conditions.Before measurement, the powder-like catalysts needed to be pressed into a disk of 10.0 mm 1.0 mm.A 30 Ci positron source of 22 Na was used and put between the two same sample disks.The positron lifespan spectrum with 10 6 counts was split into several lifetime constituents via the PATFIT program. 2.4.Photoelectrochemical Performance Measurements.The electrochemical tests of the catalysts were performed on a electrochemical workstation (CHI660, Shanghai Chenhua, China) using a conventional threeelectrode system, where the as-deposited samples on the ITO substrate coated with the catalyst were served as the working electrode, a platinum wire and a standard calomel electrode separately acted as the counter electrode and the compared electrode, respectively.The electrolyte solution was Na 2 SO 3 (0.1 M), where it needed to be purged with high purity nitrogen at lowest 20 min before performing the electrochemical tests to eliminate oxygen. 2.5.Evaluation of the Photocatalytic H 2 Evolution and CO 2 Photoconversion Activity.The photocatalytic hydrogen production activity was assessed via an online photocatalytic evaluation system (Labsolar-6A, Perfectlight, China).A xenon lamp of 300 W (PLS-SXE300, Perfectlight, China) with a light intensity of 46 mW/cm 2 and an irradiation area of 19.625 cm 2 acted as the light source to initiate the photocatalytic reaction, and the illumination radiation distance was approximately 10 cm from the liquid level.In brief, 100 mg of freshly prepared Pt loaded catalyst powder was dispersed in a mixed liquor composed of 80 mL of deionized water and 20 mL of methanol used as the scavenger of h before the photocatalytic reaction.Similarly, for the CO 2 photoreduction, 0.1 g of the catalyst powder was dispersed into a reactor containing 100 mL of high-purity water without the use of a sacrificial agent.The high-pure CO 2 gas was bubbled through the solution at 80 kPa with continuous stirring three times to drive away the excess gas, and the final preservation of the 80 kPa CO 2 was used as a test.For H 2 evolution and CO 2 reduction, the photocatalytic reaction was typically performed by irradiating with UV-vis light for 5 h, and the gaseous product was analyzed at given time intervals (1 h) by gas chromatography (FULI 979011) equipped, respectively, with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector with high-purity N 2 as the carrier gas.The amount of the obtained products was determined according to the standard curves. 2.6.Computational Details.Using the generalized gradient approximation method, we carried out DFT calculations based on the Vienna Ab initio Simulation package code. 4849950 We used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional to deal with the exchange-correlation part of the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation. 51Core electrons was treated by the projector augmented wave pseudopotentials. 52The smooth parts of the wave functions are extended in plane waves with a kinetic energy cutoff of 480 eV.In addition, dipole corrections were applied to account for the coactions between the asymmetric slabs. 53,54he model of the (3 2) supercell of the stoichiometric anatase TiO 2 (101) surface consisting of five TiO 2 layers and 180 atoms was created by the optimized unit cell.Each The Journal of Physical Chemistry C supercell has a vacuum layer of 15 A to separate the slabs.During structural relaxation, for all the supercells, the bottom TiO 2 layer was frozen in its bulk positions to simulate a bulklike layer, while the top four layers were allowed to relax along with the surface Pt single atom.For all the relaxation calculations, only G-centered k-point mesh is adopted, which is proved to provide sufficient accuracy for this large supercell system 55 while for the computation of the density of states and other ground state properties, a denser k mesh sampling by 3 3 1 grids was used at the fully relaxed geometry.The energy convergence criterion for the geometry optimization was 10 -4 eV/A.The energy of the Pt single atom and an O 2 molecule were calculated by putting the Pt 1 or molecule inside a 1011 12 A 3 cubic box and by using (6 6 6) k-point sampling. To determine the binding strength between the single Pt atom and A-TiO 2 (101) surface, the adsorption energies can be determined as follows where E Pt 1 /TiO 2 , E TiO 2 , and E Pt 1 are the total energies of the Pt 1 / A-TiO 2 (101), A-TiO 2 (101), and Pt 1 single atom, respectively.The more negative the E(ads) is, the more stable the system should be; therefore, negative E(ads) indicates that the adsorption of single metal on the TiO 2 surface is thermodynamically favorable.The generation energy of an oxygen vacancy defect is defined as follows where E surf V O , E surf , and E O 2 are the total energy of the surface with a V O defect, without a V O defect, and for an O 2 molecule in a vacuum."}, {"llm generation": "single atom Pt-supported cocatalyst", "source": "In comparison to P25 TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies, all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples exhibit excellent abilities for photocatalytic H 2 evolution and CO 2 photoconversion, which is obviously connected to the coeffect of oxygen vacancies and the single atom Pt-supported cocatalyst.", "context": "In summary, we developed V O defect-rich TiO 2 as an efficient catalyst toward photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 photoreduction to make a systematical study of the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and Pt using TANs as the TiO 2 source, and thus, oxygen vacancies were generated in-situ by annealing.In comparison to P25 TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies, all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples exhibit excellent abilities for photocatalytic H 2 evolution and CO 2 photoconversion, which is obviously connected to the coeffect of oxygen vacancies and the single atom Pt-supported cocatalyst.The introduced oxygen vacancy defects remarkably suppress the recombination of photoexcited charge carriers, as verified by the photocurrent and impedance measurements.On the basis of DFT calculation, the deposit single Pt atom used as cocatalysts lead to the generation of more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancy defects, which are responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance by strongly decreasing the formation energy of O vacancies.In turn, the introduced more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies can furtherly improve the adsorption of single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst by an anchoring effect of the surface V O for the loaded Pt atoms.Additionally, the existing V O defects facilitate the adsorption of CO 2 , contributing to the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO production.This work can open an avenue for studying the synergistic effect of defects and loaded metal single atom and the rational construction of novel and highly efficient photocatalysts.

Figure 8.Most stable adsorption configuration of a single Pt atom on TiO 2 with (a) clean surface and (b) surface oxygen vacancies. photocatalytic activity, we studied the charge distribution of the Pt/TiO 2 system.Based on our Bader charge analysis, when Pt 1 react with V O 1, it obtains 0.94 e, indicating charge transfers from the substrate to Pt atom.As a comparison, when Pt reacts with a clean surface or surface with inner V O s, it will lose charge, indicating charge will migrate from the Pt atom to substate.This point can also be supported by our charge density difference analysis (FigureS11).Hence, it is reasonable that for the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with surface V O s, such defect provides more electrons and thus increases the carrier concentration.These electrons may transfer quickly to the loaded single Pt atom, the photocatalytic active site, and participate in the photocatalytic reactions on the surface and, consequently, improve photocatalytic efficiency.3.3.Photocatalytic H 2 Production and CO 2 Photoreduction.The photocatalytic performance of all the asobtained catalysts in this work were assessed by determining the photocatalytic hydrogen production and photoreduction CO 2 abilities of the samples in water with UV-vis light (H 2 evolution was performed with MeOH as the hole sacrificial agent and CO 2 reduction was carried out in pure water without the addition of any sacrificial reagent).The obtained results are separately summarized in Figures9 and 10.With the same Pt loading, all the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples show remarkably Figure 9.

Adsorption Energy of a Pt Single Atom on TiO 2 with a Clean Surface and Oxygen Vacancies, and the Formation Energy of Oxygen Vacancies with/without Pt Single Atom Loading, in Which V O 1 and V O 2 Separately Represent the Surface and Subsurface Oxygen Vacancies, While V O 3 and V O 4 can Represent the Bulk Oxygen VacanciesThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C was clearly enhanced, especially on the surface of TiO 2 with surface/subsurface V O s, and the adsorption energies are -4.27 and -3.42 eV lower than those on the clean surface, which are separately 1.38 and 0.53 eV (herein, negative values represent releasing of heat, and the more negative the values are, the stronger the adsorption of single Pt atom is).Without a clear increase in the adsorption energy, when an interior V O exists on the Pt 1 /TiO 2 (101) surface.These results suggested that the presence of surface and subsurface oxygen vacancy defects strongly improved the adsorption of single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst, implying a stronger coaction between the supported Pt atoms and catalyst substrate.Note that when the Pt 1 reacts with V O 1, namely, surface V O s, Pt atom enters into the vacancy, bonding with O 2c and O 3c , thus enhancing the adsorption energy (Table https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c04931J.

An ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with an Al K (h 1486.6eV) achromatic X-ray source was used to achieve X-ray photoelectron spectra of catalysts.Using BaSO 4 as the reference, the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of the as-fabricated catalysts were collected within range of 200--800 nm by a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV/vis spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere accessory.To research the separation efficiency of the photoinduced charge carriers, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-obtained photocatalysts were recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer (TU-1900, Beijing PuXi, China) under 380 nm excitation wavelength.By means of N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, the specific surface area (BET) values of the samples were obtained on a Quadrasorb SI-4 instrument.Elemental analysis of Pt in the catalysts were detected by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) by means of Optima 2100 DV.High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image was recorded by a JEM ARM-200F high resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV.CO 2 gas adsorption tests were performed under the environmental condition of 298 K at 1 atm pressure (ASAP 2020M C), and the pressure can be changed gradually with the gas flow rate.On a spectrometer (Bruker E500), ESR spectra of the catalysts were achieved under room temperature condition and in the air atmosphere to verify the existence of the oxygen vacancies. At room temperature, with the help of a coincidence spectrometer, PALS measurements were carried by an ORTEC-583 fast-fast coincident system having a 270 ps prompt time resolution full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the -ray resulting from a 60 Co source under experimental conditions.Before measurement, the powder-like catalysts needed to be pressed into a disk of 10.0 mm 1.0 mm.A 30 Ci positron source of 22 Na was used and put between the two same sample disks.The positron lifespan spectrum with 10 6 counts was split into several lifetime constituents via the PATFIT program. 2.4.Photoelectrochemical Performance Measurements.The electrochemical tests of the catalysts were performed on a electrochemical workstation (CHI660, Shanghai Chenhua, China) using a conventional threeelectrode system, where the as-deposited samples on the ITO substrate coated with the catalyst were served as the working electrode, a platinum wire and a standard calomel electrode separately acted as the counter electrode and the compared electrode, respectively.The electrolyte solution was Na 2 SO 3 (0.1 M), where it needed to be purged with high purity nitrogen at lowest 20 min before performing the electrochemical tests to eliminate oxygen. 2.5.Evaluation of the Photocatalytic H 2 Evolution and CO 2 Photoconversion Activity.The photocatalytic hydrogen production activity was assessed via an online photocatalytic evaluation system (Labsolar-6A, Perfectlight, China).A xenon lamp of 300 W (PLS-SXE300, Perfectlight, China) with a light intensity of 46 mW/cm 2 and an irradiation area of 19.625 cm 2 acted as the light source to initiate the photocatalytic reaction, and the illumination radiation distance was approximately 10 cm from the liquid level.In brief, 100 mg of freshly prepared Pt loaded catalyst powder was dispersed in a mixed liquor composed of 80 mL of deionized water and 20 mL of methanol used as the scavenger of h before the photocatalytic reaction.Similarly, for the CO 2 photoreduction, 0.1 g of the catalyst powder was dispersed into a reactor containing 100 mL of high-purity water without the use of a sacrificial agent.The high-pure CO 2 gas was bubbled through the solution at 80 kPa with continuous stirring three times to drive away the excess gas, and the final preservation of the 80 kPa CO 2 was used as a test.For H 2 evolution and CO 2 reduction, the photocatalytic reaction was typically performed by irradiating with UV-vis light for 5 h, and the gaseous product was analyzed at given time intervals (1 h) by gas chromatography (FULI 979011) equipped, respectively, with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector with high-purity N 2 as the carrier gas.The amount of the obtained products was determined according to the standard curves. 2.6.Computational Details.Using the generalized gradient approximation method, we carried out DFT calculations based on the Vienna Ab initio Simulation package code. 4849950 We used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional to deal with the exchange-correlation part of the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation. 51Core electrons was treated by the projector augmented wave pseudopotentials. 52The smooth parts of the wave functions are extended in plane waves with a kinetic energy cutoff of 480 eV.In addition, dipole corrections were applied to account for the coactions between the asymmetric slabs. 53,54he model of the (3 2) supercell of the stoichiometric anatase TiO 2 (101) surface consisting of five TiO 2 layers and 180 atoms was created by the optimized unit cell.Each The Journal of Physical Chemistry C supercell has a vacuum layer of 15 A to separate the slabs.During structural relaxation, for all the supercells, the bottom TiO 2 layer was frozen in its bulk positions to simulate a bulklike layer, while the top four layers were allowed to relax along with the surface Pt single atom.For all the relaxation calculations, only G-centered k-point mesh is adopted, which is proved to provide sufficient accuracy for this large supercell system 55 while for the computation of the density of states and other ground state properties, a denser k mesh sampling by 3 3 1 grids was used at the fully relaxed geometry.The energy convergence criterion for the geometry optimization was 10 -4 eV/A.The energy of the Pt single atom and an O 2 molecule were calculated by putting the Pt 1 or molecule inside a 1011 12 A 3 cubic box and by using (6 6 6) k-point sampling. To determine the binding strength between the single Pt atom and A-TiO 2 (101) surface, the adsorption energies can be determined as follows where E Pt 1 /TiO 2 , E TiO 2 , and E Pt 1 are the total energies of the Pt 1 / A-TiO 2 (101), A-TiO 2 (101), and Pt 1 single atom, respectively.The more negative the E(ads) is, the more stable the system should be; therefore, negative E(ads) indicates that the adsorption of single metal on the TiO 2 surface is thermodynamically favorable.The generation energy of an oxygen vacancy defect is defined as follows where E surf V O , E surf , and E O 2 are the total energy of the surface with a V O defect, without a V O defect, and for an O 2 molecule in a vacuum."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "To get the effect of the isolated single Pt atom, the UV-vis absorption spectra of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25-TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies were obtained.", "context": "3.1.Characterization and Analysis.As displayed in Figure 1a, the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different calcination temperatures exhibited narrow and intense XRD peaks of 2 25.3, 37.8, and 48.0, which corresponds to the (101), (004), and (200) crystallographic planes of the anatase TiO 2 structure, respectively. 56With the increased annealing temperature, the corresponding diffraction peak became sharper, implying a more perfect lattice structure.The rutile phase can be observed in the sample prepared at 700 C, similar to the XRD pattern of pristine P25 TiO 2 , maybe suggesting a reduced photoactivity of the final catalyst.The influence of the heat treatment duration on the V O -rich-TiO 2 phase structures is also described in Figure S1.Although the diffraction peaks were slightly increased, a nearly negligible difference was found when the calcining time was set to 1-12 h, meaning that the calcining time had little effect on the catalyst phase structures.To assess the effect of the loaded Pt metal, we performed an XRD measurement of the 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).After Pt loading, the intensity of the diffraction peak corresponding to anatase TiO 2 was weakened drastically compared with the peak of the sample before Pt loading, indicating the decreased crystallinity of the catalyst, which may derive from the formation of more surface area oxygen vacancies that cause residual stress. 57It can be also reflected from the enlarge view of 15-35that a slightly broadening on the FWHM may be induced by the residual stress deriving from the newly generated oxygen defects and the reduced crystalline size (Figure S2).Analogical phenomena have been observed in Bi-based compounds, 58,59 ZnO and CeO 2 . 60,61This finding was consistent with ESR and DFT calculation results revealing that single Pt atom can promote the formation of the more surface oxygen vacancies (see below).Contrastingly, the intensity of the XRD peaks of the Pt-loaded P25 TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies only show slight decrement than that of P25 (Figure S3).The phase structure of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different temperatures was further studied by Raman spectra because of their strong scattering properties.In Figure 1c, the four typical characterized Raman bands at wavenumbers of 144, 397, 515, and 639 cm -1 are indexed obviously as the symmetric E g , B 1g , A 1g , and E g Raman-active modes of the anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 62The increased annealing temperature leads to the gradually decreased half peak width of the strongest peak located at 144 cm -1 , which reflects the vibration of O-Ti-O, suggesting a more perfect crystallization of the catalyst.For V O -TiO 2 -700, the weak peak located at 446 cm -1 showed the emergence of the rutile phase, similar to the peak observed in the P25 TiO 2 spectrum (445 cm -1 ).Likewise, the intensity of The Journal of Physical Chemistry C D the Raman peak of V O -TiO 2 -500 clearly decreased after the single Pt atom loading (Figure 1d), while the intensity of the Raman peak obtained for Pt-P25 TiO 2 slightly decreased (Figure S4), corresponding to the XRD results.These findings may hint a presence of an interaction between V O and the supported single Pt atom. The morphology and structure of the TAN precursor and V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 used as a representative sample were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and TEM.The TAN precursor of O-defect-rich TiO 2 has a layered structure (Figure 2a) with a distance of approximately 0.8 nm between the adjacent layers. 63After annealing at 500 C, V O -TiO 2 -500 shows irregular particles (Figure 2b) with clear (101) anatase phase titania crystallographic planes having d s 0.33 nm, indicating the formation of anatase phase titania, as confirmed by XRD (Figure 2c).When the photo-deposition method was used to decorate Pt nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO 2 , the same lattice fringes with d s 0.33 nm could be observed, indicating that the loading of Pt has no impact on the crystal structure of TiO 2 (Figure 2d).But a vague border in the V O -TiO 2 -500 sample can be found when loading Pt, which may also hint the presence of an interaction between Pt and V O .Meanwhile, no difference on the morphology was observed for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 before and after single Pt atom loading (Figures 2b andS5).It should be noted that no corresponding signals related to crystalline Pt species are detected in the XRD patterns of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).Not only that, the presence of Pt nanoparticles was not observed obviously, too (Figures 2d andS5), suggesting a high dispersion of Pt species.The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings show the uniform distribution of Pt, Ti, and O elements (Figure 2f).The Pt loading content determined by ICP-OES was about 0.36.In view of this, HAADF-STEM was carried out, where the dispersion of Pt species at the atomic scale was observed clearly as several isolated bright dots signed by red circles, indicating the existence of atomically dispersed Pt (Figures 2e andS6).From Table S1, after calcining the TANs, a clear decrease in the specific surface areas was detected from 390.6 m 2 g -1 for the TANs to 297.7, 174.2, and 128.0 m 2 g -1 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively, which is attributed to the change in the morphology from TANs to irregular nanoparticles after annealing.The increased calcination temperature leads to the decreased catalytic specific surface area because the high temperature makes the grains grow and even sinter, resulting in the serious collapse of small channels or the blockage of channels. To study the defect structure of TiO 2 , ESR spectra were collected.All the catalysts except for P25 TiO 2 (Figure S7a) exhibit a strong ESR signal at g 2.0 (Figures 3a andS7), indicating the existence of oxygen vacancies in their structure. 33,64,65Upon increasing the heat-treatment temperature, the ESR signal of 2.0 becomes much stronger, showing that more O vacancy defects are formed in the catalysts structures (Figure S7b).Conversely, prolonging the heattreatment time seems to be detrimental to the generation of more oxygen vacancies, and the annealing time of 2 h is applicable (Figure S7c).Fascinatingly, the obvious increase in the ESR signal intensity is found for Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b), indicating a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, which may be related to the inducing effect of single Pt atom, promoting more oxygen vacancy defects to form on the surface/subsurface, corresponding to DFT calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). To give further evidence of the increased oxygen vacancy defects, PALS measurements of before and after single Pt atom supporting for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 were conducted to test the lifetime of the positron.As shown in Figure 4, 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 gave longer average positron lifetime than its counterpart, which results from the positron trapped by O vacancy defects.The positron lifespan spectra of V O rich-TiO 2 sample gave two lifetime constituents, 1 and 2 , accompanied by corresponding relative intensities, I 1 and I 2 (Table S2).The shorter constituent ( 1 ) is usually ascribed to the free annihilation of positrons in a defect-free crystal, called as the The Journal of Physical Chemistry C first lifespan of positrons. 66In an unordered system, little vacancies or shallow positron trap from oxygen vacancies may result in the decreased electron density of the surrounding to increase the lifetime of 1 . 67Compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 1 0.202 ns), the prolonged 1 (0.208 ns) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 shows that large numbers of oxygen vacancy defects were incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice by Pt atoms loading.Accordingly, the relative intensity (I 1 ) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 also increased sharply from 10.63 in V O -TiO 2 -500 to 15.35 in 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500. 68The longer lifetime component 2 was ascribed to the positron annihilation captured by O vacancies, 66 hinting that the longer value of 2 (0.387 ns) for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 revealed the increase of oxygen vacancies concentration compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 2 0.365 ns).It is worth noting that the increase of 2 was 86.1 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while it is 44.7 for V O -TiO 2 -500 compared with 1 , which means the generation of a huge number of boundarylike defects after Pt atoms loading 68 clearly related to the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies corresponding to theoretical calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). The surface chemical states and constituent elements of V O -TiO 2 -T (T 400, 500, 600 C) and 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 were analyzed by means of XPS technology and the results are described in Figure 5 to further expound the interaction between the oxygen vacancies and single Pt atom.The survey spectra presented in Figure 5a show that the Ti, O, and C elements from reference exist for all the samples.No signal corresponding to the Pt element is detected in the survey spectrum of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 because of the lower practical Pt loading.In the Ti 2p spectra (Figure 5b), compared to V O -TiO 2 -400 (Ti 2p 3/2 : 458.53 eV), the Ti 2p 3/2 peaks of V O -TiO 2 -500 (458.06 eV) and V O -TiO 2 -600 (458.14 eV) shift obviously to lower binding energies, which is closely connected to the generation of the more oxygen vacancy defects in the two samples, inducing a changed chemical environment of the titanium ions, as shown by the ESR results.Surprisingly, the distinct decrease and larger shift to a high binding energy were found for the 1 Pt-loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample.The similar changes were observed in O 1 s spectra of the 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample (Figure 5c).The peaks at 531.30 and 529.80 eV can be, respectively, indexed to the oxygen atoms in the neighborhood of oxygen vacancies and O bond of Ti-O-Ti. 21After loading single Pt atom, the O 1s peaks shift to high binding energies, accompanied by a sharp decrease in the peak intensity.This finding could be explained as follows: (i) the decreasing intensity of the Ti 2p peak and O 1s peak for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 is due to the Pt loading, which impairs the detection sensitivity of the instrument for Ti and O; (ii) the shifting of the binding energy values may be related to the strong single Pt atom-TiO 2 substrate interaction, which would anchor strongly single Pt atom on the TiO 2 surface to accumulate more electrons for the photocatalytic reaction because of the strong stabilizing ability resulting from vacancies.Nevertheless, except for the aforementioned change, careful study shows that the peak corresponding to the O atoms around the oxygen vacancy defects becomes more intense upon single Pt atom loading, and the integral-area ratios of the peak at 532.60 eV (O 1s peak for the oxygen vacancies) to the peak at 530.20 eV (O 1s peak for the lattice oxygen) were determined to be 0.35 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while this is 0.095, 0.081, and 0.092 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively (Figure S8).This obviously suggested the increased content of oxygen vacancies The Journal of Physical Chemistry C F due to the interaction of the atomically dispersed Pt and oxygen vacancies promoting to generate more oxygen vacancy defects on the surface/subsurface of the catalyst by strongly decreasing the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, corresponding to ESR, PALS, and the theoretical calculation results (see the Theoretical Calculation section). 37In Figure 5d, the typical XPS spectra of Pt 4f centered at 70.26 and 73.90 eV showed the Pt metallic state.Moreover, the two peaks located at 72.60 and 75.60 eV indicates of the presence of platinum oxide. 69igure 6a gives the absorbance versus wavelength plots of the P25, TAN, and V O -rich-TiO 2 -based samples.Compared to the TAN precursor material, the absorption of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples shifts to longer wavelength, obviously because of the influence of the oxygen vacancy formation.Nevertheless, the difference between the absorptions of the different V O -rich-TiO 2 samples with different oxygen vacancy concentrations is negligible and similar to that of P25, which indicates that no obvious visible light absorption is generated by the introduced oxygen vacancies in the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples, as reported by the literature. 21Additionally, the same conclusion could also be drawn based on the absorptions of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples prepared with the different heat-treatment times (Figure S9).To get the effect of the isolated single Pt atom, the UV-vis absorption spectra of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25-TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies were obtained.Surprisingly, after Pt atom loading, significant visible-light-driven absorption is found for the Pt-loaded V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which is associated with the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies (Figure 6b). 37,38Nevertheless, almost no change is observed for the absorption of Pt-deposited P25 in comparison with that of the pristine P25 (the inset of Figure 6b).These findings show again that a strong interaction existed between single Pt atom and oxygen vacancy defects for the Pt atom-decorated V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which corresponds to To study the dynamics of electron transfer on the interface of the catalysts, the transient I-t curves were measured with light-on and light-off cycles.As displayed in Figure 7a, the introduced oxygen vacancy defects brought about higher photocurrent values for all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, especially V O -TiO 2 -500 with a maximum photocurrent of 0.45 mA, which is almost 2.7 and 16 times as high as that of the P25 and TAN samples.This could occur because the formed oxygen vacancy defects captured electrons and thus suppressed the recombination of photoinduced charges. 70Figure 7b displays Nyquist curves with arc-like distribution patterns and the corresponding equivalent circuit.The smaller arc radius at a low frequency is usually connected to the charge migration at the interface of the semiconductor and in the electrolyte of the tested electrode. 71According to the radius of the Nyquist plots, the V O -rich TiO 2 samples exhibit a smaller charge transfer resistance (R3) compared with the TAN precursor, as shown by the I-t results.Among the samples, V O -TiO 2 -500 demonstrates the smallest charge transfer resistance than the other two V O -TiO 2 samples and P25 TiO 2 , meaning that the charge transportation at the interface is faster for V O -TiO 2 -500.Figure 7c presents the PL emission spectra of the as-obtained V O -rich TiO 2 samples using P25 and TAN as references at an excited wavelength of 400 nm to prove the improved separation efficiency of the e --h pairs upon introducing oxygen vacancies.The decay of the PL signals for all the V Orich TiO 2 catalysts is sharp in comparison with that of the P25 and TAN reference samples, indicating that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies significantly inhibited the annihilation of the photoinduced electrons and holes. 72The V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample shows the weakest PL emission, demonstrating the best carrier separation efficiency, which means that a more robust photocatalytic process can occur over it.However, introducing excess oxygen vacancies leads to an enhanced PL emission (such as V O -TiO 2 -600) because the excess O defects can be viewed as the recombination centers of the e --h pairs, which impacts the photoreactivity of the sample.Generally, the carrier density could affect the dynamic performance and photocatalytic activity of the catalysts.Therefore, the Mott-Schottky tests of P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 were performed to determine the different donor densities of the two photocatalysts, as described in Figure 7d.The two samples show typical characteristics of an n-type semiconductor with a positive slope.The donor density can be reflected by the magnitude of the slope, and the slope reduces with the increased donor density. 73In comparison with P25 TiO 2 , the much smaller slope of V O -TiO 2 -500 indicated a higher donor density originating from the contribution of oxygen vacancies formed by annealing the TANs, which would significantly promote the carrier transfer and photocatalytic activity. 3.2.Theoretical Calculations.The aforementioned experimental characterization results showed that a strong synergistic effect existed between the oxygen vacancies and loaded single Pt atom.To better understand such a mechanism, we studied the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with and without V O defects in the framework of the KS DFT.Therein, configurations where that V O s exist on the surface, subsurface, and inner layers are considered (Figure S10).When a Pt atom adsorbs on a clean A-TiO 2 (101) surface, O 2c -O 3c -O 2c site is the most favorable site (Figure 8a), as proved by many reports, 747576 so we adopt this model directly (Figure 8b).The calculated adsorption energy of the single Pt atom on the clean surface is -2.89 eV (Table 1).Meanwhile, on the A-TiO 2 (101) surface with different oxygen vacancy concentrations, the adsorption energy of the single Pt atom 1).In other words, a surface V O has an anchoring effect on the loaded Pt 1 , which is consistent with the previous study that surface defects can strongly affect the stability of single atom-catalyst. 76,77ven more fascinating is that the formation energy of the V O s obviously decreases upon loading with Pt, especially for surface and subsurface V O s.In the absence of Pt loading, the formation energies of the surface and subsurface O vacancies are 3.31 and 4.00 eV, respectively, and they decreased to1.92 and 3.46 eV after loading the single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst (Table 1).Nevertheless, the deposited of the Pt atom seems to have no clear effect on the formation energies of the interior oxygen vacancies.These results indicated that, based on the formation energies, the loaded single Pt atom more strongly favors the formation of surface/subsurface oxygen vacancies than the V O s in the bulk as proved by the increased ESR signal over 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b) and PALS (Figure 4). Generally, the formation of V O s generates extra electrons in TiO 2 nanomaterials, increasing the electron concentration, which favors the improved photocatalytic efficiency.However, note that the bulk and surface/subsurface V O s have different influences on the photoreactivity.In stark contrast to bulk V O s generally served as the charge carrier recombination centers, surface/subsurface V O s have proven to be helpful for the efficient separation of the photoinduced electron and hole pairs.The surface/subsurface V O s give rise to more donor electrons localized on the surface region, facilitating the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and thereby improving the photoactivity of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples. 26ccording to our experimental result, the sample that single Pt atom with more V O s showed higher activity.To further determine how surface vacancy interplay with Pt 1 and improve photocatalytic activity, we studied the charge distribution of the Pt/TiO 2 system.Based on our Bader charge analysis, when Pt 1 react with V O 1, it obtains 0.94 e, indicating charge transfers from the substrate to Pt atom.As a comparison, when Pt reacts with a clean surface or surface with inner V O s, it will lose charge, indicating charge will migrate from the Pt atom to substate.This point can also be supported by our charge density difference analysis (Figure S11).Hence, it is reasonable that for the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with surface V O s, such defect provides more electrons and thus increases the carrier concentration.These electrons may transfer quickly to the loaded single Pt atom, the photocatalytic active site, and participate in the photocatalytic reactions on the surface and, consequently, improve photocatalytic efficiency.The Journal of Physical Chemistry C pubs.acs.org/JPCCenhanced hydrogen production rates (667, 1077, and 651 mol h -1 , respectively, for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600) compared to the P25 (344 mol h -1 ) and TAN (239 mol h -1 ) samples without oxygen vacancies.The best H 2 -production rate of 1077 mol h -1 was obtained by V O -TiO 2 -500, which is approximately three times that of P25 (Figure 9a).It is unquestionably related to the contribution of the introduced oxygen vacancies, whose existence remarkably increases the donor density in the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, thereby promoting carrier transfer to the surface and causing more electrons to participate in the photocatalysis reaction under the same irradiation.The higher concentration of V O defects does not seem to be good for H 2 evolution because excess oxygen vacancies become recombination centers of e -h pairs, impairing the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. 72dditionally, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) was also measured and calculated according to similar photocatalytic reaction conditions by using a 365 nm UV light bandpass filter (see the Supporting Information).Specifically, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample (21.7) was 3.14 times as high as that of P25 TiO 2 (6.9), implying that the oxygen vacancy defect-rich sample shows a better photocatalytic performance.To perform a systematic study, the effect of the pH, Pt deposition amount, and sacrificial agents on the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance was also studied.The maximal H 2 evolution rate was obtained at a pH 4.7 0.3 (Figure S12a).The excess deposition of Pt leads to the gradual deterioration of the hydrogen production rate, which may be due to more active surface sites covered by the Pt (Figure S12b). 22Using methyl alcohol as the electron donor, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 evolution from water was shown by the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples (Figure S12c).Figure 9b shows the photocatalytic stability of V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25, and the H 2 production by the two samples does not clearly decrease over four cycles, especially for V O -TiO 2 -500.The TON values have also been calculated to evaluate the long-term test stability of catalysts for H 2 production and the results are listed in the Supporting Information (Table S3).It should be noted that the TON of V O -TiO 2 -500 for H 2 evolution is clearly higher than that of P25 TiO 2 , suggesting that the obtained V O defect-rich TiO 2 sample in this work can serve as a practical photocatalyst to improve the photocatalytic H 2 generation activity.As increasing the annealing time, the attenuated photocatalytic H 2 formation rates may be related to the decreased V O concentration (Figure S12d). The gradually increasing emission of CO 2 into the atmosphere caused by burning fossil fuels generates problems of global warming for our society.The reduction of CO 2 with the aid of sunlight-driven photocatalysis technology not only leads to the decreased amount of CO 2 greenhouse gas, relieving global greenhouse effects but also converts CO 2 to value-added fuels, solving the energy problem. 78,79Therefore, we carried out the photoreduction test of CO 2 with H 2 O over the as-obtained catalysts using UV-vis light irradiation in pure water without any sacrificial agents to avoid interference, and the results are described in Figure 10.Clearly, the amounts of CH 4 and CO over all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples are significantly larger than those over the commercial P25 TiO 2 .In particular, V O -TiO 2 -500 exhibits the highest yields of CH 4 and CO with Pt single atoms loading as cocatalyst but without H 2 formation, which is almost 2.2 and 2.3 times higher than that achieved by P25 TiO 2 , respectively (Table S5).The higher selectivity for CH 4 than that of CO over all the catalysts is due to the Pt cocatalyst loading. 12Simultaneously, the AQE for CO 2 conversion has also been obtained.The AQE of the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst (V O -TiO 2 -500) is 0.064, which is almost 18-fold of commercial P25 TiO 2 .Figure 11 shows the cycle measurement results of the P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.During the four cycles, the generation rates of the CH 4 and CO did not show the obvious decrease, displaying a good stability for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and at the same time exhibiting a fascinating application potential for the photoconversion of CO 2 with H 2 O.The TON values of CO 2 photoreduction to generate CO and CH 4 have also been calculated (Table S4), in which the V O -TiO 2 -500 shows the clearly enhanced TON values compared to P25 TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction. CO 2 reduction to produce CH 4 is an eight-electron process, which requires gathering the more photogenerated charge carriers with a long lifetime. 80The Pt atom strongly anchored with the help of the large of oxygen vacancies can promote more electrons to accumulate on the surface of the catalyst, leading to a higher catalytic performance of the catalyst.In the work, without any sacrificial agents being added, CO 2 is the only carbon source.For it, control photocatalytic experiments were conducted under identical conditions but using N 2 as the carrier gas replacing CO 2 , in which no CO or CH 4 product could be detected, indicating that carbides in this experiment did not originate from carbon contamination.In addition, the theoretical calculation and experiment results show that CO 2 can be strongly adsorbed on V O existing on the TiO 2 surface and the activation barrier of CO 2 reduction can be greatly reduced. 81,82At the same time, the generated V O can be viewed as reactive sites to promote the activation of CO 2 to form CO 2 -, which could enhance the product rate of CO and The Journal of Physical Chemistry C CH 4 . 82The photoinduced holes in the VB can be oxidated by the adsorbed hydroxyl species to form O 2 . In a word, based on the abovementioned experimental and DFT calculation results, under the same Pt loading, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 photoreduction performance shown by the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples was undoubtedly related to the synergistic action of the O vacancies and isolated single Pt atom.The existence of surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies strongly anchored single Pt atom onto the surface of the catalyst, and in turn, the loaded single-atomic-site Pt bring about the generation of more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies, as illustrated in Figures 3b,4 and Table S2, by decreasing the formation energy of an O vacancy on the surface and subsurface, according to the DFT calculation.While the existence of more oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 increased the donor density not only promoting the carrier transfer but also making more electrons accumulate in the sink provided by single Pt atom to participate in the photoreaction, thus promoting the photoactivity.The theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the O defects on the surface of TiO 2 favor the adsorption and activation of CO 2 by the strong actions with the O atoms of CO 2 and the effective generation of CO 2 intermediates, leading to the dissociation of CO 2 . 78,79The CO 2 adsorption measurements were therefore carried out under environmental conditions of 298 K at low pressure, as presented in Figure S13.These measurements show that the CO 2 adsorption capacity at 298 K and 1 atm (760 mmHg) over V O -TiO 2 -500 could reach 10.94 cm 3 /g, while that is 7.09 cm 3 /g over P25 TiO 2 .The abovementioned result indicates that the introduced V O defects endow our prepared TiO 2 sample with an enhanced CO 2 adsorption capacity, improving its photocatalytic activity.It is just derived from the synergistic effect of V O and loaded single Pt atom, the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst obtained by us showed the enhanced H 2 product and CO 2 reduction performance."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "Therefore, we carried out the photoreduction test of CO 2 with H 2 O over the as-obtained catalysts using UV-vis light irradiation in pure water without any sacrificial agents to avoid interference, and the results are described in Figure 10.", "context": "3.1.Characterization and Analysis.As displayed in Figure 1a, the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different calcination temperatures exhibited narrow and intense XRD peaks of 2 25.3, 37.8, and 48.0, which corresponds to the (101), (004), and (200) crystallographic planes of the anatase TiO 2 structure, respectively. 56With the increased annealing temperature, the corresponding diffraction peak became sharper, implying a more perfect lattice structure.The rutile phase can be observed in the sample prepared at 700 C, similar to the XRD pattern of pristine P25 TiO 2 , maybe suggesting a reduced photoactivity of the final catalyst.The influence of the heat treatment duration on the V O -rich-TiO 2 phase structures is also described in Figure S1.Although the diffraction peaks were slightly increased, a nearly negligible difference was found when the calcining time was set to 1-12 h, meaning that the calcining time had little effect on the catalyst phase structures.To assess the effect of the loaded Pt metal, we performed an XRD measurement of the 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).After Pt loading, the intensity of the diffraction peak corresponding to anatase TiO 2 was weakened drastically compared with the peak of the sample before Pt loading, indicating the decreased crystallinity of the catalyst, which may derive from the formation of more surface area oxygen vacancies that cause residual stress. 57It can be also reflected from the enlarge view of 15-35that a slightly broadening on the FWHM may be induced by the residual stress deriving from the newly generated oxygen defects and the reduced crystalline size (Figure S2).Analogical phenomena have been observed in Bi-based compounds, 58,59 ZnO and CeO 2 . 60,61This finding was consistent with ESR and DFT calculation results revealing that single Pt atom can promote the formation of the more surface oxygen vacancies (see below).Contrastingly, the intensity of the XRD peaks of the Pt-loaded P25 TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies only show slight decrement than that of P25 (Figure S3).The phase structure of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different temperatures was further studied by Raman spectra because of their strong scattering properties.In Figure 1c, the four typical characterized Raman bands at wavenumbers of 144, 397, 515, and 639 cm -1 are indexed obviously as the symmetric E g , B 1g , A 1g , and E g Raman-active modes of the anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 62The increased annealing temperature leads to the gradually decreased half peak width of the strongest peak located at 144 cm -1 , which reflects the vibration of O-Ti-O, suggesting a more perfect crystallization of the catalyst.For V O -TiO 2 -700, the weak peak located at 446 cm -1 showed the emergence of the rutile phase, similar to the peak observed in the P25 TiO 2 spectrum (445 cm -1 ).Likewise, the intensity of The Journal of Physical Chemistry C D the Raman peak of V O -TiO 2 -500 clearly decreased after the single Pt atom loading (Figure 1d), while the intensity of the Raman peak obtained for Pt-P25 TiO 2 slightly decreased (Figure S4), corresponding to the XRD results.These findings may hint a presence of an interaction between V O and the supported single Pt atom. The morphology and structure of the TAN precursor and V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 used as a representative sample were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and TEM.The TAN precursor of O-defect-rich TiO 2 has a layered structure (Figure 2a) with a distance of approximately 0.8 nm between the adjacent layers. 63After annealing at 500 C, V O -TiO 2 -500 shows irregular particles (Figure 2b) with clear (101) anatase phase titania crystallographic planes having d s 0.33 nm, indicating the formation of anatase phase titania, as confirmed by XRD (Figure 2c).When the photo-deposition method was used to decorate Pt nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO 2 , the same lattice fringes with d s 0.33 nm could be observed, indicating that the loading of Pt has no impact on the crystal structure of TiO 2 (Figure 2d).But a vague border in the V O -TiO 2 -500 sample can be found when loading Pt, which may also hint the presence of an interaction between Pt and V O .Meanwhile, no difference on the morphology was observed for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 before and after single Pt atom loading (Figures 2b andS5).It should be noted that no corresponding signals related to crystalline Pt species are detected in the XRD patterns of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).Not only that, the presence of Pt nanoparticles was not observed obviously, too (Figures 2d andS5), suggesting a high dispersion of Pt species.The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings show the uniform distribution of Pt, Ti, and O elements (Figure 2f).The Pt loading content determined by ICP-OES was about 0.36.In view of this, HAADF-STEM was carried out, where the dispersion of Pt species at the atomic scale was observed clearly as several isolated bright dots signed by red circles, indicating the existence of atomically dispersed Pt (Figures 2e andS6).From Table S1, after calcining the TANs, a clear decrease in the specific surface areas was detected from 390.6 m 2 g -1 for the TANs to 297.7, 174.2, and 128.0 m 2 g -1 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively, which is attributed to the change in the morphology from TANs to irregular nanoparticles after annealing.The increased calcination temperature leads to the decreased catalytic specific surface area because the high temperature makes the grains grow and even sinter, resulting in the serious collapse of small channels or the blockage of channels. To study the defect structure of TiO 2 , ESR spectra were collected.All the catalysts except for P25 TiO 2 (Figure S7a) exhibit a strong ESR signal at g 2.0 (Figures 3a andS7), indicating the existence of oxygen vacancies in their structure. 33,64,65Upon increasing the heat-treatment temperature, the ESR signal of 2.0 becomes much stronger, showing that more O vacancy defects are formed in the catalysts structures (Figure S7b).Conversely, prolonging the heattreatment time seems to be detrimental to the generation of more oxygen vacancies, and the annealing time of 2 h is applicable (Figure S7c).Fascinatingly, the obvious increase in the ESR signal intensity is found for Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b), indicating a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, which may be related to the inducing effect of single Pt atom, promoting more oxygen vacancy defects to form on the surface/subsurface, corresponding to DFT calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). To give further evidence of the increased oxygen vacancy defects, PALS measurements of before and after single Pt atom supporting for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 were conducted to test the lifetime of the positron.As shown in Figure 4, 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 gave longer average positron lifetime than its counterpart, which results from the positron trapped by O vacancy defects.The positron lifespan spectra of V O rich-TiO 2 sample gave two lifetime constituents, 1 and 2 , accompanied by corresponding relative intensities, I 1 and I 2 (Table S2).The shorter constituent ( 1 ) is usually ascribed to the free annihilation of positrons in a defect-free crystal, called as the The Journal of Physical Chemistry C first lifespan of positrons. 66In an unordered system, little vacancies or shallow positron trap from oxygen vacancies may result in the decreased electron density of the surrounding to increase the lifetime of 1 . 67Compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 1 0.202 ns), the prolonged 1 (0.208 ns) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 shows that large numbers of oxygen vacancy defects were incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice by Pt atoms loading.Accordingly, the relative intensity (I 1 ) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 also increased sharply from 10.63 in V O -TiO 2 -500 to 15.35 in 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500. 68The longer lifetime component 2 was ascribed to the positron annihilation captured by O vacancies, 66 hinting that the longer value of 2 (0.387 ns) for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 revealed the increase of oxygen vacancies concentration compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 2 0.365 ns).It is worth noting that the increase of 2 was 86.1 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while it is 44.7 for V O -TiO 2 -500 compared with 1 , which means the generation of a huge number of boundarylike defects after Pt atoms loading 68 clearly related to the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies corresponding to theoretical calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). The surface chemical states and constituent elements of V O -TiO 2 -T (T 400, 500, 600 C) and 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 were analyzed by means of XPS technology and the results are described in Figure 5 to further expound the interaction between the oxygen vacancies and single Pt atom.The survey spectra presented in Figure 5a show that the Ti, O, and C elements from reference exist for all the samples.No signal corresponding to the Pt element is detected in the survey spectrum of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 because of the lower practical Pt loading.In the Ti 2p spectra (Figure 5b), compared to V O -TiO 2 -400 (Ti 2p 3/2 : 458.53 eV), the Ti 2p 3/2 peaks of V O -TiO 2 -500 (458.06 eV) and V O -TiO 2 -600 (458.14 eV) shift obviously to lower binding energies, which is closely connected to the generation of the more oxygen vacancy defects in the two samples, inducing a changed chemical environment of the titanium ions, as shown by the ESR results.Surprisingly, the distinct decrease and larger shift to a high binding energy were found for the 1 Pt-loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample.The similar changes were observed in O 1 s spectra of the 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample (Figure 5c).The peaks at 531.30 and 529.80 eV can be, respectively, indexed to the oxygen atoms in the neighborhood of oxygen vacancies and O bond of Ti-O-Ti. 21After loading single Pt atom, the O 1s peaks shift to high binding energies, accompanied by a sharp decrease in the peak intensity.This finding could be explained as follows: (i) the decreasing intensity of the Ti 2p peak and O 1s peak for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 is due to the Pt loading, which impairs the detection sensitivity of the instrument for Ti and O; (ii) the shifting of the binding energy values may be related to the strong single Pt atom-TiO 2 substrate interaction, which would anchor strongly single Pt atom on the TiO 2 surface to accumulate more electrons for the photocatalytic reaction because of the strong stabilizing ability resulting from vacancies.Nevertheless, except for the aforementioned change, careful study shows that the peak corresponding to the O atoms around the oxygen vacancy defects becomes more intense upon single Pt atom loading, and the integral-area ratios of the peak at 532.60 eV (O 1s peak for the oxygen vacancies) to the peak at 530.20 eV (O 1s peak for the lattice oxygen) were determined to be 0.35 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while this is 0.095, 0.081, and 0.092 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively (Figure S8).This obviously suggested the increased content of oxygen vacancies The Journal of Physical Chemistry C F due to the interaction of the atomically dispersed Pt and oxygen vacancies promoting to generate more oxygen vacancy defects on the surface/subsurface of the catalyst by strongly decreasing the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, corresponding to ESR, PALS, and the theoretical calculation results (see the Theoretical Calculation section). 37In Figure 5d, the typical XPS spectra of Pt 4f centered at 70.26 and 73.90 eV showed the Pt metallic state.Moreover, the two peaks located at 72.60 and 75.60 eV indicates of the presence of platinum oxide. 69igure 6a gives the absorbance versus wavelength plots of the P25, TAN, and V O -rich-TiO 2 -based samples.Compared to the TAN precursor material, the absorption of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples shifts to longer wavelength, obviously because of the influence of the oxygen vacancy formation.Nevertheless, the difference between the absorptions of the different V O -rich-TiO 2 samples with different oxygen vacancy concentrations is negligible and similar to that of P25, which indicates that no obvious visible light absorption is generated by the introduced oxygen vacancies in the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples, as reported by the literature. 21Additionally, the same conclusion could also be drawn based on the absorptions of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples prepared with the different heat-treatment times (Figure S9).To get the effect of the isolated single Pt atom, the UV-vis absorption spectra of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25-TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies were obtained.Surprisingly, after Pt atom loading, significant visible-light-driven absorption is found for the Pt-loaded V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which is associated with the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies (Figure 6b). 37,38Nevertheless, almost no change is observed for the absorption of Pt-deposited P25 in comparison with that of the pristine P25 (the inset of Figure 6b).These findings show again that a strong interaction existed between single Pt atom and oxygen vacancy defects for the Pt atom-decorated V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which corresponds to To study the dynamics of electron transfer on the interface of the catalysts, the transient I-t curves were measured with light-on and light-off cycles.As displayed in Figure 7a, the introduced oxygen vacancy defects brought about higher photocurrent values for all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, especially V O -TiO 2 -500 with a maximum photocurrent of 0.45 mA, which is almost 2.7 and 16 times as high as that of the P25 and TAN samples.This could occur because the formed oxygen vacancy defects captured electrons and thus suppressed the recombination of photoinduced charges. 70Figure 7b displays Nyquist curves with arc-like distribution patterns and the corresponding equivalent circuit.The smaller arc radius at a low frequency is usually connected to the charge migration at the interface of the semiconductor and in the electrolyte of the tested electrode. 71According to the radius of the Nyquist plots, the V O -rich TiO 2 samples exhibit a smaller charge transfer resistance (R3) compared with the TAN precursor, as shown by the I-t results.Among the samples, V O -TiO 2 -500 demonstrates the smallest charge transfer resistance than the other two V O -TiO 2 samples and P25 TiO 2 , meaning that the charge transportation at the interface is faster for V O -TiO 2 -500.Figure 7c presents the PL emission spectra of the as-obtained V O -rich TiO 2 samples using P25 and TAN as references at an excited wavelength of 400 nm to prove the improved separation efficiency of the e --h pairs upon introducing oxygen vacancies.The decay of the PL signals for all the V Orich TiO 2 catalysts is sharp in comparison with that of the P25 and TAN reference samples, indicating that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies significantly inhibited the annihilation of the photoinduced electrons and holes. 72The V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample shows the weakest PL emission, demonstrating the best carrier separation efficiency, which means that a more robust photocatalytic process can occur over it.However, introducing excess oxygen vacancies leads to an enhanced PL emission (such as V O -TiO 2 -600) because the excess O defects can be viewed as the recombination centers of the e --h pairs, which impacts the photoreactivity of the sample.Generally, the carrier density could affect the dynamic performance and photocatalytic activity of the catalysts.Therefore, the Mott-Schottky tests of P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 were performed to determine the different donor densities of the two photocatalysts, as described in Figure 7d.The two samples show typical characteristics of an n-type semiconductor with a positive slope.The donor density can be reflected by the magnitude of the slope, and the slope reduces with the increased donor density. 73In comparison with P25 TiO 2 , the much smaller slope of V O -TiO 2 -500 indicated a higher donor density originating from the contribution of oxygen vacancies formed by annealing the TANs, which would significantly promote the carrier transfer and photocatalytic activity. 3.2.Theoretical Calculations.The aforementioned experimental characterization results showed that a strong synergistic effect existed between the oxygen vacancies and loaded single Pt atom.To better understand such a mechanism, we studied the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with and without V O defects in the framework of the KS DFT.Therein, configurations where that V O s exist on the surface, subsurface, and inner layers are considered (Figure S10).When a Pt atom adsorbs on a clean A-TiO 2 (101) surface, O 2c -O 3c -O 2c site is the most favorable site (Figure 8a), as proved by many reports, 747576 so we adopt this model directly (Figure 8b).The calculated adsorption energy of the single Pt atom on the clean surface is -2.89 eV (Table 1).Meanwhile, on the A-TiO 2 (101) surface with different oxygen vacancy concentrations, the adsorption energy of the single Pt atom 1).In other words, a surface V O has an anchoring effect on the loaded Pt 1 , which is consistent with the previous study that surface defects can strongly affect the stability of single atom-catalyst. 76,77ven more fascinating is that the formation energy of the V O s obviously decreases upon loading with Pt, especially for surface and subsurface V O s.In the absence of Pt loading, the formation energies of the surface and subsurface O vacancies are 3.31 and 4.00 eV, respectively, and they decreased to1.92 and 3.46 eV after loading the single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst (Table 1).Nevertheless, the deposited of the Pt atom seems to have no clear effect on the formation energies of the interior oxygen vacancies.These results indicated that, based on the formation energies, the loaded single Pt atom more strongly favors the formation of surface/subsurface oxygen vacancies than the V O s in the bulk as proved by the increased ESR signal over 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b) and PALS (Figure 4). Generally, the formation of V O s generates extra electrons in TiO 2 nanomaterials, increasing the electron concentration, which favors the improved photocatalytic efficiency.However, note that the bulk and surface/subsurface V O s have different influences on the photoreactivity.In stark contrast to bulk V O s generally served as the charge carrier recombination centers, surface/subsurface V O s have proven to be helpful for the efficient separation of the photoinduced electron and hole pairs.The surface/subsurface V O s give rise to more donor electrons localized on the surface region, facilitating the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and thereby improving the photoactivity of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples. 26ccording to our experimental result, the sample that single Pt atom with more V O s showed higher activity.To further determine how surface vacancy interplay with Pt 1 and improve photocatalytic activity, we studied the charge distribution of the Pt/TiO 2 system.Based on our Bader charge analysis, when Pt 1 react with V O 1, it obtains 0.94 e, indicating charge transfers from the substrate to Pt atom.As a comparison, when Pt reacts with a clean surface or surface with inner V O s, it will lose charge, indicating charge will migrate from the Pt atom to substate.This point can also be supported by our charge density difference analysis (Figure S11).Hence, it is reasonable that for the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with surface V O s, such defect provides more electrons and thus increases the carrier concentration.These electrons may transfer quickly to the loaded single Pt atom, the photocatalytic active site, and participate in the photocatalytic reactions on the surface and, consequently, improve photocatalytic efficiency.The Journal of Physical Chemistry C pubs.acs.org/JPCCenhanced hydrogen production rates (667, 1077, and 651 mol h -1 , respectively, for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600) compared to the P25 (344 mol h -1 ) and TAN (239 mol h -1 ) samples without oxygen vacancies.The best H 2 -production rate of 1077 mol h -1 was obtained by V O -TiO 2 -500, which is approximately three times that of P25 (Figure 9a).It is unquestionably related to the contribution of the introduced oxygen vacancies, whose existence remarkably increases the donor density in the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, thereby promoting carrier transfer to the surface and causing more electrons to participate in the photocatalysis reaction under the same irradiation.The higher concentration of V O defects does not seem to be good for H 2 evolution because excess oxygen vacancies become recombination centers of e -h pairs, impairing the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. 72dditionally, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) was also measured and calculated according to similar photocatalytic reaction conditions by using a 365 nm UV light bandpass filter (see the Supporting Information).Specifically, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample (21.7) was 3.14 times as high as that of P25 TiO 2 (6.9), implying that the oxygen vacancy defect-rich sample shows a better photocatalytic performance.To perform a systematic study, the effect of the pH, Pt deposition amount, and sacrificial agents on the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance was also studied.The maximal H 2 evolution rate was obtained at a pH 4.7 0.3 (Figure S12a).The excess deposition of Pt leads to the gradual deterioration of the hydrogen production rate, which may be due to more active surface sites covered by the Pt (Figure S12b). 22Using methyl alcohol as the electron donor, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 evolution from water was shown by the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples (Figure S12c).Figure 9b shows the photocatalytic stability of V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25, and the H 2 production by the two samples does not clearly decrease over four cycles, especially for V O -TiO 2 -500.The TON values have also been calculated to evaluate the long-term test stability of catalysts for H 2 production and the results are listed in the Supporting Information (Table S3).It should be noted that the TON of V O -TiO 2 -500 for H 2 evolution is clearly higher than that of P25 TiO 2 , suggesting that the obtained V O defect-rich TiO 2 sample in this work can serve as a practical photocatalyst to improve the photocatalytic H 2 generation activity.As increasing the annealing time, the attenuated photocatalytic H 2 formation rates may be related to the decreased V O concentration (Figure S12d). The gradually increasing emission of CO 2 into the atmosphere caused by burning fossil fuels generates problems of global warming for our society.The reduction of CO 2 with the aid of sunlight-driven photocatalysis technology not only leads to the decreased amount of CO 2 greenhouse gas, relieving global greenhouse effects but also converts CO 2 to value-added fuels, solving the energy problem. 78,79Therefore, we carried out the photoreduction test of CO 2 with H 2 O over the as-obtained catalysts using UV-vis light irradiation in pure water without any sacrificial agents to avoid interference, and the results are described in Figure 10.Clearly, the amounts of CH 4 and CO over all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples are significantly larger than those over the commercial P25 TiO 2 .In particular, V O -TiO 2 -500 exhibits the highest yields of CH 4 and CO with Pt single atoms loading as cocatalyst but without H 2 formation, which is almost 2.2 and 2.3 times higher than that achieved by P25 TiO 2 , respectively (Table S5).The higher selectivity for CH 4 than that of CO over all the catalysts is due to the Pt cocatalyst loading. 12Simultaneously, the AQE for CO 2 conversion has also been obtained.The AQE of the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst (V O -TiO 2 -500) is 0.064, which is almost 18-fold of commercial P25 TiO 2 .Figure 11 shows the cycle measurement results of the P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.During the four cycles, the generation rates of the CH 4 and CO did not show the obvious decrease, displaying a good stability for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and at the same time exhibiting a fascinating application potential for the photoconversion of CO 2 with H 2 O.The TON values of CO 2 photoreduction to generate CO and CH 4 have also been calculated (Table S4), in which the V O -TiO 2 -500 shows the clearly enhanced TON values compared to P25 TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction. CO 2 reduction to produce CH 4 is an eight-electron process, which requires gathering the more photogenerated charge carriers with a long lifetime. 80The Pt atom strongly anchored with the help of the large of oxygen vacancies can promote more electrons to accumulate on the surface of the catalyst, leading to a higher catalytic performance of the catalyst.In the work, without any sacrificial agents being added, CO 2 is the only carbon source.For it, control photocatalytic experiments were conducted under identical conditions but using N 2 as the carrier gas replacing CO 2 , in which no CO or CH 4 product could be detected, indicating that carbides in this experiment did not originate from carbon contamination.In addition, the theoretical calculation and experiment results show that CO 2 can be strongly adsorbed on V O existing on the TiO 2 surface and the activation barrier of CO 2 reduction can be greatly reduced. 81,82At the same time, the generated V O can be viewed as reactive sites to promote the activation of CO 2 to form CO 2 -, which could enhance the product rate of CO and The Journal of Physical Chemistry C CH 4 . 82The photoinduced holes in the VB can be oxidated by the adsorbed hydroxyl species to form O 2 . In a word, based on the abovementioned experimental and DFT calculation results, under the same Pt loading, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 photoreduction performance shown by the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples was undoubtedly related to the synergistic action of the O vacancies and isolated single Pt atom.The existence of surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies strongly anchored single Pt atom onto the surface of the catalyst, and in turn, the loaded single-atomic-site Pt bring about the generation of more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies, as illustrated in Figures 3b,4 and Table S2, by decreasing the formation energy of an O vacancy on the surface and subsurface, according to the DFT calculation.While the existence of more oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 increased the donor density not only promoting the carrier transfer but also making more electrons accumulate in the sink provided by single Pt atom to participate in the photoreaction, thus promoting the photoactivity.The theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the O defects on the surface of TiO 2 favor the adsorption and activation of CO 2 by the strong actions with the O atoms of CO 2 and the effective generation of CO 2 intermediates, leading to the dissociation of CO 2 . 78,79The CO 2 adsorption measurements were therefore carried out under environmental conditions of 298 K at low pressure, as presented in Figure S13.These measurements show that the CO 2 adsorption capacity at 298 K and 1 atm (760 mmHg) over V O -TiO 2 -500 could reach 10.94 cm 3 /g, while that is 7.09 cm 3 /g over P25 TiO 2 .The abovementioned result indicates that the introduced V O defects endow our prepared TiO 2 sample with an enhanced CO 2 adsorption capacity, improving its photocatalytic activity.It is just derived from the synergistic effect of V O and loaded single Pt atom, the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst obtained by us showed the enhanced H 2 product and CO 2 reduction performance."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis light", "source": "The photocatalytic performance of all the asobtained catalysts in this work were assessed by determining the photocatalytic hydrogen production and photoreduction CO 2 abilities of the samples in water with UV-vis light (H 2 evolution was performed with MeOH as the hole sacrificial agent and CO 2 reduction was carried out in pure water without the addition of any sacrificial reagent).", "context": "In summary, we developed V O defect-rich TiO 2 as an efficient catalyst toward photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 photoreduction to make a systematical study of the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and Pt using TANs as the TiO 2 source, and thus, oxygen vacancies were generated in-situ by annealing.In comparison to P25 TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies, all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples exhibit excellent abilities for photocatalytic H 2 evolution and CO 2 photoconversion, which is obviously connected to the coeffect of oxygen vacancies and the single atom Pt-supported cocatalyst.The introduced oxygen vacancy defects remarkably suppress the recombination of photoexcited charge carriers, as verified by the photocurrent and impedance measurements.On the basis of DFT calculation, the deposit single Pt atom used as cocatalysts lead to the generation of more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancy defects, which are responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance by strongly decreasing the formation energy of O vacancies.In turn, the introduced more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies can furtherly improve the adsorption of single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst by an anchoring effect of the surface V O for the loaded Pt atoms.Additionally, the existing V O defects facilitate the adsorption of CO 2 , contributing to the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO production.This work can open an avenue for studying the synergistic effect of defects and loaded metal single atom and the rational construction of novel and highly efficient photocatalysts.

Adsorption Energy of a Pt Single Atom on TiO 2 with a Clean Surface and Oxygen Vacancies, and the Formation Energy of Oxygen Vacancies with/without Pt Single Atom Loading, in Which V O 1 and V O 2 Separately Represent the Surface and Subsurface Oxygen Vacancies, While V O 3 and V O 4 can Represent the Bulk Oxygen VacanciesThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C was clearly enhanced, especially on the surface of TiO 2 with surface/subsurface V O s, and the adsorption energies are -4.27 and -3.42 eV lower than those on the clean surface, which are separately 1.38 and 0.53 eV (herein, negative values represent releasing of heat, and the more negative the values are, the stronger the adsorption of single Pt atom is).Without a clear increase in the adsorption energy, when an interior V O exists on the Pt 1 /TiO 2 (101) surface.These results suggested that the presence of surface and subsurface oxygen vacancy defects strongly improved the adsorption of single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst, implying a stronger coaction between the supported Pt atoms and catalyst substrate.Note that when the Pt 1 reacts with V O 1, namely, surface V O s, Pt atom enters into the vacancy, bonding with O 2c and O 3c , thus enhancing the adsorption energy (Table https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c04931J.

An ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with an Al K (h 1486.6eV) achromatic X-ray source was used to achieve X-ray photoelectron spectra of catalysts.Using BaSO 4 as the reference, the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of the as-fabricated catalysts were collected within range of 200--800 nm by a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV/vis spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere accessory.To research the separation efficiency of the photoinduced charge carriers, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-obtained photocatalysts were recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer (TU-1900, Beijing PuXi, China) under 380 nm excitation wavelength.By means of N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, the specific surface area (BET) values of the samples were obtained on a Quadrasorb SI-4 instrument.Elemental analysis of Pt in the catalysts were detected by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) by means of Optima 2100 DV.High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image was recorded by a JEM ARM-200F high resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV.CO 2 gas adsorption tests were performed under the environmental condition of 298 K at 1 atm pressure (ASAP 2020M C), and the pressure can be changed gradually with the gas flow rate.On a spectrometer (Bruker E500), ESR spectra of the catalysts were achieved under room temperature condition and in the air atmosphere to verify the existence of the oxygen vacancies. At room temperature, with the help of a coincidence spectrometer, PALS measurements were carried by an ORTEC-583 fast-fast coincident system having a 270 ps prompt time resolution full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the -ray resulting from a 60 Co source under experimental conditions.Before measurement, the powder-like catalysts needed to be pressed into a disk of 10.0 mm 1.0 mm.A 30 Ci positron source of 22 Na was used and put between the two same sample disks.The positron lifespan spectrum with 10 6 counts was split into several lifetime constituents via the PATFIT program. 2.4.Photoelectrochemical Performance Measurements.The electrochemical tests of the catalysts were performed on a electrochemical workstation (CHI660, Shanghai Chenhua, China) using a conventional threeelectrode system, where the as-deposited samples on the ITO substrate coated with the catalyst were served as the working electrode, a platinum wire and a standard calomel electrode separately acted as the counter electrode and the compared electrode, respectively.The electrolyte solution was Na 2 SO 3 (0.1 M), where it needed to be purged with high purity nitrogen at lowest 20 min before performing the electrochemical tests to eliminate oxygen. 2.5.Evaluation of the Photocatalytic H 2 Evolution and CO 2 Photoconversion Activity.The photocatalytic hydrogen production activity was assessed via an online photocatalytic evaluation system (Labsolar-6A, Perfectlight, China).A xenon lamp of 300 W (PLS-SXE300, Perfectlight, China) with a light intensity of 46 mW/cm 2 and an irradiation area of 19.625 cm 2 acted as the light source to initiate the photocatalytic reaction, and the illumination radiation distance was approximately 10 cm from the liquid level.In brief, 100 mg of freshly prepared Pt loaded catalyst powder was dispersed in a mixed liquor composed of 80 mL of deionized water and 20 mL of methanol used as the scavenger of h before the photocatalytic reaction.Similarly, for the CO 2 photoreduction, 0.1 g of the catalyst powder was dispersed into a reactor containing 100 mL of high-purity water without the use of a sacrificial agent.The high-pure CO 2 gas was bubbled through the solution at 80 kPa with continuous stirring three times to drive away the excess gas, and the final preservation of the 80 kPa CO 2 was used as a test.For H 2 evolution and CO 2 reduction, the photocatalytic reaction was typically performed by irradiating with UV-vis light for 5 h, and the gaseous product was analyzed at given time intervals (1 h) by gas chromatography (FULI 979011) equipped, respectively, with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector with high-purity N 2 as the carrier gas.The amount of the obtained products was determined according to the standard curves. 2.6.Computational Details.Using the generalized gradient approximation method, we carried out DFT calculations based on the Vienna Ab initio Simulation package code. 4849950 We used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional to deal with the exchange-correlation part of the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation. 51Core electrons was treated by the projector augmented wave pseudopotentials. 52The smooth parts of the wave functions are extended in plane waves with a kinetic energy cutoff of 480 eV.In addition, dipole corrections were applied to account for the coactions between the asymmetric slabs. 53,54he model of the (3 2) supercell of the stoichiometric anatase TiO 2 (101) surface consisting of five TiO 2 layers and 180 atoms was created by the optimized unit cell.Each The Journal of Physical Chemistry C supercell has a vacuum layer of 15 A to separate the slabs.During structural relaxation, for all the supercells, the bottom TiO 2 layer was frozen in its bulk positions to simulate a bulklike layer, while the top four layers were allowed to relax along with the surface Pt single atom.For all the relaxation calculations, only G-centered k-point mesh is adopted, which is proved to provide sufficient accuracy for this large supercell system 55 while for the computation of the density of states and other ground state properties, a denser k mesh sampling by 3 3 1 grids was used at the fully relaxed geometry.The energy convergence criterion for the geometry optimization was 10 -4 eV/A.The energy of the Pt single atom and an O 2 molecule were calculated by putting the Pt 1 or molecule inside a 1011 12 A 3 cubic box and by using (6 6 6) k-point sampling. To determine the binding strength between the single Pt atom and A-TiO 2 (101) surface, the adsorption energies can be determined as follows where E Pt 1 /TiO 2 , E TiO 2 , and E Pt 1 are the total energies of the Pt 1 / A-TiO 2 (101), A-TiO 2 (101), and Pt 1 single atom, respectively.The more negative the E(ads) is, the more stable the system should be; therefore, negative E(ads) indicates that the adsorption of single metal on the TiO 2 surface is thermodynamically favorable.The generation energy of an oxygen vacancy defect is defined as follows where E surf V O , E surf , and E O 2 are the total energy of the surface with a V O defect, without a V O defect, and for an O 2 molecule in a vacuum."}, {"llm generation": "xenon lamp of 300 W", "source": "A xenon lamp of 300 W (PLS-SXE300, Perfectlight, China) with a light intensity of 46 mW/cm 2 and an irradiation area of 19.625 cm 2 acted as the light source to initiate the photocatalytic reaction, and the illumination radiation distance was approximately 10 cm from the liquid level.", "context": "2.1.Synthesis of the Titanic Acid Nanotube Precursor and V O Defect-Rich TiO 2 .Typically, a 10 M NaOH solution (300 mL) and 3 g of P25 powder were used as the raw materials, and a suspension was achieved by heat-treating the raw materials at 150 C for 24 h in four 100 mL Teflon-sealed autoclaves. 47Cooling to room temperature, the achieved white production was washed using the high purity water to obtain a pH value of 7.0-8.0and was next dipped into hydrogen chloride solution (HCl, pH 1.0) to perform an ion exchange between Na and H and fabricate the titanic acid nanotubes.Subsequently, to remove Cl -, the precipitate was washed again with the high purity water and dried at vacuum room temperature.The final powder-like product was titanic acid nanotubes (abbreviated as TANs in the below section).The as-obtained TANs were well-distributed in a quartz boat and calcined in a static air atmosphere at 400, 500, 600, and 700 C for 2 h under a heating speed of 10 Cmin -1 .The prepared samples were named V O -TiO 2 -T (where T 400, 500, 600, and 700 C). 2.2.Deposition of the Pt Cocatalyst.Using H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O as precursors, the loading process of the Pt cocatalyst on TiO 2 -based samples was carried out by a photodeposition method.Briefly, taking 1 wt Pt loading for example, 0.5 g of TiO 2 sample was immersed in 100 mL of 2.57 10 -4 mol/L H 2 PtCl 6 /ethanol solution, in which ethanol was served as the electron donor.The suspension was illuminated with a 300 W Xe lamp for 1.5 h after adsorption in dark for 1 h.Whereafter, the sample was collected and washed repeatedly with the high pure water by filtration for about six times and then dried in vacuum at room temperature. 2.3.Photocatalyst Characterizations.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan) was employed to observe the morphologies and microstructure of the obtained samples.With the help of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, Cu K1), the crystalline phase of catalysts was characterized.A Raman spectrometer (Renishaw inVia) was used with a working power of 50 mW, an accumulation time of 30 s under 532 nm excitation wavelength.

At room temperature, with the help of a coincidence spectrometer, PALS measurements were carried by an ORTEC-583 fast-fast coincident system having a 270 ps prompt time resolution full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the -ray resulting from a 60 Co source under experimental conditions.Before measurement, the powder-like catalysts needed to be pressed into a disk of 10.0 mm 1.0 mm.A 30 Ci positron source of 22 Na was used and put between the two same sample disks.The positron lifespan spectrum with 10 6 counts was split into several lifetime constituents via the PATFIT program. 2.4.Photoelectrochemical Performance Measurements.The electrochemical tests of the catalysts were performed on a electrochemical workstation (CHI660, Shanghai Chenhua, China) using a conventional threeelectrode system, where the as-deposited samples on the ITO substrate coated with the catalyst were served as the working electrode, a platinum wire and a standard calomel electrode separately acted as the counter electrode and the compared electrode, respectively.The electrolyte solution was Na 2 SO 3 (0.1 M), where it needed to be purged with high purity nitrogen at lowest 20 min before performing the electrochemical tests to eliminate oxygen. 2.5.Evaluation of the Photocatalytic H 2 Evolution and CO 2 Photoconversion Activity.The photocatalytic hydrogen production activity was assessed via an online photocatalytic evaluation system (Labsolar-6A, Perfectlight, China).A xenon lamp of 300 W (PLS-SXE300, Perfectlight, China) with a light intensity of 46 mW/cm 2 and an irradiation area of 19.625 cm 2 acted as the light source to initiate the photocatalytic reaction, and the illumination radiation distance was approximately 10 cm from the liquid level.In brief, 100 mg of freshly prepared Pt loaded catalyst powder was dispersed in a mixed liquor composed of 80 mL of deionized water and 20 mL of methanol used as the scavenger of h before the photocatalytic reaction.Similarly, for the CO 2 photoreduction, 0.1 g of the catalyst powder was dispersed into a reactor containing 100 mL of high-purity water without the use of a sacrificial agent.The high-pure CO 2 gas was bubbled through the solution at 80 kPa with continuous stirring three times to drive away the excess gas, and the final preservation of the 80 kPa CO 2 was used as a test.For H 2 evolution and CO 2 reduction, the photocatalytic reaction was typically performed by irradiating with UV-vis light for 5 h, and the gaseous product was analyzed at given time intervals (1 h) by gas chromatography (FULI 979011) equipped, respectively, with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector with high-purity N 2 as the carrier gas.The amount of the obtained products was determined according to the standard curves. 2.6.Computational Details.Using the generalized gradient approximation method, we carried out DFT calculations based on the Vienna Ab initio Simulation package code. 4849950 We used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional to deal with the exchange-correlation part of the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation. 51Core electrons was treated by the projector augmented wave pseudopotentials. 52The smooth parts of the wave functions are extended in plane waves with a kinetic energy cutoff of 480 eV.In addition, dipole corrections were applied to account for the coactions between the asymmetric slabs. 53,54he model of the (3 2) supercell of the stoichiometric anatase TiO 2 (101) surface consisting of five TiO 2 layers and 180 atoms was created by the optimized unit cell.Each The Journal of Physical Chemistry C supercell has a vacuum layer of 15 A to separate the slabs.During structural relaxation, for all the supercells, the bottom TiO 2 layer was frozen in its bulk positions to simulate a bulklike layer, while the top four layers were allowed to relax along with the surface Pt single atom.For all the relaxation calculations, only G-centered k-point mesh is adopted, which is proved to provide sufficient accuracy for this large supercell system 55 while for the computation of the density of states and other ground state properties, a denser k mesh sampling by 3 3 1 grids was used at the fully relaxed geometry.The energy convergence criterion for the geometry optimization was 10 -4 eV/A.The energy of the Pt single atom and an O 2 molecule were calculated by putting the Pt 1 or molecule inside a 1011 12 A 3 cubic box and by using (6 6 6) k-point sampling. To determine the binding strength between the single Pt atom and A-TiO 2 (101) surface, the adsorption energies can be determined as follows where E Pt 1 /TiO 2 , E TiO 2 , and E Pt 1 are the total energies of the Pt 1 / A-TiO 2 (101), A-TiO 2 (101), and Pt 1 single atom, respectively.The more negative the E(ads) is, the more stable the system should be; therefore, negative E(ads) indicates that the adsorption of single metal on the TiO 2 surface is thermodynamically favorable.The generation energy of an oxygen vacancy defect is defined as follows where E surf V O , E surf , and E O 2 are the total energy of the surface with a V O defect, without a V O defect, and for an O 2 molecule in a vacuum."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "high-purity water", "source": "Similarly, for the CO 2 photoreduction, 0.1 g of the catalyst powder was dispersed into a reactor containing 100 mL of high-purity water without the use of a sacrificial agent.", "context": "2.1.Synthesis of the Titanic Acid Nanotube Precursor and V O Defect-Rich TiO 2 .Typically, a 10 M NaOH solution (300 mL) and 3 g of P25 powder were used as the raw materials, and a suspension was achieved by heat-treating the raw materials at 150 C for 24 h in four 100 mL Teflon-sealed autoclaves. 47Cooling to room temperature, the achieved white production was washed using the high purity water to obtain a pH value of 7.0-8.0and was next dipped into hydrogen chloride solution (HCl, pH 1.0) to perform an ion exchange between Na and H and fabricate the titanic acid nanotubes.Subsequently, to remove Cl -, the precipitate was washed again with the high purity water and dried at vacuum room temperature.The final powder-like product was titanic acid nanotubes (abbreviated as TANs in the below section).The as-obtained TANs were well-distributed in a quartz boat and calcined in a static air atmosphere at 400, 500, 600, and 700 C for 2 h under a heating speed of 10 Cmin -1 .The prepared samples were named V O -TiO 2 -T (where T 400, 500, 600, and 700 C). 2.2.Deposition of the Pt Cocatalyst.Using H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O as precursors, the loading process of the Pt cocatalyst on TiO 2 -based samples was carried out by a photodeposition method.Briefly, taking 1 wt Pt loading for example, 0.5 g of TiO 2 sample was immersed in 100 mL of 2.57 10 -4 mol/L H 2 PtCl 6 /ethanol solution, in which ethanol was served as the electron donor.The suspension was illuminated with a 300 W Xe lamp for 1.5 h after adsorption in dark for 1 h.Whereafter, the sample was collected and washed repeatedly with the high pure water by filtration for about six times and then dried in vacuum at room temperature. 2.3.Photocatalyst Characterizations.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan) was employed to observe the morphologies and microstructure of the obtained samples.With the help of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, Cu K1), the crystalline phase of catalysts was characterized.A Raman spectrometer (Renishaw inVia) was used with a working power of 50 mW, an accumulation time of 30 s under 532 nm excitation wavelength.

To determine the binding strength between the single Pt atom and A-TiO 2 (101) surface, the adsorption energies can be determined as follows where E Pt 1 /TiO 2 , E TiO 2 , and E Pt 1 are the total energies of the Pt 1 / A-TiO 2 (101), A-TiO 2 (101), and Pt 1 single atom, respectively.The more negative the E(ads) is, the more stable the system should be; therefore, negative E(ads) indicates that the adsorption of single metal on the TiO 2 surface is thermodynamically favorable.The generation energy of an oxygen vacancy defect is defined as follows where E surf V O , E surf , and E O 2 are the total energy of the surface with a V O defect, without a V O defect, and for an O 2 molecule in a vacuum."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Therefore, we carried out the photoreduction test of CO 2 with H 2 O over the as-obtained catalysts using UV-vis light irradiation in pure water without any sacrificial agents to avoid interference, and the results are described in Figure 10.", "context": "3.1.Characterization and Analysis.As displayed in Figure 1a, the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different calcination temperatures exhibited narrow and intense XRD peaks of 2 25.3, 37.8, and 48.0, which corresponds to the (101), (004), and (200) crystallographic planes of the anatase TiO 2 structure, respectively. 56With the increased annealing temperature, the corresponding diffraction peak became sharper, implying a more perfect lattice structure.The rutile phase can be observed in the sample prepared at 700 C, similar to the XRD pattern of pristine P25 TiO 2 , maybe suggesting a reduced photoactivity of the final catalyst.The influence of the heat treatment duration on the V O -rich-TiO 2 phase structures is also described in Figure S1.Although the diffraction peaks were slightly increased, a nearly negligible difference was found when the calcining time was set to 1-12 h, meaning that the calcining time had little effect on the catalyst phase structures.To assess the effect of the loaded Pt metal, we performed an XRD measurement of the 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).After Pt loading, the intensity of the diffraction peak corresponding to anatase TiO 2 was weakened drastically compared with the peak of the sample before Pt loading, indicating the decreased crystallinity of the catalyst, which may derive from the formation of more surface area oxygen vacancies that cause residual stress. 57It can be also reflected from the enlarge view of 15-35that a slightly broadening on the FWHM may be induced by the residual stress deriving from the newly generated oxygen defects and the reduced crystalline size (Figure S2).Analogical phenomena have been observed in Bi-based compounds, 58,59 ZnO and CeO 2 . 60,61This finding was consistent with ESR and DFT calculation results revealing that single Pt atom can promote the formation of the more surface oxygen vacancies (see below).Contrastingly, the intensity of the XRD peaks of the Pt-loaded P25 TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies only show slight decrement than that of P25 (Figure S3).The phase structure of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples prepared at different temperatures was further studied by Raman spectra because of their strong scattering properties.In Figure 1c, the four typical characterized Raman bands at wavenumbers of 144, 397, 515, and 639 cm -1 are indexed obviously as the symmetric E g , B 1g , A 1g , and E g Raman-active modes of the anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 62The increased annealing temperature leads to the gradually decreased half peak width of the strongest peak located at 144 cm -1 , which reflects the vibration of O-Ti-O, suggesting a more perfect crystallization of the catalyst.For V O -TiO 2 -700, the weak peak located at 446 cm -1 showed the emergence of the rutile phase, similar to the peak observed in the P25 TiO 2 spectrum (445 cm -1 ).Likewise, the intensity of The Journal of Physical Chemistry C D the Raman peak of V O -TiO 2 -500 clearly decreased after the single Pt atom loading (Figure 1d), while the intensity of the Raman peak obtained for Pt-P25 TiO 2 slightly decreased (Figure S4), corresponding to the XRD results.These findings may hint a presence of an interaction between V O and the supported single Pt atom. The morphology and structure of the TAN precursor and V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 used as a representative sample were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and TEM.The TAN precursor of O-defect-rich TiO 2 has a layered structure (Figure 2a) with a distance of approximately 0.8 nm between the adjacent layers. 63After annealing at 500 C, V O -TiO 2 -500 shows irregular particles (Figure 2b) with clear (101) anatase phase titania crystallographic planes having d s 0.33 nm, indicating the formation of anatase phase titania, as confirmed by XRD (Figure 2c).When the photo-deposition method was used to decorate Pt nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO 2 , the same lattice fringes with d s 0.33 nm could be observed, indicating that the loading of Pt has no impact on the crystal structure of TiO 2 (Figure 2d).But a vague border in the V O -TiO 2 -500 sample can be found when loading Pt, which may also hint the presence of an interaction between Pt and V O .Meanwhile, no difference on the morphology was observed for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 before and after single Pt atom loading (Figures 2b andS5).It should be noted that no corresponding signals related to crystalline Pt species are detected in the XRD patterns of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 1b).Not only that, the presence of Pt nanoparticles was not observed obviously, too (Figures 2d andS5), suggesting a high dispersion of Pt species.The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings show the uniform distribution of Pt, Ti, and O elements (Figure 2f).The Pt loading content determined by ICP-OES was about 0.36.In view of this, HAADF-STEM was carried out, where the dispersion of Pt species at the atomic scale was observed clearly as several isolated bright dots signed by red circles, indicating the existence of atomically dispersed Pt (Figures 2e andS6).From Table S1, after calcining the TANs, a clear decrease in the specific surface areas was detected from 390.6 m 2 g -1 for the TANs to 297.7, 174.2, and 128.0 m 2 g -1 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively, which is attributed to the change in the morphology from TANs to irregular nanoparticles after annealing.The increased calcination temperature leads to the decreased catalytic specific surface area because the high temperature makes the grains grow and even sinter, resulting in the serious collapse of small channels or the blockage of channels. To study the defect structure of TiO 2 , ESR spectra were collected.All the catalysts except for P25 TiO 2 (Figure S7a) exhibit a strong ESR signal at g 2.0 (Figures 3a andS7), indicating the existence of oxygen vacancies in their structure. 33,64,65Upon increasing the heat-treatment temperature, the ESR signal of 2.0 becomes much stronger, showing that more O vacancy defects are formed in the catalysts structures (Figure S7b).Conversely, prolonging the heattreatment time seems to be detrimental to the generation of more oxygen vacancies, and the annealing time of 2 h is applicable (Figure S7c).Fascinatingly, the obvious increase in the ESR signal intensity is found for Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b), indicating a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, which may be related to the inducing effect of single Pt atom, promoting more oxygen vacancy defects to form on the surface/subsurface, corresponding to DFT calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). To give further evidence of the increased oxygen vacancy defects, PALS measurements of before and after single Pt atom supporting for the sample V O -TiO 2 -500 were conducted to test the lifetime of the positron.As shown in Figure 4, 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 gave longer average positron lifetime than its counterpart, which results from the positron trapped by O vacancy defects.The positron lifespan spectra of V O rich-TiO 2 sample gave two lifetime constituents, 1 and 2 , accompanied by corresponding relative intensities, I 1 and I 2 (Table S2).The shorter constituent ( 1 ) is usually ascribed to the free annihilation of positrons in a defect-free crystal, called as the The Journal of Physical Chemistry C first lifespan of positrons. 66In an unordered system, little vacancies or shallow positron trap from oxygen vacancies may result in the decreased electron density of the surrounding to increase the lifetime of 1 . 67Compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 1 0.202 ns), the prolonged 1 (0.208 ns) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 shows that large numbers of oxygen vacancy defects were incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice by Pt atoms loading.Accordingly, the relative intensity (I 1 ) of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 also increased sharply from 10.63 in V O -TiO 2 -500 to 15.35 in 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500. 68The longer lifetime component 2 was ascribed to the positron annihilation captured by O vacancies, 66 hinting that the longer value of 2 (0.387 ns) for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 revealed the increase of oxygen vacancies concentration compared to V O -TiO 2 -500 ( 2 0.365 ns).It is worth noting that the increase of 2 was 86.1 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while it is 44.7 for V O -TiO 2 -500 compared with 1 , which means the generation of a huge number of boundarylike defects after Pt atoms loading 68 clearly related to the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies corresponding to theoretical calculation (see the Theoretical Calculation section). The surface chemical states and constituent elements of V O -TiO 2 -T (T 400, 500, 600 C) and 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 were analyzed by means of XPS technology and the results are described in Figure 5 to further expound the interaction between the oxygen vacancies and single Pt atom.The survey spectra presented in Figure 5a show that the Ti, O, and C elements from reference exist for all the samples.No signal corresponding to the Pt element is detected in the survey spectrum of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 because of the lower practical Pt loading.In the Ti 2p spectra (Figure 5b), compared to V O -TiO 2 -400 (Ti 2p 3/2 : 458.53 eV), the Ti 2p 3/2 peaks of V O -TiO 2 -500 (458.06 eV) and V O -TiO 2 -600 (458.14 eV) shift obviously to lower binding energies, which is closely connected to the generation of the more oxygen vacancy defects in the two samples, inducing a changed chemical environment of the titanium ions, as shown by the ESR results.Surprisingly, the distinct decrease and larger shift to a high binding energy were found for the 1 Pt-loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample.The similar changes were observed in O 1 s spectra of the 1 Pt loaded V O -TiO 2 -500 sample (Figure 5c).The peaks at 531.30 and 529.80 eV can be, respectively, indexed to the oxygen atoms in the neighborhood of oxygen vacancies and O bond of Ti-O-Ti. 21After loading single Pt atom, the O 1s peaks shift to high binding energies, accompanied by a sharp decrease in the peak intensity.This finding could be explained as follows: (i) the decreasing intensity of the Ti 2p peak and O 1s peak for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 is due to the Pt loading, which impairs the detection sensitivity of the instrument for Ti and O; (ii) the shifting of the binding energy values may be related to the strong single Pt atom-TiO 2 substrate interaction, which would anchor strongly single Pt atom on the TiO 2 surface to accumulate more electrons for the photocatalytic reaction because of the strong stabilizing ability resulting from vacancies.Nevertheless, except for the aforementioned change, careful study shows that the peak corresponding to the O atoms around the oxygen vacancy defects becomes more intense upon single Pt atom loading, and the integral-area ratios of the peak at 532.60 eV (O 1s peak for the oxygen vacancies) to the peak at 530.20 eV (O 1s peak for the lattice oxygen) were determined to be 0.35 for 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500, while this is 0.095, 0.081, and 0.092 for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600, respectively (Figure S8).This obviously suggested the increased content of oxygen vacancies The Journal of Physical Chemistry C F due to the interaction of the atomically dispersed Pt and oxygen vacancies promoting to generate more oxygen vacancy defects on the surface/subsurface of the catalyst by strongly decreasing the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, corresponding to ESR, PALS, and the theoretical calculation results (see the Theoretical Calculation section). 37In Figure 5d, the typical XPS spectra of Pt 4f centered at 70.26 and 73.90 eV showed the Pt metallic state.Moreover, the two peaks located at 72.60 and 75.60 eV indicates of the presence of platinum oxide. 69igure 6a gives the absorbance versus wavelength plots of the P25, TAN, and V O -rich-TiO 2 -based samples.Compared to the TAN precursor material, the absorption of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples shifts to longer wavelength, obviously because of the influence of the oxygen vacancy formation.Nevertheless, the difference between the absorptions of the different V O -rich-TiO 2 samples with different oxygen vacancy concentrations is negligible and similar to that of P25, which indicates that no obvious visible light absorption is generated by the introduced oxygen vacancies in the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples, as reported by the literature. 21Additionally, the same conclusion could also be drawn based on the absorptions of the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples prepared with the different heat-treatment times (Figure S9).To get the effect of the isolated single Pt atom, the UV-vis absorption spectra of 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25-TiO 2 without oxygen vacancies were obtained.Surprisingly, after Pt atom loading, significant visible-light-driven absorption is found for the Pt-loaded V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which is associated with the interaction of single Pt atom and oxygen vacancies (Figure 6b). 37,38Nevertheless, almost no change is observed for the absorption of Pt-deposited P25 in comparison with that of the pristine P25 (the inset of Figure 6b).These findings show again that a strong interaction existed between single Pt atom and oxygen vacancy defects for the Pt atom-decorated V O -rich-TiO 2 sample, which corresponds to To study the dynamics of electron transfer on the interface of the catalysts, the transient I-t curves were measured with light-on and light-off cycles.As displayed in Figure 7a, the introduced oxygen vacancy defects brought about higher photocurrent values for all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, especially V O -TiO 2 -500 with a maximum photocurrent of 0.45 mA, which is almost 2.7 and 16 times as high as that of the P25 and TAN samples.This could occur because the formed oxygen vacancy defects captured electrons and thus suppressed the recombination of photoinduced charges. 70Figure 7b displays Nyquist curves with arc-like distribution patterns and the corresponding equivalent circuit.The smaller arc radius at a low frequency is usually connected to the charge migration at the interface of the semiconductor and in the electrolyte of the tested electrode. 71According to the radius of the Nyquist plots, the V O -rich TiO 2 samples exhibit a smaller charge transfer resistance (R3) compared with the TAN precursor, as shown by the I-t results.Among the samples, V O -TiO 2 -500 demonstrates the smallest charge transfer resistance than the other two V O -TiO 2 samples and P25 TiO 2 , meaning that the charge transportation at the interface is faster for V O -TiO 2 -500.Figure 7c presents the PL emission spectra of the as-obtained V O -rich TiO 2 samples using P25 and TAN as references at an excited wavelength of 400 nm to prove the improved separation efficiency of the e --h pairs upon introducing oxygen vacancies.The decay of the PL signals for all the V Orich TiO 2 catalysts is sharp in comparison with that of the P25 and TAN reference samples, indicating that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies significantly inhibited the annihilation of the photoinduced electrons and holes. 72The V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample shows the weakest PL emission, demonstrating the best carrier separation efficiency, which means that a more robust photocatalytic process can occur over it.However, introducing excess oxygen vacancies leads to an enhanced PL emission (such as V O -TiO 2 -600) because the excess O defects can be viewed as the recombination centers of the e --h pairs, which impacts the photoreactivity of the sample.Generally, the carrier density could affect the dynamic performance and photocatalytic activity of the catalysts.Therefore, the Mott-Schottky tests of P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 were performed to determine the different donor densities of the two photocatalysts, as described in Figure 7d.The two samples show typical characteristics of an n-type semiconductor with a positive slope.The donor density can be reflected by the magnitude of the slope, and the slope reduces with the increased donor density. 73In comparison with P25 TiO 2 , the much smaller slope of V O -TiO 2 -500 indicated a higher donor density originating from the contribution of oxygen vacancies formed by annealing the TANs, which would significantly promote the carrier transfer and photocatalytic activity. 3.2.Theoretical Calculations.The aforementioned experimental characterization results showed that a strong synergistic effect existed between the oxygen vacancies and loaded single Pt atom.To better understand such a mechanism, we studied the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with and without V O defects in the framework of the KS DFT.Therein, configurations where that V O s exist on the surface, subsurface, and inner layers are considered (Figure S10).When a Pt atom adsorbs on a clean A-TiO 2 (101) surface, O 2c -O 3c -O 2c site is the most favorable site (Figure 8a), as proved by many reports, 747576 so we adopt this model directly (Figure 8b).The calculated adsorption energy of the single Pt atom on the clean surface is -2.89 eV (Table 1).Meanwhile, on the A-TiO 2 (101) surface with different oxygen vacancy concentrations, the adsorption energy of the single Pt atom 1).In other words, a surface V O has an anchoring effect on the loaded Pt 1 , which is consistent with the previous study that surface defects can strongly affect the stability of single atom-catalyst. 76,77ven more fascinating is that the formation energy of the V O s obviously decreases upon loading with Pt, especially for surface and subsurface V O s.In the absence of Pt loading, the formation energies of the surface and subsurface O vacancies are 3.31 and 4.00 eV, respectively, and they decreased to1.92 and 3.46 eV after loading the single Pt atom on the surface of the catalyst (Table 1).Nevertheless, the deposited of the Pt atom seems to have no clear effect on the formation energies of the interior oxygen vacancies.These results indicated that, based on the formation energies, the loaded single Pt atom more strongly favors the formation of surface/subsurface oxygen vacancies than the V O s in the bulk as proved by the increased ESR signal over 1 Pt-V O -TiO 2 -500 (Figure 3b) and PALS (Figure 4). Generally, the formation of V O s generates extra electrons in TiO 2 nanomaterials, increasing the electron concentration, which favors the improved photocatalytic efficiency.However, note that the bulk and surface/subsurface V O s have different influences on the photoreactivity.In stark contrast to bulk V O s generally served as the charge carrier recombination centers, surface/subsurface V O s have proven to be helpful for the efficient separation of the photoinduced electron and hole pairs.The surface/subsurface V O s give rise to more donor electrons localized on the surface region, facilitating the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and thereby improving the photoactivity of the V O -rich TiO 2 samples. 26ccording to our experimental result, the sample that single Pt atom with more V O s showed higher activity.To further determine how surface vacancy interplay with Pt 1 and improve photocatalytic activity, we studied the charge distribution of the Pt/TiO 2 system.Based on our Bader charge analysis, when Pt 1 react with V O 1, it obtains 0.94 e, indicating charge transfers from the substrate to Pt atom.As a comparison, when Pt reacts with a clean surface or surface with inner V O s, it will lose charge, indicating charge will migrate from the Pt atom to substate.This point can also be supported by our charge density difference analysis (Figure S11).Hence, it is reasonable that for the Pt 1 /A-TiO 2 (101) system with surface V O s, such defect provides more electrons and thus increases the carrier concentration.These electrons may transfer quickly to the loaded single Pt atom, the photocatalytic active site, and participate in the photocatalytic reactions on the surface and, consequently, improve photocatalytic efficiency.The Journal of Physical Chemistry C pubs.acs.org/JPCCenhanced hydrogen production rates (667, 1077, and 651 mol h -1 , respectively, for V O -TiO 2 -400, V O -TiO 2 -500, and V O -TiO 2 -600) compared to the P25 (344 mol h -1 ) and TAN (239 mol h -1 ) samples without oxygen vacancies.The best H 2 -production rate of 1077 mol h -1 was obtained by V O -TiO 2 -500, which is approximately three times that of P25 (Figure 9a).It is unquestionably related to the contribution of the introduced oxygen vacancies, whose existence remarkably increases the donor density in the V O -rich TiO 2 samples, thereby promoting carrier transfer to the surface and causing more electrons to participate in the photocatalysis reaction under the same irradiation.The higher concentration of V O defects does not seem to be good for H 2 evolution because excess oxygen vacancies become recombination centers of e -h pairs, impairing the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. 72dditionally, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) was also measured and calculated according to similar photocatalytic reaction conditions by using a 365 nm UV light bandpass filter (see the Supporting Information).Specifically, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the V O -rich-TiO 2 -500 sample (21.7) was 3.14 times as high as that of P25 TiO 2 (6.9), implying that the oxygen vacancy defect-rich sample shows a better photocatalytic performance.To perform a systematic study, the effect of the pH, Pt deposition amount, and sacrificial agents on the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance was also studied.The maximal H 2 evolution rate was obtained at a pH 4.7 0.3 (Figure S12a).The excess deposition of Pt leads to the gradual deterioration of the hydrogen production rate, which may be due to more active surface sites covered by the Pt (Figure S12b). 22Using methyl alcohol as the electron donor, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 evolution from water was shown by the V O -rich-TiO 2 samples (Figure S12c).Figure 9b shows the photocatalytic stability of V O -TiO 2 -500 and P25, and the H 2 production by the two samples does not clearly decrease over four cycles, especially for V O -TiO 2 -500.The TON values have also been calculated to evaluate the long-term test stability of catalysts for H 2 production and the results are listed in the Supporting Information (Table S3).It should be noted that the TON of V O -TiO 2 -500 for H 2 evolution is clearly higher than that of P25 TiO 2 , suggesting that the obtained V O defect-rich TiO 2 sample in this work can serve as a practical photocatalyst to improve the photocatalytic H 2 generation activity.As increasing the annealing time, the attenuated photocatalytic H 2 formation rates may be related to the decreased V O concentration (Figure S12d). The gradually increasing emission of CO 2 into the atmosphere caused by burning fossil fuels generates problems of global warming for our society.The reduction of CO 2 with the aid of sunlight-driven photocatalysis technology not only leads to the decreased amount of CO 2 greenhouse gas, relieving global greenhouse effects but also converts CO 2 to value-added fuels, solving the energy problem. 78,79Therefore, we carried out the photoreduction test of CO 2 with H 2 O over the as-obtained catalysts using UV-vis light irradiation in pure water without any sacrificial agents to avoid interference, and the results are described in Figure 10.Clearly, the amounts of CH 4 and CO over all the V O -rich TiO 2 samples are significantly larger than those over the commercial P25 TiO 2 .In particular, V O -TiO 2 -500 exhibits the highest yields of CH 4 and CO with Pt single atoms loading as cocatalyst but without H 2 formation, which is almost 2.2 and 2.3 times higher than that achieved by P25 TiO 2 , respectively (Table S5).The higher selectivity for CH 4 than that of CO over all the catalysts is due to the Pt cocatalyst loading. 12Simultaneously, the AQE for CO 2 conversion has also been obtained.The AQE of the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst (V O -TiO 2 -500) is 0.064, which is almost 18-fold of commercial P25 TiO 2 .Figure 11 shows the cycle measurement results of the P25 TiO 2 and V O -TiO 2 -500 for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.During the four cycles, the generation rates of the CH 4 and CO did not show the obvious decrease, displaying a good stability for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and at the same time exhibiting a fascinating application potential for the photoconversion of CO 2 with H 2 O.The TON values of CO 2 photoreduction to generate CO and CH 4 have also been calculated (Table S4), in which the V O -TiO 2 -500 shows the clearly enhanced TON values compared to P25 TiO 2 for CO 2 photoreduction. CO 2 reduction to produce CH 4 is an eight-electron process, which requires gathering the more photogenerated charge carriers with a long lifetime. 80The Pt atom strongly anchored with the help of the large of oxygen vacancies can promote more electrons to accumulate on the surface of the catalyst, leading to a higher catalytic performance of the catalyst.In the work, without any sacrificial agents being added, CO 2 is the only carbon source.For it, control photocatalytic experiments were conducted under identical conditions but using N 2 as the carrier gas replacing CO 2 , in which no CO or CH 4 product could be detected, indicating that carbides in this experiment did not originate from carbon contamination.In addition, the theoretical calculation and experiment results show that CO 2 can be strongly adsorbed on V O existing on the TiO 2 surface and the activation barrier of CO 2 reduction can be greatly reduced. 81,82At the same time, the generated V O can be viewed as reactive sites to promote the activation of CO 2 to form CO 2 -, which could enhance the product rate of CO and The Journal of Physical Chemistry C CH 4 . 82The photoinduced holes in the VB can be oxidated by the adsorbed hydroxyl species to form O 2 . In a word, based on the abovementioned experimental and DFT calculation results, under the same Pt loading, the excellent photocatalytic H 2 production and CO 2 photoreduction performance shown by the V O defect-rich TiO 2 samples was undoubtedly related to the synergistic action of the O vacancies and isolated single Pt atom.The existence of surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies strongly anchored single Pt atom onto the surface of the catalyst, and in turn, the loaded single-atomic-site Pt bring about the generation of more surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies, as illustrated in Figures 3b,4 and Table S2, by decreasing the formation energy of an O vacancy on the surface and subsurface, according to the DFT calculation.While the existence of more oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 increased the donor density not only promoting the carrier transfer but also making more electrons accumulate in the sink provided by single Pt atom to participate in the photoreaction, thus promoting the photoactivity.The theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the O defects on the surface of TiO 2 favor the adsorption and activation of CO 2 by the strong actions with the O atoms of CO 2 and the effective generation of CO 2 intermediates, leading to the dissociation of CO 2 . 78,79The CO 2 adsorption measurements were therefore carried out under environmental conditions of 298 K at low pressure, as presented in Figure S13.These measurements show that the CO 2 adsorption capacity at 298 K and 1 atm (760 mmHg) over V O -TiO 2 -500 could reach 10.94 cm 3 /g, while that is 7.09 cm 3 /g over P25 TiO 2 .The abovementioned result indicates that the introduced V O defects endow our prepared TiO 2 sample with an enhanced CO 2 adsorption capacity, improving its photocatalytic activity.It is just derived from the synergistic effect of V O and loaded single Pt atom, the V O -rich TiO 2 catalyst obtained by us showed the enhanced H 2 product and CO 2 reduction performance."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "For H 2 evolution and CO 2 reduction, the photocatalytic reaction was typically performed by irradiating with UV-vis light for 5 h, and the gaseous product was analyzed at given time intervals (1 h) by gas chromatography (FULI 979011) equipped, respectively, with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector with high-purity N 2 as the carrier gas.", "context": "2.1.Synthesis of the Titanic Acid Nanotube Precursor and V O Defect-Rich TiO 2 .Typically, a 10 M NaOH solution (300 mL) and 3 g of P25 powder were used as the raw materials, and a suspension was achieved by heat-treating the raw materials at 150 C for 24 h in four 100 mL Teflon-sealed autoclaves. 47Cooling to room temperature, the achieved white production was washed using the high purity water to obtain a pH value of 7.0-8.0and was next dipped into hydrogen chloride solution (HCl, pH 1.0) to perform an ion exchange between Na and H and fabricate the titanic acid nanotubes.Subsequently, to remove Cl -, the precipitate was washed again with the high purity water and dried at vacuum room temperature.The final powder-like product was titanic acid nanotubes (abbreviated as TANs in the below section).The as-obtained TANs were well-distributed in a quartz boat and calcined in a static air atmosphere at 400, 500, 600, and 700 C for 2 h under a heating speed of 10 Cmin -1 .The prepared samples were named V O -TiO 2 -T (where T 400, 500, 600, and 700 C). 2.2.Deposition of the Pt Cocatalyst.Using H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O as precursors, the loading process of the Pt cocatalyst on TiO 2 -based samples was carried out by a photodeposition method.Briefly, taking 1 wt Pt loading for example, 0.5 g of TiO 2 sample was immersed in 100 mL of 2.57 10 -4 mol/L H 2 PtCl 6 /ethanol solution, in which ethanol was served as the electron donor.The suspension was illuminated with a 300 W Xe lamp for 1.5 h after adsorption in dark for 1 h.Whereafter, the sample was collected and washed repeatedly with the high pure water by filtration for about six times and then dried in vacuum at room temperature. 2.3.Photocatalyst Characterizations.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan) was employed to observe the morphologies and microstructure of the obtained samples.With the help of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, Cu K1), the crystalline phase of catalysts was characterized.A Raman spectrometer (Renishaw inVia) was used with a working power of 50 mW, an accumulation time of 30 s under 532 nm excitation wavelength. An ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with an Al K (h 1486.6eV) achromatic X-ray source was used to achieve X-ray photoelectron spectra of catalysts.Using BaSO 4 as the reference, the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of the as-fabricated catalysts were collected within range of 200--800 nm by a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV/vis spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere accessory.To research the separation efficiency of the photoinduced charge carriers, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-obtained photocatalysts were recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer (TU-1900, Beijing PuXi, China) under 380 nm excitation wavelength.By means of N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, the specific surface area (BET) values of the samples were obtained on a Quadrasorb SI-4 instrument.Elemental analysis of Pt in the catalysts were detected by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) by means of Optima 2100 DV.High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image was recorded by a JEM ARM-200F high resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV.CO 2 gas adsorption tests were performed under the environmental condition of 298 K at 1 atm pressure (ASAP 2020M C), and the pressure can be changed gradually with the gas flow rate.On a spectrometer (Bruker E500), ESR spectra of the catalysts were achieved under room temperature condition and in the air atmosphere to verify the existence of the oxygen vacancies. At room temperature, with the help of a coincidence spectrometer, PALS measurements were carried by an ORTEC-583 fast-fast coincident system having a 270 ps prompt time resolution full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the -ray resulting from a 60 Co source under experimental conditions.Before measurement, the powder-like catalysts needed to be pressed into a disk of 10.0 mm 1.0 mm.A 30 Ci positron source of 22 Na was used and put between the two same sample disks.The positron lifespan spectrum with 10 6 counts was split into several lifetime constituents via the PATFIT program. 2.4.Photoelectrochemical Performance Measurements.The electrochemical tests of the catalysts were performed on a electrochemical workstation (CHI660, Shanghai Chenhua, China) using a conventional threeelectrode system, where the as-deposited samples on the ITO substrate coated with the catalyst were served as the working electrode, a platinum wire and a standard calomel electrode separately acted as the counter electrode and the compared electrode, respectively.The electrolyte solution was Na 2 SO 3 (0.1 M), where it needed to be purged with high purity nitrogen at lowest 20 min before performing the electrochemical tests to eliminate oxygen. 2.5.Evaluation of the Photocatalytic H 2 Evolution and CO 2 Photoconversion Activity.The photocatalytic hydrogen production activity was assessed via an online photocatalytic evaluation system (Labsolar-6A, Perfectlight, China).A xenon lamp of 300 W (PLS-SXE300, Perfectlight, China) with a light intensity of 46 mW/cm 2 and an irradiation area of 19.625 cm 2 acted as the light source to initiate the photocatalytic reaction, and the illumination radiation distance was approximately 10 cm from the liquid level.In brief, 100 mg of freshly prepared Pt loaded catalyst powder was dispersed in a mixed liquor composed of 80 mL of deionized water and 20 mL of methanol used as the scavenger of h before the photocatalytic reaction.Similarly, for the CO 2 photoreduction, 0.1 g of the catalyst powder was dispersed into a reactor containing 100 mL of high-purity water without the use of a sacrificial agent.The high-pure CO 2 gas was bubbled through the solution at 80 kPa with continuous stirring three times to drive away the excess gas, and the final preservation of the 80 kPa CO 2 was used as a test.For H 2 evolution and CO 2 reduction, the photocatalytic reaction was typically performed by irradiating with UV-vis light for 5 h, and the gaseous product was analyzed at given time intervals (1 h) by gas chromatography (FULI 979011) equipped, respectively, with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector with high-purity N 2 as the carrier gas.The amount of the obtained products was determined according to the standard curves. 2.6.Computational Details.Using the generalized gradient approximation method, we carried out DFT calculations based on the Vienna Ab initio Simulation package code. 4849950 We used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional to deal with the exchange-correlation part of the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation. 51Core electrons was treated by the projector augmented wave pseudopotentials. 52The smooth parts of the wave functions are extended in plane waves with a kinetic energy cutoff of 480 eV.In addition, dipole corrections were applied to account for the coactions between the asymmetric slabs. 53,54he model of the (3 2) supercell of the stoichiometric anatase TiO 2 (101) surface consisting of five TiO 2 layers and 180 atoms was created by the optimized unit cell.Each The Journal of Physical Chemistry C supercell has a vacuum layer of 15 A to separate the slabs.During structural relaxation, for all the supercells, the bottom TiO 2 layer was frozen in its bulk positions to simulate a bulklike layer, while the top four layers were allowed to relax along with the surface Pt single atom.For all the relaxation calculations, only G-centered k-point mesh is adopted, which is proved to provide sufficient accuracy for this large supercell system 55 while for the computation of the density of states and other ground state properties, a denser k mesh sampling by 3 3 1 grids was used at the fully relaxed geometry.The energy convergence criterion for the geometry optimization was 10 -4 eV/A.The energy of the Pt single atom and an O 2 molecule were calculated by putting the Pt 1 or molecule inside a 1011 12 A 3 cubic box and by using (6 6 6) k-point sampling. To determine the binding strength between the single Pt atom and A-TiO 2 (101) surface, the adsorption energies can be determined as follows where E Pt 1 /TiO 2 , E TiO 2 , and E Pt 1 are the total energies of the Pt 1 / A-TiO 2 (101), A-TiO 2 (101), and Pt 1 single atom, respectively.The more negative the E(ads) is, the more stable the system should be; therefore, negative E(ads) indicates that the adsorption of single metal on the TiO 2 surface is thermodynamically favorable.The generation energy of an oxygen vacancy defect is defined as follows where E surf V O , E surf , and E O 2 are the total energy of the surface with a V O defect, without a V O defect, and for an O 2 molecule in a vacuum."}]}}
