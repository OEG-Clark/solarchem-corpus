To prepare Cu/TiO 2 catalysts with different Cu valences, the asprepared Cu/TiO 2 was in situ pretreated inside the DRIFT reaction cell (for investigation of CO 2 adsorption) or inside the photoreactor (for activity test of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O) at 220 C for 1.5 h with a flow of He (99.999, 120 ml/min) or H 2 (99.998, 35 ml/min).Bare TiO 2 samples were also pretreated under the same condition.It has been reported that inert gas (e.g., N 2 , Ar, He) treatment leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 and increases the number of electrons in shallow donor states and in the conduction band; each Cu 2 ion traps one of these electrons and converts to Cu ion 28.In a more reductive environment (i.e., H 2 ), the obtained Cu ions are possibly further reduced into Cu 0 13.Hence, our hypothesis was that the as-prepared (unpretreated) Cu/TiO 2 surface would be dominated by Cu 2 species, while He and H 2 pretreated Cu/TiO 2 dominated by Cu and Cu 0 , respectively.The thermal pretreatment may also result in the formation of V O /Ti 3 sites on TiO 2 and Cu/TiO 2 .The unpretreated and pretreated TiO 2 and Cu/TiO 2 samples were denoted as Ti(UP), Ti (He), Ti(H 2 ), xCu/Ti(UP), xCu/Ti (He) and xCu/Ti(H 2 ), respectively, where the x was the nominal atomic ratio of Cu to Ti, either 1 or 5, calculated from the Cu and Ti precursor molar concentrations. The surface area, pore size and pore volume of the unpretreated and pretreated 1Cu/Ti samples were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020). The crystal structures of the Cu/TiO 2 samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Scintag XDS 2000) using Cu K irradiation at 45 kV and a diffracted beam monochromator at 40 mA. The lattice structure of Cu/TiO 2 was visualized by phasecontrast high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) carried out with 300 keV electrons in a Hitachi H9000NAR instrument with 0.18 nm point and 0.11 nm lattice resolution.Amplitude contrast TEM images were used to obtain the information about the sizes and morphology. The valence state of Cu was identified by in situ XPS analysis, which was performed on a PHI 5000 Versaprobe system using monochromatic Al KR radiation (1486.6 eV).In the case of pretreated sample, the as-prepared Cu/TiO 2 was placed in the introduction chamber (IC), and then was transferred to the reaction chamber (RC) by a transfer rod.After degassing the RC, the samples were in situ pretreated by introducing He or H 2 into RC at the same conditions as previously described in Section 2.1.As the temperature was cooled down from 220 C to room temperature, the samples were transferred back to IC, and were degassed again to remove the adsorbed He or H 2 .Subsequently, the samples were transferred to the main chamber (MC) for XPS detection.For the unpretreated Cu/TiO 2 , the same procedure was performed but without the thermal pretreatment in the RC.All binding energies were referenced to the C 1 s peak at 284.6 eV. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the unpretreated and pretreated Cu/TiO 2 were obtained by a UV-visible spectrometer (Ocean Optics) using BaSO 4 as the background. All IR spectra presented in this work were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo Electron) equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled HgCdTe (MCT) detector.The spectra were displayed in absorbance units, and acquired with a resolution of 4 cm -1 , using 32 scans.The DRIFTS studies were performed in a Praying Mantis DRIFTS accessory and a reaction chamber (Harrick Scientific, HVC-DRP).The reaction cell is equipped with a heater and a temperature controller, as well as a sample cup in the center.The dome of the DRIFTS cell has two KBr windows allowing IR transmission and a third (quartz) window allowing transmission of irradiation introduced through a liquid light guide (Newport) that connects to a 150 W solar simulator. The state of Ti on the unpretreated and pretreated Cu/TiO 2 samples was identified by DRIFTS by examining the characteristic Ti-OH bonds.In addition to XPS analysis, in situ DRIFTS experiment was separately performed to confirm the valence of Cu by investigating the adsorption of CO, a probe molecule, on Cu/TiO 2 .He-pretreated Cu/TiO 2 samples were in situ prepared by first purging the DRIFTS chamber with He while ramping the temperature to 220 C at 5 C/min and then maintaining at 220 C for 1.5 h in He environment.H 2 -reduced Cu/TiO 2 was prepared in a similar manner, and immediately after H 2 treatment at 220 C for 1.5 h, a relatively high flow rate of He (100 ml/min) was used to purge the DRIFTS chamber to remove surface-adsorbed H 2 , if any, until the chamber was cooled down to room temperature.After that, 5CO balanced in He (Praxair) was introduced into the reaction cell at a rate of 4.0 ml/min at 15 C. IR spectra were recorded before and after the introduction of CO as the probe molecule. The in situ DRIFTS spectra of CO 2 adsorption and activation were recorded on the unpretreated and pretreated 1Cu/TiO 2 .In the case of 1Cu/Ti(UP), the sample was purged by He for 1 h at 25 C, and the background spectrum in the presence of the sample was collected.After that, 10CO 2 balanced in He (Praxair) passed through the chamber at 2.0 ml/min under photoillumination for 45 min.Meanwhile, the IR spectrum was recorded as a function of time.In the cases of 1Cu/Ti(He) and 1Cu/Ti(H 2 ), the same procedure was used except that the sample was undergone the previously described pretreatment process at 220 C and the DRIFTS reaction cell was allowed to cool down to 25 C before the IR spectra were taken. The experiments of CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O on unpretreated and pretreated TiO 2 and Cu/TiO 2 catalysts were carried out in a photoreactor system as described in our previous study 8.For each test, 50 mg of catalysts was used.For Ti(UP) and Cu/Ti(UP), CO 2 was continuously passed through a water bubbler to bring a mixed gas of CO 2 H 2 O into the photoreactor at a flow rate of 2 ml/min.Ti(He), Ti(H 2 ), Cu/Ti(He) and Cu/Ti(H 2 ) were in situ prepared by pretreating Ti(UP) and Cu/Ti(UP) in an He or H 2 environment in the photoreactor using a 250 W infrared lamp to heat up the reactor to 220 C.After thermal pretreatment, a mixed gas of CO 2 H 2 O at a relatively high flow rate (120 ml/min) was immediately introduced to purge the photoreactor until the reactor was cooled down to room temperature.This step was aimed to remove any surface-adsorbed H 2 from the thermal treatment process.Background measurement by the GC was conducted to verify no H 2 present in the gas phase.After that, the flow rate of CO 2 H 2 O gas was decreased to 2 ml/min for another hour before the photoillumination was turned on to initiate the photocatalytic reaction.A 150 W solar simulator (Oriel) was used as the light source, and the light intensity was about 90 mW/cm 2 in the range of 200-1000 nm.The gaseous products in the reactor effluent were continuously analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7890A) equipped with both a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID)."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "The various Cu/TiO 2 catalysts were tested in CO 2 photoreduction with water vapor under simulated solar irradiation, and their activities were in the order of as-prepared (unpretreated) He-pretreated H 2 -pretreated.", "context": "The incorporation of Cu species in TiO 2 photocatalysts is critical in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to fuels, but the effect of Cu valence is poorly understood.In this work, Cu/TiO 2 (P25) nanoparticle catalysts were prepared by a simple precipitation and calcination method.The as-prepared Cu/TiO 2 sample was dominated by Cu 2 species.Thermal pretreatment of the as-prepared samples in He and H 2 atmosphere resulted in the transition to a surface dominated by Cu and mixed Cu /Cu 0 , respectively, confirmed by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analyses.These thermal pretreatments in reducing atmospheres also induced the formation of defect sites such as oxygen vacancies and Ti 3 .The various Cu/TiO 2 catalysts were tested in CO 2 photoreduction with water vapor under simulated solar irradiation, and their activities were in the order of as-prepared (unpretreated) He-pretreated H 2 -pretreated.Compared with unpretreated TiO 2 (P25), the H 2 -pretreated Cu/TiO 2 demonstrated a 10-fold and 189-fold enhancement in the production of CO and CH 4 , respectively.This significant enhancement was mainly attributed to the synergy of the following two factors: (1) the formation of surface defect sites promoting CO 2 adsorption and subsequent charge transfer to the adsorbed CO 2 ;
