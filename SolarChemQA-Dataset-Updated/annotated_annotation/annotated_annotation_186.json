XRD patterns of ZnS, Ni-doped ZnS and NiS loaded ZnS, synthesized by hydrothermal method using TAA as the sulfur source, were depicted in Fig. 1b.Obviously, the diffraction peaks for the three samples matched well with the cubic zinc blende structure of ZnS with lattice constants a 5.406 A and b 5.406 A (JCPDS No. 05-0566).The peaks were much sharper and smoother than that of ZnS-P or ZnS-I, which indicated samples synthesized by hydrothermal method had good crystalline structure.Fig. 1c displayed the enlarged (1 1 1) diffraction peak for the above three catalysts.Notably, the peak position of 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS was slightly left-shifted compared to undoped ZnS, which might be ascribed to that Ni 2 inserted into the structure of ZnS and located at interstices or occupied some of the lattice sites of ZnS because the effective ionic radius of Ni 2 (0.69 A) 25 was smaller than that of Zn 2 (0.74 A) 26.Interestingly, the peak position of 0.3 wt NiS loaded ZnS was similar to that of pure ZnS, suggesting that only Ni 2 incorporated into the ZnS lattice could result in its lattice change.Other photocatalysts prepared by hydrothermal method had XRD patterns similar to that of Fig. 1b, and the average crystallite sizes were further estimated based on the broadening of the (1 1 1) diffraction peak using the Scherrer equation (see Table 1). BET gas sorptometry measurements were conducted to examine the porous nature of samples.Fig. 2 showed nitrogen sorption hysteresis and the corresponding pore size distribution curve (inset) for the ZnS-I sample.The isotherms exhibited type IV, which was characteristic of mesoporous materials.The pore size distribution curve calculated from the desorption branch by the BJH method indicated a number of pores about 3.4 nm in the sample.The measured Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) area for as-prepared ZnS-I was 126.56 m 2 g A1 and the single-point total volume of pores at P/P 0 0.9618 was 0.55 cm 3 g A1 .These results manifested that ZnS-I had nanoporous and hollow nanostructures 23.BET surface areas of the as-prepared catalysts were summarized in Table 1. The UV-Vis diffuse absorption spectra for the pristine and Nidoped ZnS samples were shown in Fig. 3.It could be seen that 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS exhibited an enhanced absorption in the visible-light range except the UV light absorption band derived from ZnS.The impurity level of nickel (II) in the band structure of ZnS may show a visible light absorption band due to the transition from the Ni 3d level to the conduction band level of ZnS 19,21.However, the absorption resulted from impurity level by Ni 2 could not be found by our diffuse reflectance spectra, which might be attributed to the reason that the doping amount was very low and the doping occurred at the photocatalysts surface.A similar Volume adsorbed (cm 3 g -1 Relative pressure (P/P 0 ) Fig. 2.

The direct bandgap values of the pristine and 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS samples were estimated from the (ahm) 2 versus photon energy (hm) plot 12,14 as shown in the inset of Fig. 3.The bandgap values of other samples were estimated by the same method and the values were listed in Table 1.Fig. 4a and b presented the morphology of pure ZnS and 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS prepared by hydrothermal method recorded by SEM image.It could be seen that both catalysts consisted of nanosized crystallite particles, which was consistent with the calculated results by Scherrer equation.Furthermore, a large proportion of nanoparticles agglomerated into anomalistic particles without uniform size.The addition of Ni almost did not change the morphology of ZnS.The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectrum of 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS was shown in Fig. 4c.The actual Ni content of Ni-doped ZnS from EDS analysis was listed in Table 1. The average formation rates of methyl formate on ZnS prepared via the different methods for photocatalytically reducing CO 2 in methanol under UV irradiation were compared in Fig. 5.It could be found out that ZnS prepared by precipitation and ion-exchange methods using Na 2 S as sulfur source displayed low photocatalytic activities, while ZnS prepared by hydrothermal method showed excellent activities.Moreover, the activity increased rapidly with the increasing hydrothermal time to maximum of 87.6 lmol g A1h A1 at 24 h, but the activity decreased with further increase of hydrothermal time. Since the photocatalytic formation of methyl formate from CO 2 and methanol was a complicated reaction, its activity depended on many factors, such as preparation process, surface area, crystallinity and doping concentration.As could be seen from the XRD results shown in Fig. 1, ZnS prepared by precipitation and ionexchange methods mainly existed in hexagonal ZnS phase and had lower crystallinity than ZnS prepared by hydrothermal method which existed in cubic zinc blende phase.In addition, with increasing hydrothermal time, the crystallization was enhanced and the crystallites grew 28.Bad crystallization could lead to grain boundary, where recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes was easy to occur 29.Thereby, ZnS prepared by hydrothermal method showed higher activities and the activity was enhanced with an increase in hydrothermal time.However, for the hydrothermal time from 24 to 36 h, the increase in the hydrothermal time led to more agglomeration and smaller specific surface area (see Table 1), contributing to the decrease of photocatalytic activity of ZnS-H36.It was worth noting that the photocatalytic activity of ZnS-I with high BET surface area was inferior to that of ZnS-H24 with low BET surface area, indicating that nanoporous or hollow nanostructure was not significant for photocatalytic activity in present study.These observations suggested that the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction in methanol mainly depended on crystalline structure.Fig. 6 showed the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction in methanol over ZnS with various Ni 2 doping under irradiation, as well as NiS loaded ZnS for comparison.Remarkably, 0.3 wt Nidoped ZnS demonstrated the highest activity of methyl formate formation and the corresponding methyl formate evolution rate reached 121.4 lmol g A1 h A1 .The activity was visibly enhanced compared with non-doped ZnS, but when the Ni 2 doped content increased to 0.5 wt, the activity became lower.The above results suggested that suitable incorporation of Ni 2 could improve the photocatalytic activity of ZnS.This was ascribed to that doped Ni 2 could act as a temporary trapping site of photoinduced electrons and greatly suppressed the recombination of electronAhole pairs on the surface of the photocatalyst 21,30.However, the relatively high doping concentrations of Ni 2 might become the recombination center of photogenerated carriers, resulting in a decrease of photocatalytic efficiency 25,31.For comparison, the photocatalytic activity over 0.3 wt NiS loaded ZnS was also evaluated.Apparently, the photocatalytic activity of 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS was almost four times that of 0.3 wt NiS loaded ZnS, which indicated again that it was Ni 2 entering the ZnS lattice that possessed the enhanced photocatalytic activity.The NiS on ZnS surface could shield the incident light and facilitate charge recombination because their unmatched energy levels, which resulted in the significant reduction of the photocatalytic activity.Ag 2 S, CuS and Bi 2 S 3 loaded ZnS were also prepared, respectively, and all of them had lower photocatalytic activity than ZnS. It is difficult to directly compare the methyl formate production rate of our catalysts with the rates reported for other TiO 2 -based photocatalysts because of the variance in experimental conditions and specific products.However, the catalytic performance of 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS is comparable to, and perhaps better than, other reported TiO 2 -based catalysts.Dimitrijevic et al. reported a production of only CH 4 about 0.37 lmol g A1 after 4 h photoreaction on a TiO 2 -P25 sample 2.Liu et al. reported the overall production of CO and CH 4 on brookite and anatase polymorphs of TiO 2 was 18.9 and 12.8 lmol g A1 for a period of 6 h photoillumination, respectively 32.It is well known that metal sulfide photocatalysts are unstable because of photocorrosion 33,34.However, the durability of metal sulfide with foreign metal doping was confirmed experimentally by previous works 21,25,27, indicating that the Ni-doped ZnS photocatalysts were photostable and not photocorroded during the photocatalytic reaction.The time course of methyl formate production over 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS was studied and the photocatalyst was recovered every 6 h.As shown in Fig. 7, the reaction showed comparatively good reproducibility and consistency in three consecutive repeated runs of accumulatively 18 h, indicating that the catalyst was stable during the photocatalytic reaction. ZnS had a good reduction potential for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into formic acid and formaldehyde 15.Additional control experiment, in which CO 2 was reduced over 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS in the present of water, was performed.It turned out that formic acid and formaldehyde were produced in aqueous solution.However, the yields of products were very low because of the low solubility of CO 2 in water at neutral pH and poor reducibility of water.In this study, methanol was used as reductant for the photoreduction of CO 2 owing to its stronger reducibility for balancing the hole on valance band and solubility for concentrating CO 2 .When ZnS absorbed light, the electron in the valence band (VB) was excited to the conduction band (CB), where CO 2 or intermediate molecules adsorbed were reduced.Meanwhile, a hole on valence band oxidized a methanol molecule to produce a CH 2 OH and a proton (H ).Then the proton moved to conduction band and combined with reduced CO 2 to form formic acid and formaldehyde.The methyl formate could be produced through the esterification of formic acid and methanol, as well as dimerization of formaldehyde via Tishchenko reaction 22,35.The characteristic absorbance peaks of formic acid and formaldehyde were observed in the reaction using on-line ReactIR.In addition, methyl formate was also formed from methanol in the absence of CO 2 .Methanol was dehydrogenated to ACH 2 OH and HCHO in the VB and the produced H was reduced to H 2 in the CB, and methyl formate was formed through dimerization of formaldehyde.According to additional isotopic labeling studies reported in the previous work 36, the bulk of MF was produced via CO 2 reduction rather than methanol oxidation.As a control experiment, methyl formate formation rate over catalysts was taken into account when CO 2 was replaced with N 2 .In this case, methyl formate formation rate over 0.3 wt 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.5 1.0 0.3 0 Ni-doped ZnS was 38.5 lmol g A1 h A1 , while that was 121.4 lmol g A1 h A1 in the presence of CO 2 , which demonstrated that the existence of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . To further confirm that CO 2 was reduced in our photocatalytic reaction, an on-line ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was employed to monitor CO 2 in reaction solution.The spectra region was between 650 and 3000 cm A1 , and spectra were collected every 1 min.In the FTIR spectra before ultraviolet illumination (Fig. 8a), CO 2 peak at 2343 cm A1 was observed apparently when methanol was saturated with CO 2 .An amplified plot of peak height at 2343 cm A1 versus reaction time was shown in Fig. 8b.Under UV-light illumination, the peak height decreased obviously and the downward trend disappeared as soon as the irradiation of light was turned off.Then a gradual decline appeared when the light was turned on again, which was well reproducible.The spectra demonstrated that CO 2 in solution was consumed.Furthermore, there appeared some absorption peaks between 1200 and 1950 cm A1 in the FTIR difference spectra (the spectrum of methanol was used as the background) after 6 h illumination.For formic acid, corresponding peaks were at 1380, 1565 and 1700 cm A1 , for formaldehyde at 1460 cm A1 , and for methyl formate at 1726 cm A1 ."}, {"llm generation": "Ni-doped ZnS", "source": "XRD patterns of ZnS, Ni-doped ZnS and NiS loaded ZnS, synthesized by hydrothermal method using TAA as the sulfur source, were depicted in Fig. 1b.", "context": "Fig. 1a showed XRD patterns of the photocatalysts prepared by precipitation and ion-exchange methods using Na 2 S as sulfur source.The three very broad diffraction peaks of both ZnS-P and ZnS-I could be indexed to hexagonal ZnS with lattice constants a 3.777 A and b 6.188A (JCPDS No. 80-0007) 7.This result demonstrated that simple precipitation and ion-exchange methods could produce high-temperature-stable hexagonal ZnS phase, although the diffraction peaks were very broad.The average grain sizes, calculated using Debye-Scherrer formula on the basis of the broadening of the (0 0 2) diffraction peak, were 2.5 nm for ZnS-P and 3.5 nm for ZnS-I, respectively.

Since the photocatalytic formation of methyl formate from CO 2 and methanol was a complicated reaction, its activity depended on many factors, such as preparation process, surface area, crystallinity and doping concentration.As could be seen from the XRD results shown in Fig. 1, ZnS prepared by precipitation and ionexchange methods mainly existed in hexagonal ZnS phase and had lower crystallinity than ZnS prepared by hydrothermal method which existed in cubic zinc blende phase.In addition, with increasing hydrothermal time, the crystallization was enhanced and the crystallites grew 28.Bad crystallization could lead to grain boundary, where recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes was easy to occur 29.Thereby, ZnS prepared by hydrothermal method showed higher activities and the activity was enhanced with an increase in hydrothermal time.However, for the hydrothermal time from 24 to 36 h, the increase in the hydrothermal time led to more agglomeration and smaller specific surface area (see Table 1), contributing to the decrease of photocatalytic activity of ZnS-H36.It was worth noting that the photocatalytic activity of ZnS-I with high BET surface area was inferior to that of ZnS-H24 with low BET surface area, indicating that nanoporous or hollow nanostructure was not significant for photocatalytic activity in present study.These observations suggested that the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction in methanol mainly depended on crystalline structure.Fig. 6 showed the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction in methanol over ZnS with various Ni 2 doping under irradiation, as well as NiS loaded ZnS for comparison.Remarkably, 0.3 wt Nidoped ZnS demonstrated the highest activity of methyl formate formation and the corresponding methyl formate evolution rate reached 121.4 lmol g A1 h A1 .The activity was visibly enhanced compared with non-doped ZnS, but when the Ni 2 doped content increased to 0.5 wt, the activity became lower.The above results suggested that suitable incorporation of Ni 2 could improve the photocatalytic activity of ZnS.This was ascribed to that doped Ni 2 could act as a temporary trapping site of photoinduced electrons and greatly suppressed the recombination of electronAhole pairs on the surface of the photocatalyst 21,30.However, the relatively high doping concentrations of Ni 2 might become the recombination center of photogenerated carriers, resulting in a decrease of photocatalytic efficiency 25,31.For comparison, the photocatalytic activity over 0.3 wt NiS loaded ZnS was also evaluated.Apparently, the photocatalytic activity of 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS was almost four times that of 0.3 wt NiS loaded ZnS, which indicated again that it was Ni 2 entering the ZnS lattice that possessed the enhanced photocatalytic activity.The NiS on ZnS surface could shield the incident light and facilitate charge recombination because their unmatched energy levels, which resulted in the significant reduction of the photocatalytic activity.Ag 2 S, CuS and Bi 2 S 3 loaded ZnS were also prepared, respectively, and all of them had lower photocatalytic activity than ZnS. It is difficult to directly compare the methyl formate production rate of our catalysts with the rates reported for other TiO 2 -based photocatalysts because of the variance in experimental conditions and specific products.However, the catalytic performance of 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS is comparable to, and perhaps better than, other reported TiO 2 -based catalysts.Dimitrijevic et al. reported a production of only CH 4 about 0.37 lmol g A1 after 4 h photoreaction on a TiO 2 -P25 sample 2.Liu et al. reported the overall production of CO and CH 4 on brookite and anatase polymorphs of TiO 2 was 18.9 and 12.8 lmol g A1 for a period of 6 h photoillumination, respectively 32.It is well known that metal sulfide photocatalysts are unstable because of photocorrosion 33,34.However, the durability of metal sulfide with foreign metal doping was confirmed experimentally by previous works 21,25,27, indicating that the Ni-doped ZnS photocatalysts were photostable and not photocorroded during the photocatalytic reaction.The time course of methyl formate production over 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS was studied and the photocatalyst was recovered every 6 h.As shown in Fig. 7, the reaction showed comparatively good reproducibility and consistency in three consecutive repeated runs of accumulatively 18 h, indicating that the catalyst was stable during the photocatalytic reaction. ZnS had a good reduction potential for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into formic acid and formaldehyde 15.Additional control experiment, in which CO 2 was reduced over 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS in the present of water, was performed.It turned out that formic acid and formaldehyde were produced in aqueous solution.However, the yields of products were very low because of the low solubility of CO 2 in water at neutral pH and poor reducibility of water.In this study, methanol was used as reductant for the photoreduction of CO 2 owing to its stronger reducibility for balancing the hole on valance band and solubility for concentrating CO 2 .When ZnS absorbed light, the electron in the valence band (VB) was excited to the conduction band (CB), where CO 2 or intermediate molecules adsorbed were reduced.Meanwhile, a hole on valence band oxidized a methanol molecule to produce a CH 2 OH and a proton (H ).Then the proton moved to conduction band and combined with reduced CO 2 to form formic acid and formaldehyde.The methyl formate could be produced through the esterification of formic acid and methanol, as well as dimerization of formaldehyde via Tishchenko reaction 22,35.The characteristic absorbance peaks of formic acid and formaldehyde were observed in the reaction using on-line ReactIR.In addition, methyl formate was also formed from methanol in the absence of CO 2 .Methanol was dehydrogenated to ACH 2 OH and HCHO in the VB and the produced H was reduced to H 2 in the CB, and methyl formate was formed through dimerization of formaldehyde.According to additional isotopic labeling studies reported in the previous work 36, the bulk of MF was produced via CO 2 reduction rather than methanol oxidation.As a control experiment, methyl formate formation rate over catalysts was taken into account when CO 2 was replaced with N 2 .In this case, methyl formate formation rate over 0.3 wt 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.5 1.0 0.3 0 Ni-doped ZnS was 38.5 lmol g A1 h A1 , while that was 121.4 lmol g A1 h A1 in the presence of CO 2 , which demonstrated that the existence of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . To further confirm that CO 2 was reduced in our photocatalytic reaction, an on-line ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was employed to monitor CO 2 in reaction solution.The spectra region was between 650 and 3000 cm A1 , and spectra were collected every 1 min.In the FTIR spectra before ultraviolet illumination (Fig. 8a), CO 2 peak at 2343 cm A1 was observed apparently when methanol was saturated with CO 2 .An amplified plot of peak height at 2343 cm A1 versus reaction time was shown in Fig. 8b.Under UV-light illumination, the peak height decreased obviously and the downward trend disappeared as soon as the irradiation of light was turned off.Then a gradual decline appeared when the light was turned on again, which was well reproducible.The spectra demonstrated that CO 2 in solution was consumed.Furthermore, there appeared some absorption peaks between 1200 and 1950 cm A1 in the FTIR difference spectra (the spectrum of methanol was used as the background) after 6 h illumination.For formic acid, corresponding peaks were at 1380, 1565 and 1700 cm A1 , for formaldehyde at 1460 cm A1 , and for methyl formate at 1726 cm A1 ."}, {"llm generation": "0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS", "source": "Remarkably, 0.3 wt Nidoped ZnS demonstrated the highest activity of methyl formate formation and the corresponding methyl formate evolution rate reached 121.4 lmol g A1 h A1 .", "context": "Fig. 1a showed XRD patterns of the photocatalysts prepared by precipitation and ion-exchange methods using Na 2 S as sulfur source.The three very broad diffraction peaks of both ZnS-P and ZnS-I could be indexed to hexagonal ZnS with lattice constants a 3.777 A and b 6.188A (JCPDS No. 80-0007) 7.This result demonstrated that simple precipitation and ion-exchange methods could produce high-temperature-stable hexagonal ZnS phase, although the diffraction peaks were very broad.The average grain sizes, calculated using Debye-Scherrer formula on the basis of the broadening of the (0 0 2) diffraction peak, were 2.5 nm for ZnS-P and 3.5 nm for ZnS-I, respectively. XRD patterns of ZnS, Ni-doped ZnS and NiS loaded ZnS, synthesized by hydrothermal method using TAA as the sulfur source, were depicted in Fig. 1b.Obviously, the diffraction peaks for the three samples matched well with the cubic zinc blende structure of ZnS with lattice constants a 5.406 A and b 5.406 A (JCPDS No. 05-0566).The peaks were much sharper and smoother than that of ZnS-P or ZnS-I, which indicated samples synthesized by hydrothermal method had good crystalline structure.Fig. 1c displayed the enlarged (1 1 1) diffraction peak for the above three catalysts.Notably, the peak position of 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS was slightly left-shifted compared to undoped ZnS, which might be ascribed to that Ni 2 inserted into the structure of ZnS and located at interstices or occupied some of the lattice sites of ZnS because the effective ionic radius of Ni 2 (0.69 A) 25 was smaller than that of Zn 2 (0.74 A) 26.Interestingly, the peak position of 0.3 wt NiS loaded ZnS was similar to that of pure ZnS, suggesting that only Ni 2 incorporated into the ZnS lattice could result in its lattice change.Other photocatalysts prepared by hydrothermal method had XRD patterns similar to that of Fig. 1b, and the average crystallite sizes were further estimated based on the broadening of the (1 1 1) diffraction peak using the Scherrer equation (see Table 1). BET gas sorptometry measurements were conducted to examine the porous nature of samples.Fig. 2 showed nitrogen sorption hysteresis and the corresponding pore size distribution curve (inset) for the ZnS-I sample.The isotherms exhibited type IV, which was characteristic of mesoporous materials.The pore size distribution curve calculated from the desorption branch by the BJH method indicated a number of pores about 3.4 nm in the sample.The measured Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) area for as-prepared ZnS-I was 126.56 m 2 g A1 and the single-point total volume of pores at P/P 0 0.9618 was 0.55 cm 3 g A1 .These results manifested that ZnS-I had nanoporous and hollow nanostructures 23.BET surface areas of the as-prepared catalysts were summarized in Table 1. The UV-Vis diffuse absorption spectra for the pristine and Nidoped ZnS samples were shown in Fig. 3.It could be seen that 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS exhibited an enhanced absorption in the visible-light range except the UV light absorption band derived from ZnS.The impurity level of nickel (II) in the band structure of ZnS may show a visible light absorption band due to the transition from the Ni 3d level to the conduction band level of ZnS 19,21.However, the absorption resulted from impurity level by Ni 2 could not be found by our diffuse reflectance spectra, which might be attributed to the reason that the doping amount was very low and the doping occurred at the photocatalysts surface.A similar Volume adsorbed (cm 3 g -1 Relative pressure (P/P 0 ) Fig. 2.

Preparation of ZnS by hydrothermal method included the following steps: 15 mmol Zn(NO 3 ) 2 A6H 2 O and 18 mmol thioacetamide were dissolved in 50 mL deionized water, and the solution was added into an autoclave with inert liner of PTFE, then the sealed autoclave was kept in an oven at 160 C for different reaction times.After cooling down, the precipitate separated by centrifugation was washed with water and ethanol for several times, and dried at 65 C for 6 h.The as-prepared samples were labeled as ZnS-H1, ZnS-H5, ZnS-H10, ZnS-H24 and ZnS-H36, for different reaction times of 1, 5, 10, 24 and 36 h, respectively.The ZnS samples prepared by the precipitation method and the ion-exchange method 23 were denoted as ZnS-P and ZnS-I, respectively.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-prepared photocatalysts were confirmed by a D/max-2500 diffractometer using Cu Ka irradiation.Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV-2550 instrument in wavelengths of 190-800 nm by using BaSO 4 as a reference.The crystallite morphologic micrograph and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) analysis were taken with a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with the Thermo Scientific energydispersion X-ray fluorescence analyzer.The BET specific surface was determined on the basis of N 2 adsorption data measured by a V-Sorb 2800P adsorption apparatus, and the pore size distribution plots were obtained by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) algorism.

The direct bandgap values of the pristine and 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS samples were estimated from the (ahm) 2 versus photon energy (hm) plot 12,14 as shown in the inset of Fig. 3.The bandgap values of other samples were estimated by the same method and the values were listed in Table 1.Fig. 4a and b presented the morphology of pure ZnS and 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS prepared by hydrothermal method recorded by SEM image.It could be seen that both catalysts consisted of nanosized crystallite particles, which was consistent with the calculated results by Scherrer equation.Furthermore, a large proportion of nanoparticles agglomerated into anomalistic particles without uniform size.The addition of Ni almost did not change the morphology of ZnS.The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectrum of 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS was shown in Fig. 4c.The actual Ni content of Ni-doped ZnS from EDS analysis was listed in Table 1. The average formation rates of methyl formate on ZnS prepared via the different methods for photocatalytically reducing CO 2 in methanol under UV irradiation were compared in Fig. 5.It could be found out that ZnS prepared by precipitation and ion-exchange methods using Na 2 S as sulfur source displayed low photocatalytic activities, while ZnS prepared by hydrothermal method showed excellent activities.Moreover, the activity increased rapidly with the increasing hydrothermal time to maximum of 87.6 lmol g A1h A1 at 24 h, but the activity decreased with further increase of hydrothermal time. Since the photocatalytic formation of methyl formate from CO 2 and methanol was a complicated reaction, its activity depended on many factors, such as preparation process, surface area, crystallinity and doping concentration.As could be seen from the XRD results shown in Fig. 1, ZnS prepared by precipitation and ionexchange methods mainly existed in hexagonal ZnS phase and had lower crystallinity than ZnS prepared by hydrothermal method which existed in cubic zinc blende phase.In addition, with increasing hydrothermal time, the crystallization was enhanced and the crystallites grew 28.Bad crystallization could lead to grain boundary, where recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes was easy to occur 29.Thereby, ZnS prepared by hydrothermal method showed higher activities and the activity was enhanced with an increase in hydrothermal time.However, for the hydrothermal time from 24 to 36 h, the increase in the hydrothermal time led to more agglomeration and smaller specific surface area (see Table 1), contributing to the decrease of photocatalytic activity of ZnS-H36.It was worth noting that the photocatalytic activity of ZnS-I with high BET surface area was inferior to that of ZnS-H24 with low BET surface area, indicating that nanoporous or hollow nanostructure was not significant for photocatalytic activity in present study.These observations suggested that the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction in methanol mainly depended on crystalline structure.Fig. 6 showed the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction in methanol over ZnS with various Ni 2 doping under irradiation, as well as NiS loaded ZnS for comparison.Remarkably, 0.3 wt Nidoped ZnS demonstrated the highest activity of methyl formate formation and the corresponding methyl formate evolution rate reached 121.4 lmol g A1 h A1 .The activity was visibly enhanced compared with non-doped ZnS, but when the Ni 2 doped content increased to 0.5 wt, the activity became lower.The above results suggested that suitable incorporation of Ni 2 could improve the photocatalytic activity of ZnS.This was ascribed to that doped Ni 2 could act as a temporary trapping site of photoinduced electrons and greatly suppressed the recombination of electronAhole pairs on the surface of the photocatalyst 21,30.However, the relatively high doping concentrations of Ni 2 might become the recombination center of photogenerated carriers, resulting in a decrease of photocatalytic efficiency 25,31.For comparison, the photocatalytic activity over 0.3 wt NiS loaded ZnS was also evaluated.Apparently, the photocatalytic activity of 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS was almost four times that of 0.3 wt NiS loaded ZnS, which indicated again that it was Ni 2 entering the ZnS lattice that possessed the enhanced photocatalytic activity.The NiS on ZnS surface could shield the incident light and facilitate charge recombination because their unmatched energy levels, which resulted in the significant reduction of the photocatalytic activity.Ag 2 S, CuS and Bi 2 S 3 loaded ZnS were also prepared, respectively, and all of them had lower photocatalytic activity than ZnS. It is difficult to directly compare the methyl formate production rate of our catalysts with the rates reported for other TiO 2 -based photocatalysts because of the variance in experimental conditions and specific products.However, the catalytic performance of 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS is comparable to, and perhaps better than, other reported TiO 2 -based catalysts.Dimitrijevic et al. reported a production of only CH 4 about 0.37 lmol g A1 after 4 h photoreaction on a TiO 2 -P25 sample 2.Liu et al. reported the overall production of CO and CH 4 on brookite and anatase polymorphs of TiO 2 was 18.9 and 12.8 lmol g A1 for a period of 6 h photoillumination, respectively 32.It is well known that metal sulfide photocatalysts are unstable because of photocorrosion 33,34.However, the durability of metal sulfide with foreign metal doping was confirmed experimentally by previous works 21,25,27, indicating that the Ni-doped ZnS photocatalysts were photostable and not photocorroded during the photocatalytic reaction.The time course of methyl formate production over 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS was studied and the photocatalyst was recovered every 6 h.As shown in Fig. 7, the reaction showed comparatively good reproducibility and consistency in three consecutive repeated runs of accumulatively 18 h, indicating that the catalyst was stable during the photocatalytic reaction. ZnS had a good reduction potential for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into formic acid and formaldehyde 15.Additional control experiment, in which CO 2 was reduced over 0.3 wt Ni-doped ZnS in the present of water, was performed.It turned out that formic acid and formaldehyde were produced in aqueous solution.However, the yields of products were very low because of the low solubility of CO 2 in water at neutral pH and poor reducibility of water.In this study, methanol was used as reductant for the photoreduction of CO 2 owing to its stronger reducibility for balancing the hole on valance band and solubility for concentrating CO 2 .When ZnS absorbed light, the electron in the valence band (VB) was excited to the conduction band (CB), where CO 2 or intermediate molecules adsorbed were reduced.Meanwhile, a hole on valence band oxidized a methanol molecule to produce a CH 2 OH and a proton (H ).Then the proton moved to conduction band and combined with reduced CO 2 to form formic acid and formaldehyde.The methyl formate could be produced through the esterification of formic acid and methanol, as well as dimerization of formaldehyde via Tishchenko reaction 22,35.The characteristic absorbance peaks of formic acid and formaldehyde were observed in the reaction using on-line ReactIR.In addition, methyl formate was also formed from methanol in the absence of CO 2 .Methanol was dehydrogenated to ACH 2 OH and HCHO in the VB and the produced H was reduced to H 2 in the CB, and methyl formate was formed through dimerization of formaldehyde.According to additional isotopic labeling studies reported in the previous work 36, the bulk of MF was produced via CO 2 reduction rather than methanol oxidation.As a control experiment, methyl formate formation rate over catalysts was taken into account when CO 2 was replaced with N 2 .In this case, methyl formate formation rate over 0.3 wt 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.5 1.0 0.3 0 Ni-doped ZnS was 38.5 lmol g A1 h A1 , while that was 121.4 lmol g A1 h A1 in the presence of CO 2 , which demonstrated that the existence of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . To further confirm that CO 2 was reduced in our photocatalytic reaction, an on-line ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was employed to monitor CO 2 in reaction solution.The spectra region was between 650 and 3000 cm A1 , and spectra were collected every 1 min.In the FTIR spectra before ultraviolet illumination (Fig. 8a), CO 2 peak at 2343 cm A1 was observed apparently when methanol was saturated with CO 2 .An amplified plot of peak height at 2343 cm A1 versus reaction time was shown in Fig. 8b.Under UV-light illumination, the peak height decreased obviously and the downward trend disappeared as soon as the irradiation of light was turned off.Then a gradual decline appeared when the light was turned on again, which was well reproducible.The spectra demonstrated that CO 2 in solution was consumed.Furthermore, there appeared some absorption peaks between 1200 and 1950 cm A1 in the FTIR difference spectra (the spectrum of methanol was used as the background) after 6 h illumination.For formic acid, corresponding peaks were at 1380, 1565 and 1700 cm A1 , for formaldehyde at 1460 cm A1 , and for methyl formate at 1726 cm A1 ."}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "Fig.3.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of (a) ZnS-H24 and (b) 0.3 wt Nidoped ZnS.", "context": "In the present study, the average formation rate of methyl formate was chosen to appraise the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction in methanol over ZnS and Ni-doped ZnS photocatalysts.
