A series of CN composites with different Pt content were synthesized using photo-deposition method, whereas platinum acetylacetonate (Pt (C 5 H 7 O 2 ) 2 ) was used as the Pt source.Initially, two different solutions of CN and Pt(C 5 H 7 O 2 ) 2 were prepared separately.In the first solution, 100 mg of CN powder was dissolved in 100 mL solution mixture of DI H 2 O methanol (8:2) whereas, an appropriate amount of Pt(C 5 H 7 O 2 ) 2 was dissolved in 20 mL methanol as the second solution.After 20 min ultrasonication of both solutions, the Pt(C 5 H 7 O 2 ) 2 solution (0.2 mg/mL) was added dropwise into CN solution under the magnetic string and ultra-sonicated for 20 min.Photo-deposition of Pt over CN was performed under the illumination of UV light for 10 h.The resulted product was then washed for several times and dried overnight at 80 C.Finally, the powder was calcined at 400 C for 2 h in air to obtain Pt deposited CN.Following the same procedure, different powders were prepared with various the Pt content (x), denoted by xPCN where x 1, 3 and 5 wt represent the content of Pt over CN sheets. Novel CZTS deposited 3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was synthesized using one pot hydrothermal method.Initially, 1 g of 3 wt PCN and 0.1 g of CZTS nanoparticles (10:1 by weight ratio) were dispersed in solution of DI H 2 O EtOH (2:1) and ultra-sonicated for 30 min.Subsequent, the suspension was shifted to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 200 C for 24 h.The resulted product was washed and dried at 100 C in an oven.Finally, the subsequent composite was calcined at 400 C for 2 h and the heterojunction photocatalyst and (named as CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst) was obtained.The synthesis process of heterojunction photocatalyst is illustrated in Fig. 1. The crystal structure was identified by using XRD on Rigaku D/max-2400 X-ray diffractometer, using Cu-K radiation ( 1.5418A).The surface morphology and elemental stoichiometry observations were performed using HITACHI S-4800 scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).The nanoscale morphology of the powder was studied by JEM-2100 F high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).The BET surface area and corresponding textural properties were investigated from N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms using V-SORB 2800 P BET analyzer.The adsorption isotherms of CO 2 were measured on ASAP 2020 adsorption volumetric analyzer, at 298 K in 0-1 bar.Prior to each adsorption measurement, samples were degassed under vacuum at 393 K for 2 h.The FTIR spectra of all samples were recorded with Nicolet 870 FTIR by KBr pellet method in the region 400 to 4000cm -1 .The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of all samples was measured on Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere while the absorption spectra were referenced to BaSO 4 .XPS spectra of the hybrid composite were analyzed on a PHI-5702 x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. All the PEC measurements were carried out on a CHI 660D conventional three-electrode electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, China) consisting of a prepared electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.For working electrode, a homogeneous slurry was formed by mixing the catalysts powder (5 mg), carboxymethyl cellulose (1.5 wt ) and ethanol (0.5 mL).The resulting slurry was coated on a 1 1 cm 2 fluorinated-tin-oxide (FTO) glass substrate by the doctor-blade method and dried in air at 100 C for 30 min, while 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution was employed as electrolyte. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed according to our previous report 21.Briefly, the gas-phase CO 2 reduction was carried out in a lab built stainless-steel cylindrical reactor (total volume of 213 cm 3 ) with a quartz window at top, while high purity CO 2 (air products, 99.99 ) and H 2 O were employed as carbon source and reducing reagent, respectively (supporting information, Fig. S1).First, photocatalyst powder (0.1 g) was uniformly dispersed on a quart plate with an area of 53 cm 2 and placed in the reactor.The assembled reactor was replenished with pure CO 2 several times and vacuumed.Prior to photo-illumination, the CO 2 gas regulated by mass flow controller (MFC) was continuously purged through water bubbler (H 2 O/CO 2 vapor ratio 3.8 vol.) and resulting vapor mixture of CO 2 H 2 O was injected in the assembled reactor at 100 mL/min to saturate the catalyst.Later, the flow rate of CO 2 H 2 O vapor mixture was stabilized at 5.0 mL/min and the experiment was started by turning on a 400 W xenon solar lamp with 420 nm cut-off filter.The gaseous products (CO and CH 4 ) were taken regularly throughout for 8 h and analyzed by an Agilent GC-6890 N gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), serially connected with a capillary column (60 m 0.25 mm 0.25 m, Agilent JW Sci.USA).Helium was used as gas carrier with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.Furthermore, several blank experiments in dark and in the absence of CO 2 reagent were also carried out and pure N 2 with H 2 O vapors were used as a substitute for CO 2 H 2 O vapor.The stability of the photocatalysts was evaluated by repeating the same process for four times after each 1 h illumination without opening the photo-reactor during illumination.The photocatalytic products evolution during photocatalytic reaction were analyzed by FID as per standard curves.Prior to each experiment, the calibration with certified calibration gases was performed.In addition, the isotope tracer experiments using 13 CO 2 were performed on an Agilent MS-5973 GC-mass spectroscopy to verify the source of photocatalytic products.The selectivity of the photocatalytic products (CO and CH 4 ) was estimated with the following equations 6: (1) While, the apparent quantum yield of photocatalytic products (CO and CH 4 ) were calculated with the following equations:"}, {"llm generation": "3 wt PCN", "source": "In addition, the best photocatalytic performance was shown by 3 wt PCN (Fig. 11), Therefore, the CZTS nanoparticles were further loaded on the 3 wt PCN sample.", "context": "The crystalline phase and structural features of all samples were investigated by XRD and shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen the pristine CN showed two characteristic peaks centered at 12.92and 27.36, corresponding to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) plane of CN (JCPDS 87-1526).The lower characteristic peak centered at 13.1attributes the interlayer stacking of aromatic system, while the intense peak centered at 27.41a ttributes the in-plane periodicity distance of heptazine units 14,30.In the XRD patterns of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), no obvious diffraction peak of Pt was observed, which may be due to low content and uniform dispersion of Pt over the CN sheets (Fig. 2(a)).Besides, this could also be due to electronic synergetic effect and formation of perfect alloy leading to the reduction of the (111) plane of Pt.Furthermore, a small decrease in intensity with a slight shift in the peak at 27.36t owards a higher degree was observed owing to introduction of Pt nanoparticles.This is probably due to a distortion in the CN layer structure as a consequence of Pt nanoparticles addition.Besides that, no significant change in crystal structure was observed.In addition, the best photocatalytic performance was shown by 3 wt PCN (Fig. 11), Therefore, the CZTS nanoparticles were further loaded on the 3 wt PCN sample.As can see in Fig. 2(b), the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the diffraction peaks centered at 28.6, 31.7,48.34and 56.15, which can be well indexed to (1 1 2), ( 200), ( 220) and (312) planes corresponding to kesterite structure of CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575), reflecting the coexistence of both phases, CZTS and CN, attributing to successful hybridization of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.Notably, narrow diffraction peaks corresponding to (002) plane of interplanar stacking and (112) plane of kesterite CZTS are attributing a large crystallite size of the hybrid composite 31.In addition, the XRD results suggest that the synthesized samples mainly contain graphitic carbon nitride.The average crystallite sizes of all samples are calculated by Scherrer equation: where D, k, , , and B represent average crystallite size (nm), crystallite shape factor (0.9), X-ray wavelength (Cu K 1.5418A), the full-width at half maximum intensity in XRD (red), and brag's angle, respectively.The calculated average crystallite size of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt) and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst vary in the range of 8.57-18.39nm, see Table 1.The increase of average crystallite size can be attributed to the annealing temperature effect on the crystallite size, which leads to aggregation of particles 31,32.It is well-known that the smaller crystallite size (and thus, higher surface area) is associated with improvement in reaction of gaseous molecules on the surface owing to plentiful active sites, which further improves the photocatalytic performance of a potential photocatalyst by higher separation and rapid charge transfer of photoinduced charge carrier to the semiconductor interface 33.The XRD pattern of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The surface morphology and microstructure of all samples characterized by employing SEM and TEM are presented in Fig. 3.The pristine CN shows thick and irregular 2D nanosheet-like structure with a considerably large size (Fig. 3(a)), whereas the CZTS nanoparticles are comprised of flower-like agglomerates that have been composed of a large number of nanoplates with a size in the range of 100-150 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(b).The xPCN composites exhibit stacked, curly, twodimensional (2D) nanosheet-like structure with a particle size of several nanometers, different from pristine CN consisted of solid agglomerates (Fig. 3(c-e)).In addition, Pt nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of CN nanosheets and no obvious variation in surface morphology of Pt-integrated composites is observed with the increasing amount of Pt content.In the case of CZTS loaded 3 wt PCN, the hybrid composite is irregularly agglomerated having approximately spherical particles with an average diameter of tens to hundreds of nanometer, as shown in Fig. 3(f).Furthermore, the hybrid composite has clear incorporation and coating of flower-like CZTS nanoparticles on the 3 wt PCN nanosheets, which is confirmed by the EDS and elemental mapping.Fig. 3(g) show the EDS spectra, whereas the elemental mapping of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst confirms that the hybrid composite is composed of C, N, Pt, Cu, Zn, Sn, and S elements.Furthermore, Pt and CZTS nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of CN nanosheets (Fig. 3(h)). The TEM and High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst are presented in Fig. 4. The TEM image in Fig. 4(a) shows that the CN has fibrous and porous structure of thin sheet.From HRTEM image of 3 wt PCN in Fig. 4(a), Pt nanoparticles can be clearly distinguished with lattice spacing determined as 0.22 nm, belonging to (111) plan of metallic Pt.On the other hand, Fig. 4(b and b) confirm the flower-like structure with a lattice spacing of 0.313 nm indexed to (112) plane of kesterite CZTS nanoparticles.As shown in Fig. 4(c), the CN exhibits the fibrous and sheet-like morphology that acts as substrate for deposition of Pt and CZTS nanoparticles, while the dark parts located on the layered structure are assigned to CZTS nanoparticles having an obvious agglomeration.Furthermore, the TEM confirms the random distribution of Pt nanoparticles with particle size of less the 10 nm, decorated over the CN sheets.The HRTEM further shows the lattice fringe of hybrid composite with lattice spacing of 0.32 nm, suggesting that the sample is mainly CN.The lattice spacing of 0.22 nm and 0.31 nm can be well-indexed to (111) plan of metallic Pt, and (112) plane to kesterite CZTS nanoparticles, respectively (Fig. 4(c)).Moreover, the closely bounded lattice fringes attribute to the existence of intimate interface (shown by white dotted line) between 3 wt PCN and CZTS nanoparticles which could leads to effective interfacial transfer of photoinduced charge carrier transfer between CZTS nanoparticles and 3 wt PCN and hinder the probability of charge recombination over the surface of photocatalyst, thus to improve the photocatalytic performance. The FTIR spectroscopy was employed to characterize the functional groups, organic, inorganic species and related inter-and intra-bonding present in the CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, see presented in Fig. 5(a).All samples show a common intense band in the range of 3000-3500 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the stretching modes of residual primary, secondary amine groups and OeH stretching modes of adsorbed water 5,30.A series of peaks located between 1200-1700 cm -1 are associated with sp 3 CeN breathing modes and sp 2 CN stretching vibrations in heterocycles 343536.For all samples, the band appeared around 809-813 cm -1 is related to typical breathing mode of the triazine unit, whereas the characteristic peak around 887 cm -1 is attributed to NeH deformation modes 5,35.Moreover, the FTIR spectrum of hybrid composite shows some peaks emerging around 439, 1090 and 1735 cm -1 , which could be assigned to the stretching mode of ZneN, CS and CO bands, respectively, corresponding to the presence of CZTS in the composite 11,37,38.According to FTIR results, it has been found that after Pt and CZTS nanoparticles loading over CN, no significant damage in the basic carbon nitride structural framework was observed by either nanostructural design or surface modification, ascribing that the present CZTS and Pt modified counterpart were graphitic phase, agreeing with the previous XRD results 22,30.The FTIR spectra of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was employed to study the optical properties of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt ), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the pristine CN shows an absorption edge located around 450 nm with an estimated bandgap of 2.8 eV, consistent with previously reported value 13,14,39.After photo-deposition with Pt nanoparticles with different wt, the PCN samples exhibit a reasonably enhanced visible absorption, which may be attributed to Schottky junction across CN/Pt and surface-plasmon-resonance (SPR) effect of Pt, which is resulted from the interaction between the photons with photo-excited electrons on the Pt surface 25,40.No notable shift in absorption edges of the composites was observed, suggesting that Pt only deposits on the surface of CN instead of being incorporated into the lattice of CN, which is in good agreement with the XRD results.The combination of CZTS and 3 wt PCN shows a significantly enhanced visible absorption in the whole visible region, which means enhanced visible light absorption results in more electron-hole pairs generation, which is beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance 21.The DRS spectra of CZTS and absorbance spectra of Pt nanoparticles are displayed in supporting information (Fig. S3).The obtained results demonstrate that the encapsulation of CZTS nanoparticles can extend the optical absorption range of 3 wt PCN composite and Pt nanoparticles could facilitate the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers across CN and CZTS to their surfaces for photoreduction of CO 2 . Estimation of the conduction band potential (CBP) and valance band potential (VBP) is vibrant to understand the underlying mechanism of photoinduced charge transfer and separation in a potential photocatalytic composite for photocatalytic reaction.The CBP and VBP of CN and CZTS are calculated using the following equations 39, where E VB , E CB , X, E C and E g are conduction band potential, valance band potential, electronegativity (X CN 6.39 eV and X CZTS 4.80 eV), the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale (4.5 eV) and bandgap of semiconductors (2.8 eV of CN and 1.52 eV for CZTS), respectively.The estimated VBP of CN and CZTS are 1.51 and 1.06 eV, respectively.The calculated CBP of CN and CZTS are -1.22 and -0.46 eV, respectively.The calculated band potentials suggest a type I heterojunction, which is that the CBP and VBP of the CZTS in straddling alignment with the CN, is formed in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst. The schematic illustration of band structures of CN and CZTS is presented in Fig. 6(a).The Fermi level of CN and CZTS straddles the Fermi level of platinum at 0.66 eV.This allows band structure bending at the interfaces of CN-Pt and Pt-CZTS, which makes the migration of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs more efficient.Fig. 6(b) shows that the CBP of CZTS is lower compared to the reduction potential of CO (-0.53 eV), suggesting that only CH 4 yield can instigated by the photoinduced electron.If the photoinduced electrons in CB of CN migrate to CB of CZTS following the conventional \"type-I heterojunction\", all the photoinduced electrons will be accumulated on CZTS.Subsequently, charge recombination rate will increase and thus, limit the photocatalytic efficiency together with no CO yield.As Pt works as a bridge to accelerate the charge transportation between CN and CZTS, the hybrid composite follows the \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. Fig. 7(a) exhibits N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.All three samples show the type IV isotherms with H 3 hysteresis loops, indicating that the samples have mesoporous structure.The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameters for all the samples are enlisted in Table 1.A BET surface area of 7.9 m 2 g -1 was obtained for pristine CN increased to 9.35 m 2 g -1 in PCN composite, while it was further increased to 28.68 m 2 g -1 in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.This three times increase in specific surface area of heterojunction photocatalyst is due to the introduction of high specific surface CZTS nanoparticles.The pore volumes of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were 0.041, 0.086 and 0.165 cm 3 g -1 , respectively.Thus, larger surface area may contribute to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the prepared sample 39.The BET isotherm of only CZTS is presented in supporting information (Fig. S4). It is known fact that the CO 2 adsorption onto the photocatalyst surface is prerequisites to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To optimize the adsorption capacity and stability, the adsorption configuration and adsorption strength of CO 2 are critical features, similar to the surface area 10,13.Typically, the CO 2 adsorption isotherms were used to analyze the CO 2 adsorption of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/ 3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 7(b).The results show that the pristine CN has a weak CO 2 adsorption capacity at a relative pressure of 1.The 3 wt PCN composite exhibited better CO 2 adsorption capacity then pristine CN under similar conditions.Since flower-like CZTS nanoparticles are more active which provide more sites for CO 2 adsorption to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As a result, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of PCN composite was further enhanced by CZTS incorporation.According to BET results, the 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst have the higher specific surface area and pore volume, and consequently, exhibit superior CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of pristine CN.Thus, a combination of textural and surface guest modification is an effective approach to improve the adsorption capability of CN-based photocatalyst 11.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of all samples are presented in Table 1. Generally, photoinduced charge recombination leads to PL spectral emission and therefore PL emission spectra are beneficial to understand the transfer, migration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers 41.The Photoluminescence emission (PL) was performed to study the photoinduced charge recombination rate, see Fig. 8(a).It can be seen that the pristine CN exhibits the highest PL intensity as a result of the charge carriers generation upon absorption of photons, which leads to instigate the photocatalytic activity 42.However, after photo-deposition of Pt nanoparticles, a significant decrease in PL intensity can be seen, much lower than pristine CN because charge separation efficiency is improved owing to the electron sink function of Pt nanoparticles.A significant decrease in PL intensity was observed by the hybrid composite compared to the other samples, indicating the higher number of electrons with the highest separation efficiency to perform the photoreduction of CO 2 . In order to further confirm the suppressed charge recombination by means of their emission lifetime, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was performed.Fig. 8(b) shows that all spectra exhibit a doubleexponential decay and that the CZ/3 wt PCN has slightly slower fluorescent decay kinetics than that of pristine CN.The average lifetime was calculated by the following equation. where 1 and 2 are the emission lifetime, A 1 and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.The average lifetimes values were 6.65 ns, 6.90 ns and 7.42 ns for pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, respectively, which suggested that owing to electron reservoir function of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles, the hybrid composite has slower PL decay with longer average lifetime than pristine CN.The slower PL decay is indicative of an increased number of charge carriers with a longer lifetime which in turn results in an improved accessibility of the charge carriers to the surface of the hybrid composite 6,43.The determined values support the PL results. In order to understand the photoinduced charge recombination and separation process in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, the photoelectrochemical properties were investigated through the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).It is well known that the increase in electrical conductivity of pristine CN could lead to improve the charge carrier density.Fig. 8(c) shows the transient photocurrent response of all samples under visible light illumination for several on-off cycles.It can be seen that the photocurrent response goes down to zero immediately once the light turns off and returns to a constant value when the light turns on again.In addition, the photocurrent response is reproducible under visible light illumination, which implies an efficient transfer of photoinduced electrons to the surface of the sample and generates photocurrent.Owing to its wide bandgap, relatively weakest photocurrent response was exhibited by the pristine CN.Furthermore, the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst sample showed the highest photocurrent response compared to those of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.The maximum photocurrent response of each cycle is nearly the same and stable under the visible light exposure.This suggest that the visible light activated CZTS leads to improve the light absorption, increases the charge collection efficiency whereas, Pt improves separation efficiency and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, which is in good agreement with the DRS and PL results. Typical EIS results as Nyquist plots of all three samples are shown in Fig. 8(d).In fact, the Nyquist impedance arc reflects a semicircle feature, indicating the charge transfer across the interface of electrode/ electrolyte 21.Besides, the semicircle with smaller diameter/radius attributes to the effective charge transfer and separation across the electrode/electrolyte interface 44.As can be seen from Fig. 8(d), the radius of Nyquist impedance arc of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is significantly smaller compared with those Nyquist impedance arcs of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.This indicates that the CZ/3 wt PCN heterostructure composite retains the fastest charge transfer rate with effective inhibition of charge recombination across CZTS, Pt and CN. To validate the interfacial properties, the PEC properties of CN, 3 wt PCN, CZTS and CZ/3 wt PCN electrodes were investigated by measuring the current-voltage (I-V) curves both in the dark and under visible light.As can see in Fig. 9(a), a small current observed in 3 wt PCN and CN under dark in a potential region of -4 V to 5 V.After visible light irradiation, an abrupt increase in photocurrent density in 3 wt PCN and CN was measured.In addition, the positive slopes may indicate that both CN and 3 wt PCN are n-type semiconductor 45,46.According to semiconductor theory, metal-semiconductor contacts lead to the creation of potential barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface, which could hinder the electron transfer between metal and semiconductor.Therefore, the Pt loading over CN anticipates a Schottky barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface.Similarly, a small current was measured in CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS in absence of light as can see in Fig. 9(b).Whereas, CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS show a significantly increased photocurrent density upon visible light irradiation.The current-voltage curves show that the devices work in nonohmic (Schottky) mode and approaching that of back to back diode, and ending with S-shape I-V curve 47.Fig. 9(b) exhibits a swift increase in current under light irradiation when compared to dark.This specifies that the addition of Pt and CZTS in CZ/3 wt PCN may improve the light absorption and in that way increases the current.Furthermore, a steady increase of the current with respect to the negative potential indicates the p-type character of CZTS 47,48. The chemical and electronic states of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst analyzed by XPS analysis are shown in Fig. 10.Typical survey spectra in Fig. 10(a 2 ), ascribing to the presence of Zn in 2 oxidation state.As for Sn 3d spectra (Fig. 10(d)), two peaks at 486.5 eV (Sn 3d 5/2 ) and 495 eV (Sn 3d 3/2 ), correspond the presence of Sn in 4 oxidation state.The S 2p spectra (Fig. 10(e)) shows the two characteristic peaks appeared at 160.5 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 161.7 eV (S 2p 1/2 ), indicative of the sulfur in the form of sulfide with -2 oxidation state.In Fig. 10(f), the C 1s region shows three deconvolution peaks appearing at 284.7 eV, 286.2 eV and 288 eV originated from sp3-bonded carbon C-NH 2 , graphitic CeC and sp 2 -bonded carbon of N-CN bonds, respectively.Deconvolution spectra of N 1s (Fig. 10(g)) exhibit three binding energies centered at 398.5 eV, 399.3 eV and 400.9 eV correspond to sp 2 hybridized N-containing aromatic ring (CeNC), sp 3 bonded N (N-C 3 ), and amino functional groups (N-NH x ), respectively.Fig. 10(h) shows the two binding energies located at 70.2 eV (Pt 4f 7/2 ) and 74.6 eV (Pt 4f 5/2 ), ascribing to the presence of Pt (II) 49.Generally, Pt 4f 7/2 binding energies corresponding to Pt, Pt 2 and Pt 4 are centered at 71.2 eV, 72.4 eV and 74.2 eV, respectively.In comparison with Pt, the corresponding binding energies of Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 in composite sample shifted towards lower binding energy in consequence of the strong metal carrier interaction led by the electron-transfer from CN to Pt (a strong metal support interaction (SMSI)) 50.In photocatalytic reaction, when CZ/3 wt PCN is used, Pt nanoparticles act as an electronshuttle mediator due to its excellent electrical conductivity favorable for charge transportation and improve the visible absorption properties owing to localized surface-plasmon-resonance (LSPR).The XPS spectra of CZTS (Fig. S5) is presented in supporting information. The gaseous products in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors (used as reduction reagent) over pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were evaluated and yield rates of CO (two-electron reduction product) and CH 4 (eight-electron reduction product) as main product under visible light illumination for 5 h are given in Fig. 11(a-c).The undesired H 2 yield was also observed due to water splitting.The CH 4 and H 2 yield rates increased more or less linearly at a constant rate, as can be seen in Fig. 11(a andc).On the other hand, the yield rate of CO was rapid in the first hour and then remained constant (Fig. 11(b)).According to time-dependent yield rates in 11(a-c), the average yield rates of gaseous products were evaluated and compared in Fig. 11(d).The pristine CN and CZTS exhibit relatively low CO/CH 4 yield rates of 5.238/ 1.431 mol g -1 h -1 and 0.799/0.615mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, owing to large surface area and higher photoinduced charge recombination rate.The crystalline and electronic structure of CN were tuned by altering the particle size of Pt nanoparticles.Generally, a decrease in particle size leads to an increase in low-coordinated surface sites 51.Furthermore, the size-dependent properties are also associated with metal oxidation states.Therefore, under the similar conditions, the CO and CH 4 yield rates of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt) were considerably enhanced and systematic studies show that 3 wt PCN exhibits the highest CO/CH 4 yield rates of 13.028/5.455mol g -1 h -1 under visible-light illumination, 2.48/3.81folds higher than pristine CN.The improved photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of 3 wt PCN composite can be ascribed to large specific surface area, localized surface-plasmon-resonance effect by of Pt, electron-sink function of Pt, the formation of Schottky barrier 25,40 and effective photoinduced charge separation.Interestingly, with visible light active CZTS encapsulation over 3 wt PCN composite, the CO/CH 4 yield rates were further enhanced, which were 3.31 and 5.56 folds higher than pristine CN.The CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the best photocatalytic performance: CO yield rate of 17.351 mol g -1 h -1 and CH 4 yield rate of 7.961 mol g -1 h -1 , several times higher than the yield rates of CO (5.238 mol g -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (1.431 mol g -1 h -1 ) by pristine CN, indicative of the superiority of the novel heterojunction photocatalyst in photoreduction of CO 2 .The significant enhancement in CO and CH 4 yield rates may be attributed to the synergistic effects of visible light active CZTS and Pt nanoparticles.The visible light activated CZTS has more active sites and shortened diffusion channel for charge transfer and separation which provides more active sites for CO 2 adsorption, whereas Pt nanoparticles accelerate the effective charge separation for the reductive reaction.Besides, the extended light absorption range, higher surface area, effective interfacial charge transfer and separation under visible light are key factors that are instigating the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 .In addition, the best H 2 yield rate of 147.231 mol g -1 h -1 by heterojunction photocatalyst was achieved, several times improved than pristine CN.The improved CO, CH 4 and H 2 yield rates by photocatalyst followed the order of CZ/3 wt PCN 3 wt PCN 5 wt PCN 1 wt PCN CN and can be attributed to higher surface area with multiple level porous structure, improved light absorption and electron-sink function by Pt nanoparticles which activate H 2 O whereas CN and CZTS intended to reduce the CO 2 .In addition, the photocatalytic performance of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was further compared with the previously reported results as illustrated in Table 2. Furthermore, three blank experiments and a 13 CO 2 -labeled isotopic experiment were also performed to verify that the CO and CH 4 were evolved only from CO 2 under following conditions: (i) under light irradiation, but without photocatalyst (ii) under dark with photocatalyst and (iii) under N 2 H 2 O vapors instead of CO 2 H 2 O vapors with photocatalyst.Almost zero yield of corresponding carbonaceous product was observed which indicates that CO and CH 4 are generated by CO 2 reduction over CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, suggesting that CO and CH 4 are mainly generated from CO 2 reduction.Besides, some other gaseous products like methanol (CH 3 OH) and formic acid (H 2 CO) were also detected on hybrid composite, yet their yield rates were relatively small. In addition, the stability of the heterojunction photocatalyst is evaluated within four consecutive cycles under the same conditions.After each test, the catalyst is refreshed and refreshed helium gas periodically replaced in each cycle.As shown in Fig. 12(a), no significant change in CO/CH 4 yield rates of the first and fourth cycle was observed, which indicates that CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst has excellent stability as it has the ability of CO 2 reduction after four cycles. In the isotopic experiment, the generated CO and CH 4 were analyzed by GC-MS and 13 CO 2 was used instead of 12 CO 2 , shown in Fig. S6 (supporting Information).According to the GC-MS spectra, the signals at m/z at 29 and 17 are indexed to 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , which further confirms that CO and CH 4 are produced from the CO 2 reduction on CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.According to Fig. 12(b), the CH 4 selectivity of all the samples is more than 50 in comparison with CO selectivity, attributing that the CH 4 is the main product evolving in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Furthermore, the apparent quantum yield based on the yield rates of carbonaceous products, CO and CH 4 over hybrid composite was calculated to be 0.408 and 0.749 , respectively, and the total AQY () was 1.157 for CO 2 conversion.The details of AQY () estimation of all samples are given in supporting information (Table S1). The structural changes and characteristics parameters of composite, before and after the photocatalytic reaction were studied by XRD and FTIR, respectively.As can be seen in Fig. 12(c), no significant phase decomposition in the XRD results of fresh and used CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was observed.Similarly, FTIR characteristics spectra peaks of fresh and used hybrid composite are almost same with a slight decline in absorption band intensities, ascribing to the trivial deactivation of functional sites of hybrid composite, as shown in Fig. 12(d).Thus, the heterojunction photocatalyst with sustained structure and functional groups attribute to its exceptional stability after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test. Based on the aforementioned results, a plausible underlying mechanism scheme of interfacial electron transfer in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is presented in Fig. 13.According to photoinduced charge transfer and separation (Eqs.6 and 7) of the photocatalytic composite, the CBP of CN (-1.22 eV) is higher compared to reduction potential of CH 4 (-0.24eV) and CO (-0.53 eV).On the other hand, the CBP of CZTS (-0.46 eV) is lower compared to reduction potential of CO (cannot proceed the CO yield by CO 2 reduction) and more negative than reduction potential of CH 4 5,48.While the VBP of both CN and CZTS is higher in comparison with the oxidation potential of H 2 O/O 2 52.Thus, the CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O into CO and CH 4 over the CN based catalysts is found to be thermodynamically feasible 53.Moreover, the DRS results reflect that the LSPR effects of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles can significantly enhance the visible absorption properties of hybrid composite.In addition, the plasmonic Pt nanoparticles supported over CN surface function as a charge transmission bridge and play a vital role in the electron exchange between CZTS and CN sheets. Since CZTS is a typical visible light photocatalyst and CN is partial visible light responsive photocatalyst, therefore both CZTS and CN can induce electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination.The interfacial electron transfer in underlying mechanism can follow a \"Type I heterojunction transfer\" or a \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. In \"Type I heterojunction transfer\", upon visible light illumination, the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs in CB and VB of CN will transfer to CB and VB of CZTS and the CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation would take place on the CB and VB of CZTS, respectively.Also, the CBP of CZTS is less negative than CO redox potential, only CH 4 would not be generated.As the matter of fact, all of the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination would be accumulated on the CZTS in the \"Type I heterojunction\" (Fig. 13), which does not improve the charge separation and also limits the photocatalytic efficiency.Thus \"Type I heterojunction\" mechanism is not feasible to explain the enhanced CH 4 yield rate. Beside, Z-scheme transfer mechanism is more appropriate to explain the enhanced solar to fuel conversion rate.Owing to higher work function ( Pt 5.56 eV), Pt nanoparticles has low Fermi level (E F 0.66 eV vs. NHE) and strong electron accepting ability for the photoinduced electrons.According to TEM analysis, the Pt nanoparticles are uniformly distributed over the CN sheets.As a result, the Pt nanoparticles work as a bridge to accept photoinduced electrons from CB of CZTS and holes from VB of CN, resulting in the formation of Z-scheme photocatalytic system.This improves the transmission of photoinduced charge and retain the stronger oxidationreduction abilities of the composite.Thus, owing to charge transmission bridge function of Pt, the accumulated electrons in CB of CN can strongly reduce CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes at the VB of CZTS participate in the oxidation of H 2 O into OH and H .Besides, the photoinduced electrons remaining in the CB of CZTS would directly participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and yield CH Eqs. ( 9) and (10) indicate the generation followed by trapping of photoinduced charge carriers by heterojunctions and Pt metal, consequently, increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.Eqs.(11) and (12) kinetically explain that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction takes place at CB and oxidation of H 2 O takes place at the VB by the activity of electrons and holes, respectively.Eqs. ( 13)- (15) show the generation of H 2, CO and CH 4 through the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Moreover, the Pt nanoparticles encapsulated over CN can store electron owing to its electron-sink feature, function as reduction active sites, which can suppress the photoinduced charge recombination rate, and the LSPR effect further helps to improve visible light adsorption and charge generation.Thus, the photocatalytic performance, particularly the yield of CH 4 is significantly improved because of enriched density of electrons on Pt.In general, the synergistic interaction of multiple charge-transfer channels comprising Z-scheme charge transfer, LSPR and electron sink effects of Pt nanoparticles that can together be responsible for an efficient photoinduced charge separation and surface site activation for CO 2 reduction, which ultimately improves the photocatalytic performance."}, {"llm generation": "CZTS nanoparticles", "source": "In addition, the best photocatalytic performance was shown by 3 wt PCN (Fig. 11), Therefore, the CZTS nanoparticles were further loaded on the 3 wt PCN sample.", "context": "The crystalline phase and structural features of all samples were investigated by XRD and shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen the pristine CN showed two characteristic peaks centered at 12.92and 27.36, corresponding to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) plane of CN (JCPDS 87-1526).The lower characteristic peak centered at 13.1attributes the interlayer stacking of aromatic system, while the intense peak centered at 27.41a ttributes the in-plane periodicity distance of heptazine units 14,30.In the XRD patterns of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), no obvious diffraction peak of Pt was observed, which may be due to low content and uniform dispersion of Pt over the CN sheets (Fig. 2(a)).Besides, this could also be due to electronic synergetic effect and formation of perfect alloy leading to the reduction of the (111) plane of Pt.Furthermore, a small decrease in intensity with a slight shift in the peak at 27.36t owards a higher degree was observed owing to introduction of Pt nanoparticles.This is probably due to a distortion in the CN layer structure as a consequence of Pt nanoparticles addition.Besides that, no significant change in crystal structure was observed.In addition, the best photocatalytic performance was shown by 3 wt PCN (Fig. 11), Therefore, the CZTS nanoparticles were further loaded on the 3 wt PCN sample.As can see in Fig. 2(b), the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the diffraction peaks centered at 28.6, 31.7,48.34and 56.15, which can be well indexed to (1 1 2), ( 200), ( 220) and (312) planes corresponding to kesterite structure of CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575), reflecting the coexistence of both phases, CZTS and CN, attributing to successful hybridization of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.Notably, narrow diffraction peaks corresponding to (002) plane of interplanar stacking and (112) plane of kesterite CZTS are attributing a large crystallite size of the hybrid composite 31.In addition, the XRD results suggest that the synthesized samples mainly contain graphitic carbon nitride.The average crystallite sizes of all samples are calculated by Scherrer equation: where D, k, , , and B represent average crystallite size (nm), crystallite shape factor (0.9), X-ray wavelength (Cu K 1.5418A), the full-width at half maximum intensity in XRD (red), and brag's angle, respectively.The calculated average crystallite size of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt) and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst vary in the range of 8.57-18.39nm, see Table 1.The increase of average crystallite size can be attributed to the annealing temperature effect on the crystallite size, which leads to aggregation of particles 31,32.It is well-known that the smaller crystallite size (and thus, higher surface area) is associated with improvement in reaction of gaseous molecules on the surface owing to plentiful active sites, which further improves the photocatalytic performance of a potential photocatalyst by higher separation and rapid charge transfer of photoinduced charge carrier to the semiconductor interface 33.The XRD pattern of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The surface morphology and microstructure of all samples characterized by employing SEM and TEM are presented in Fig. 3.The pristine CN shows thick and irregular 2D nanosheet-like structure with a considerably large size (Fig. 3(a)), whereas the CZTS nanoparticles are comprised of flower-like agglomerates that have been composed of a large number of nanoplates with a size in the range of 100-150 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(b).The xPCN composites exhibit stacked, curly, twodimensional (2D) nanosheet-like structure with a particle size of several nanometers, different from pristine CN consisted of solid agglomerates (Fig. 3(c-e)).In addition, Pt nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of CN nanosheets and no obvious variation in surface morphology of Pt-integrated composites is observed with the increasing amount of Pt content.In the case of CZTS loaded 3 wt PCN, the hybrid composite is irregularly agglomerated having approximately spherical particles with an average diameter of tens to hundreds of nanometer, as shown in Fig. 3(f).Furthermore, the hybrid composite has clear incorporation and coating of flower-like CZTS nanoparticles on the 3 wt PCN nanosheets, which is confirmed by the EDS and elemental mapping.Fig. 3(g) show the EDS spectra, whereas the elemental mapping of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst confirms that the hybrid composite is composed of C, N, Pt, Cu, Zn, Sn, and S elements.Furthermore, Pt and CZTS nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of CN nanosheets (Fig. 3(h)). The TEM and High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst are presented in Fig. 4. The TEM image in Fig. 4(a) shows that the CN has fibrous and porous structure of thin sheet.From HRTEM image of 3 wt PCN in Fig. 4(a), Pt nanoparticles can be clearly distinguished with lattice spacing determined as 0.22 nm, belonging to (111) plan of metallic Pt.On the other hand, Fig. 4(b and b) confirm the flower-like structure with a lattice spacing of 0.313 nm indexed to (112) plane of kesterite CZTS nanoparticles.As shown in Fig. 4(c), the CN exhibits the fibrous and sheet-like morphology that acts as substrate for deposition of Pt and CZTS nanoparticles, while the dark parts located on the layered structure are assigned to CZTS nanoparticles having an obvious agglomeration.Furthermore, the TEM confirms the random distribution of Pt nanoparticles with particle size of less the 10 nm, decorated over the CN sheets.The HRTEM further shows the lattice fringe of hybrid composite with lattice spacing of 0.32 nm, suggesting that the sample is mainly CN.The lattice spacing of 0.22 nm and 0.31 nm can be well-indexed to (111) plan of metallic Pt, and (112) plane to kesterite CZTS nanoparticles, respectively (Fig. 4(c)).Moreover, the closely bounded lattice fringes attribute to the existence of intimate interface (shown by white dotted line) between 3 wt PCN and CZTS nanoparticles which could leads to effective interfacial transfer of photoinduced charge carrier transfer between CZTS nanoparticles and 3 wt PCN and hinder the probability of charge recombination over the surface of photocatalyst, thus to improve the photocatalytic performance. The FTIR spectroscopy was employed to characterize the functional groups, organic, inorganic species and related inter-and intra-bonding present in the CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, see presented in Fig. 5(a).All samples show a common intense band in the range of 3000-3500 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the stretching modes of residual primary, secondary amine groups and OeH stretching modes of adsorbed water 5,30.A series of peaks located between 1200-1700 cm -1 are associated with sp 3 CeN breathing modes and sp 2 CN stretching vibrations in heterocycles 343536.For all samples, the band appeared around 809-813 cm -1 is related to typical breathing mode of the triazine unit, whereas the characteristic peak around 887 cm -1 is attributed to NeH deformation modes 5,35.Moreover, the FTIR spectrum of hybrid composite shows some peaks emerging around 439, 1090 and 1735 cm -1 , which could be assigned to the stretching mode of ZneN, CS and CO bands, respectively, corresponding to the presence of CZTS in the composite 11,37,38.According to FTIR results, it has been found that after Pt and CZTS nanoparticles loading over CN, no significant damage in the basic carbon nitride structural framework was observed by either nanostructural design or surface modification, ascribing that the present CZTS and Pt modified counterpart were graphitic phase, agreeing with the previous XRD results 22,30.The FTIR spectra of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was employed to study the optical properties of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt ), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the pristine CN shows an absorption edge located around 450 nm with an estimated bandgap of 2.8 eV, consistent with previously reported value 13,14,39.After photo-deposition with Pt nanoparticles with different wt, the PCN samples exhibit a reasonably enhanced visible absorption, which may be attributed to Schottky junction across CN/Pt and surface-plasmon-resonance (SPR) effect of Pt, which is resulted from the interaction between the photons with photo-excited electrons on the Pt surface 25,40.No notable shift in absorption edges of the composites was observed, suggesting that Pt only deposits on the surface of CN instead of being incorporated into the lattice of CN, which is in good agreement with the XRD results.The combination of CZTS and 3 wt PCN shows a significantly enhanced visible absorption in the whole visible region, which means enhanced visible light absorption results in more electron-hole pairs generation, which is beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance 21.The DRS spectra of CZTS and absorbance spectra of Pt nanoparticles are displayed in supporting information (Fig. S3).The obtained results demonstrate that the encapsulation of CZTS nanoparticles can extend the optical absorption range of 3 wt PCN composite and Pt nanoparticles could facilitate the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers across CN and CZTS to their surfaces for photoreduction of CO 2 . Estimation of the conduction band potential (CBP) and valance band potential (VBP) is vibrant to understand the underlying mechanism of photoinduced charge transfer and separation in a potential photocatalytic composite for photocatalytic reaction.The CBP and VBP of CN and CZTS are calculated using the following equations 39, where E VB , E CB , X, E C and E g are conduction band potential, valance band potential, electronegativity (X CN 6.39 eV and X CZTS 4.80 eV), the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale (4.5 eV) and bandgap of semiconductors (2.8 eV of CN and 1.52 eV for CZTS), respectively.The estimated VBP of CN and CZTS are 1.51 and 1.06 eV, respectively.The calculated CBP of CN and CZTS are -1.22 and -0.46 eV, respectively.The calculated band potentials suggest a type I heterojunction, which is that the CBP and VBP of the CZTS in straddling alignment with the CN, is formed in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst. The schematic illustration of band structures of CN and CZTS is presented in Fig. 6(a).The Fermi level of CN and CZTS straddles the Fermi level of platinum at 0.66 eV.This allows band structure bending at the interfaces of CN-Pt and Pt-CZTS, which makes the migration of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs more efficient.Fig. 6(b) shows that the CBP of CZTS is lower compared to the reduction potential of CO (-0.53 eV), suggesting that only CH 4 yield can instigated by the photoinduced electron.If the photoinduced electrons in CB of CN migrate to CB of CZTS following the conventional \"type-I heterojunction\", all the photoinduced electrons will be accumulated on CZTS.Subsequently, charge recombination rate will increase and thus, limit the photocatalytic efficiency together with no CO yield.As Pt works as a bridge to accelerate the charge transportation between CN and CZTS, the hybrid composite follows the \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. Fig. 7(a) exhibits N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.All three samples show the type IV isotherms with H 3 hysteresis loops, indicating that the samples have mesoporous structure.The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameters for all the samples are enlisted in Table 1.A BET surface area of 7.9 m 2 g -1 was obtained for pristine CN increased to 9.35 m 2 g -1 in PCN composite, while it was further increased to 28.68 m 2 g -1 in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.This three times increase in specific surface area of heterojunction photocatalyst is due to the introduction of high specific surface CZTS nanoparticles.The pore volumes of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were 0.041, 0.086 and 0.165 cm 3 g -1 , respectively.Thus, larger surface area may contribute to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the prepared sample 39.The BET isotherm of only CZTS is presented in supporting information (Fig. S4). It is known fact that the CO 2 adsorption onto the photocatalyst surface is prerequisites to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To optimize the adsorption capacity and stability, the adsorption configuration and adsorption strength of CO 2 are critical features, similar to the surface area 10,13.Typically, the CO 2 adsorption isotherms were used to analyze the CO 2 adsorption of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/ 3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 7(b).The results show that the pristine CN has a weak CO 2 adsorption capacity at a relative pressure of 1.The 3 wt PCN composite exhibited better CO 2 adsorption capacity then pristine CN under similar conditions.Since flower-like CZTS nanoparticles are more active which provide more sites for CO 2 adsorption to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As a result, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of PCN composite was further enhanced by CZTS incorporation.According to BET results, the 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst have the higher specific surface area and pore volume, and consequently, exhibit superior CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of pristine CN.Thus, a combination of textural and surface guest modification is an effective approach to improve the adsorption capability of CN-based photocatalyst 11.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of all samples are presented in Table 1. Generally, photoinduced charge recombination leads to PL spectral emission and therefore PL emission spectra are beneficial to understand the transfer, migration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers 41.The Photoluminescence emission (PL) was performed to study the photoinduced charge recombination rate, see Fig. 8(a).It can be seen that the pristine CN exhibits the highest PL intensity as a result of the charge carriers generation upon absorption of photons, which leads to instigate the photocatalytic activity 42.However, after photo-deposition of Pt nanoparticles, a significant decrease in PL intensity can be seen, much lower than pristine CN because charge separation efficiency is improved owing to the electron sink function of Pt nanoparticles.A significant decrease in PL intensity was observed by the hybrid composite compared to the other samples, indicating the higher number of electrons with the highest separation efficiency to perform the photoreduction of CO 2 . In order to further confirm the suppressed charge recombination by means of their emission lifetime, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was performed.Fig. 8(b) shows that all spectra exhibit a doubleexponential decay and that the CZ/3 wt PCN has slightly slower fluorescent decay kinetics than that of pristine CN.The average lifetime was calculated by the following equation. where 1 and 2 are the emission lifetime, A 1 and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.The average lifetimes values were 6.65 ns, 6.90 ns and 7.42 ns for pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, respectively, which suggested that owing to electron reservoir function of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles, the hybrid composite has slower PL decay with longer average lifetime than pristine CN.The slower PL decay is indicative of an increased number of charge carriers with a longer lifetime which in turn results in an improved accessibility of the charge carriers to the surface of the hybrid composite 6,43.The determined values support the PL results. In order to understand the photoinduced charge recombination and separation process in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, the photoelectrochemical properties were investigated through the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).It is well known that the increase in electrical conductivity of pristine CN could lead to improve the charge carrier density.Fig. 8(c) shows the transient photocurrent response of all samples under visible light illumination for several on-off cycles.It can be seen that the photocurrent response goes down to zero immediately once the light turns off and returns to a constant value when the light turns on again.In addition, the photocurrent response is reproducible under visible light illumination, which implies an efficient transfer of photoinduced electrons to the surface of the sample and generates photocurrent.Owing to its wide bandgap, relatively weakest photocurrent response was exhibited by the pristine CN.Furthermore, the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst sample showed the highest photocurrent response compared to those of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.The maximum photocurrent response of each cycle is nearly the same and stable under the visible light exposure.This suggest that the visible light activated CZTS leads to improve the light absorption, increases the charge collection efficiency whereas, Pt improves separation efficiency and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, which is in good agreement with the DRS and PL results. Typical EIS results as Nyquist plots of all three samples are shown in Fig. 8(d).In fact, the Nyquist impedance arc reflects a semicircle feature, indicating the charge transfer across the interface of electrode/ electrolyte 21.Besides, the semicircle with smaller diameter/radius attributes to the effective charge transfer and separation across the electrode/electrolyte interface 44.As can be seen from Fig. 8(d), the radius of Nyquist impedance arc of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is significantly smaller compared with those Nyquist impedance arcs of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.This indicates that the CZ/3 wt PCN heterostructure composite retains the fastest charge transfer rate with effective inhibition of charge recombination across CZTS, Pt and CN. To validate the interfacial properties, the PEC properties of CN, 3 wt PCN, CZTS and CZ/3 wt PCN electrodes were investigated by measuring the current-voltage (I-V) curves both in the dark and under visible light.As can see in Fig. 9(a), a small current observed in 3 wt PCN and CN under dark in a potential region of -4 V to 5 V.After visible light irradiation, an abrupt increase in photocurrent density in 3 wt PCN and CN was measured.In addition, the positive slopes may indicate that both CN and 3 wt PCN are n-type semiconductor 45,46.According to semiconductor theory, metal-semiconductor contacts lead to the creation of potential barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface, which could hinder the electron transfer between metal and semiconductor.Therefore, the Pt loading over CN anticipates a Schottky barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface.Similarly, a small current was measured in CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS in absence of light as can see in Fig. 9(b).Whereas, CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS show a significantly increased photocurrent density upon visible light irradiation.The current-voltage curves show that the devices work in nonohmic (Schottky) mode and approaching that of back to back diode, and ending with S-shape I-V curve 47.Fig. 9(b) exhibits a swift increase in current under light irradiation when compared to dark.This specifies that the addition of Pt and CZTS in CZ/3 wt PCN may improve the light absorption and in that way increases the current.Furthermore, a steady increase of the current with respect to the negative potential indicates the p-type character of CZTS 47,48. The chemical and electronic states of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst analyzed by XPS analysis are shown in Fig. 10.Typical survey spectra in Fig. 10(a 2 ), ascribing to the presence of Zn in 2 oxidation state.As for Sn 3d spectra (Fig. 10(d)), two peaks at 486.5 eV (Sn 3d 5/2 ) and 495 eV (Sn 3d 3/2 ), correspond the presence of Sn in 4 oxidation state.The S 2p spectra (Fig. 10(e)) shows the two characteristic peaks appeared at 160.5 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 161.7 eV (S 2p 1/2 ), indicative of the sulfur in the form of sulfide with -2 oxidation state.In Fig. 10(f), the C 1s region shows three deconvolution peaks appearing at 284.7 eV, 286.2 eV and 288 eV originated from sp3-bonded carbon C-NH 2 , graphitic CeC and sp 2 -bonded carbon of N-CN bonds, respectively.Deconvolution spectra of N 1s (Fig. 10(g)) exhibit three binding energies centered at 398.5 eV, 399.3 eV and 400.9 eV correspond to sp 2 hybridized N-containing aromatic ring (CeNC), sp 3 bonded N (N-C 3 ), and amino functional groups (N-NH x ), respectively.Fig. 10(h) shows the two binding energies located at 70.2 eV (Pt 4f 7/2 ) and 74.6 eV (Pt 4f 5/2 ), ascribing to the presence of Pt (II) 49.Generally, Pt 4f 7/2 binding energies corresponding to Pt, Pt 2 and Pt 4 are centered at 71.2 eV, 72.4 eV and 74.2 eV, respectively.In comparison with Pt, the corresponding binding energies of Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 in composite sample shifted towards lower binding energy in consequence of the strong metal carrier interaction led by the electron-transfer from CN to Pt (a strong metal support interaction (SMSI)) 50.In photocatalytic reaction, when CZ/3 wt PCN is used, Pt nanoparticles act as an electronshuttle mediator due to its excellent electrical conductivity favorable for charge transportation and improve the visible absorption properties owing to localized surface-plasmon-resonance (LSPR).The XPS spectra of CZTS (Fig. S5) is presented in supporting information. The gaseous products in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors (used as reduction reagent) over pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were evaluated and yield rates of CO (two-electron reduction product) and CH 4 (eight-electron reduction product) as main product under visible light illumination for 5 h are given in Fig. 11(a-c).The undesired H 2 yield was also observed due to water splitting.The CH 4 and H 2 yield rates increased more or less linearly at a constant rate, as can be seen in Fig. 11(a andc).On the other hand, the yield rate of CO was rapid in the first hour and then remained constant (Fig. 11(b)).According to time-dependent yield rates in 11(a-c), the average yield rates of gaseous products were evaluated and compared in Fig. 11(d).The pristine CN and CZTS exhibit relatively low CO/CH 4 yield rates of 5.238/ 1.431 mol g -1 h -1 and 0.799/0.615mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, owing to large surface area and higher photoinduced charge recombination rate.The crystalline and electronic structure of CN were tuned by altering the particle size of Pt nanoparticles.Generally, a decrease in particle size leads to an increase in low-coordinated surface sites 51.Furthermore, the size-dependent properties are also associated with metal oxidation states.Therefore, under the similar conditions, the CO and CH 4 yield rates of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt) were considerably enhanced and systematic studies show that 3 wt PCN exhibits the highest CO/CH 4 yield rates of 13.028/5.455mol g -1 h -1 under visible-light illumination, 2.48/3.81folds higher than pristine CN.The improved photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of 3 wt PCN composite can be ascribed to large specific surface area, localized surface-plasmon-resonance effect by of Pt, electron-sink function of Pt, the formation of Schottky barrier 25,40 and effective photoinduced charge separation.Interestingly, with visible light active CZTS encapsulation over 3 wt PCN composite, the CO/CH 4 yield rates were further enhanced, which were 3.31 and 5.56 folds higher than pristine CN.The CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the best photocatalytic performance: CO yield rate of 17.351 mol g -1 h -1 and CH 4 yield rate of 7.961 mol g -1 h -1 , several times higher than the yield rates of CO (5.238 mol g -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (1.431 mol g -1 h -1 ) by pristine CN, indicative of the superiority of the novel heterojunction photocatalyst in photoreduction of CO 2 .The significant enhancement in CO and CH 4 yield rates may be attributed to the synergistic effects of visible light active CZTS and Pt nanoparticles.The visible light activated CZTS has more active sites and shortened diffusion channel for charge transfer and separation which provides more active sites for CO 2 adsorption, whereas Pt nanoparticles accelerate the effective charge separation for the reductive reaction.Besides, the extended light absorption range, higher surface area, effective interfacial charge transfer and separation under visible light are key factors that are instigating the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 .In addition, the best H 2 yield rate of 147.231 mol g -1 h -1 by heterojunction photocatalyst was achieved, several times improved than pristine CN.The improved CO, CH 4 and H 2 yield rates by photocatalyst followed the order of CZ/3 wt PCN 3 wt PCN 5 wt PCN 1 wt PCN CN and can be attributed to higher surface area with multiple level porous structure, improved light absorption and electron-sink function by Pt nanoparticles which activate H 2 O whereas CN and CZTS intended to reduce the CO 2 .In addition, the photocatalytic performance of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was further compared with the previously reported results as illustrated in Table 2. Furthermore, three blank experiments and a 13 CO 2 -labeled isotopic experiment were also performed to verify that the CO and CH 4 were evolved only from CO 2 under following conditions: (i) under light irradiation, but without photocatalyst (ii) under dark with photocatalyst and (iii) under N 2 H 2 O vapors instead of CO 2 H 2 O vapors with photocatalyst.Almost zero yield of corresponding carbonaceous product was observed which indicates that CO and CH 4 are generated by CO 2 reduction over CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, suggesting that CO and CH 4 are mainly generated from CO 2 reduction.Besides, some other gaseous products like methanol (CH 3 OH) and formic acid (H 2 CO) were also detected on hybrid composite, yet their yield rates were relatively small. In addition, the stability of the heterojunction photocatalyst is evaluated within four consecutive cycles under the same conditions.After each test, the catalyst is refreshed and refreshed helium gas periodically replaced in each cycle.As shown in Fig. 12(a), no significant change in CO/CH 4 yield rates of the first and fourth cycle was observed, which indicates that CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst has excellent stability as it has the ability of CO 2 reduction after four cycles. In the isotopic experiment, the generated CO and CH 4 were analyzed by GC-MS and 13 CO 2 was used instead of 12 CO 2 , shown in Fig. S6 (supporting Information).According to the GC-MS spectra, the signals at m/z at 29 and 17 are indexed to 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , which further confirms that CO and CH 4 are produced from the CO 2 reduction on CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.According to Fig. 12(b), the CH 4 selectivity of all the samples is more than 50 in comparison with CO selectivity, attributing that the CH 4 is the main product evolving in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Furthermore, the apparent quantum yield based on the yield rates of carbonaceous products, CO and CH 4 over hybrid composite was calculated to be 0.408 and 0.749 , respectively, and the total AQY () was 1.157 for CO 2 conversion.The details of AQY () estimation of all samples are given in supporting information (Table S1). The structural changes and characteristics parameters of composite, before and after the photocatalytic reaction were studied by XRD and FTIR, respectively.As can be seen in Fig. 12(c), no significant phase decomposition in the XRD results of fresh and used CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was observed.Similarly, FTIR characteristics spectra peaks of fresh and used hybrid composite are almost same with a slight decline in absorption band intensities, ascribing to the trivial deactivation of functional sites of hybrid composite, as shown in Fig. 12(d).Thus, the heterojunction photocatalyst with sustained structure and functional groups attribute to its exceptional stability after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test. Based on the aforementioned results, a plausible underlying mechanism scheme of interfacial electron transfer in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is presented in Fig. 13.According to photoinduced charge transfer and separation (Eqs.6 and 7) of the photocatalytic composite, the CBP of CN (-1.22 eV) is higher compared to reduction potential of CH 4 (-0.24eV) and CO (-0.53 eV).On the other hand, the CBP of CZTS (-0.46 eV) is lower compared to reduction potential of CO (cannot proceed the CO yield by CO 2 reduction) and more negative than reduction potential of CH 4 5,48.While the VBP of both CN and CZTS is higher in comparison with the oxidation potential of H 2 O/O 2 52.Thus, the CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O into CO and CH 4 over the CN based catalysts is found to be thermodynamically feasible 53.Moreover, the DRS results reflect that the LSPR effects of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles can significantly enhance the visible absorption properties of hybrid composite.In addition, the plasmonic Pt nanoparticles supported over CN surface function as a charge transmission bridge and play a vital role in the electron exchange between CZTS and CN sheets. Since CZTS is a typical visible light photocatalyst and CN is partial visible light responsive photocatalyst, therefore both CZTS and CN can induce electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination.The interfacial electron transfer in underlying mechanism can follow a \"Type I heterojunction transfer\" or a \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. In \"Type I heterojunction transfer\", upon visible light illumination, the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs in CB and VB of CN will transfer to CB and VB of CZTS and the CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation would take place on the CB and VB of CZTS, respectively.Also, the CBP of CZTS is less negative than CO redox potential, only CH 4 would not be generated.As the matter of fact, all of the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination would be accumulated on the CZTS in the \"Type I heterojunction\" (Fig. 13), which does not improve the charge separation and also limits the photocatalytic efficiency.Thus \"Type I heterojunction\" mechanism is not feasible to explain the enhanced CH 4 yield rate. Beside, Z-scheme transfer mechanism is more appropriate to explain the enhanced solar to fuel conversion rate.Owing to higher work function ( Pt 5.56 eV), Pt nanoparticles has low Fermi level (E F 0.66 eV vs. NHE) and strong electron accepting ability for the photoinduced electrons.According to TEM analysis, the Pt nanoparticles are uniformly distributed over the CN sheets.As a result, the Pt nanoparticles work as a bridge to accept photoinduced electrons from CB of CZTS and holes from VB of CN, resulting in the formation of Z-scheme photocatalytic system.This improves the transmission of photoinduced charge and retain the stronger oxidationreduction abilities of the composite.Thus, owing to charge transmission bridge function of Pt, the accumulated electrons in CB of CN can strongly reduce CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes at the VB of CZTS participate in the oxidation of H 2 O into OH and H .Besides, the photoinduced electrons remaining in the CB of CZTS would directly participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and yield CH Eqs. ( 9) and (10) indicate the generation followed by trapping of photoinduced charge carriers by heterojunctions and Pt metal, consequently, increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.Eqs.(11) and (12) kinetically explain that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction takes place at CB and oxidation of H 2 O takes place at the VB by the activity of electrons and holes, respectively.Eqs. ( 13)- (15) show the generation of H 2, CO and CH 4 through the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Moreover, the Pt nanoparticles encapsulated over CN can store electron owing to its electron-sink feature, function as reduction active sites, which can suppress the photoinduced charge recombination rate, and the LSPR effect further helps to improve visible light adsorption and charge generation.Thus, the photocatalytic performance, particularly the yield of CH 4 is significantly improved because of enriched density of electrons on Pt.In general, the synergistic interaction of multiple charge-transfer channels comprising Z-scheme charge transfer, LSPR and electron sink effects of Pt nanoparticles that can together be responsible for an efficient photoinduced charge separation and surface site activation for CO 2 reduction, which ultimately improves the photocatalytic performance."}, {"llm generation": "CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst", "source": "As can see in Fig. 2(b), the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the diffraction peaks centered at 28.6, 31.7,48.34and 56.15, which can be well indexed to (1 1 2), ( 200), ( 220) and (312) planes corresponding to kesterite structure of CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575), reflecting the coexistence of both phases, CZTS and CN, attributing to successful hybridization of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.", "context": "The crystalline phase and structural features of all samples were investigated by XRD and shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen the pristine CN showed two characteristic peaks centered at 12.92and 27.36, corresponding to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) plane of CN (JCPDS 87-1526).The lower characteristic peak centered at 13.1attributes the interlayer stacking of aromatic system, while the intense peak centered at 27.41a ttributes the in-plane periodicity distance of heptazine units 14,30.In the XRD patterns of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), no obvious diffraction peak of Pt was observed, which may be due to low content and uniform dispersion of Pt over the CN sheets (Fig. 2(a)).Besides, this could also be due to electronic synergetic effect and formation of perfect alloy leading to the reduction of the (111) plane of Pt.Furthermore, a small decrease in intensity with a slight shift in the peak at 27.36t owards a higher degree was observed owing to introduction of Pt nanoparticles.This is probably due to a distortion in the CN layer structure as a consequence of Pt nanoparticles addition.Besides that, no significant change in crystal structure was observed.In addition, the best photocatalytic performance was shown by 3 wt PCN (Fig. 11), Therefore, the CZTS nanoparticles were further loaded on the 3 wt PCN sample.As can see in Fig. 2(b), the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the diffraction peaks centered at 28.6, 31.7,48.34and 56.15, which can be well indexed to (1 1 2), ( 200), ( 220) and (312) planes corresponding to kesterite structure of CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575), reflecting the coexistence of both phases, CZTS and CN, attributing to successful hybridization of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.Notably, narrow diffraction peaks corresponding to (002) plane of interplanar stacking and (112) plane of kesterite CZTS are attributing a large crystallite size of the hybrid composite 31.In addition, the XRD results suggest that the synthesized samples mainly contain graphitic carbon nitride.The average crystallite sizes of all samples are calculated by Scherrer equation: where D, k, , , and B represent average crystallite size (nm), crystallite shape factor (0.9), X-ray wavelength (Cu K 1.5418A), the full-width at half maximum intensity in XRD (red), and brag's angle, respectively.The calculated average crystallite size of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt) and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst vary in the range of 8.57-18.39nm, see Table 1.The increase of average crystallite size can be attributed to the annealing temperature effect on the crystallite size, which leads to aggregation of particles 31,32.It is well-known that the smaller crystallite size (and thus, higher surface area) is associated with improvement in reaction of gaseous molecules on the surface owing to plentiful active sites, which further improves the photocatalytic performance of a potential photocatalyst by higher separation and rapid charge transfer of photoinduced charge carrier to the semiconductor interface 33.The XRD pattern of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The surface morphology and microstructure of all samples characterized by employing SEM and TEM are presented in Fig. 3.The pristine CN shows thick and irregular 2D nanosheet-like structure with a considerably large size (Fig. 3(a)), whereas the CZTS nanoparticles are comprised of flower-like agglomerates that have been composed of a large number of nanoplates with a size in the range of 100-150 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(b).The xPCN composites exhibit stacked, curly, twodimensional (2D) nanosheet-like structure with a particle size of several nanometers, different from pristine CN consisted of solid agglomerates (Fig. 3(c-e)).In addition, Pt nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of CN nanosheets and no obvious variation in surface morphology of Pt-integrated composites is observed with the increasing amount of Pt content.In the case of CZTS loaded 3 wt PCN, the hybrid composite is irregularly agglomerated having approximately spherical particles with an average diameter of tens to hundreds of nanometer, as shown in Fig. 3(f).Furthermore, the hybrid composite has clear incorporation and coating of flower-like CZTS nanoparticles on the 3 wt PCN nanosheets, which is confirmed by the EDS and elemental mapping.Fig. 3(g) show the EDS spectra, whereas the elemental mapping of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst confirms that the hybrid composite is composed of C, N, Pt, Cu, Zn, Sn, and S elements.Furthermore, Pt and CZTS nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of CN nanosheets (Fig. 3(h)). The TEM and High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst are presented in Fig. 4. The TEM image in Fig. 4(a) shows that the CN has fibrous and porous structure of thin sheet.From HRTEM image of 3 wt PCN in Fig. 4(a), Pt nanoparticles can be clearly distinguished with lattice spacing determined as 0.22 nm, belonging to (111) plan of metallic Pt.On the other hand, Fig. 4(b and b) confirm the flower-like structure with a lattice spacing of 0.313 nm indexed to (112) plane of kesterite CZTS nanoparticles.As shown in Fig. 4(c), the CN exhibits the fibrous and sheet-like morphology that acts as substrate for deposition of Pt and CZTS nanoparticles, while the dark parts located on the layered structure are assigned to CZTS nanoparticles having an obvious agglomeration.Furthermore, the TEM confirms the random distribution of Pt nanoparticles with particle size of less the 10 nm, decorated over the CN sheets.The HRTEM further shows the lattice fringe of hybrid composite with lattice spacing of 0.32 nm, suggesting that the sample is mainly CN.The lattice spacing of 0.22 nm and 0.31 nm can be well-indexed to (111) plan of metallic Pt, and (112) plane to kesterite CZTS nanoparticles, respectively (Fig. 4(c)).Moreover, the closely bounded lattice fringes attribute to the existence of intimate interface (shown by white dotted line) between 3 wt PCN and CZTS nanoparticles which could leads to effective interfacial transfer of photoinduced charge carrier transfer between CZTS nanoparticles and 3 wt PCN and hinder the probability of charge recombination over the surface of photocatalyst, thus to improve the photocatalytic performance. The FTIR spectroscopy was employed to characterize the functional groups, organic, inorganic species and related inter-and intra-bonding present in the CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, see presented in Fig. 5(a).All samples show a common intense band in the range of 3000-3500 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the stretching modes of residual primary, secondary amine groups and OeH stretching modes of adsorbed water 5,30.A series of peaks located between 1200-1700 cm -1 are associated with sp 3 CeN breathing modes and sp 2 CN stretching vibrations in heterocycles 343536.For all samples, the band appeared around 809-813 cm -1 is related to typical breathing mode of the triazine unit, whereas the characteristic peak around 887 cm -1 is attributed to NeH deformation modes 5,35.Moreover, the FTIR spectrum of hybrid composite shows some peaks emerging around 439, 1090 and 1735 cm -1 , which could be assigned to the stretching mode of ZneN, CS and CO bands, respectively, corresponding to the presence of CZTS in the composite 11,37,38.According to FTIR results, it has been found that after Pt and CZTS nanoparticles loading over CN, no significant damage in the basic carbon nitride structural framework was observed by either nanostructural design or surface modification, ascribing that the present CZTS and Pt modified counterpart were graphitic phase, agreeing with the previous XRD results 22,30.The FTIR spectra of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was employed to study the optical properties of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt ), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the pristine CN shows an absorption edge located around 450 nm with an estimated bandgap of 2.8 eV, consistent with previously reported value 13,14,39.After photo-deposition with Pt nanoparticles with different wt, the PCN samples exhibit a reasonably enhanced visible absorption, which may be attributed to Schottky junction across CN/Pt and surface-plasmon-resonance (SPR) effect of Pt, which is resulted from the interaction between the photons with photo-excited electrons on the Pt surface 25,40.No notable shift in absorption edges of the composites was observed, suggesting that Pt only deposits on the surface of CN instead of being incorporated into the lattice of CN, which is in good agreement with the XRD results.The combination of CZTS and 3 wt PCN shows a significantly enhanced visible absorption in the whole visible region, which means enhanced visible light absorption results in more electron-hole pairs generation, which is beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance 21.The DRS spectra of CZTS and absorbance spectra of Pt nanoparticles are displayed in supporting information (Fig. S3).The obtained results demonstrate that the encapsulation of CZTS nanoparticles can extend the optical absorption range of 3 wt PCN composite and Pt nanoparticles could facilitate the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers across CN and CZTS to their surfaces for photoreduction of CO 2 . Estimation of the conduction band potential (CBP) and valance band potential (VBP) is vibrant to understand the underlying mechanism of photoinduced charge transfer and separation in a potential photocatalytic composite for photocatalytic reaction.The CBP and VBP of CN and CZTS are calculated using the following equations 39, where E VB , E CB , X, E C and E g are conduction band potential, valance band potential, electronegativity (X CN 6.39 eV and X CZTS 4.80 eV), the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale (4.5 eV) and bandgap of semiconductors (2.8 eV of CN and 1.52 eV for CZTS), respectively.The estimated VBP of CN and CZTS are 1.51 and 1.06 eV, respectively.The calculated CBP of CN and CZTS are -1.22 and -0.46 eV, respectively.The calculated band potentials suggest a type I heterojunction, which is that the CBP and VBP of the CZTS in straddling alignment with the CN, is formed in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst. The schematic illustration of band structures of CN and CZTS is presented in Fig. 6(a).The Fermi level of CN and CZTS straddles the Fermi level of platinum at 0.66 eV.This allows band structure bending at the interfaces of CN-Pt and Pt-CZTS, which makes the migration of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs more efficient.Fig. 6(b) shows that the CBP of CZTS is lower compared to the reduction potential of CO (-0.53 eV), suggesting that only CH 4 yield can instigated by the photoinduced electron.If the photoinduced electrons in CB of CN migrate to CB of CZTS following the conventional \"type-I heterojunction\", all the photoinduced electrons will be accumulated on CZTS.Subsequently, charge recombination rate will increase and thus, limit the photocatalytic efficiency together with no CO yield.As Pt works as a bridge to accelerate the charge transportation between CN and CZTS, the hybrid composite follows the \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. Fig. 7(a) exhibits N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.All three samples show the type IV isotherms with H 3 hysteresis loops, indicating that the samples have mesoporous structure.The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameters for all the samples are enlisted in Table 1.A BET surface area of 7.9 m 2 g -1 was obtained for pristine CN increased to 9.35 m 2 g -1 in PCN composite, while it was further increased to 28.68 m 2 g -1 in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.This three times increase in specific surface area of heterojunction photocatalyst is due to the introduction of high specific surface CZTS nanoparticles.The pore volumes of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were 0.041, 0.086 and 0.165 cm 3 g -1 , respectively.Thus, larger surface area may contribute to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the prepared sample 39.The BET isotherm of only CZTS is presented in supporting information (Fig. S4). It is known fact that the CO 2 adsorption onto the photocatalyst surface is prerequisites to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To optimize the adsorption capacity and stability, the adsorption configuration and adsorption strength of CO 2 are critical features, similar to the surface area 10,13.Typically, the CO 2 adsorption isotherms were used to analyze the CO 2 adsorption of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/ 3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 7(b).The results show that the pristine CN has a weak CO 2 adsorption capacity at a relative pressure of 1.The 3 wt PCN composite exhibited better CO 2 adsorption capacity then pristine CN under similar conditions.Since flower-like CZTS nanoparticles are more active which provide more sites for CO 2 adsorption to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As a result, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of PCN composite was further enhanced by CZTS incorporation.According to BET results, the 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst have the higher specific surface area and pore volume, and consequently, exhibit superior CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of pristine CN.Thus, a combination of textural and surface guest modification is an effective approach to improve the adsorption capability of CN-based photocatalyst 11.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of all samples are presented in Table 1. Generally, photoinduced charge recombination leads to PL spectral emission and therefore PL emission spectra are beneficial to understand the transfer, migration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers 41.The Photoluminescence emission (PL) was performed to study the photoinduced charge recombination rate, see Fig. 8(a).It can be seen that the pristine CN exhibits the highest PL intensity as a result of the charge carriers generation upon absorption of photons, which leads to instigate the photocatalytic activity 42.However, after photo-deposition of Pt nanoparticles, a significant decrease in PL intensity can be seen, much lower than pristine CN because charge separation efficiency is improved owing to the electron sink function of Pt nanoparticles.A significant decrease in PL intensity was observed by the hybrid composite compared to the other samples, indicating the higher number of electrons with the highest separation efficiency to perform the photoreduction of CO 2 . In order to further confirm the suppressed charge recombination by means of their emission lifetime, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was performed.Fig. 8(b) shows that all spectra exhibit a doubleexponential decay and that the CZ/3 wt PCN has slightly slower fluorescent decay kinetics than that of pristine CN.The average lifetime was calculated by the following equation. where 1 and 2 are the emission lifetime, A 1 and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.The average lifetimes values were 6.65 ns, 6.90 ns and 7.42 ns for pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, respectively, which suggested that owing to electron reservoir function of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles, the hybrid composite has slower PL decay with longer average lifetime than pristine CN.The slower PL decay is indicative of an increased number of charge carriers with a longer lifetime which in turn results in an improved accessibility of the charge carriers to the surface of the hybrid composite 6,43.The determined values support the PL results. In order to understand the photoinduced charge recombination and separation process in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, the photoelectrochemical properties were investigated through the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).It is well known that the increase in electrical conductivity of pristine CN could lead to improve the charge carrier density.Fig. 8(c) shows the transient photocurrent response of all samples under visible light illumination for several on-off cycles.It can be seen that the photocurrent response goes down to zero immediately once the light turns off and returns to a constant value when the light turns on again.In addition, the photocurrent response is reproducible under visible light illumination, which implies an efficient transfer of photoinduced electrons to the surface of the sample and generates photocurrent.Owing to its wide bandgap, relatively weakest photocurrent response was exhibited by the pristine CN.Furthermore, the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst sample showed the highest photocurrent response compared to those of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.The maximum photocurrent response of each cycle is nearly the same and stable under the visible light exposure.This suggest that the visible light activated CZTS leads to improve the light absorption, increases the charge collection efficiency whereas, Pt improves separation efficiency and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, which is in good agreement with the DRS and PL results. Typical EIS results as Nyquist plots of all three samples are shown in Fig. 8(d).In fact, the Nyquist impedance arc reflects a semicircle feature, indicating the charge transfer across the interface of electrode/ electrolyte 21.Besides, the semicircle with smaller diameter/radius attributes to the effective charge transfer and separation across the electrode/electrolyte interface 44.As can be seen from Fig. 8(d), the radius of Nyquist impedance arc of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is significantly smaller compared with those Nyquist impedance arcs of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.This indicates that the CZ/3 wt PCN heterostructure composite retains the fastest charge transfer rate with effective inhibition of charge recombination across CZTS, Pt and CN. To validate the interfacial properties, the PEC properties of CN, 3 wt PCN, CZTS and CZ/3 wt PCN electrodes were investigated by measuring the current-voltage (I-V) curves both in the dark and under visible light.As can see in Fig. 9(a), a small current observed in 3 wt PCN and CN under dark in a potential region of -4 V to 5 V.After visible light irradiation, an abrupt increase in photocurrent density in 3 wt PCN and CN was measured.In addition, the positive slopes may indicate that both CN and 3 wt PCN are n-type semiconductor 45,46.According to semiconductor theory, metal-semiconductor contacts lead to the creation of potential barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface, which could hinder the electron transfer between metal and semiconductor.Therefore, the Pt loading over CN anticipates a Schottky barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface.Similarly, a small current was measured in CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS in absence of light as can see in Fig. 9(b).Whereas, CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS show a significantly increased photocurrent density upon visible light irradiation.The current-voltage curves show that the devices work in nonohmic (Schottky) mode and approaching that of back to back diode, and ending with S-shape I-V curve 47.Fig. 9(b) exhibits a swift increase in current under light irradiation when compared to dark.This specifies that the addition of Pt and CZTS in CZ/3 wt PCN may improve the light absorption and in that way increases the current.Furthermore, a steady increase of the current with respect to the negative potential indicates the p-type character of CZTS 47,48. The chemical and electronic states of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst analyzed by XPS analysis are shown in Fig. 10.Typical survey spectra in Fig. 10(a 2 ), ascribing to the presence of Zn in 2 oxidation state.As for Sn 3d spectra (Fig. 10(d)), two peaks at 486.5 eV (Sn 3d 5/2 ) and 495 eV (Sn 3d 3/2 ), correspond the presence of Sn in 4 oxidation state.The S 2p spectra (Fig. 10(e)) shows the two characteristic peaks appeared at 160.5 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 161.7 eV (S 2p 1/2 ), indicative of the sulfur in the form of sulfide with -2 oxidation state.In Fig. 10(f), the C 1s region shows three deconvolution peaks appearing at 284.7 eV, 286.2 eV and 288 eV originated from sp3-bonded carbon C-NH 2 , graphitic CeC and sp 2 -bonded carbon of N-CN bonds, respectively.Deconvolution spectra of N 1s (Fig. 10(g)) exhibit three binding energies centered at 398.5 eV, 399.3 eV and 400.9 eV correspond to sp 2 hybridized N-containing aromatic ring (CeNC), sp 3 bonded N (N-C 3 ), and amino functional groups (N-NH x ), respectively.Fig. 10(h) shows the two binding energies located at 70.2 eV (Pt 4f 7/2 ) and 74.6 eV (Pt 4f 5/2 ), ascribing to the presence of Pt (II) 49.Generally, Pt 4f 7/2 binding energies corresponding to Pt, Pt 2 and Pt 4 are centered at 71.2 eV, 72.4 eV and 74.2 eV, respectively.In comparison with Pt, the corresponding binding energies of Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 in composite sample shifted towards lower binding energy in consequence of the strong metal carrier interaction led by the electron-transfer from CN to Pt (a strong metal support interaction (SMSI)) 50.In photocatalytic reaction, when CZ/3 wt PCN is used, Pt nanoparticles act as an electronshuttle mediator due to its excellent electrical conductivity favorable for charge transportation and improve the visible absorption properties owing to localized surface-plasmon-resonance (LSPR).The XPS spectra of CZTS (Fig. S5) is presented in supporting information. The gaseous products in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors (used as reduction reagent) over pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were evaluated and yield rates of CO (two-electron reduction product) and CH 4 (eight-electron reduction product) as main product under visible light illumination for 5 h are given in Fig. 11(a-c).The undesired H 2 yield was also observed due to water splitting.The CH 4 and H 2 yield rates increased more or less linearly at a constant rate, as can be seen in Fig. 11(a andc).On the other hand, the yield rate of CO was rapid in the first hour and then remained constant (Fig. 11(b)).According to time-dependent yield rates in 11(a-c), the average yield rates of gaseous products were evaluated and compared in Fig. 11(d).The pristine CN and CZTS exhibit relatively low CO/CH 4 yield rates of 5.238/ 1.431 mol g -1 h -1 and 0.799/0.615mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, owing to large surface area and higher photoinduced charge recombination rate.The crystalline and electronic structure of CN were tuned by altering the particle size of Pt nanoparticles.Generally, a decrease in particle size leads to an increase in low-coordinated surface sites 51.Furthermore, the size-dependent properties are also associated with metal oxidation states.Therefore, under the similar conditions, the CO and CH 4 yield rates of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt) were considerably enhanced and systematic studies show that 3 wt PCN exhibits the highest CO/CH 4 yield rates of 13.028/5.455mol g -1 h -1 under visible-light illumination, 2.48/3.81folds higher than pristine CN.The improved photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of 3 wt PCN composite can be ascribed to large specific surface area, localized surface-plasmon-resonance effect by of Pt, electron-sink function of Pt, the formation of Schottky barrier 25,40 and effective photoinduced charge separation.Interestingly, with visible light active CZTS encapsulation over 3 wt PCN composite, the CO/CH 4 yield rates were further enhanced, which were 3.31 and 5.56 folds higher than pristine CN.The CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the best photocatalytic performance: CO yield rate of 17.351 mol g -1 h -1 and CH 4 yield rate of 7.961 mol g -1 h -1 , several times higher than the yield rates of CO (5.238 mol g -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (1.431 mol g -1 h -1 ) by pristine CN, indicative of the superiority of the novel heterojunction photocatalyst in photoreduction of CO 2 .The significant enhancement in CO and CH 4 yield rates may be attributed to the synergistic effects of visible light active CZTS and Pt nanoparticles.The visible light activated CZTS has more active sites and shortened diffusion channel for charge transfer and separation which provides more active sites for CO 2 adsorption, whereas Pt nanoparticles accelerate the effective charge separation for the reductive reaction.Besides, the extended light absorption range, higher surface area, effective interfacial charge transfer and separation under visible light are key factors that are instigating the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 .In addition, the best H 2 yield rate of 147.231 mol g -1 h -1 by heterojunction photocatalyst was achieved, several times improved than pristine CN.The improved CO, CH 4 and H 2 yield rates by photocatalyst followed the order of CZ/3 wt PCN 3 wt PCN 5 wt PCN 1 wt PCN CN and can be attributed to higher surface area with multiple level porous structure, improved light absorption and electron-sink function by Pt nanoparticles which activate H 2 O whereas CN and CZTS intended to reduce the CO 2 .In addition, the photocatalytic performance of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was further compared with the previously reported results as illustrated in Table 2. Furthermore, three blank experiments and a 13 CO 2 -labeled isotopic experiment were also performed to verify that the CO and CH 4 were evolved only from CO 2 under following conditions: (i) under light irradiation, but without photocatalyst (ii) under dark with photocatalyst and (iii) under N 2 H 2 O vapors instead of CO 2 H 2 O vapors with photocatalyst.Almost zero yield of corresponding carbonaceous product was observed which indicates that CO and CH 4 are generated by CO 2 reduction over CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, suggesting that CO and CH 4 are mainly generated from CO 2 reduction.Besides, some other gaseous products like methanol (CH 3 OH) and formic acid (H 2 CO) were also detected on hybrid composite, yet their yield rates were relatively small. In addition, the stability of the heterojunction photocatalyst is evaluated within four consecutive cycles under the same conditions.After each test, the catalyst is refreshed and refreshed helium gas periodically replaced in each cycle.As shown in Fig. 12(a), no significant change in CO/CH 4 yield rates of the first and fourth cycle was observed, which indicates that CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst has excellent stability as it has the ability of CO 2 reduction after four cycles. In the isotopic experiment, the generated CO and CH 4 were analyzed by GC-MS and 13 CO 2 was used instead of 12 CO 2 , shown in Fig. S6 (supporting Information).According to the GC-MS spectra, the signals at m/z at 29 and 17 are indexed to 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , which further confirms that CO and CH 4 are produced from the CO 2 reduction on CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.According to Fig. 12(b), the CH 4 selectivity of all the samples is more than 50 in comparison with CO selectivity, attributing that the CH 4 is the main product evolving in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Furthermore, the apparent quantum yield based on the yield rates of carbonaceous products, CO and CH 4 over hybrid composite was calculated to be 0.408 and 0.749 , respectively, and the total AQY () was 1.157 for CO 2 conversion.The details of AQY () estimation of all samples are given in supporting information (Table S1). The structural changes and characteristics parameters of composite, before and after the photocatalytic reaction were studied by XRD and FTIR, respectively.As can be seen in Fig. 12(c), no significant phase decomposition in the XRD results of fresh and used CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was observed.Similarly, FTIR characteristics spectra peaks of fresh and used hybrid composite are almost same with a slight decline in absorption band intensities, ascribing to the trivial deactivation of functional sites of hybrid composite, as shown in Fig. 12(d).Thus, the heterojunction photocatalyst with sustained structure and functional groups attribute to its exceptional stability after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test. Based on the aforementioned results, a plausible underlying mechanism scheme of interfacial electron transfer in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is presented in Fig. 13.According to photoinduced charge transfer and separation (Eqs.6 and 7) of the photocatalytic composite, the CBP of CN (-1.22 eV) is higher compared to reduction potential of CH 4 (-0.24eV) and CO (-0.53 eV).On the other hand, the CBP of CZTS (-0.46 eV) is lower compared to reduction potential of CO (cannot proceed the CO yield by CO 2 reduction) and more negative than reduction potential of CH 4 5,48.While the VBP of both CN and CZTS is higher in comparison with the oxidation potential of H 2 O/O 2 52.Thus, the CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O into CO and CH 4 over the CN based catalysts is found to be thermodynamically feasible 53.Moreover, the DRS results reflect that the LSPR effects of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles can significantly enhance the visible absorption properties of hybrid composite.In addition, the plasmonic Pt nanoparticles supported over CN surface function as a charge transmission bridge and play a vital role in the electron exchange between CZTS and CN sheets. Since CZTS is a typical visible light photocatalyst and CN is partial visible light responsive photocatalyst, therefore both CZTS and CN can induce electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination.The interfacial electron transfer in underlying mechanism can follow a \"Type I heterojunction transfer\" or a \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. In \"Type I heterojunction transfer\", upon visible light illumination, the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs in CB and VB of CN will transfer to CB and VB of CZTS and the CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation would take place on the CB and VB of CZTS, respectively.Also, the CBP of CZTS is less negative than CO redox potential, only CH 4 would not be generated.As the matter of fact, all of the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination would be accumulated on the CZTS in the \"Type I heterojunction\" (Fig. 13), which does not improve the charge separation and also limits the photocatalytic efficiency.Thus \"Type I heterojunction\" mechanism is not feasible to explain the enhanced CH 4 yield rate. Beside, Z-scheme transfer mechanism is more appropriate to explain the enhanced solar to fuel conversion rate.Owing to higher work function ( Pt 5.56 eV), Pt nanoparticles has low Fermi level (E F 0.66 eV vs. NHE) and strong electron accepting ability for the photoinduced electrons.According to TEM analysis, the Pt nanoparticles are uniformly distributed over the CN sheets.As a result, the Pt nanoparticles work as a bridge to accept photoinduced electrons from CB of CZTS and holes from VB of CN, resulting in the formation of Z-scheme photocatalytic system.This improves the transmission of photoinduced charge and retain the stronger oxidationreduction abilities of the composite.Thus, owing to charge transmission bridge function of Pt, the accumulated electrons in CB of CN can strongly reduce CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes at the VB of CZTS participate in the oxidation of H 2 O into OH and H .Besides, the photoinduced electrons remaining in the CB of CZTS would directly participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and yield CH Eqs. ( 9) and (10) indicate the generation followed by trapping of photoinduced charge carriers by heterojunctions and Pt metal, consequently, increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.Eqs.(11) and (12) kinetically explain that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction takes place at CB and oxidation of H 2 O takes place at the VB by the activity of electrons and holes, respectively.Eqs. ( 13)- (15) show the generation of H 2, CO and CH 4 through the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Moreover, the Pt nanoparticles encapsulated over CN can store electron owing to its electron-sink feature, function as reduction active sites, which can suppress the photoinduced charge recombination rate, and the LSPR effect further helps to improve visible light adsorption and charge generation.Thus, the photocatalytic performance, particularly the yield of CH 4 is significantly improved because of enriched density of electrons on Pt.In general, the synergistic interaction of multiple charge-transfer channels comprising Z-scheme charge transfer, LSPR and electron sink effects of Pt nanoparticles that can together be responsible for an efficient photoinduced charge separation and surface site activation for CO 2 reduction, which ultimately improves the photocatalytic performance."}, {"llm generation": "CN", "source": "If the photoinduced electrons in CB of CN migrate to CB of CZTS following the conventional \"type-I heterojunction\", all the photoinduced electrons will be accumulated on CZTS.", "context": "The crystalline phase and structural features of all samples were investigated by XRD and shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen the pristine CN showed two characteristic peaks centered at 12.92and 27.36, corresponding to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) plane of CN (JCPDS 87-1526).The lower characteristic peak centered at 13.1attributes the interlayer stacking of aromatic system, while the intense peak centered at 27.41a ttributes the in-plane periodicity distance of heptazine units 14,30.In the XRD patterns of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), no obvious diffraction peak of Pt was observed, which may be due to low content and uniform dispersion of Pt over the CN sheets (Fig. 2(a)).Besides, this could also be due to electronic synergetic effect and formation of perfect alloy leading to the reduction of the (111) plane of Pt.Furthermore, a small decrease in intensity with a slight shift in the peak at 27.36t owards a higher degree was observed owing to introduction of Pt nanoparticles.This is probably due to a distortion in the CN layer structure as a consequence of Pt nanoparticles addition.Besides that, no significant change in crystal structure was observed.In addition, the best photocatalytic performance was shown by 3 wt PCN (Fig. 11), Therefore, the CZTS nanoparticles were further loaded on the 3 wt PCN sample.As can see in Fig. 2(b), the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the diffraction peaks centered at 28.6, 31.7,48.34and 56.15, which can be well indexed to (1 1 2), ( 200), ( 220) and (312) planes corresponding to kesterite structure of CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575), reflecting the coexistence of both phases, CZTS and CN, attributing to successful hybridization of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.Notably, narrow diffraction peaks corresponding to (002) plane of interplanar stacking and (112) plane of kesterite CZTS are attributing a large crystallite size of the hybrid composite 31.In addition, the XRD results suggest that the synthesized samples mainly contain graphitic carbon nitride.The average crystallite sizes of all samples are calculated by Scherrer equation: where D, k, , , and B represent average crystallite size (nm), crystallite shape factor (0.9), X-ray wavelength (Cu K 1.5418A), the full-width at half maximum intensity in XRD (red), and brag's angle, respectively.The calculated average crystallite size of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt) and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst vary in the range of 8.57-18.39nm, see Table 1.The increase of average crystallite size can be attributed to the annealing temperature effect on the crystallite size, which leads to aggregation of particles 31,32.It is well-known that the smaller crystallite size (and thus, higher surface area) is associated with improvement in reaction of gaseous molecules on the surface owing to plentiful active sites, which further improves the photocatalytic performance of a potential photocatalyst by higher separation and rapid charge transfer of photoinduced charge carrier to the semiconductor interface 33.The XRD pattern of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The surface morphology and microstructure of all samples characterized by employing SEM and TEM are presented in Fig. 3.The pristine CN shows thick and irregular 2D nanosheet-like structure with a considerably large size (Fig. 3(a)), whereas the CZTS nanoparticles are comprised of flower-like agglomerates that have been composed of a large number of nanoplates with a size in the range of 100-150 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(b).The xPCN composites exhibit stacked, curly, twodimensional (2D) nanosheet-like structure with a particle size of several nanometers, different from pristine CN consisted of solid agglomerates (Fig. 3(c-e)).In addition, Pt nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of CN nanosheets and no obvious variation in surface morphology of Pt-integrated composites is observed with the increasing amount of Pt content.In the case of CZTS loaded 3 wt PCN, the hybrid composite is irregularly agglomerated having approximately spherical particles with an average diameter of tens to hundreds of nanometer, as shown in Fig. 3(f).Furthermore, the hybrid composite has clear incorporation and coating of flower-like CZTS nanoparticles on the 3 wt PCN nanosheets, which is confirmed by the EDS and elemental mapping.Fig. 3(g) show the EDS spectra, whereas the elemental mapping of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst confirms that the hybrid composite is composed of C, N, Pt, Cu, Zn, Sn, and S elements.Furthermore, Pt and CZTS nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of CN nanosheets (Fig. 3(h)). The TEM and High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst are presented in Fig. 4. The TEM image in Fig. 4(a) shows that the CN has fibrous and porous structure of thin sheet.From HRTEM image of 3 wt PCN in Fig. 4(a), Pt nanoparticles can be clearly distinguished with lattice spacing determined as 0.22 nm, belonging to (111) plan of metallic Pt.On the other hand, Fig. 4(b and b) confirm the flower-like structure with a lattice spacing of 0.313 nm indexed to (112) plane of kesterite CZTS nanoparticles.As shown in Fig. 4(c), the CN exhibits the fibrous and sheet-like morphology that acts as substrate for deposition of Pt and CZTS nanoparticles, while the dark parts located on the layered structure are assigned to CZTS nanoparticles having an obvious agglomeration.Furthermore, the TEM confirms the random distribution of Pt nanoparticles with particle size of less the 10 nm, decorated over the CN sheets.The HRTEM further shows the lattice fringe of hybrid composite with lattice spacing of 0.32 nm, suggesting that the sample is mainly CN.The lattice spacing of 0.22 nm and 0.31 nm can be well-indexed to (111) plan of metallic Pt, and (112) plane to kesterite CZTS nanoparticles, respectively (Fig. 4(c)).Moreover, the closely bounded lattice fringes attribute to the existence of intimate interface (shown by white dotted line) between 3 wt PCN and CZTS nanoparticles which could leads to effective interfacial transfer of photoinduced charge carrier transfer between CZTS nanoparticles and 3 wt PCN and hinder the probability of charge recombination over the surface of photocatalyst, thus to improve the photocatalytic performance. The FTIR spectroscopy was employed to characterize the functional groups, organic, inorganic species and related inter-and intra-bonding present in the CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, see presented in Fig. 5(a).All samples show a common intense band in the range of 3000-3500 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the stretching modes of residual primary, secondary amine groups and OeH stretching modes of adsorbed water 5,30.A series of peaks located between 1200-1700 cm -1 are associated with sp 3 CeN breathing modes and sp 2 CN stretching vibrations in heterocycles 343536.For all samples, the band appeared around 809-813 cm -1 is related to typical breathing mode of the triazine unit, whereas the characteristic peak around 887 cm -1 is attributed to NeH deformation modes 5,35.Moreover, the FTIR spectrum of hybrid composite shows some peaks emerging around 439, 1090 and 1735 cm -1 , which could be assigned to the stretching mode of ZneN, CS and CO bands, respectively, corresponding to the presence of CZTS in the composite 11,37,38.According to FTIR results, it has been found that after Pt and CZTS nanoparticles loading over CN, no significant damage in the basic carbon nitride structural framework was observed by either nanostructural design or surface modification, ascribing that the present CZTS and Pt modified counterpart were graphitic phase, agreeing with the previous XRD results 22,30.The FTIR spectra of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was employed to study the optical properties of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt ), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the pristine CN shows an absorption edge located around 450 nm with an estimated bandgap of 2.8 eV, consistent with previously reported value 13,14,39.After photo-deposition with Pt nanoparticles with different wt, the PCN samples exhibit a reasonably enhanced visible absorption, which may be attributed to Schottky junction across CN/Pt and surface-plasmon-resonance (SPR) effect of Pt, which is resulted from the interaction between the photons with photo-excited electrons on the Pt surface 25,40.No notable shift in absorption edges of the composites was observed, suggesting that Pt only deposits on the surface of CN instead of being incorporated into the lattice of CN, which is in good agreement with the XRD results.The combination of CZTS and 3 wt PCN shows a significantly enhanced visible absorption in the whole visible region, which means enhanced visible light absorption results in more electron-hole pairs generation, which is beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance 21.The DRS spectra of CZTS and absorbance spectra of Pt nanoparticles are displayed in supporting information (Fig. S3).The obtained results demonstrate that the encapsulation of CZTS nanoparticles can extend the optical absorption range of 3 wt PCN composite and Pt nanoparticles could facilitate the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers across CN and CZTS to their surfaces for photoreduction of CO 2 . Estimation of the conduction band potential (CBP) and valance band potential (VBP) is vibrant to understand the underlying mechanism of photoinduced charge transfer and separation in a potential photocatalytic composite for photocatalytic reaction.The CBP and VBP of CN and CZTS are calculated using the following equations 39, where E VB , E CB , X, E C and E g are conduction band potential, valance band potential, electronegativity (X CN 6.39 eV and X CZTS 4.80 eV), the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale (4.5 eV) and bandgap of semiconductors (2.8 eV of CN and 1.52 eV for CZTS), respectively.The estimated VBP of CN and CZTS are 1.51 and 1.06 eV, respectively.The calculated CBP of CN and CZTS are -1.22 and -0.46 eV, respectively.The calculated band potentials suggest a type I heterojunction, which is that the CBP and VBP of the CZTS in straddling alignment with the CN, is formed in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst. The schematic illustration of band structures of CN and CZTS is presented in Fig. 6(a).The Fermi level of CN and CZTS straddles the Fermi level of platinum at 0.66 eV.This allows band structure bending at the interfaces of CN-Pt and Pt-CZTS, which makes the migration of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs more efficient.Fig. 6(b) shows that the CBP of CZTS is lower compared to the reduction potential of CO (-0.53 eV), suggesting that only CH 4 yield can instigated by the photoinduced electron.If the photoinduced electrons in CB of CN migrate to CB of CZTS following the conventional \"type-I heterojunction\", all the photoinduced electrons will be accumulated on CZTS.Subsequently, charge recombination rate will increase and thus, limit the photocatalytic efficiency together with no CO yield.As Pt works as a bridge to accelerate the charge transportation between CN and CZTS, the hybrid composite follows the \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. Fig. 7(a) exhibits N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.All three samples show the type IV isotherms with H 3 hysteresis loops, indicating that the samples have mesoporous structure.The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameters for all the samples are enlisted in Table 1.A BET surface area of 7.9 m 2 g -1 was obtained for pristine CN increased to 9.35 m 2 g -1 in PCN composite, while it was further increased to 28.68 m 2 g -1 in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.This three times increase in specific surface area of heterojunction photocatalyst is due to the introduction of high specific surface CZTS nanoparticles.The pore volumes of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were 0.041, 0.086 and 0.165 cm 3 g -1 , respectively.Thus, larger surface area may contribute to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the prepared sample 39.The BET isotherm of only CZTS is presented in supporting information (Fig. S4). It is known fact that the CO 2 adsorption onto the photocatalyst surface is prerequisites to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To optimize the adsorption capacity and stability, the adsorption configuration and adsorption strength of CO 2 are critical features, similar to the surface area 10,13.Typically, the CO 2 adsorption isotherms were used to analyze the CO 2 adsorption of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/ 3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 7(b).The results show that the pristine CN has a weak CO 2 adsorption capacity at a relative pressure of 1.The 3 wt PCN composite exhibited better CO 2 adsorption capacity then pristine CN under similar conditions.Since flower-like CZTS nanoparticles are more active which provide more sites for CO 2 adsorption to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As a result, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of PCN composite was further enhanced by CZTS incorporation.According to BET results, the 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst have the higher specific surface area and pore volume, and consequently, exhibit superior CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of pristine CN.Thus, a combination of textural and surface guest modification is an effective approach to improve the adsorption capability of CN-based photocatalyst 11.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of all samples are presented in Table 1. Generally, photoinduced charge recombination leads to PL spectral emission and therefore PL emission spectra are beneficial to understand the transfer, migration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers 41.The Photoluminescence emission (PL) was performed to study the photoinduced charge recombination rate, see Fig. 8(a).It can be seen that the pristine CN exhibits the highest PL intensity as a result of the charge carriers generation upon absorption of photons, which leads to instigate the photocatalytic activity 42.However, after photo-deposition of Pt nanoparticles, a significant decrease in PL intensity can be seen, much lower than pristine CN because charge separation efficiency is improved owing to the electron sink function of Pt nanoparticles.A significant decrease in PL intensity was observed by the hybrid composite compared to the other samples, indicating the higher number of electrons with the highest separation efficiency to perform the photoreduction of CO 2 . In order to further confirm the suppressed charge recombination by means of their emission lifetime, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was performed.Fig. 8(b) shows that all spectra exhibit a doubleexponential decay and that the CZ/3 wt PCN has slightly slower fluorescent decay kinetics than that of pristine CN.The average lifetime was calculated by the following equation. where 1 and 2 are the emission lifetime, A 1 and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.The average lifetimes values were 6.65 ns, 6.90 ns and 7.42 ns for pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, respectively, which suggested that owing to electron reservoir function of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles, the hybrid composite has slower PL decay with longer average lifetime than pristine CN.The slower PL decay is indicative of an increased number of charge carriers with a longer lifetime which in turn results in an improved accessibility of the charge carriers to the surface of the hybrid composite 6,43.The determined values support the PL results. In order to understand the photoinduced charge recombination and separation process in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, the photoelectrochemical properties were investigated through the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).It is well known that the increase in electrical conductivity of pristine CN could lead to improve the charge carrier density.Fig. 8(c) shows the transient photocurrent response of all samples under visible light illumination for several on-off cycles.It can be seen that the photocurrent response goes down to zero immediately once the light turns off and returns to a constant value when the light turns on again.In addition, the photocurrent response is reproducible under visible light illumination, which implies an efficient transfer of photoinduced electrons to the surface of the sample and generates photocurrent.Owing to its wide bandgap, relatively weakest photocurrent response was exhibited by the pristine CN.Furthermore, the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst sample showed the highest photocurrent response compared to those of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.The maximum photocurrent response of each cycle is nearly the same and stable under the visible light exposure.This suggest that the visible light activated CZTS leads to improve the light absorption, increases the charge collection efficiency whereas, Pt improves separation efficiency and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, which is in good agreement with the DRS and PL results. Typical EIS results as Nyquist plots of all three samples are shown in Fig. 8(d).In fact, the Nyquist impedance arc reflects a semicircle feature, indicating the charge transfer across the interface of electrode/ electrolyte 21.Besides, the semicircle with smaller diameter/radius attributes to the effective charge transfer and separation across the electrode/electrolyte interface 44.As can be seen from Fig. 8(d), the radius of Nyquist impedance arc of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is significantly smaller compared with those Nyquist impedance arcs of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.This indicates that the CZ/3 wt PCN heterostructure composite retains the fastest charge transfer rate with effective inhibition of charge recombination across CZTS, Pt and CN. To validate the interfacial properties, the PEC properties of CN, 3 wt PCN, CZTS and CZ/3 wt PCN electrodes were investigated by measuring the current-voltage (I-V) curves both in the dark and under visible light.As can see in Fig. 9(a), a small current observed in 3 wt PCN and CN under dark in a potential region of -4 V to 5 V.After visible light irradiation, an abrupt increase in photocurrent density in 3 wt PCN and CN was measured.In addition, the positive slopes may indicate that both CN and 3 wt PCN are n-type semiconductor 45,46.According to semiconductor theory, metal-semiconductor contacts lead to the creation of potential barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface, which could hinder the electron transfer between metal and semiconductor.Therefore, the Pt loading over CN anticipates a Schottky barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface.Similarly, a small current was measured in CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS in absence of light as can see in Fig. 9(b).Whereas, CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS show a significantly increased photocurrent density upon visible light irradiation.The current-voltage curves show that the devices work in nonohmic (Schottky) mode and approaching that of back to back diode, and ending with S-shape I-V curve 47.Fig. 9(b) exhibits a swift increase in current under light irradiation when compared to dark.This specifies that the addition of Pt and CZTS in CZ/3 wt PCN may improve the light absorption and in that way increases the current.Furthermore, a steady increase of the current with respect to the negative potential indicates the p-type character of CZTS 47,48. The chemical and electronic states of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst analyzed by XPS analysis are shown in Fig. 10.Typical survey spectra in Fig. 10(a 2 ), ascribing to the presence of Zn in 2 oxidation state.As for Sn 3d spectra (Fig. 10(d)), two peaks at 486.5 eV (Sn 3d 5/2 ) and 495 eV (Sn 3d 3/2 ), correspond the presence of Sn in 4 oxidation state.The S 2p spectra (Fig. 10(e)) shows the two characteristic peaks appeared at 160.5 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 161.7 eV (S 2p 1/2 ), indicative of the sulfur in the form of sulfide with -2 oxidation state.In Fig. 10(f), the C 1s region shows three deconvolution peaks appearing at 284.7 eV, 286.2 eV and 288 eV originated from sp3-bonded carbon C-NH 2 , graphitic CeC and sp 2 -bonded carbon of N-CN bonds, respectively.Deconvolution spectra of N 1s (Fig. 10(g)) exhibit three binding energies centered at 398.5 eV, 399.3 eV and 400.9 eV correspond to sp 2 hybridized N-containing aromatic ring (CeNC), sp 3 bonded N (N-C 3 ), and amino functional groups (N-NH x ), respectively.Fig. 10(h) shows the two binding energies located at 70.2 eV (Pt 4f 7/2 ) and 74.6 eV (Pt 4f 5/2 ), ascribing to the presence of Pt (II) 49.Generally, Pt 4f 7/2 binding energies corresponding to Pt, Pt 2 and Pt 4 are centered at 71.2 eV, 72.4 eV and 74.2 eV, respectively.In comparison with Pt, the corresponding binding energies of Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 in composite sample shifted towards lower binding energy in consequence of the strong metal carrier interaction led by the electron-transfer from CN to Pt (a strong metal support interaction (SMSI)) 50.In photocatalytic reaction, when CZ/3 wt PCN is used, Pt nanoparticles act as an electronshuttle mediator due to its excellent electrical conductivity favorable for charge transportation and improve the visible absorption properties owing to localized surface-plasmon-resonance (LSPR).The XPS spectra of CZTS (Fig. S5) is presented in supporting information. The gaseous products in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors (used as reduction reagent) over pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were evaluated and yield rates of CO (two-electron reduction product) and CH 4 (eight-electron reduction product) as main product under visible light illumination for 5 h are given in Fig. 11(a-c).The undesired H 2 yield was also observed due to water splitting.The CH 4 and H 2 yield rates increased more or less linearly at a constant rate, as can be seen in Fig. 11(a andc).On the other hand, the yield rate of CO was rapid in the first hour and then remained constant (Fig. 11(b)).According to time-dependent yield rates in 11(a-c), the average yield rates of gaseous products were evaluated and compared in Fig. 11(d).The pristine CN and CZTS exhibit relatively low CO/CH 4 yield rates of 5.238/ 1.431 mol g -1 h -1 and 0.799/0.615mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, owing to large surface area and higher photoinduced charge recombination rate.The crystalline and electronic structure of CN were tuned by altering the particle size of Pt nanoparticles.Generally, a decrease in particle size leads to an increase in low-coordinated surface sites 51.Furthermore, the size-dependent properties are also associated with metal oxidation states.Therefore, under the similar conditions, the CO and CH 4 yield rates of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt) were considerably enhanced and systematic studies show that 3 wt PCN exhibits the highest CO/CH 4 yield rates of 13.028/5.455mol g -1 h -1 under visible-light illumination, 2.48/3.81folds higher than pristine CN.The improved photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of 3 wt PCN composite can be ascribed to large specific surface area, localized surface-plasmon-resonance effect by of Pt, electron-sink function of Pt, the formation of Schottky barrier 25,40 and effective photoinduced charge separation.Interestingly, with visible light active CZTS encapsulation over 3 wt PCN composite, the CO/CH 4 yield rates were further enhanced, which were 3.31 and 5.56 folds higher than pristine CN.The CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the best photocatalytic performance: CO yield rate of 17.351 mol g -1 h -1 and CH 4 yield rate of 7.961 mol g -1 h -1 , several times higher than the yield rates of CO (5.238 mol g -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (1.431 mol g -1 h -1 ) by pristine CN, indicative of the superiority of the novel heterojunction photocatalyst in photoreduction of CO 2 .The significant enhancement in CO and CH 4 yield rates may be attributed to the synergistic effects of visible light active CZTS and Pt nanoparticles.The visible light activated CZTS has more active sites and shortened diffusion channel for charge transfer and separation which provides more active sites for CO 2 adsorption, whereas Pt nanoparticles accelerate the effective charge separation for the reductive reaction.Besides, the extended light absorption range, higher surface area, effective interfacial charge transfer and separation under visible light are key factors that are instigating the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 .In addition, the best H 2 yield rate of 147.231 mol g -1 h -1 by heterojunction photocatalyst was achieved, several times improved than pristine CN.The improved CO, CH 4 and H 2 yield rates by photocatalyst followed the order of CZ/3 wt PCN 3 wt PCN 5 wt PCN 1 wt PCN CN and can be attributed to higher surface area with multiple level porous structure, improved light absorption and electron-sink function by Pt nanoparticles which activate H 2 O whereas CN and CZTS intended to reduce the CO 2 .In addition, the photocatalytic performance of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was further compared with the previously reported results as illustrated in Table 2. Furthermore, three blank experiments and a 13 CO 2 -labeled isotopic experiment were also performed to verify that the CO and CH 4 were evolved only from CO 2 under following conditions: (i) under light irradiation, but without photocatalyst (ii) under dark with photocatalyst and (iii) under N 2 H 2 O vapors instead of CO 2 H 2 O vapors with photocatalyst.Almost zero yield of corresponding carbonaceous product was observed which indicates that CO and CH 4 are generated by CO 2 reduction over CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, suggesting that CO and CH 4 are mainly generated from CO 2 reduction.Besides, some other gaseous products like methanol (CH 3 OH) and formic acid (H 2 CO) were also detected on hybrid composite, yet their yield rates were relatively small. In addition, the stability of the heterojunction photocatalyst is evaluated within four consecutive cycles under the same conditions.After each test, the catalyst is refreshed and refreshed helium gas periodically replaced in each cycle.As shown in Fig. 12(a), no significant change in CO/CH 4 yield rates of the first and fourth cycle was observed, which indicates that CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst has excellent stability as it has the ability of CO 2 reduction after four cycles. In the isotopic experiment, the generated CO and CH 4 were analyzed by GC-MS and 13 CO 2 was used instead of 12 CO 2 , shown in Fig. S6 (supporting Information).According to the GC-MS spectra, the signals at m/z at 29 and 17 are indexed to 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , which further confirms that CO and CH 4 are produced from the CO 2 reduction on CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.According to Fig. 12(b), the CH 4 selectivity of all the samples is more than 50 in comparison with CO selectivity, attributing that the CH 4 is the main product evolving in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Furthermore, the apparent quantum yield based on the yield rates of carbonaceous products, CO and CH 4 over hybrid composite was calculated to be 0.408 and 0.749 , respectively, and the total AQY () was 1.157 for CO 2 conversion.The details of AQY () estimation of all samples are given in supporting information (Table S1). The structural changes and characteristics parameters of composite, before and after the photocatalytic reaction were studied by XRD and FTIR, respectively.As can be seen in Fig. 12(c), no significant phase decomposition in the XRD results of fresh and used CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was observed.Similarly, FTIR characteristics spectra peaks of fresh and used hybrid composite are almost same with a slight decline in absorption band intensities, ascribing to the trivial deactivation of functional sites of hybrid composite, as shown in Fig. 12(d).Thus, the heterojunction photocatalyst with sustained structure and functional groups attribute to its exceptional stability after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test. Based on the aforementioned results, a plausible underlying mechanism scheme of interfacial electron transfer in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is presented in Fig. 13.According to photoinduced charge transfer and separation (Eqs.6 and 7) of the photocatalytic composite, the CBP of CN (-1.22 eV) is higher compared to reduction potential of CH 4 (-0.24eV) and CO (-0.53 eV).On the other hand, the CBP of CZTS (-0.46 eV) is lower compared to reduction potential of CO (cannot proceed the CO yield by CO 2 reduction) and more negative than reduction potential of CH 4 5,48.While the VBP of both CN and CZTS is higher in comparison with the oxidation potential of H 2 O/O 2 52.Thus, the CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O into CO and CH 4 over the CN based catalysts is found to be thermodynamically feasible 53.Moreover, the DRS results reflect that the LSPR effects of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles can significantly enhance the visible absorption properties of hybrid composite.In addition, the plasmonic Pt nanoparticles supported over CN surface function as a charge transmission bridge and play a vital role in the electron exchange between CZTS and CN sheets. Since CZTS is a typical visible light photocatalyst and CN is partial visible light responsive photocatalyst, therefore both CZTS and CN can induce electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination.The interfacial electron transfer in underlying mechanism can follow a \"Type I heterojunction transfer\" or a \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. In \"Type I heterojunction transfer\", upon visible light illumination, the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs in CB and VB of CN will transfer to CB and VB of CZTS and the CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation would take place on the CB and VB of CZTS, respectively.Also, the CBP of CZTS is less negative than CO redox potential, only CH 4 would not be generated.As the matter of fact, all of the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination would be accumulated on the CZTS in the \"Type I heterojunction\" (Fig. 13), which does not improve the charge separation and also limits the photocatalytic efficiency.Thus \"Type I heterojunction\" mechanism is not feasible to explain the enhanced CH 4 yield rate. Beside, Z-scheme transfer mechanism is more appropriate to explain the enhanced solar to fuel conversion rate.Owing to higher work function ( Pt 5.56 eV), Pt nanoparticles has low Fermi level (E F 0.66 eV vs. NHE) and strong electron accepting ability for the photoinduced electrons.According to TEM analysis, the Pt nanoparticles are uniformly distributed over the CN sheets.As a result, the Pt nanoparticles work as a bridge to accept photoinduced electrons from CB of CZTS and holes from VB of CN, resulting in the formation of Z-scheme photocatalytic system.This improves the transmission of photoinduced charge and retain the stronger oxidationreduction abilities of the composite.Thus, owing to charge transmission bridge function of Pt, the accumulated electrons in CB of CN can strongly reduce CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes at the VB of CZTS participate in the oxidation of H 2 O into OH and H .Besides, the photoinduced electrons remaining in the CB of CZTS would directly participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and yield CH Eqs. ( 9) and (10) indicate the generation followed by trapping of photoinduced charge carriers by heterojunctions and Pt metal, consequently, increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.Eqs.(11) and (12) kinetically explain that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction takes place at CB and oxidation of H 2 O takes place at the VB by the activity of electrons and holes, respectively.Eqs. ( 13)- (15) show the generation of H 2, CO and CH 4 through the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Moreover, the Pt nanoparticles encapsulated over CN can store electron owing to its electron-sink feature, function as reduction active sites, which can suppress the photoinduced charge recombination rate, and the LSPR effect further helps to improve visible light adsorption and charge generation.Thus, the photocatalytic performance, particularly the yield of CH 4 is significantly improved because of enriched density of electrons on Pt.In general, the synergistic interaction of multiple charge-transfer channels comprising Z-scheme charge transfer, LSPR and electron sink effects of Pt nanoparticles that can together be responsible for an efficient photoinduced charge separation and surface site activation for CO 2 reduction, which ultimately improves the photocatalytic performance."}, {"llm generation": "CN-based photocatalyst", "source": "Thus, a combination of textural and surface guest modification is an effective approach to improve the adsorption capability of CN-based photocatalyst 11.", "context": "The crystalline phase and structural features of all samples were investigated by XRD and shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen the pristine CN showed two characteristic peaks centered at 12.92and 27.36, corresponding to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) plane of CN (JCPDS 87-1526).The lower characteristic peak centered at 13.1attributes the interlayer stacking of aromatic system, while the intense peak centered at 27.41a ttributes the in-plane periodicity distance of heptazine units 14,30.In the XRD patterns of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), no obvious diffraction peak of Pt was observed, which may be due to low content and uniform dispersion of Pt over the CN sheets (Fig. 2(a)).Besides, this could also be due to electronic synergetic effect and formation of perfect alloy leading to the reduction of the (111) plane of Pt.Furthermore, a small decrease in intensity with a slight shift in the peak at 27.36t owards a higher degree was observed owing to introduction of Pt nanoparticles.This is probably due to a distortion in the CN layer structure as a consequence of Pt nanoparticles addition.Besides that, no significant change in crystal structure was observed.In addition, the best photocatalytic performance was shown by 3 wt PCN (Fig. 11), Therefore, the CZTS nanoparticles were further loaded on the 3 wt PCN sample.As can see in Fig. 2(b), the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the diffraction peaks centered at 28.6, 31.7,48.34and 56.15, which can be well indexed to (1 1 2), ( 200), ( 220) and (312) planes corresponding to kesterite structure of CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575), reflecting the coexistence of both phases, CZTS and CN, attributing to successful hybridization of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.Notably, narrow diffraction peaks corresponding to (002) plane of interplanar stacking and (112) plane of kesterite CZTS are attributing a large crystallite size of the hybrid composite 31.In addition, the XRD results suggest that the synthesized samples mainly contain graphitic carbon nitride.The average crystallite sizes of all samples are calculated by Scherrer equation: where D, k, , , and B represent average crystallite size (nm), crystallite shape factor (0.9), X-ray wavelength (Cu K 1.5418A), the full-width at half maximum intensity in XRD (red), and brag's angle, respectively.The calculated average crystallite size of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt) and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst vary in the range of 8.57-18.39nm, see Table 1.The increase of average crystallite size can be attributed to the annealing temperature effect on the crystallite size, which leads to aggregation of particles 31,32.It is well-known that the smaller crystallite size (and thus, higher surface area) is associated with improvement in reaction of gaseous molecules on the surface owing to plentiful active sites, which further improves the photocatalytic performance of a potential photocatalyst by higher separation and rapid charge transfer of photoinduced charge carrier to the semiconductor interface 33.The XRD pattern of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The surface morphology and microstructure of all samples characterized by employing SEM and TEM are presented in Fig. 3.The pristine CN shows thick and irregular 2D nanosheet-like structure with a considerably large size (Fig. 3(a)), whereas the CZTS nanoparticles are comprised of flower-like agglomerates that have been composed of a large number of nanoplates with a size in the range of 100-150 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(b).The xPCN composites exhibit stacked, curly, twodimensional (2D) nanosheet-like structure with a particle size of several nanometers, different from pristine CN consisted of solid agglomerates (Fig. 3(c-e)).In addition, Pt nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of CN nanosheets and no obvious variation in surface morphology of Pt-integrated composites is observed with the increasing amount of Pt content.In the case of CZTS loaded 3 wt PCN, the hybrid composite is irregularly agglomerated having approximately spherical particles with an average diameter of tens to hundreds of nanometer, as shown in Fig. 3(f).Furthermore, the hybrid composite has clear incorporation and coating of flower-like CZTS nanoparticles on the 3 wt PCN nanosheets, which is confirmed by the EDS and elemental mapping.Fig. 3(g) show the EDS spectra, whereas the elemental mapping of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst confirms that the hybrid composite is composed of C, N, Pt, Cu, Zn, Sn, and S elements.Furthermore, Pt and CZTS nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of CN nanosheets (Fig. 3(h)). The TEM and High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst are presented in Fig. 4. The TEM image in Fig. 4(a) shows that the CN has fibrous and porous structure of thin sheet.From HRTEM image of 3 wt PCN in Fig. 4(a), Pt nanoparticles can be clearly distinguished with lattice spacing determined as 0.22 nm, belonging to (111) plan of metallic Pt.On the other hand, Fig. 4(b and b) confirm the flower-like structure with a lattice spacing of 0.313 nm indexed to (112) plane of kesterite CZTS nanoparticles.As shown in Fig. 4(c), the CN exhibits the fibrous and sheet-like morphology that acts as substrate for deposition of Pt and CZTS nanoparticles, while the dark parts located on the layered structure are assigned to CZTS nanoparticles having an obvious agglomeration.Furthermore, the TEM confirms the random distribution of Pt nanoparticles with particle size of less the 10 nm, decorated over the CN sheets.The HRTEM further shows the lattice fringe of hybrid composite with lattice spacing of 0.32 nm, suggesting that the sample is mainly CN.The lattice spacing of 0.22 nm and 0.31 nm can be well-indexed to (111) plan of metallic Pt, and (112) plane to kesterite CZTS nanoparticles, respectively (Fig. 4(c)).Moreover, the closely bounded lattice fringes attribute to the existence of intimate interface (shown by white dotted line) between 3 wt PCN and CZTS nanoparticles which could leads to effective interfacial transfer of photoinduced charge carrier transfer between CZTS nanoparticles and 3 wt PCN and hinder the probability of charge recombination over the surface of photocatalyst, thus to improve the photocatalytic performance. The FTIR spectroscopy was employed to characterize the functional groups, organic, inorganic species and related inter-and intra-bonding present in the CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, see presented in Fig. 5(a).All samples show a common intense band in the range of 3000-3500 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the stretching modes of residual primary, secondary amine groups and OeH stretching modes of adsorbed water 5,30.A series of peaks located between 1200-1700 cm -1 are associated with sp 3 CeN breathing modes and sp 2 CN stretching vibrations in heterocycles 343536.For all samples, the band appeared around 809-813 cm -1 is related to typical breathing mode of the triazine unit, whereas the characteristic peak around 887 cm -1 is attributed to NeH deformation modes 5,35.Moreover, the FTIR spectrum of hybrid composite shows some peaks emerging around 439, 1090 and 1735 cm -1 , which could be assigned to the stretching mode of ZneN, CS and CO bands, respectively, corresponding to the presence of CZTS in the composite 11,37,38.According to FTIR results, it has been found that after Pt and CZTS nanoparticles loading over CN, no significant damage in the basic carbon nitride structural framework was observed by either nanostructural design or surface modification, ascribing that the present CZTS and Pt modified counterpart were graphitic phase, agreeing with the previous XRD results 22,30.The FTIR spectra of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was employed to study the optical properties of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt ), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the pristine CN shows an absorption edge located around 450 nm with an estimated bandgap of 2.8 eV, consistent with previously reported value 13,14,39.After photo-deposition with Pt nanoparticles with different wt, the PCN samples exhibit a reasonably enhanced visible absorption, which may be attributed to Schottky junction across CN/Pt and surface-plasmon-resonance (SPR) effect of Pt, which is resulted from the interaction between the photons with photo-excited electrons on the Pt surface 25,40.No notable shift in absorption edges of the composites was observed, suggesting that Pt only deposits on the surface of CN instead of being incorporated into the lattice of CN, which is in good agreement with the XRD results.The combination of CZTS and 3 wt PCN shows a significantly enhanced visible absorption in the whole visible region, which means enhanced visible light absorption results in more electron-hole pairs generation, which is beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance 21.The DRS spectra of CZTS and absorbance spectra of Pt nanoparticles are displayed in supporting information (Fig. S3).The obtained results demonstrate that the encapsulation of CZTS nanoparticles can extend the optical absorption range of 3 wt PCN composite and Pt nanoparticles could facilitate the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers across CN and CZTS to their surfaces for photoreduction of CO 2 . Estimation of the conduction band potential (CBP) and valance band potential (VBP) is vibrant to understand the underlying mechanism of photoinduced charge transfer and separation in a potential photocatalytic composite for photocatalytic reaction.The CBP and VBP of CN and CZTS are calculated using the following equations 39, where E VB , E CB , X, E C and E g are conduction band potential, valance band potential, electronegativity (X CN 6.39 eV and X CZTS 4.80 eV), the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale (4.5 eV) and bandgap of semiconductors (2.8 eV of CN and 1.52 eV for CZTS), respectively.The estimated VBP of CN and CZTS are 1.51 and 1.06 eV, respectively.The calculated CBP of CN and CZTS are -1.22 and -0.46 eV, respectively.The calculated band potentials suggest a type I heterojunction, which is that the CBP and VBP of the CZTS in straddling alignment with the CN, is formed in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst. The schematic illustration of band structures of CN and CZTS is presented in Fig. 6(a).The Fermi level of CN and CZTS straddles the Fermi level of platinum at 0.66 eV.This allows band structure bending at the interfaces of CN-Pt and Pt-CZTS, which makes the migration of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs more efficient.Fig. 6(b) shows that the CBP of CZTS is lower compared to the reduction potential of CO (-0.53 eV), suggesting that only CH 4 yield can instigated by the photoinduced electron.If the photoinduced electrons in CB of CN migrate to CB of CZTS following the conventional \"type-I heterojunction\", all the photoinduced electrons will be accumulated on CZTS.Subsequently, charge recombination rate will increase and thus, limit the photocatalytic efficiency together with no CO yield.As Pt works as a bridge to accelerate the charge transportation between CN and CZTS, the hybrid composite follows the \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. Fig. 7(a) exhibits N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.All three samples show the type IV isotherms with H 3 hysteresis loops, indicating that the samples have mesoporous structure.The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameters for all the samples are enlisted in Table 1.A BET surface area of 7.9 m 2 g -1 was obtained for pristine CN increased to 9.35 m 2 g -1 in PCN composite, while it was further increased to 28.68 m 2 g -1 in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.This three times increase in specific surface area of heterojunction photocatalyst is due to the introduction of high specific surface CZTS nanoparticles.The pore volumes of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were 0.041, 0.086 and 0.165 cm 3 g -1 , respectively.Thus, larger surface area may contribute to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the prepared sample 39.The BET isotherm of only CZTS is presented in supporting information (Fig. S4). It is known fact that the CO 2 adsorption onto the photocatalyst surface is prerequisites to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To optimize the adsorption capacity and stability, the adsorption configuration and adsorption strength of CO 2 are critical features, similar to the surface area 10,13.Typically, the CO 2 adsorption isotherms were used to analyze the CO 2 adsorption of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/ 3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 7(b).The results show that the pristine CN has a weak CO 2 adsorption capacity at a relative pressure of 1.The 3 wt PCN composite exhibited better CO 2 adsorption capacity then pristine CN under similar conditions.Since flower-like CZTS nanoparticles are more active which provide more sites for CO 2 adsorption to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As a result, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of PCN composite was further enhanced by CZTS incorporation.According to BET results, the 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst have the higher specific surface area and pore volume, and consequently, exhibit superior CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of pristine CN.Thus, a combination of textural and surface guest modification is an effective approach to improve the adsorption capability of CN-based photocatalyst 11.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of all samples are presented in Table 1. Generally, photoinduced charge recombination leads to PL spectral emission and therefore PL emission spectra are beneficial to understand the transfer, migration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers 41.The Photoluminescence emission (PL) was performed to study the photoinduced charge recombination rate, see Fig. 8(a).It can be seen that the pristine CN exhibits the highest PL intensity as a result of the charge carriers generation upon absorption of photons, which leads to instigate the photocatalytic activity 42.However, after photo-deposition of Pt nanoparticles, a significant decrease in PL intensity can be seen, much lower than pristine CN because charge separation efficiency is improved owing to the electron sink function of Pt nanoparticles.A significant decrease in PL intensity was observed by the hybrid composite compared to the other samples, indicating the higher number of electrons with the highest separation efficiency to perform the photoreduction of CO 2 . In order to further confirm the suppressed charge recombination by means of their emission lifetime, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was performed.Fig. 8(b) shows that all spectra exhibit a doubleexponential decay and that the CZ/3 wt PCN has slightly slower fluorescent decay kinetics than that of pristine CN.The average lifetime was calculated by the following equation. where 1 and 2 are the emission lifetime, A 1 and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.The average lifetimes values were 6.65 ns, 6.90 ns and 7.42 ns for pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, respectively, which suggested that owing to electron reservoir function of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles, the hybrid composite has slower PL decay with longer average lifetime than pristine CN.The slower PL decay is indicative of an increased number of charge carriers with a longer lifetime which in turn results in an improved accessibility of the charge carriers to the surface of the hybrid composite 6,43.The determined values support the PL results. In order to understand the photoinduced charge recombination and separation process in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, the photoelectrochemical properties were investigated through the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).It is well known that the increase in electrical conductivity of pristine CN could lead to improve the charge carrier density.Fig. 8(c) shows the transient photocurrent response of all samples under visible light illumination for several on-off cycles.It can be seen that the photocurrent response goes down to zero immediately once the light turns off and returns to a constant value when the light turns on again.In addition, the photocurrent response is reproducible under visible light illumination, which implies an efficient transfer of photoinduced electrons to the surface of the sample and generates photocurrent.Owing to its wide bandgap, relatively weakest photocurrent response was exhibited by the pristine CN.Furthermore, the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst sample showed the highest photocurrent response compared to those of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.The maximum photocurrent response of each cycle is nearly the same and stable under the visible light exposure.This suggest that the visible light activated CZTS leads to improve the light absorption, increases the charge collection efficiency whereas, Pt improves separation efficiency and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, which is in good agreement with the DRS and PL results. Typical EIS results as Nyquist plots of all three samples are shown in Fig. 8(d).In fact, the Nyquist impedance arc reflects a semicircle feature, indicating the charge transfer across the interface of electrode/ electrolyte 21.Besides, the semicircle with smaller diameter/radius attributes to the effective charge transfer and separation across the electrode/electrolyte interface 44.As can be seen from Fig. 8(d), the radius of Nyquist impedance arc of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is significantly smaller compared with those Nyquist impedance arcs of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.This indicates that the CZ/3 wt PCN heterostructure composite retains the fastest charge transfer rate with effective inhibition of charge recombination across CZTS, Pt and CN. To validate the interfacial properties, the PEC properties of CN, 3 wt PCN, CZTS and CZ/3 wt PCN electrodes were investigated by measuring the current-voltage (I-V) curves both in the dark and under visible light.As can see in Fig. 9(a), a small current observed in 3 wt PCN and CN under dark in a potential region of -4 V to 5 V.After visible light irradiation, an abrupt increase in photocurrent density in 3 wt PCN and CN was measured.In addition, the positive slopes may indicate that both CN and 3 wt PCN are n-type semiconductor 45,46.According to semiconductor theory, metal-semiconductor contacts lead to the creation of potential barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface, which could hinder the electron transfer between metal and semiconductor.Therefore, the Pt loading over CN anticipates a Schottky barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface.Similarly, a small current was measured in CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS in absence of light as can see in Fig. 9(b).Whereas, CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS show a significantly increased photocurrent density upon visible light irradiation.The current-voltage curves show that the devices work in nonohmic (Schottky) mode and approaching that of back to back diode, and ending with S-shape I-V curve 47.Fig. 9(b) exhibits a swift increase in current under light irradiation when compared to dark.This specifies that the addition of Pt and CZTS in CZ/3 wt PCN may improve the light absorption and in that way increases the current.Furthermore, a steady increase of the current with respect to the negative potential indicates the p-type character of CZTS 47,48. The chemical and electronic states of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst analyzed by XPS analysis are shown in Fig. 10.Typical survey spectra in Fig. 10(a 2 ), ascribing to the presence of Zn in 2 oxidation state.As for Sn 3d spectra (Fig. 10(d)), two peaks at 486.5 eV (Sn 3d 5/2 ) and 495 eV (Sn 3d 3/2 ), correspond the presence of Sn in 4 oxidation state.The S 2p spectra (Fig. 10(e)) shows the two characteristic peaks appeared at 160.5 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 161.7 eV (S 2p 1/2 ), indicative of the sulfur in the form of sulfide with -2 oxidation state.In Fig. 10(f), the C 1s region shows three deconvolution peaks appearing at 284.7 eV, 286.2 eV and 288 eV originated from sp3-bonded carbon C-NH 2 , graphitic CeC and sp 2 -bonded carbon of N-CN bonds, respectively.Deconvolution spectra of N 1s (Fig. 10(g)) exhibit three binding energies centered at 398.5 eV, 399.3 eV and 400.9 eV correspond to sp 2 hybridized N-containing aromatic ring (CeNC), sp 3 bonded N (N-C 3 ), and amino functional groups (N-NH x ), respectively.Fig. 10(h) shows the two binding energies located at 70.2 eV (Pt 4f 7/2 ) and 74.6 eV (Pt 4f 5/2 ), ascribing to the presence of Pt (II) 49.Generally, Pt 4f 7/2 binding energies corresponding to Pt, Pt 2 and Pt 4 are centered at 71.2 eV, 72.4 eV and 74.2 eV, respectively.In comparison with Pt, the corresponding binding energies of Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 in composite sample shifted towards lower binding energy in consequence of the strong metal carrier interaction led by the electron-transfer from CN to Pt (a strong metal support interaction (SMSI)) 50.In photocatalytic reaction, when CZ/3 wt PCN is used, Pt nanoparticles act as an electronshuttle mediator due to its excellent electrical conductivity favorable for charge transportation and improve the visible absorption properties owing to localized surface-plasmon-resonance (LSPR).The XPS spectra of CZTS (Fig. S5) is presented in supporting information. The gaseous products in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors (used as reduction reagent) over pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were evaluated and yield rates of CO (two-electron reduction product) and CH 4 (eight-electron reduction product) as main product under visible light illumination for 5 h are given in Fig. 11(a-c).The undesired H 2 yield was also observed due to water splitting.The CH 4 and H 2 yield rates increased more or less linearly at a constant rate, as can be seen in Fig. 11(a andc).On the other hand, the yield rate of CO was rapid in the first hour and then remained constant (Fig. 11(b)).According to time-dependent yield rates in 11(a-c), the average yield rates of gaseous products were evaluated and compared in Fig. 11(d).The pristine CN and CZTS exhibit relatively low CO/CH 4 yield rates of 5.238/ 1.431 mol g -1 h -1 and 0.799/0.615mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, owing to large surface area and higher photoinduced charge recombination rate.The crystalline and electronic structure of CN were tuned by altering the particle size of Pt nanoparticles.Generally, a decrease in particle size leads to an increase in low-coordinated surface sites 51.Furthermore, the size-dependent properties are also associated with metal oxidation states.Therefore, under the similar conditions, the CO and CH 4 yield rates of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt) were considerably enhanced and systematic studies show that 3 wt PCN exhibits the highest CO/CH 4 yield rates of 13.028/5.455mol g -1 h -1 under visible-light illumination, 2.48/3.81folds higher than pristine CN.The improved photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of 3 wt PCN composite can be ascribed to large specific surface area, localized surface-plasmon-resonance effect by of Pt, electron-sink function of Pt, the formation of Schottky barrier 25,40 and effective photoinduced charge separation.Interestingly, with visible light active CZTS encapsulation over 3 wt PCN composite, the CO/CH 4 yield rates were further enhanced, which were 3.31 and 5.56 folds higher than pristine CN.The CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the best photocatalytic performance: CO yield rate of 17.351 mol g -1 h -1 and CH 4 yield rate of 7.961 mol g -1 h -1 , several times higher than the yield rates of CO (5.238 mol g -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (1.431 mol g -1 h -1 ) by pristine CN, indicative of the superiority of the novel heterojunction photocatalyst in photoreduction of CO 2 .The significant enhancement in CO and CH 4 yield rates may be attributed to the synergistic effects of visible light active CZTS and Pt nanoparticles.The visible light activated CZTS has more active sites and shortened diffusion channel for charge transfer and separation which provides more active sites for CO 2 adsorption, whereas Pt nanoparticles accelerate the effective charge separation for the reductive reaction.Besides, the extended light absorption range, higher surface area, effective interfacial charge transfer and separation under visible light are key factors that are instigating the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 .In addition, the best H 2 yield rate of 147.231 mol g -1 h -1 by heterojunction photocatalyst was achieved, several times improved than pristine CN.The improved CO, CH 4 and H 2 yield rates by photocatalyst followed the order of CZ/3 wt PCN 3 wt PCN 5 wt PCN 1 wt PCN CN and can be attributed to higher surface area with multiple level porous structure, improved light absorption and electron-sink function by Pt nanoparticles which activate H 2 O whereas CN and CZTS intended to reduce the CO 2 .In addition, the photocatalytic performance of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was further compared with the previously reported results as illustrated in Table 2. Furthermore, three blank experiments and a 13 CO 2 -labeled isotopic experiment were also performed to verify that the CO and CH 4 were evolved only from CO 2 under following conditions: (i) under light irradiation, but without photocatalyst (ii) under dark with photocatalyst and (iii) under N 2 H 2 O vapors instead of CO 2 H 2 O vapors with photocatalyst.Almost zero yield of corresponding carbonaceous product was observed which indicates that CO and CH 4 are generated by CO 2 reduction over CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, suggesting that CO and CH 4 are mainly generated from CO 2 reduction.Besides, some other gaseous products like methanol (CH 3 OH) and formic acid (H 2 CO) were also detected on hybrid composite, yet their yield rates were relatively small. In addition, the stability of the heterojunction photocatalyst is evaluated within four consecutive cycles under the same conditions.After each test, the catalyst is refreshed and refreshed helium gas periodically replaced in each cycle.As shown in Fig. 12(a), no significant change in CO/CH 4 yield rates of the first and fourth cycle was observed, which indicates that CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst has excellent stability as it has the ability of CO 2 reduction after four cycles. In the isotopic experiment, the generated CO and CH 4 were analyzed by GC-MS and 13 CO 2 was used instead of 12 CO 2 , shown in Fig. S6 (supporting Information).According to the GC-MS spectra, the signals at m/z at 29 and 17 are indexed to 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , which further confirms that CO and CH 4 are produced from the CO 2 reduction on CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.According to Fig. 12(b), the CH 4 selectivity of all the samples is more than 50 in comparison with CO selectivity, attributing that the CH 4 is the main product evolving in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Furthermore, the apparent quantum yield based on the yield rates of carbonaceous products, CO and CH 4 over hybrid composite was calculated to be 0.408 and 0.749 , respectively, and the total AQY () was 1.157 for CO 2 conversion.The details of AQY () estimation of all samples are given in supporting information (Table S1). The structural changes and characteristics parameters of composite, before and after the photocatalytic reaction were studied by XRD and FTIR, respectively.As can be seen in Fig. 12(c), no significant phase decomposition in the XRD results of fresh and used CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was observed.Similarly, FTIR characteristics spectra peaks of fresh and used hybrid composite are almost same with a slight decline in absorption band intensities, ascribing to the trivial deactivation of functional sites of hybrid composite, as shown in Fig. 12(d).Thus, the heterojunction photocatalyst with sustained structure and functional groups attribute to its exceptional stability after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test. Based on the aforementioned results, a plausible underlying mechanism scheme of interfacial electron transfer in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is presented in Fig. 13.According to photoinduced charge transfer and separation (Eqs.6 and 7) of the photocatalytic composite, the CBP of CN (-1.22 eV) is higher compared to reduction potential of CH 4 (-0.24eV) and CO (-0.53 eV).On the other hand, the CBP of CZTS (-0.46 eV) is lower compared to reduction potential of CO (cannot proceed the CO yield by CO 2 reduction) and more negative than reduction potential of CH 4 5,48.While the VBP of both CN and CZTS is higher in comparison with the oxidation potential of H 2 O/O 2 52.Thus, the CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O into CO and CH 4 over the CN based catalysts is found to be thermodynamically feasible 53.Moreover, the DRS results reflect that the LSPR effects of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles can significantly enhance the visible absorption properties of hybrid composite.In addition, the plasmonic Pt nanoparticles supported over CN surface function as a charge transmission bridge and play a vital role in the electron exchange between CZTS and CN sheets. Since CZTS is a typical visible light photocatalyst and CN is partial visible light responsive photocatalyst, therefore both CZTS and CN can induce electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination.The interfacial electron transfer in underlying mechanism can follow a \"Type I heterojunction transfer\" or a \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. In \"Type I heterojunction transfer\", upon visible light illumination, the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs in CB and VB of CN will transfer to CB and VB of CZTS and the CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation would take place on the CB and VB of CZTS, respectively.Also, the CBP of CZTS is less negative than CO redox potential, only CH 4 would not be generated.As the matter of fact, all of the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination would be accumulated on the CZTS in the \"Type I heterojunction\" (Fig. 13), which does not improve the charge separation and also limits the photocatalytic efficiency.Thus \"Type I heterojunction\" mechanism is not feasible to explain the enhanced CH 4 yield rate. Beside, Z-scheme transfer mechanism is more appropriate to explain the enhanced solar to fuel conversion rate.Owing to higher work function ( Pt 5.56 eV), Pt nanoparticles has low Fermi level (E F 0.66 eV vs. NHE) and strong electron accepting ability for the photoinduced electrons.According to TEM analysis, the Pt nanoparticles are uniformly distributed over the CN sheets.As a result, the Pt nanoparticles work as a bridge to accept photoinduced electrons from CB of CZTS and holes from VB of CN, resulting in the formation of Z-scheme photocatalytic system.This improves the transmission of photoinduced charge and retain the stronger oxidationreduction abilities of the composite.Thus, owing to charge transmission bridge function of Pt, the accumulated electrons in CB of CN can strongly reduce CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes at the VB of CZTS participate in the oxidation of H 2 O into OH and H .Besides, the photoinduced electrons remaining in the CB of CZTS would directly participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and yield CH Eqs. ( 9) and (10) indicate the generation followed by trapping of photoinduced charge carriers by heterojunctions and Pt metal, consequently, increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.Eqs.(11) and (12) kinetically explain that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction takes place at CB and oxidation of H 2 O takes place at the VB by the activity of electrons and holes, respectively.Eqs. ( 13)- (15) show the generation of H 2, CO and CH 4 through the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Moreover, the Pt nanoparticles encapsulated over CN can store electron owing to its electron-sink feature, function as reduction active sites, which can suppress the photoinduced charge recombination rate, and the LSPR effect further helps to improve visible light adsorption and charge generation.Thus, the photocatalytic performance, particularly the yield of CH 4 is significantly improved because of enriched density of electrons on Pt.In general, the synergistic interaction of multiple charge-transfer channels comprising Z-scheme charge transfer, LSPR and electron sink effects of Pt nanoparticles that can together be responsible for an efficient photoinduced charge separation and surface site activation for CO 2 reduction, which ultimately improves the photocatalytic performance."}, {"llm generation": "novel heterojunction photocatalyst", "source": "The CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the best photocatalytic performance: CO yield rate of 17.351 mol g -1 h -1 and CH 4 yield rate of 7.961 mol g -1 h -1 , several times higher than the yield rates of CO (5.238 mol g -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (1.431 mol g -1 h -1 ) by pristine CN, indicative of the superiority of the novel heterojunction photocatalyst in photoreduction of CO 2 .", "context": "The crystalline phase and structural features of all samples were investigated by XRD and shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen the pristine CN showed two characteristic peaks centered at 12.92and 27.36, corresponding to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) plane of CN (JCPDS 87-1526).The lower characteristic peak centered at 13.1attributes the interlayer stacking of aromatic system, while the intense peak centered at 27.41a ttributes the in-plane periodicity distance of heptazine units 14,30.In the XRD patterns of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), no obvious diffraction peak of Pt was observed, which may be due to low content and uniform dispersion of Pt over the CN sheets (Fig. 2(a)).Besides, this could also be due to electronic synergetic effect and formation of perfect alloy leading to the reduction of the (111) plane of Pt.Furthermore, a small decrease in intensity with a slight shift in the peak at 27.36t owards a higher degree was observed owing to introduction of Pt nanoparticles.This is probably due to a distortion in the CN layer structure as a consequence of Pt nanoparticles addition.Besides that, no significant change in crystal structure was observed.In addition, the best photocatalytic performance was shown by 3 wt PCN (Fig. 11), Therefore, the CZTS nanoparticles were further loaded on the 3 wt PCN sample.As can see in Fig. 2(b), the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the diffraction peaks centered at 28.6, 31.7,48.34and 56.15, which can be well indexed to (1 1 2), ( 200), ( 220) and (312) planes corresponding to kesterite structure of CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575), reflecting the coexistence of both phases, CZTS and CN, attributing to successful hybridization of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.Notably, narrow diffraction peaks corresponding to (002) plane of interplanar stacking and (112) plane of kesterite CZTS are attributing a large crystallite size of the hybrid composite 31.In addition, the XRD results suggest that the synthesized samples mainly contain graphitic carbon nitride.The average crystallite sizes of all samples are calculated by Scherrer equation: where D, k, , , and B represent average crystallite size (nm), crystallite shape factor (0.9), X-ray wavelength (Cu K 1.5418A), the full-width at half maximum intensity in XRD (red), and brag's angle, respectively.The calculated average crystallite size of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt) and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst vary in the range of 8.57-18.39nm, see Table 1.The increase of average crystallite size can be attributed to the annealing temperature effect on the crystallite size, which leads to aggregation of particles 31,32.It is well-known that the smaller crystallite size (and thus, higher surface area) is associated with improvement in reaction of gaseous molecules on the surface owing to plentiful active sites, which further improves the photocatalytic performance of a potential photocatalyst by higher separation and rapid charge transfer of photoinduced charge carrier to the semiconductor interface 33.The XRD pattern of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The surface morphology and microstructure of all samples characterized by employing SEM and TEM are presented in Fig. 3.The pristine CN shows thick and irregular 2D nanosheet-like structure with a considerably large size (Fig. 3(a)), whereas the CZTS nanoparticles are comprised of flower-like agglomerates that have been composed of a large number of nanoplates with a size in the range of 100-150 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(b).The xPCN composites exhibit stacked, curly, twodimensional (2D) nanosheet-like structure with a particle size of several nanometers, different from pristine CN consisted of solid agglomerates (Fig. 3(c-e)).In addition, Pt nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of CN nanosheets and no obvious variation in surface morphology of Pt-integrated composites is observed with the increasing amount of Pt content.In the case of CZTS loaded 3 wt PCN, the hybrid composite is irregularly agglomerated having approximately spherical particles with an average diameter of tens to hundreds of nanometer, as shown in Fig. 3(f).Furthermore, the hybrid composite has clear incorporation and coating of flower-like CZTS nanoparticles on the 3 wt PCN nanosheets, which is confirmed by the EDS and elemental mapping.Fig. 3(g) show the EDS spectra, whereas the elemental mapping of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst confirms that the hybrid composite is composed of C, N, Pt, Cu, Zn, Sn, and S elements.Furthermore, Pt and CZTS nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of CN nanosheets (Fig. 3(h)). The TEM and High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst are presented in Fig. 4. The TEM image in Fig. 4(a) shows that the CN has fibrous and porous structure of thin sheet.From HRTEM image of 3 wt PCN in Fig. 4(a), Pt nanoparticles can be clearly distinguished with lattice spacing determined as 0.22 nm, belonging to (111) plan of metallic Pt.On the other hand, Fig. 4(b and b) confirm the flower-like structure with a lattice spacing of 0.313 nm indexed to (112) plane of kesterite CZTS nanoparticles.As shown in Fig. 4(c), the CN exhibits the fibrous and sheet-like morphology that acts as substrate for deposition of Pt and CZTS nanoparticles, while the dark parts located on the layered structure are assigned to CZTS nanoparticles having an obvious agglomeration.Furthermore, the TEM confirms the random distribution of Pt nanoparticles with particle size of less the 10 nm, decorated over the CN sheets.The HRTEM further shows the lattice fringe of hybrid composite with lattice spacing of 0.32 nm, suggesting that the sample is mainly CN.The lattice spacing of 0.22 nm and 0.31 nm can be well-indexed to (111) plan of metallic Pt, and (112) plane to kesterite CZTS nanoparticles, respectively (Fig. 4(c)).Moreover, the closely bounded lattice fringes attribute to the existence of intimate interface (shown by white dotted line) between 3 wt PCN and CZTS nanoparticles which could leads to effective interfacial transfer of photoinduced charge carrier transfer between CZTS nanoparticles and 3 wt PCN and hinder the probability of charge recombination over the surface of photocatalyst, thus to improve the photocatalytic performance. The FTIR spectroscopy was employed to characterize the functional groups, organic, inorganic species and related inter-and intra-bonding present in the CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, see presented in Fig. 5(a).All samples show a common intense band in the range of 3000-3500 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the stretching modes of residual primary, secondary amine groups and OeH stretching modes of adsorbed water 5,30.A series of peaks located between 1200-1700 cm -1 are associated with sp 3 CeN breathing modes and sp 2 CN stretching vibrations in heterocycles 343536.For all samples, the band appeared around 809-813 cm -1 is related to typical breathing mode of the triazine unit, whereas the characteristic peak around 887 cm -1 is attributed to NeH deformation modes 5,35.Moreover, the FTIR spectrum of hybrid composite shows some peaks emerging around 439, 1090 and 1735 cm -1 , which could be assigned to the stretching mode of ZneN, CS and CO bands, respectively, corresponding to the presence of CZTS in the composite 11,37,38.According to FTIR results, it has been found that after Pt and CZTS nanoparticles loading over CN, no significant damage in the basic carbon nitride structural framework was observed by either nanostructural design or surface modification, ascribing that the present CZTS and Pt modified counterpart were graphitic phase, agreeing with the previous XRD results 22,30.The FTIR spectra of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was employed to study the optical properties of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt ), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the pristine CN shows an absorption edge located around 450 nm with an estimated bandgap of 2.8 eV, consistent with previously reported value 13,14,39.After photo-deposition with Pt nanoparticles with different wt, the PCN samples exhibit a reasonably enhanced visible absorption, which may be attributed to Schottky junction across CN/Pt and surface-plasmon-resonance (SPR) effect of Pt, which is resulted from the interaction between the photons with photo-excited electrons on the Pt surface 25,40.No notable shift in absorption edges of the composites was observed, suggesting that Pt only deposits on the surface of CN instead of being incorporated into the lattice of CN, which is in good agreement with the XRD results.The combination of CZTS and 3 wt PCN shows a significantly enhanced visible absorption in the whole visible region, which means enhanced visible light absorption results in more electron-hole pairs generation, which is beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance 21.The DRS spectra of CZTS and absorbance spectra of Pt nanoparticles are displayed in supporting information (Fig. S3).The obtained results demonstrate that the encapsulation of CZTS nanoparticles can extend the optical absorption range of 3 wt PCN composite and Pt nanoparticles could facilitate the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers across CN and CZTS to their surfaces for photoreduction of CO 2 . Estimation of the conduction band potential (CBP) and valance band potential (VBP) is vibrant to understand the underlying mechanism of photoinduced charge transfer and separation in a potential photocatalytic composite for photocatalytic reaction.The CBP and VBP of CN and CZTS are calculated using the following equations 39, where E VB , E CB , X, E C and E g are conduction band potential, valance band potential, electronegativity (X CN 6.39 eV and X CZTS 4.80 eV), the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale (4.5 eV) and bandgap of semiconductors (2.8 eV of CN and 1.52 eV for CZTS), respectively.The estimated VBP of CN and CZTS are 1.51 and 1.06 eV, respectively.The calculated CBP of CN and CZTS are -1.22 and -0.46 eV, respectively.The calculated band potentials suggest a type I heterojunction, which is that the CBP and VBP of the CZTS in straddling alignment with the CN, is formed in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst. The schematic illustration of band structures of CN and CZTS is presented in Fig. 6(a).The Fermi level of CN and CZTS straddles the Fermi level of platinum at 0.66 eV.This allows band structure bending at the interfaces of CN-Pt and Pt-CZTS, which makes the migration of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs more efficient.Fig. 6(b) shows that the CBP of CZTS is lower compared to the reduction potential of CO (-0.53 eV), suggesting that only CH 4 yield can instigated by the photoinduced electron.If the photoinduced electrons in CB of CN migrate to CB of CZTS following the conventional \"type-I heterojunction\", all the photoinduced electrons will be accumulated on CZTS.Subsequently, charge recombination rate will increase and thus, limit the photocatalytic efficiency together with no CO yield.As Pt works as a bridge to accelerate the charge transportation between CN and CZTS, the hybrid composite follows the \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. Fig. 7(a) exhibits N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.All three samples show the type IV isotherms with H 3 hysteresis loops, indicating that the samples have mesoporous structure.The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameters for all the samples are enlisted in Table 1.A BET surface area of 7.9 m 2 g -1 was obtained for pristine CN increased to 9.35 m 2 g -1 in PCN composite, while it was further increased to 28.68 m 2 g -1 in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.This three times increase in specific surface area of heterojunction photocatalyst is due to the introduction of high specific surface CZTS nanoparticles.The pore volumes of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were 0.041, 0.086 and 0.165 cm 3 g -1 , respectively.Thus, larger surface area may contribute to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the prepared sample 39.The BET isotherm of only CZTS is presented in supporting information (Fig. S4). It is known fact that the CO 2 adsorption onto the photocatalyst surface is prerequisites to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To optimize the adsorption capacity and stability, the adsorption configuration and adsorption strength of CO 2 are critical features, similar to the surface area 10,13.Typically, the CO 2 adsorption isotherms were used to analyze the CO 2 adsorption of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/ 3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 7(b).The results show that the pristine CN has a weak CO 2 adsorption capacity at a relative pressure of 1.The 3 wt PCN composite exhibited better CO 2 adsorption capacity then pristine CN under similar conditions.Since flower-like CZTS nanoparticles are more active which provide more sites for CO 2 adsorption to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As a result, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of PCN composite was further enhanced by CZTS incorporation.According to BET results, the 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst have the higher specific surface area and pore volume, and consequently, exhibit superior CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of pristine CN.Thus, a combination of textural and surface guest modification is an effective approach to improve the adsorption capability of CN-based photocatalyst 11.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of all samples are presented in Table 1. Generally, photoinduced charge recombination leads to PL spectral emission and therefore PL emission spectra are beneficial to understand the transfer, migration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers 41.The Photoluminescence emission (PL) was performed to study the photoinduced charge recombination rate, see Fig. 8(a).It can be seen that the pristine CN exhibits the highest PL intensity as a result of the charge carriers generation upon absorption of photons, which leads to instigate the photocatalytic activity 42.However, after photo-deposition of Pt nanoparticles, a significant decrease in PL intensity can be seen, much lower than pristine CN because charge separation efficiency is improved owing to the electron sink function of Pt nanoparticles.A significant decrease in PL intensity was observed by the hybrid composite compared to the other samples, indicating the higher number of electrons with the highest separation efficiency to perform the photoreduction of CO 2 . In order to further confirm the suppressed charge recombination by means of their emission lifetime, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was performed.Fig. 8(b) shows that all spectra exhibit a doubleexponential decay and that the CZ/3 wt PCN has slightly slower fluorescent decay kinetics than that of pristine CN.The average lifetime was calculated by the following equation. where 1 and 2 are the emission lifetime, A 1 and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.The average lifetimes values were 6.65 ns, 6.90 ns and 7.42 ns for pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, respectively, which suggested that owing to electron reservoir function of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles, the hybrid composite has slower PL decay with longer average lifetime than pristine CN.The slower PL decay is indicative of an increased number of charge carriers with a longer lifetime which in turn results in an improved accessibility of the charge carriers to the surface of the hybrid composite 6,43.The determined values support the PL results. In order to understand the photoinduced charge recombination and separation process in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, the photoelectrochemical properties were investigated through the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).It is well known that the increase in electrical conductivity of pristine CN could lead to improve the charge carrier density.Fig. 8(c) shows the transient photocurrent response of all samples under visible light illumination for several on-off cycles.It can be seen that the photocurrent response goes down to zero immediately once the light turns off and returns to a constant value when the light turns on again.In addition, the photocurrent response is reproducible under visible light illumination, which implies an efficient transfer of photoinduced electrons to the surface of the sample and generates photocurrent.Owing to its wide bandgap, relatively weakest photocurrent response was exhibited by the pristine CN.Furthermore, the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst sample showed the highest photocurrent response compared to those of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.The maximum photocurrent response of each cycle is nearly the same and stable under the visible light exposure.This suggest that the visible light activated CZTS leads to improve the light absorption, increases the charge collection efficiency whereas, Pt improves separation efficiency and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, which is in good agreement with the DRS and PL results. Typical EIS results as Nyquist plots of all three samples are shown in Fig. 8(d).In fact, the Nyquist impedance arc reflects a semicircle feature, indicating the charge transfer across the interface of electrode/ electrolyte 21.Besides, the semicircle with smaller diameter/radius attributes to the effective charge transfer and separation across the electrode/electrolyte interface 44.As can be seen from Fig. 8(d), the radius of Nyquist impedance arc of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is significantly smaller compared with those Nyquist impedance arcs of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.This indicates that the CZ/3 wt PCN heterostructure composite retains the fastest charge transfer rate with effective inhibition of charge recombination across CZTS, Pt and CN. To validate the interfacial properties, the PEC properties of CN, 3 wt PCN, CZTS and CZ/3 wt PCN electrodes were investigated by measuring the current-voltage (I-V) curves both in the dark and under visible light.As can see in Fig. 9(a), a small current observed in 3 wt PCN and CN under dark in a potential region of -4 V to 5 V.After visible light irradiation, an abrupt increase in photocurrent density in 3 wt PCN and CN was measured.In addition, the positive slopes may indicate that both CN and 3 wt PCN are n-type semiconductor 45,46.According to semiconductor theory, metal-semiconductor contacts lead to the creation of potential barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface, which could hinder the electron transfer between metal and semiconductor.Therefore, the Pt loading over CN anticipates a Schottky barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface.Similarly, a small current was measured in CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS in absence of light as can see in Fig. 9(b).Whereas, CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS show a significantly increased photocurrent density upon visible light irradiation.The current-voltage curves show that the devices work in nonohmic (Schottky) mode and approaching that of back to back diode, and ending with S-shape I-V curve 47.Fig. 9(b) exhibits a swift increase in current under light irradiation when compared to dark.This specifies that the addition of Pt and CZTS in CZ/3 wt PCN may improve the light absorption and in that way increases the current.Furthermore, a steady increase of the current with respect to the negative potential indicates the p-type character of CZTS 47,48. The chemical and electronic states of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst analyzed by XPS analysis are shown in Fig. 10.Typical survey spectra in Fig. 10(a 2 ), ascribing to the presence of Zn in 2 oxidation state.As for Sn 3d spectra (Fig. 10(d)), two peaks at 486.5 eV (Sn 3d 5/2 ) and 495 eV (Sn 3d 3/2 ), correspond the presence of Sn in 4 oxidation state.The S 2p spectra (Fig. 10(e)) shows the two characteristic peaks appeared at 160.5 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 161.7 eV (S 2p 1/2 ), indicative of the sulfur in the form of sulfide with -2 oxidation state.In Fig. 10(f), the C 1s region shows three deconvolution peaks appearing at 284.7 eV, 286.2 eV and 288 eV originated from sp3-bonded carbon C-NH 2 , graphitic CeC and sp 2 -bonded carbon of N-CN bonds, respectively.Deconvolution spectra of N 1s (Fig. 10(g)) exhibit three binding energies centered at 398.5 eV, 399.3 eV and 400.9 eV correspond to sp 2 hybridized N-containing aromatic ring (CeNC), sp 3 bonded N (N-C 3 ), and amino functional groups (N-NH x ), respectively.Fig. 10(h) shows the two binding energies located at 70.2 eV (Pt 4f 7/2 ) and 74.6 eV (Pt 4f 5/2 ), ascribing to the presence of Pt (II) 49.Generally, Pt 4f 7/2 binding energies corresponding to Pt, Pt 2 and Pt 4 are centered at 71.2 eV, 72.4 eV and 74.2 eV, respectively.In comparison with Pt, the corresponding binding energies of Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 in composite sample shifted towards lower binding energy in consequence of the strong metal carrier interaction led by the electron-transfer from CN to Pt (a strong metal support interaction (SMSI)) 50.In photocatalytic reaction, when CZ/3 wt PCN is used, Pt nanoparticles act as an electronshuttle mediator due to its excellent electrical conductivity favorable for charge transportation and improve the visible absorption properties owing to localized surface-plasmon-resonance (LSPR).The XPS spectra of CZTS (Fig. S5) is presented in supporting information. The gaseous products in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors (used as reduction reagent) over pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were evaluated and yield rates of CO (two-electron reduction product) and CH 4 (eight-electron reduction product) as main product under visible light illumination for 5 h are given in Fig. 11(a-c).The undesired H 2 yield was also observed due to water splitting.The CH 4 and H 2 yield rates increased more or less linearly at a constant rate, as can be seen in Fig. 11(a andc).On the other hand, the yield rate of CO was rapid in the first hour and then remained constant (Fig. 11(b)).According to time-dependent yield rates in 11(a-c), the average yield rates of gaseous products were evaluated and compared in Fig. 11(d).The pristine CN and CZTS exhibit relatively low CO/CH 4 yield rates of 5.238/ 1.431 mol g -1 h -1 and 0.799/0.615mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, owing to large surface area and higher photoinduced charge recombination rate.The crystalline and electronic structure of CN were tuned by altering the particle size of Pt nanoparticles.Generally, a decrease in particle size leads to an increase in low-coordinated surface sites 51.Furthermore, the size-dependent properties are also associated with metal oxidation states.Therefore, under the similar conditions, the CO and CH 4 yield rates of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt) were considerably enhanced and systematic studies show that 3 wt PCN exhibits the highest CO/CH 4 yield rates of 13.028/5.455mol g -1 h -1 under visible-light illumination, 2.48/3.81folds higher than pristine CN.The improved photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of 3 wt PCN composite can be ascribed to large specific surface area, localized surface-plasmon-resonance effect by of Pt, electron-sink function of Pt, the formation of Schottky barrier 25,40 and effective photoinduced charge separation.Interestingly, with visible light active CZTS encapsulation over 3 wt PCN composite, the CO/CH 4 yield rates were further enhanced, which were 3.31 and 5.56 folds higher than pristine CN.The CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the best photocatalytic performance: CO yield rate of 17.351 mol g -1 h -1 and CH 4 yield rate of 7.961 mol g -1 h -1 , several times higher than the yield rates of CO (5.238 mol g -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (1.431 mol g -1 h -1 ) by pristine CN, indicative of the superiority of the novel heterojunction photocatalyst in photoreduction of CO 2 .The significant enhancement in CO and CH 4 yield rates may be attributed to the synergistic effects of visible light active CZTS and Pt nanoparticles.The visible light activated CZTS has more active sites and shortened diffusion channel for charge transfer and separation which provides more active sites for CO 2 adsorption, whereas Pt nanoparticles accelerate the effective charge separation for the reductive reaction.Besides, the extended light absorption range, higher surface area, effective interfacial charge transfer and separation under visible light are key factors that are instigating the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 .In addition, the best H 2 yield rate of 147.231 mol g -1 h -1 by heterojunction photocatalyst was achieved, several times improved than pristine CN.The improved CO, CH 4 and H 2 yield rates by photocatalyst followed the order of CZ/3 wt PCN 3 wt PCN 5 wt PCN 1 wt PCN CN and can be attributed to higher surface area with multiple level porous structure, improved light absorption and electron-sink function by Pt nanoparticles which activate H 2 O whereas CN and CZTS intended to reduce the CO 2 .In addition, the photocatalytic performance of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was further compared with the previously reported results as illustrated in Table 2. Furthermore, three blank experiments and a 13 CO 2 -labeled isotopic experiment were also performed to verify that the CO and CH 4 were evolved only from CO 2 under following conditions: (i) under light irradiation, but without photocatalyst (ii) under dark with photocatalyst and (iii) under N 2 H 2 O vapors instead of CO 2 H 2 O vapors with photocatalyst.Almost zero yield of corresponding carbonaceous product was observed which indicates that CO and CH 4 are generated by CO 2 reduction over CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, suggesting that CO and CH 4 are mainly generated from CO 2 reduction.Besides, some other gaseous products like methanol (CH 3 OH) and formic acid (H 2 CO) were also detected on hybrid composite, yet their yield rates were relatively small. In addition, the stability of the heterojunction photocatalyst is evaluated within four consecutive cycles under the same conditions.After each test, the catalyst is refreshed and refreshed helium gas periodically replaced in each cycle.As shown in Fig. 12(a), no significant change in CO/CH 4 yield rates of the first and fourth cycle was observed, which indicates that CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst has excellent stability as it has the ability of CO 2 reduction after four cycles. In the isotopic experiment, the generated CO and CH 4 were analyzed by GC-MS and 13 CO 2 was used instead of 12 CO 2 , shown in Fig. S6 (supporting Information).According to the GC-MS spectra, the signals at m/z at 29 and 17 are indexed to 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , which further confirms that CO and CH 4 are produced from the CO 2 reduction on CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.According to Fig. 12(b), the CH 4 selectivity of all the samples is more than 50 in comparison with CO selectivity, attributing that the CH 4 is the main product evolving in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Furthermore, the apparent quantum yield based on the yield rates of carbonaceous products, CO and CH 4 over hybrid composite was calculated to be 0.408 and 0.749 , respectively, and the total AQY () was 1.157 for CO 2 conversion.The details of AQY () estimation of all samples are given in supporting information (Table S1). The structural changes and characteristics parameters of composite, before and after the photocatalytic reaction were studied by XRD and FTIR, respectively.As can be seen in Fig. 12(c), no significant phase decomposition in the XRD results of fresh and used CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was observed.Similarly, FTIR characteristics spectra peaks of fresh and used hybrid composite are almost same with a slight decline in absorption band intensities, ascribing to the trivial deactivation of functional sites of hybrid composite, as shown in Fig. 12(d).Thus, the heterojunction photocatalyst with sustained structure and functional groups attribute to its exceptional stability after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test. Based on the aforementioned results, a plausible underlying mechanism scheme of interfacial electron transfer in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is presented in Fig. 13.According to photoinduced charge transfer and separation (Eqs.6 and 7) of the photocatalytic composite, the CBP of CN (-1.22 eV) is higher compared to reduction potential of CH 4 (-0.24eV) and CO (-0.53 eV).On the other hand, the CBP of CZTS (-0.46 eV) is lower compared to reduction potential of CO (cannot proceed the CO yield by CO 2 reduction) and more negative than reduction potential of CH 4 5,48.While the VBP of both CN and CZTS is higher in comparison with the oxidation potential of H 2 O/O 2 52.Thus, the CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O into CO and CH 4 over the CN based catalysts is found to be thermodynamically feasible 53.Moreover, the DRS results reflect that the LSPR effects of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles can significantly enhance the visible absorption properties of hybrid composite.In addition, the plasmonic Pt nanoparticles supported over CN surface function as a charge transmission bridge and play a vital role in the electron exchange between CZTS and CN sheets. Since CZTS is a typical visible light photocatalyst and CN is partial visible light responsive photocatalyst, therefore both CZTS and CN can induce electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination.The interfacial electron transfer in underlying mechanism can follow a \"Type I heterojunction transfer\" or a \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. In \"Type I heterojunction transfer\", upon visible light illumination, the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs in CB and VB of CN will transfer to CB and VB of CZTS and the CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation would take place on the CB and VB of CZTS, respectively.Also, the CBP of CZTS is less negative than CO redox potential, only CH 4 would not be generated.As the matter of fact, all of the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination would be accumulated on the CZTS in the \"Type I heterojunction\" (Fig. 13), which does not improve the charge separation and also limits the photocatalytic efficiency.Thus \"Type I heterojunction\" mechanism is not feasible to explain the enhanced CH 4 yield rate. Beside, Z-scheme transfer mechanism is more appropriate to explain the enhanced solar to fuel conversion rate.Owing to higher work function ( Pt 5.56 eV), Pt nanoparticles has low Fermi level (E F 0.66 eV vs. NHE) and strong electron accepting ability for the photoinduced electrons.According to TEM analysis, the Pt nanoparticles are uniformly distributed over the CN sheets.As a result, the Pt nanoparticles work as a bridge to accept photoinduced electrons from CB of CZTS and holes from VB of CN, resulting in the formation of Z-scheme photocatalytic system.This improves the transmission of photoinduced charge and retain the stronger oxidationreduction abilities of the composite.Thus, owing to charge transmission bridge function of Pt, the accumulated electrons in CB of CN can strongly reduce CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes at the VB of CZTS participate in the oxidation of H 2 O into OH and H .Besides, the photoinduced electrons remaining in the CB of CZTS would directly participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and yield CH Eqs. ( 9) and (10) indicate the generation followed by trapping of photoinduced charge carriers by heterojunctions and Pt metal, consequently, increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.Eqs.(11) and (12) kinetically explain that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction takes place at CB and oxidation of H 2 O takes place at the VB by the activity of electrons and holes, respectively.Eqs. ( 13)- (15) show the generation of H 2, CO and CH 4 through the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Moreover, the Pt nanoparticles encapsulated over CN can store electron owing to its electron-sink feature, function as reduction active sites, which can suppress the photoinduced charge recombination rate, and the LSPR effect further helps to improve visible light adsorption and charge generation.Thus, the photocatalytic performance, particularly the yield of CH 4 is significantly improved because of enriched density of electrons on Pt.In general, the synergistic interaction of multiple charge-transfer channels comprising Z-scheme charge transfer, LSPR and electron sink effects of Pt nanoparticles that can together be responsible for an efficient photoinduced charge separation and surface site activation for CO 2 reduction, which ultimately improves the photocatalytic performance."}, {"llm generation": "CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst", "source": "The CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst having straddling band configuration exhibits a superior CO 2 reduction performance with average CO/CH 4 yield rates of 17.351/7.961mol g -1 h -1 under visible light illumination, which is 3.31 and 5.56 folds higher than pristine CN.", "context": "In this study a novel CN based heterojunction photocatalyst having Pt and CZTS cocatalyst is prepared by a facile two-step approach with excellent photocatalytic properties.The CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst having straddling band configuration exhibits a superior CO 2 reduction performance with average CO/CH 4 yield rates of 17.351/7.961mol g -1 h -1 under visible light illumination, which is 3.31 and 5.56 folds higher than pristine CN.The comprehensive investigation demonstrates the enhanced photocatalytic performance may be ascribed to following four reasons: (i) higher specific surface area (57.68 m 2 /g) providing plentiful active sites for photocatalytic reaction, (ii) extended light absorption of CN owing to decorated Pt and CZTS cocatalyst, (iii) multistep interfacial photoinduced charge transfer, and (iv) effective separation efficiency across CZTS and CN owing to electron-sink function of Pt.The synergistic interaction of multiple charge-transfer channels comprising Z-scheme charge transfer, LSPR and electron-sink functions of Pt nanoparticles that can together be responsible for an efficient photoinduced charge separation and surface site activation for CO 2 reduction and ultimately improves the photocatalytic performance.This work is very significant that provides a simple way to design a high-performance heterojunction photocatalyst under the synergetic action of Pt and CZTS.

As can be seen the pristine CN showed two characteristic peaks centered at 12.92and 27.36, corresponding to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) plane of CN (JCPDS 87-1526).The lower characteristic peak centered at 13.1attributes the interlayer stacking of aromatic system, while the intense peak centered at 27.41a ttributes the in-plane periodicity distance of heptazine units 14,30.In the XRD patterns of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), no obvious diffraction peak of Pt was observed, which may be due to low content and uniform dispersion of Pt over the CN sheets (Fig. 2(a)).Besides, this could also be due to electronic synergetic effect and formation of perfect alloy leading to the reduction of the (111) plane of Pt.Furthermore, a small decrease in intensity with a slight shift in the peak at 27.36t owards a higher degree was observed owing to introduction of Pt nanoparticles.This is probably due to a distortion in the CN layer structure as a consequence of Pt nanoparticles addition.Besides that, no significant change in crystal structure was observed.In addition, the best photocatalytic performance was shown by 3 wt PCN (Fig. 11), Therefore, the CZTS nanoparticles were further loaded on the 3 wt PCN sample.As can see in Fig. 2(b), the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the diffraction peaks centered at 28.6, 31.7,48.34and 56.15, which can be well indexed to (1 1 2), ( 200), ( 220) and (312) planes corresponding to kesterite structure of CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575), reflecting the coexistence of both phases, CZTS and CN, attributing to successful hybridization of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.Notably, narrow diffraction peaks corresponding to (002) plane of interplanar stacking and (112) plane of kesterite CZTS are attributing a large crystallite size of the hybrid composite 31.In addition, the XRD results suggest that the synthesized samples mainly contain graphitic carbon nitride.The average crystallite sizes of all samples are calculated by Scherrer equation: where D, k, , , and B represent average crystallite size (nm), crystallite shape factor (0.9), X-ray wavelength (Cu K 1.5418A), the full-width at half maximum intensity in XRD (red), and brag's angle, respectively.The calculated average crystallite size of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt) and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst vary in the range of 8.57-18.39nm, see Table 1.The increase of average crystallite size can be attributed to the annealing temperature effect on the crystallite size, which leads to aggregation of particles 31,32.It is well-known that the smaller crystallite size (and thus, higher surface area) is associated with improvement in reaction of gaseous molecules on the surface owing to plentiful active sites, which further improves the photocatalytic performance of a potential photocatalyst by higher separation and rapid charge transfer of photoinduced charge carrier to the semiconductor interface 33.The XRD pattern of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The surface morphology and microstructure of all samples characterized by employing SEM and TEM are presented in Fig. 3.The pristine CN shows thick and irregular 2D nanosheet-like structure with a considerably large size (Fig. 3(a)), whereas the CZTS nanoparticles are comprised of flower-like agglomerates that have been composed of a large number of nanoplates with a size in the range of 100-150 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(b).The xPCN composites exhibit stacked, curly, twodimensional (2D) nanosheet-like structure with a particle size of several nanometers, different from pristine CN consisted of solid agglomerates (Fig. 3(c-e)).In addition, Pt nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of CN nanosheets and no obvious variation in surface morphology of Pt-integrated composites is observed with the increasing amount of Pt content.In the case of CZTS loaded 3 wt PCN, the hybrid composite is irregularly agglomerated having approximately spherical particles with an average diameter of tens to hundreds of nanometer, as shown in Fig. 3(f).Furthermore, the hybrid composite has clear incorporation and coating of flower-like CZTS nanoparticles on the 3 wt PCN nanosheets, which is confirmed by the EDS and elemental mapping.Fig. 3(g) show the EDS spectra, whereas the elemental mapping of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst confirms that the hybrid composite is composed of C, N, Pt, Cu, Zn, Sn, and S elements.Furthermore, Pt and CZTS nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of CN nanosheets (Fig. 3(h)). The TEM and High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst are presented in Fig. 4. The TEM image in Fig. 4(a) shows that the CN has fibrous and porous structure of thin sheet.From HRTEM image of 3 wt PCN in Fig. 4(a), Pt nanoparticles can be clearly distinguished with lattice spacing determined as 0.22 nm, belonging to (111) plan of metallic Pt.On the other hand, Fig. 4(b and b) confirm the flower-like structure with a lattice spacing of 0.313 nm indexed to (112) plane of kesterite CZTS nanoparticles.As shown in Fig. 4(c), the CN exhibits the fibrous and sheet-like morphology that acts as substrate for deposition of Pt and CZTS nanoparticles, while the dark parts located on the layered structure are assigned to CZTS nanoparticles having an obvious agglomeration.Furthermore, the TEM confirms the random distribution of Pt nanoparticles with particle size of less the 10 nm, decorated over the CN sheets.The HRTEM further shows the lattice fringe of hybrid composite with lattice spacing of 0.32 nm, suggesting that the sample is mainly CN.The lattice spacing of 0.22 nm and 0.31 nm can be well-indexed to (111) plan of metallic Pt, and (112) plane to kesterite CZTS nanoparticles, respectively (Fig. 4(c)).Moreover, the closely bounded lattice fringes attribute to the existence of intimate interface (shown by white dotted line) between 3 wt PCN and CZTS nanoparticles which could leads to effective interfacial transfer of photoinduced charge carrier transfer between CZTS nanoparticles and 3 wt PCN and hinder the probability of charge recombination over the surface of photocatalyst, thus to improve the photocatalytic performance. The FTIR spectroscopy was employed to characterize the functional groups, organic, inorganic species and related inter-and intra-bonding present in the CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, see presented in Fig. 5(a).All samples show a common intense band in the range of 3000-3500 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the stretching modes of residual primary, secondary amine groups and OeH stretching modes of adsorbed water 5,30.A series of peaks located between 1200-1700 cm -1 are associated with sp 3 CeN breathing modes and sp 2 CN stretching vibrations in heterocycles 343536.For all samples, the band appeared around 809-813 cm -1 is related to typical breathing mode of the triazine unit, whereas the characteristic peak around 887 cm -1 is attributed to NeH deformation modes 5,35.Moreover, the FTIR spectrum of hybrid composite shows some peaks emerging around 439, 1090 and 1735 cm -1 , which could be assigned to the stretching mode of ZneN, CS and CO bands, respectively, corresponding to the presence of CZTS in the composite 11,37,38.According to FTIR results, it has been found that after Pt and CZTS nanoparticles loading over CN, no significant damage in the basic carbon nitride structural framework was observed by either nanostructural design or surface modification, ascribing that the present CZTS and Pt modified counterpart were graphitic phase, agreeing with the previous XRD results 22,30.The FTIR spectra of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was employed to study the optical properties of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt ), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the pristine CN shows an absorption edge located around 450 nm with an estimated bandgap of 2.8 eV, consistent with previously reported value 13,14,39.After photo-deposition with Pt nanoparticles with different wt, the PCN samples exhibit a reasonably enhanced visible absorption, which may be attributed to Schottky junction across CN/Pt and surface-plasmon-resonance (SPR) effect of Pt, which is resulted from the interaction between the photons with photo-excited electrons on the Pt surface 25,40.No notable shift in absorption edges of the composites was observed, suggesting that Pt only deposits on the surface of CN instead of being incorporated into the lattice of CN, which is in good agreement with the XRD results.The combination of CZTS and 3 wt PCN shows a significantly enhanced visible absorption in the whole visible region, which means enhanced visible light absorption results in more electron-hole pairs generation, which is beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance 21.The DRS spectra of CZTS and absorbance spectra of Pt nanoparticles are displayed in supporting information (Fig. S3).The obtained results demonstrate that the encapsulation of CZTS nanoparticles can extend the optical absorption range of 3 wt PCN composite and Pt nanoparticles could facilitate the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers across CN and CZTS to their surfaces for photoreduction of CO 2 . Estimation of the conduction band potential (CBP) and valance band potential (VBP) is vibrant to understand the underlying mechanism of photoinduced charge transfer and separation in a potential photocatalytic composite for photocatalytic reaction.The CBP and VBP of CN and CZTS are calculated using the following equations 39, where E VB , E CB , X, E C and E g are conduction band potential, valance band potential, electronegativity (X CN 6.39 eV and X CZTS 4.80 eV), the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale (4.5 eV) and bandgap of semiconductors (2.8 eV of CN and 1.52 eV for CZTS), respectively.The estimated VBP of CN and CZTS are 1.51 and 1.06 eV, respectively.The calculated CBP of CN and CZTS are -1.22 and -0.46 eV, respectively.The calculated band potentials suggest a type I heterojunction, which is that the CBP and VBP of the CZTS in straddling alignment with the CN, is formed in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst. The schematic illustration of band structures of CN and CZTS is presented in Fig. 6(a).The Fermi level of CN and CZTS straddles the Fermi level of platinum at 0.66 eV.This allows band structure bending at the interfaces of CN-Pt and Pt-CZTS, which makes the migration of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs more efficient.Fig. 6(b) shows that the CBP of CZTS is lower compared to the reduction potential of CO (-0.53 eV), suggesting that only CH 4 yield can instigated by the photoinduced electron.If the photoinduced electrons in CB of CN migrate to CB of CZTS following the conventional \"type-I heterojunction\", all the photoinduced electrons will be accumulated on CZTS.Subsequently, charge recombination rate will increase and thus, limit the photocatalytic efficiency together with no CO yield.As Pt works as a bridge to accelerate the charge transportation between CN and CZTS, the hybrid composite follows the \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. Fig. 7(a) exhibits N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.All three samples show the type IV isotherms with H 3 hysteresis loops, indicating that the samples have mesoporous structure.The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameters for all the samples are enlisted in Table 1.A BET surface area of 7.9 m 2 g -1 was obtained for pristine CN increased to 9.35 m 2 g -1 in PCN composite, while it was further increased to 28.68 m 2 g -1 in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.This three times increase in specific surface area of heterojunction photocatalyst is due to the introduction of high specific surface CZTS nanoparticles.The pore volumes of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were 0.041, 0.086 and 0.165 cm 3 g -1 , respectively.Thus, larger surface area may contribute to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the prepared sample 39.The BET isotherm of only CZTS is presented in supporting information (Fig. S4). It is known fact that the CO 2 adsorption onto the photocatalyst surface is prerequisites to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To optimize the adsorption capacity and stability, the adsorption configuration and adsorption strength of CO 2 are critical features, similar to the surface area 10,13.Typically, the CO 2 adsorption isotherms were used to analyze the CO 2 adsorption of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/ 3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 7(b).The results show that the pristine CN has a weak CO 2 adsorption capacity at a relative pressure of 1.The 3 wt PCN composite exhibited better CO 2 adsorption capacity then pristine CN under similar conditions.Since flower-like CZTS nanoparticles are more active which provide more sites for CO 2 adsorption to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As a result, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of PCN composite was further enhanced by CZTS incorporation.According to BET results, the 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst have the higher specific surface area and pore volume, and consequently, exhibit superior CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of pristine CN.Thus, a combination of textural and surface guest modification is an effective approach to improve the adsorption capability of CN-based photocatalyst 11.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of all samples are presented in Table 1. Generally, photoinduced charge recombination leads to PL spectral emission and therefore PL emission spectra are beneficial to understand the transfer, migration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers 41.The Photoluminescence emission (PL) was performed to study the photoinduced charge recombination rate, see Fig. 8(a).It can be seen that the pristine CN exhibits the highest PL intensity as a result of the charge carriers generation upon absorption of photons, which leads to instigate the photocatalytic activity 42.However, after photo-deposition of Pt nanoparticles, a significant decrease in PL intensity can be seen, much lower than pristine CN because charge separation efficiency is improved owing to the electron sink function of Pt nanoparticles.A significant decrease in PL intensity was observed by the hybrid composite compared to the other samples, indicating the higher number of electrons with the highest separation efficiency to perform the photoreduction of CO 2 . In order to further confirm the suppressed charge recombination by means of their emission lifetime, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was performed.Fig. 8(b) shows that all spectra exhibit a doubleexponential decay and that the CZ/3 wt PCN has slightly slower fluorescent decay kinetics than that of pristine CN.The average lifetime was calculated by the following equation. where 1 and 2 are the emission lifetime, A 1 and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.The average lifetimes values were 6.65 ns, 6.90 ns and 7.42 ns for pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, respectively, which suggested that owing to electron reservoir function of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles, the hybrid composite has slower PL decay with longer average lifetime than pristine CN.The slower PL decay is indicative of an increased number of charge carriers with a longer lifetime which in turn results in an improved accessibility of the charge carriers to the surface of the hybrid composite 6,43.The determined values support the PL results. In order to understand the photoinduced charge recombination and separation process in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, the photoelectrochemical properties were investigated through the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).It is well known that the increase in electrical conductivity of pristine CN could lead to improve the charge carrier density.Fig. 8(c) shows the transient photocurrent response of all samples under visible light illumination for several on-off cycles.It can be seen that the photocurrent response goes down to zero immediately once the light turns off and returns to a constant value when the light turns on again.In addition, the photocurrent response is reproducible under visible light illumination, which implies an efficient transfer of photoinduced electrons to the surface of the sample and generates photocurrent.Owing to its wide bandgap, relatively weakest photocurrent response was exhibited by the pristine CN.Furthermore, the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst sample showed the highest photocurrent response compared to those of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.The maximum photocurrent response of each cycle is nearly the same and stable under the visible light exposure.This suggest that the visible light activated CZTS leads to improve the light absorption, increases the charge collection efficiency whereas, Pt improves separation efficiency and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, which is in good agreement with the DRS and PL results. Typical EIS results as Nyquist plots of all three samples are shown in Fig. 8(d).In fact, the Nyquist impedance arc reflects a semicircle feature, indicating the charge transfer across the interface of electrode/ electrolyte 21.Besides, the semicircle with smaller diameter/radius attributes to the effective charge transfer and separation across the electrode/electrolyte interface 44.As can be seen from Fig. 8(d), the radius of Nyquist impedance arc of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is significantly smaller compared with those Nyquist impedance arcs of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.This indicates that the CZ/3 wt PCN heterostructure composite retains the fastest charge transfer rate with effective inhibition of charge recombination across CZTS, Pt and CN. To validate the interfacial properties, the PEC properties of CN, 3 wt PCN, CZTS and CZ/3 wt PCN electrodes were investigated by measuring the current-voltage (I-V) curves both in the dark and under visible light.As can see in Fig. 9(a), a small current observed in 3 wt PCN and CN under dark in a potential region of -4 V to 5 V.After visible light irradiation, an abrupt increase in photocurrent density in 3 wt PCN and CN was measured.In addition, the positive slopes may indicate that both CN and 3 wt PCN are n-type semiconductor 45,46.According to semiconductor theory, metal-semiconductor contacts lead to the creation of potential barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface, which could hinder the electron transfer between metal and semiconductor.Therefore, the Pt loading over CN anticipates a Schottky barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface.Similarly, a small current was measured in CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS in absence of light as can see in Fig. 9(b).Whereas, CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS show a significantly increased photocurrent density upon visible light irradiation.The current-voltage curves show that the devices work in nonohmic (Schottky) mode and approaching that of back to back diode, and ending with S-shape I-V curve 47.Fig. 9(b) exhibits a swift increase in current under light irradiation when compared to dark.This specifies that the addition of Pt and CZTS in CZ/3 wt PCN may improve the light absorption and in that way increases the current.Furthermore, a steady increase of the current with respect to the negative potential indicates the p-type character of CZTS 47,48. The chemical and electronic states of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst analyzed by XPS analysis are shown in Fig. 10.Typical survey spectra in Fig. 10(a 2 ), ascribing to the presence of Zn in 2 oxidation state.As for Sn 3d spectra (Fig. 10(d)), two peaks at 486.5 eV (Sn 3d 5/2 ) and 495 eV (Sn 3d 3/2 ), correspond the presence of Sn in 4 oxidation state.The S 2p spectra (Fig. 10(e)) shows the two characteristic peaks appeared at 160.5 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 161.7 eV (S 2p 1/2 ), indicative of the sulfur in the form of sulfide with -2 oxidation state.In Fig. 10(f), the C 1s region shows three deconvolution peaks appearing at 284.7 eV, 286.2 eV and 288 eV originated from sp3-bonded carbon C-NH 2 , graphitic CeC and sp 2 -bonded carbon of N-CN bonds, respectively.Deconvolution spectra of N 1s (Fig. 10(g)) exhibit three binding energies centered at 398.5 eV, 399.3 eV and 400.9 eV correspond to sp 2 hybridized N-containing aromatic ring (CeNC), sp 3 bonded N (N-C 3 ), and amino functional groups (N-NH x ), respectively.Fig. 10(h) shows the two binding energies located at 70.2 eV (Pt 4f 7/2 ) and 74.6 eV (Pt 4f 5/2 ), ascribing to the presence of Pt (II) 49.Generally, Pt 4f 7/2 binding energies corresponding to Pt, Pt 2 and Pt 4 are centered at 71.2 eV, 72.4 eV and 74.2 eV, respectively.In comparison with Pt, the corresponding binding energies of Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 in composite sample shifted towards lower binding energy in consequence of the strong metal carrier interaction led by the electron-transfer from CN to Pt (a strong metal support interaction (SMSI)) 50.In photocatalytic reaction, when CZ/3 wt PCN is used, Pt nanoparticles act as an electronshuttle mediator due to its excellent electrical conductivity favorable for charge transportation and improve the visible absorption properties owing to localized surface-plasmon-resonance (LSPR).The XPS spectra of CZTS (Fig. S5) is presented in supporting information. The gaseous products in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors (used as reduction reagent) over pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were evaluated and yield rates of CO (two-electron reduction product) and CH 4 (eight-electron reduction product) as main product under visible light illumination for 5 h are given in Fig. 11(a-c).The undesired H 2 yield was also observed due to water splitting.The CH 4 and H 2 yield rates increased more or less linearly at a constant rate, as can be seen in Fig. 11(a andc).On the other hand, the yield rate of CO was rapid in the first hour and then remained constant (Fig. 11(b)).According to time-dependent yield rates in 11(a-c), the average yield rates of gaseous products were evaluated and compared in Fig. 11(d).The pristine CN and CZTS exhibit relatively low CO/CH 4 yield rates of 5.238/ 1.431 mol g -1 h -1 and 0.799/0.615mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, owing to large surface area and higher photoinduced charge recombination rate.The crystalline and electronic structure of CN were tuned by altering the particle size of Pt nanoparticles.Generally, a decrease in particle size leads to an increase in low-coordinated surface sites 51.Furthermore, the size-dependent properties are also associated with metal oxidation states.Therefore, under the similar conditions, the CO and CH 4 yield rates of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt) were considerably enhanced and systematic studies show that 3 wt PCN exhibits the highest CO/CH 4 yield rates of 13.028/5.455mol g -1 h -1 under visible-light illumination, 2.48/3.81folds higher than pristine CN.The improved photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of 3 wt PCN composite can be ascribed to large specific surface area, localized surface-plasmon-resonance effect by of Pt, electron-sink function of Pt, the formation of Schottky barrier 25,40 and effective photoinduced charge separation.Interestingly, with visible light active CZTS encapsulation over 3 wt PCN composite, the CO/CH 4 yield rates were further enhanced, which were 3.31 and 5.56 folds higher than pristine CN.The CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the best photocatalytic performance: CO yield rate of 17.351 mol g -1 h -1 and CH 4 yield rate of 7.961 mol g -1 h -1 , several times higher than the yield rates of CO (5.238 mol g -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (1.431 mol g -1 h -1 ) by pristine CN, indicative of the superiority of the novel heterojunction photocatalyst in photoreduction of CO 2 .The significant enhancement in CO and CH 4 yield rates may be attributed to the synergistic effects of visible light active CZTS and Pt nanoparticles.The visible light activated CZTS has more active sites and shortened diffusion channel for charge transfer and separation which provides more active sites for CO 2 adsorption, whereas Pt nanoparticles accelerate the effective charge separation for the reductive reaction.Besides, the extended light absorption range, higher surface area, effective interfacial charge transfer and separation under visible light are key factors that are instigating the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 .In addition, the best H 2 yield rate of 147.231 mol g -1 h -1 by heterojunction photocatalyst was achieved, several times improved than pristine CN.The improved CO, CH 4 and H 2 yield rates by photocatalyst followed the order of CZ/3 wt PCN 3 wt PCN 5 wt PCN 1 wt PCN CN and can be attributed to higher surface area with multiple level porous structure, improved light absorption and electron-sink function by Pt nanoparticles which activate H 2 O whereas CN and CZTS intended to reduce the CO 2 .In addition, the photocatalytic performance of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was further compared with the previously reported results as illustrated in Table 2. Furthermore, three blank experiments and a 13 CO 2 -labeled isotopic experiment were also performed to verify that the CO and CH 4 were evolved only from CO 2 under following conditions: (i) under light irradiation, but without photocatalyst (ii) under dark with photocatalyst and (iii) under N 2 H 2 O vapors instead of CO 2 H 2 O vapors with photocatalyst.Almost zero yield of corresponding carbonaceous product was observed which indicates that CO and CH 4 are generated by CO 2 reduction over CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, suggesting that CO and CH 4 are mainly generated from CO 2 reduction.Besides, some other gaseous products like methanol (CH 3 OH) and formic acid (H 2 CO) were also detected on hybrid composite, yet their yield rates were relatively small. In addition, the stability of the heterojunction photocatalyst is evaluated within four consecutive cycles under the same conditions.After each test, the catalyst is refreshed and refreshed helium gas periodically replaced in each cycle.As shown in Fig. 12(a), no significant change in CO/CH 4 yield rates of the first and fourth cycle was observed, which indicates that CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst has excellent stability as it has the ability of CO 2 reduction after four cycles. In the isotopic experiment, the generated CO and CH 4 were analyzed by GC-MS and 13 CO 2 was used instead of 12 CO 2 , shown in Fig. S6 (supporting Information).According to the GC-MS spectra, the signals at m/z at 29 and 17 are indexed to 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , which further confirms that CO and CH 4 are produced from the CO 2 reduction on CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.According to Fig. 12(b), the CH 4 selectivity of all the samples is more than 50 in comparison with CO selectivity, attributing that the CH 4 is the main product evolving in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Furthermore, the apparent quantum yield based on the yield rates of carbonaceous products, CO and CH 4 over hybrid composite was calculated to be 0.408 and 0.749 , respectively, and the total AQY () was 1.157 for CO 2 conversion.The details of AQY () estimation of all samples are given in supporting information (Table S1). The structural changes and characteristics parameters of composite, before and after the photocatalytic reaction were studied by XRD and FTIR, respectively.As can be seen in Fig. 12(c), no significant phase decomposition in the XRD results of fresh and used CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was observed.Similarly, FTIR characteristics spectra peaks of fresh and used hybrid composite are almost same with a slight decline in absorption band intensities, ascribing to the trivial deactivation of functional sites of hybrid composite, as shown in Fig. 12(d).Thus, the heterojunction photocatalyst with sustained structure and functional groups attribute to its exceptional stability after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test. Based on the aforementioned results, a plausible underlying mechanism scheme of interfacial electron transfer in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is presented in Fig. 13.According to photoinduced charge transfer and separation (Eqs.6 and 7) of the photocatalytic composite, the CBP of CN (-1.22 eV) is higher compared to reduction potential of CH 4 (-0.24eV) and CO (-0.53 eV).On the other hand, the CBP of CZTS (-0.46 eV) is lower compared to reduction potential of CO (cannot proceed the CO yield by CO 2 reduction) and more negative than reduction potential of CH 4 5,48.While the VBP of both CN and CZTS is higher in comparison with the oxidation potential of H 2 O/O 2 52.Thus, the CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O into CO and CH 4 over the CN based catalysts is found to be thermodynamically feasible 53.Moreover, the DRS results reflect that the LSPR effects of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles can significantly enhance the visible absorption properties of hybrid composite.In addition, the plasmonic Pt nanoparticles supported over CN surface function as a charge transmission bridge and play a vital role in the electron exchange between CZTS and CN sheets. Since CZTS is a typical visible light photocatalyst and CN is partial visible light responsive photocatalyst, therefore both CZTS and CN can induce electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination.The interfacial electron transfer in underlying mechanism can follow a \"Type I heterojunction transfer\" or a \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. In \"Type I heterojunction transfer\", upon visible light illumination, the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs in CB and VB of CN will transfer to CB and VB of CZTS and the CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation would take place on the CB and VB of CZTS, respectively.Also, the CBP of CZTS is less negative than CO redox potential, only CH 4 would not be generated.As the matter of fact, all of the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination would be accumulated on the CZTS in the \"Type I heterojunction\" (Fig. 13), which does not improve the charge separation and also limits the photocatalytic efficiency.Thus \"Type I heterojunction\" mechanism is not feasible to explain the enhanced CH 4 yield rate. Beside, Z-scheme transfer mechanism is more appropriate to explain the enhanced solar to fuel conversion rate.Owing to higher work function ( Pt 5.56 eV), Pt nanoparticles has low Fermi level (E F 0.66 eV vs. NHE) and strong electron accepting ability for the photoinduced electrons.According to TEM analysis, the Pt nanoparticles are uniformly distributed over the CN sheets.As a result, the Pt nanoparticles work as a bridge to accept photoinduced electrons from CB of CZTS and holes from VB of CN, resulting in the formation of Z-scheme photocatalytic system.This improves the transmission of photoinduced charge and retain the stronger oxidationreduction abilities of the composite.Thus, owing to charge transmission bridge function of Pt, the accumulated electrons in CB of CN can strongly reduce CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes at the VB of CZTS participate in the oxidation of H 2 O into OH and H .Besides, the photoinduced electrons remaining in the CB of CZTS would directly participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and yield CH Eqs.

The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed according to our previous report 21.Briefly, the gas-phase CO 2 reduction was carried out in a lab built stainless-steel cylindrical reactor (total volume of 213 cm 3 ) with a quartz window at top, while high purity CO 2 (air products, 99.99 ) and H 2 O were employed as carbon source and reducing reagent, respectively (supporting information, Fig. S1).First, photocatalyst powder (0.1 g) was uniformly dispersed on a quart plate with an area of 53 cm 2 and placed in the reactor.The assembled reactor was replenished with pure CO 2 several times and vacuumed.Prior to photo-illumination, the CO 2 gas regulated by mass flow controller (MFC) was continuously purged through water bubbler (H 2 O/CO 2 vapor ratio 3.8 vol.) and resulting vapor mixture of CO 2 H 2 O was injected in the assembled reactor at 100 mL/min to saturate the catalyst.Later, the flow rate of CO 2 H 2 O vapor mixture was stabilized at 5.0 mL/min and the experiment was started by turning on a 400 W xenon solar lamp with 420 nm cut-off filter.The gaseous products (CO and CH 4 ) were taken regularly throughout for 8 h and analyzed by an Agilent GC-6890 N gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), serially connected with a capillary column (60 m 0.25 mm 0.25 m, Agilent JW Sci.USA).Helium was used as gas carrier with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.Furthermore, several blank experiments in dark and in the absence of CO 2 reagent were also carried out and pure N 2 with H 2 O vapors were used as a substitute for CO 2 H 2 O vapor.The stability of the photocatalysts was evaluated by repeating the same process for four times after each 1 h illumination without opening the photo-reactor during illumination.The photocatalytic products evolution during photocatalytic reaction were analyzed by FID as per standard curves.Prior to each experiment, the calibration with certified calibration gases was performed.In addition, the isotope tracer experiments using 13 CO 2 were performed on an Agilent MS-5973 GC-mass spectroscopy to verify the source of photocatalytic products.The selectivity of the photocatalytic products (CO and CH 4 ) was estimated with the following equations 6: (1) While, the apparent quantum yield of photocatalytic products (CO and CH 4 ) were calculated with the following equations:"}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The gaseous products in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors (used as reduction reagent) over pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were evaluated and yield rates of CO (two-electron reduction product) and CH 4 (eight-electron reduction product) as main product under visible light illumination for 5 h are given in Fig. 11(a-c).", "context": "The crystalline phase and structural features of all samples were investigated by XRD and shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen the pristine CN showed two characteristic peaks centered at 12.92and 27.36, corresponding to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) plane of CN (JCPDS 87-1526).The lower characteristic peak centered at 13.1attributes the interlayer stacking of aromatic system, while the intense peak centered at 27.41a ttributes the in-plane periodicity distance of heptazine units 14,30.In the XRD patterns of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), no obvious diffraction peak of Pt was observed, which may be due to low content and uniform dispersion of Pt over the CN sheets (Fig. 2(a)).Besides, this could also be due to electronic synergetic effect and formation of perfect alloy leading to the reduction of the (111) plane of Pt.Furthermore, a small decrease in intensity with a slight shift in the peak at 27.36t owards a higher degree was observed owing to introduction of Pt nanoparticles.This is probably due to a distortion in the CN layer structure as a consequence of Pt nanoparticles addition.Besides that, no significant change in crystal structure was observed.In addition, the best photocatalytic performance was shown by 3 wt PCN (Fig. 11), Therefore, the CZTS nanoparticles were further loaded on the 3 wt PCN sample.As can see in Fig. 2(b), the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the diffraction peaks centered at 28.6, 31.7,48.34and 56.15, which can be well indexed to (1 1 2), ( 200), ( 220) and (312) planes corresponding to kesterite structure of CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575), reflecting the coexistence of both phases, CZTS and CN, attributing to successful hybridization of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.Notably, narrow diffraction peaks corresponding to (002) plane of interplanar stacking and (112) plane of kesterite CZTS are attributing a large crystallite size of the hybrid composite 31.In addition, the XRD results suggest that the synthesized samples mainly contain graphitic carbon nitride.The average crystallite sizes of all samples are calculated by Scherrer equation: where D, k, , , and B represent average crystallite size (nm), crystallite shape factor (0.9), X-ray wavelength (Cu K 1.5418A), the full-width at half maximum intensity in XRD (red), and brag's angle, respectively.The calculated average crystallite size of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt) and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst vary in the range of 8.57-18.39nm, see Table 1.The increase of average crystallite size can be attributed to the annealing temperature effect on the crystallite size, which leads to aggregation of particles 31,32.It is well-known that the smaller crystallite size (and thus, higher surface area) is associated with improvement in reaction of gaseous molecules on the surface owing to plentiful active sites, which further improves the photocatalytic performance of a potential photocatalyst by higher separation and rapid charge transfer of photoinduced charge carrier to the semiconductor interface 33.The XRD pattern of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The surface morphology and microstructure of all samples characterized by employing SEM and TEM are presented in Fig. 3.The pristine CN shows thick and irregular 2D nanosheet-like structure with a considerably large size (Fig. 3(a)), whereas the CZTS nanoparticles are comprised of flower-like agglomerates that have been composed of a large number of nanoplates with a size in the range of 100-150 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(b).The xPCN composites exhibit stacked, curly, twodimensional (2D) nanosheet-like structure with a particle size of several nanometers, different from pristine CN consisted of solid agglomerates (Fig. 3(c-e)).In addition, Pt nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of CN nanosheets and no obvious variation in surface morphology of Pt-integrated composites is observed with the increasing amount of Pt content.In the case of CZTS loaded 3 wt PCN, the hybrid composite is irregularly agglomerated having approximately spherical particles with an average diameter of tens to hundreds of nanometer, as shown in Fig. 3(f).Furthermore, the hybrid composite has clear incorporation and coating of flower-like CZTS nanoparticles on the 3 wt PCN nanosheets, which is confirmed by the EDS and elemental mapping.Fig. 3(g) show the EDS spectra, whereas the elemental mapping of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst confirms that the hybrid composite is composed of C, N, Pt, Cu, Zn, Sn, and S elements.Furthermore, Pt and CZTS nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of CN nanosheets (Fig. 3(h)). The TEM and High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst are presented in Fig. 4. The TEM image in Fig. 4(a) shows that the CN has fibrous and porous structure of thin sheet.From HRTEM image of 3 wt PCN in Fig. 4(a), Pt nanoparticles can be clearly distinguished with lattice spacing determined as 0.22 nm, belonging to (111) plan of metallic Pt.On the other hand, Fig. 4(b and b) confirm the flower-like structure with a lattice spacing of 0.313 nm indexed to (112) plane of kesterite CZTS nanoparticles.As shown in Fig. 4(c), the CN exhibits the fibrous and sheet-like morphology that acts as substrate for deposition of Pt and CZTS nanoparticles, while the dark parts located on the layered structure are assigned to CZTS nanoparticles having an obvious agglomeration.Furthermore, the TEM confirms the random distribution of Pt nanoparticles with particle size of less the 10 nm, decorated over the CN sheets.The HRTEM further shows the lattice fringe of hybrid composite with lattice spacing of 0.32 nm, suggesting that the sample is mainly CN.The lattice spacing of 0.22 nm and 0.31 nm can be well-indexed to (111) plan of metallic Pt, and (112) plane to kesterite CZTS nanoparticles, respectively (Fig. 4(c)).Moreover, the closely bounded lattice fringes attribute to the existence of intimate interface (shown by white dotted line) between 3 wt PCN and CZTS nanoparticles which could leads to effective interfacial transfer of photoinduced charge carrier transfer between CZTS nanoparticles and 3 wt PCN and hinder the probability of charge recombination over the surface of photocatalyst, thus to improve the photocatalytic performance. The FTIR spectroscopy was employed to characterize the functional groups, organic, inorganic species and related inter-and intra-bonding present in the CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, see presented in Fig. 5(a).All samples show a common intense band in the range of 3000-3500 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the stretching modes of residual primary, secondary amine groups and OeH stretching modes of adsorbed water 5,30.A series of peaks located between 1200-1700 cm -1 are associated with sp 3 CeN breathing modes and sp 2 CN stretching vibrations in heterocycles 343536.For all samples, the band appeared around 809-813 cm -1 is related to typical breathing mode of the triazine unit, whereas the characteristic peak around 887 cm -1 is attributed to NeH deformation modes 5,35.Moreover, the FTIR spectrum of hybrid composite shows some peaks emerging around 439, 1090 and 1735 cm -1 , which could be assigned to the stretching mode of ZneN, CS and CO bands, respectively, corresponding to the presence of CZTS in the composite 11,37,38.According to FTIR results, it has been found that after Pt and CZTS nanoparticles loading over CN, no significant damage in the basic carbon nitride structural framework was observed by either nanostructural design or surface modification, ascribing that the present CZTS and Pt modified counterpart were graphitic phase, agreeing with the previous XRD results 22,30.The FTIR spectra of CZTS nanoparticles is presented in supporting information (Fig. S2). The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was employed to study the optical properties of pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3 and 5 wt ), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.As shown in Fig. 5(b), the pristine CN shows an absorption edge located around 450 nm with an estimated bandgap of 2.8 eV, consistent with previously reported value 13,14,39.After photo-deposition with Pt nanoparticles with different wt, the PCN samples exhibit a reasonably enhanced visible absorption, which may be attributed to Schottky junction across CN/Pt and surface-plasmon-resonance (SPR) effect of Pt, which is resulted from the interaction between the photons with photo-excited electrons on the Pt surface 25,40.No notable shift in absorption edges of the composites was observed, suggesting that Pt only deposits on the surface of CN instead of being incorporated into the lattice of CN, which is in good agreement with the XRD results.The combination of CZTS and 3 wt PCN shows a significantly enhanced visible absorption in the whole visible region, which means enhanced visible light absorption results in more electron-hole pairs generation, which is beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance 21.The DRS spectra of CZTS and absorbance spectra of Pt nanoparticles are displayed in supporting information (Fig. S3).The obtained results demonstrate that the encapsulation of CZTS nanoparticles can extend the optical absorption range of 3 wt PCN composite and Pt nanoparticles could facilitate the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers across CN and CZTS to their surfaces for photoreduction of CO 2 . Estimation of the conduction band potential (CBP) and valance band potential (VBP) is vibrant to understand the underlying mechanism of photoinduced charge transfer and separation in a potential photocatalytic composite for photocatalytic reaction.The CBP and VBP of CN and CZTS are calculated using the following equations 39, where E VB , E CB , X, E C and E g are conduction band potential, valance band potential, electronegativity (X CN 6.39 eV and X CZTS 4.80 eV), the energy of free electrons on hydrogen scale (4.5 eV) and bandgap of semiconductors (2.8 eV of CN and 1.52 eV for CZTS), respectively.The estimated VBP of CN and CZTS are 1.51 and 1.06 eV, respectively.The calculated CBP of CN and CZTS are -1.22 and -0.46 eV, respectively.The calculated band potentials suggest a type I heterojunction, which is that the CBP and VBP of the CZTS in straddling alignment with the CN, is formed in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst. The schematic illustration of band structures of CN and CZTS is presented in Fig. 6(a).The Fermi level of CN and CZTS straddles the Fermi level of platinum at 0.66 eV.This allows band structure bending at the interfaces of CN-Pt and Pt-CZTS, which makes the migration of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs more efficient.Fig. 6(b) shows that the CBP of CZTS is lower compared to the reduction potential of CO (-0.53 eV), suggesting that only CH 4 yield can instigated by the photoinduced electron.If the photoinduced electrons in CB of CN migrate to CB of CZTS following the conventional \"type-I heterojunction\", all the photoinduced electrons will be accumulated on CZTS.Subsequently, charge recombination rate will increase and thus, limit the photocatalytic efficiency together with no CO yield.As Pt works as a bridge to accelerate the charge transportation between CN and CZTS, the hybrid composite follows the \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. Fig. 7(a) exhibits N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.All three samples show the type IV isotherms with H 3 hysteresis loops, indicating that the samples have mesoporous structure.The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameters for all the samples are enlisted in Table 1.A BET surface area of 7.9 m 2 g -1 was obtained for pristine CN increased to 9.35 m 2 g -1 in PCN composite, while it was further increased to 28.68 m 2 g -1 in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.This three times increase in specific surface area of heterojunction photocatalyst is due to the introduction of high specific surface CZTS nanoparticles.The pore volumes of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were 0.041, 0.086 and 0.165 cm 3 g -1 , respectively.Thus, larger surface area may contribute to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the prepared sample 39.The BET isotherm of only CZTS is presented in supporting information (Fig. S4). It is known fact that the CO 2 adsorption onto the photocatalyst surface is prerequisites to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To optimize the adsorption capacity and stability, the adsorption configuration and adsorption strength of CO 2 are critical features, similar to the surface area 10,13.Typically, the CO 2 adsorption isotherms were used to analyze the CO 2 adsorption of pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/ 3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 7(b).The results show that the pristine CN has a weak CO 2 adsorption capacity at a relative pressure of 1.The 3 wt PCN composite exhibited better CO 2 adsorption capacity then pristine CN under similar conditions.Since flower-like CZTS nanoparticles are more active which provide more sites for CO 2 adsorption to instigate the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.As a result, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of PCN composite was further enhanced by CZTS incorporation.According to BET results, the 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst have the higher specific surface area and pore volume, and consequently, exhibit superior CO 2 adsorption capacity than that of pristine CN.Thus, a combination of textural and surface guest modification is an effective approach to improve the adsorption capability of CN-based photocatalyst 11.The CO 2 adsorption capacities of all samples are presented in Table 1. Generally, photoinduced charge recombination leads to PL spectral emission and therefore PL emission spectra are beneficial to understand the transfer, migration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers 41.The Photoluminescence emission (PL) was performed to study the photoinduced charge recombination rate, see Fig. 8(a).It can be seen that the pristine CN exhibits the highest PL intensity as a result of the charge carriers generation upon absorption of photons, which leads to instigate the photocatalytic activity 42.However, after photo-deposition of Pt nanoparticles, a significant decrease in PL intensity can be seen, much lower than pristine CN because charge separation efficiency is improved owing to the electron sink function of Pt nanoparticles.A significant decrease in PL intensity was observed by the hybrid composite compared to the other samples, indicating the higher number of electrons with the highest separation efficiency to perform the photoreduction of CO 2 . In order to further confirm the suppressed charge recombination by means of their emission lifetime, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was performed.Fig. 8(b) shows that all spectra exhibit a doubleexponential decay and that the CZ/3 wt PCN has slightly slower fluorescent decay kinetics than that of pristine CN.The average lifetime was calculated by the following equation. where 1 and 2 are the emission lifetime, A 1 and A 2 are the corresponding amplitudes.The average lifetimes values were 6.65 ns, 6.90 ns and 7.42 ns for pristine CN, 3 wt PCN and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, respectively, which suggested that owing to electron reservoir function of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles, the hybrid composite has slower PL decay with longer average lifetime than pristine CN.The slower PL decay is indicative of an increased number of charge carriers with a longer lifetime which in turn results in an improved accessibility of the charge carriers to the surface of the hybrid composite 6,43.The determined values support the PL results. In order to understand the photoinduced charge recombination and separation process in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, the photoelectrochemical properties were investigated through the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).It is well known that the increase in electrical conductivity of pristine CN could lead to improve the charge carrier density.Fig. 8(c) shows the transient photocurrent response of all samples under visible light illumination for several on-off cycles.It can be seen that the photocurrent response goes down to zero immediately once the light turns off and returns to a constant value when the light turns on again.In addition, the photocurrent response is reproducible under visible light illumination, which implies an efficient transfer of photoinduced electrons to the surface of the sample and generates photocurrent.Owing to its wide bandgap, relatively weakest photocurrent response was exhibited by the pristine CN.Furthermore, the CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst sample showed the highest photocurrent response compared to those of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.The maximum photocurrent response of each cycle is nearly the same and stable under the visible light exposure.This suggest that the visible light activated CZTS leads to improve the light absorption, increases the charge collection efficiency whereas, Pt improves separation efficiency and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, which is in good agreement with the DRS and PL results. Typical EIS results as Nyquist plots of all three samples are shown in Fig. 8(d).In fact, the Nyquist impedance arc reflects a semicircle feature, indicating the charge transfer across the interface of electrode/ electrolyte 21.Besides, the semicircle with smaller diameter/radius attributes to the effective charge transfer and separation across the electrode/electrolyte interface 44.As can be seen from Fig. 8(d), the radius of Nyquist impedance arc of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is significantly smaller compared with those Nyquist impedance arcs of 3 wt PCN and pristine CN.This indicates that the CZ/3 wt PCN heterostructure composite retains the fastest charge transfer rate with effective inhibition of charge recombination across CZTS, Pt and CN. To validate the interfacial properties, the PEC properties of CN, 3 wt PCN, CZTS and CZ/3 wt PCN electrodes were investigated by measuring the current-voltage (I-V) curves both in the dark and under visible light.As can see in Fig. 9(a), a small current observed in 3 wt PCN and CN under dark in a potential region of -4 V to 5 V.After visible light irradiation, an abrupt increase in photocurrent density in 3 wt PCN and CN was measured.In addition, the positive slopes may indicate that both CN and 3 wt PCN are n-type semiconductor 45,46.According to semiconductor theory, metal-semiconductor contacts lead to the creation of potential barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface, which could hinder the electron transfer between metal and semiconductor.Therefore, the Pt loading over CN anticipates a Schottky barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface.Similarly, a small current was measured in CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS in absence of light as can see in Fig. 9(b).Whereas, CZ/3 wt PCN and CZTS show a significantly increased photocurrent density upon visible light irradiation.The current-voltage curves show that the devices work in nonohmic (Schottky) mode and approaching that of back to back diode, and ending with S-shape I-V curve 47.Fig. 9(b) exhibits a swift increase in current under light irradiation when compared to dark.This specifies that the addition of Pt and CZTS in CZ/3 wt PCN may improve the light absorption and in that way increases the current.Furthermore, a steady increase of the current with respect to the negative potential indicates the p-type character of CZTS 47,48. The chemical and electronic states of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst analyzed by XPS analysis are shown in Fig. 10.Typical survey spectra in Fig. 10(a 2 ), ascribing to the presence of Zn in 2 oxidation state.As for Sn 3d spectra (Fig. 10(d)), two peaks at 486.5 eV (Sn 3d 5/2 ) and 495 eV (Sn 3d 3/2 ), correspond the presence of Sn in 4 oxidation state.The S 2p spectra (Fig. 10(e)) shows the two characteristic peaks appeared at 160.5 eV (S 2p 3/2 ) and 161.7 eV (S 2p 1/2 ), indicative of the sulfur in the form of sulfide with -2 oxidation state.In Fig. 10(f), the C 1s region shows three deconvolution peaks appearing at 284.7 eV, 286.2 eV and 288 eV originated from sp3-bonded carbon C-NH 2 , graphitic CeC and sp 2 -bonded carbon of N-CN bonds, respectively.Deconvolution spectra of N 1s (Fig. 10(g)) exhibit three binding energies centered at 398.5 eV, 399.3 eV and 400.9 eV correspond to sp 2 hybridized N-containing aromatic ring (CeNC), sp 3 bonded N (N-C 3 ), and amino functional groups (N-NH x ), respectively.Fig. 10(h) shows the two binding energies located at 70.2 eV (Pt 4f 7/2 ) and 74.6 eV (Pt 4f 5/2 ), ascribing to the presence of Pt (II) 49.Generally, Pt 4f 7/2 binding energies corresponding to Pt, Pt 2 and Pt 4 are centered at 71.2 eV, 72.4 eV and 74.2 eV, respectively.In comparison with Pt, the corresponding binding energies of Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 in composite sample shifted towards lower binding energy in consequence of the strong metal carrier interaction led by the electron-transfer from CN to Pt (a strong metal support interaction (SMSI)) 50.In photocatalytic reaction, when CZ/3 wt PCN is used, Pt nanoparticles act as an electronshuttle mediator due to its excellent electrical conductivity favorable for charge transportation and improve the visible absorption properties owing to localized surface-plasmon-resonance (LSPR).The XPS spectra of CZTS (Fig. S5) is presented in supporting information. The gaseous products in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapors (used as reduction reagent) over pristine CN, xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt), and CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst were evaluated and yield rates of CO (two-electron reduction product) and CH 4 (eight-electron reduction product) as main product under visible light illumination for 5 h are given in Fig. 11(a-c).The undesired H 2 yield was also observed due to water splitting.The CH 4 and H 2 yield rates increased more or less linearly at a constant rate, as can be seen in Fig. 11(a andc).On the other hand, the yield rate of CO was rapid in the first hour and then remained constant (Fig. 11(b)).According to time-dependent yield rates in 11(a-c), the average yield rates of gaseous products were evaluated and compared in Fig. 11(d).The pristine CN and CZTS exhibit relatively low CO/CH 4 yield rates of 5.238/ 1.431 mol g -1 h -1 and 0.799/0.615mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, owing to large surface area and higher photoinduced charge recombination rate.The crystalline and electronic structure of CN were tuned by altering the particle size of Pt nanoparticles.Generally, a decrease in particle size leads to an increase in low-coordinated surface sites 51.Furthermore, the size-dependent properties are also associated with metal oxidation states.Therefore, under the similar conditions, the CO and CH 4 yield rates of xPCN (x 1, 3, and 5 wt) were considerably enhanced and systematic studies show that 3 wt PCN exhibits the highest CO/CH 4 yield rates of 13.028/5.455mol g -1 h -1 under visible-light illumination, 2.48/3.81folds higher than pristine CN.The improved photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of 3 wt PCN composite can be ascribed to large specific surface area, localized surface-plasmon-resonance effect by of Pt, electron-sink function of Pt, the formation of Schottky barrier 25,40 and effective photoinduced charge separation.Interestingly, with visible light active CZTS encapsulation over 3 wt PCN composite, the CO/CH 4 yield rates were further enhanced, which were 3.31 and 5.56 folds higher than pristine CN.The CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst shows the best photocatalytic performance: CO yield rate of 17.351 mol g -1 h -1 and CH 4 yield rate of 7.961 mol g -1 h -1 , several times higher than the yield rates of CO (5.238 mol g -1 h -1 ) and CH 4 (1.431 mol g -1 h -1 ) by pristine CN, indicative of the superiority of the novel heterojunction photocatalyst in photoreduction of CO 2 .The significant enhancement in CO and CH 4 yield rates may be attributed to the synergistic effects of visible light active CZTS and Pt nanoparticles.The visible light activated CZTS has more active sites and shortened diffusion channel for charge transfer and separation which provides more active sites for CO 2 adsorption, whereas Pt nanoparticles accelerate the effective charge separation for the reductive reaction.Besides, the extended light absorption range, higher surface area, effective interfacial charge transfer and separation under visible light are key factors that are instigating the enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 .In addition, the best H 2 yield rate of 147.231 mol g -1 h -1 by heterojunction photocatalyst was achieved, several times improved than pristine CN.The improved CO, CH 4 and H 2 yield rates by photocatalyst followed the order of CZ/3 wt PCN 3 wt PCN 5 wt PCN 1 wt PCN CN and can be attributed to higher surface area with multiple level porous structure, improved light absorption and electron-sink function by Pt nanoparticles which activate H 2 O whereas CN and CZTS intended to reduce the CO 2 .In addition, the photocatalytic performance of CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was further compared with the previously reported results as illustrated in Table 2. Furthermore, three blank experiments and a 13 CO 2 -labeled isotopic experiment were also performed to verify that the CO and CH 4 were evolved only from CO 2 under following conditions: (i) under light irradiation, but without photocatalyst (ii) under dark with photocatalyst and (iii) under N 2 H 2 O vapors instead of CO 2 H 2 O vapors with photocatalyst.Almost zero yield of corresponding carbonaceous product was observed which indicates that CO and CH 4 are generated by CO 2 reduction over CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst, suggesting that CO and CH 4 are mainly generated from CO 2 reduction.Besides, some other gaseous products like methanol (CH 3 OH) and formic acid (H 2 CO) were also detected on hybrid composite, yet their yield rates were relatively small. In addition, the stability of the heterojunction photocatalyst is evaluated within four consecutive cycles under the same conditions.After each test, the catalyst is refreshed and refreshed helium gas periodically replaced in each cycle.As shown in Fig. 12(a), no significant change in CO/CH 4 yield rates of the first and fourth cycle was observed, which indicates that CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst has excellent stability as it has the ability of CO 2 reduction after four cycles. In the isotopic experiment, the generated CO and CH 4 were analyzed by GC-MS and 13 CO 2 was used instead of 12 CO 2 , shown in Fig. S6 (supporting Information).According to the GC-MS spectra, the signals at m/z at 29 and 17 are indexed to 13 CO and 13 CH 4 , which further confirms that CO and CH 4 are produced from the CO 2 reduction on CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst.According to Fig. 12(b), the CH 4 selectivity of all the samples is more than 50 in comparison with CO selectivity, attributing that the CH 4 is the main product evolving in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test.Furthermore, the apparent quantum yield based on the yield rates of carbonaceous products, CO and CH 4 over hybrid composite was calculated to be 0.408 and 0.749 , respectively, and the total AQY () was 1.157 for CO 2 conversion.The details of AQY () estimation of all samples are given in supporting information (Table S1). The structural changes and characteristics parameters of composite, before and after the photocatalytic reaction were studied by XRD and FTIR, respectively.As can be seen in Fig. 12(c), no significant phase decomposition in the XRD results of fresh and used CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst was observed.Similarly, FTIR characteristics spectra peaks of fresh and used hybrid composite are almost same with a slight decline in absorption band intensities, ascribing to the trivial deactivation of functional sites of hybrid composite, as shown in Fig. 12(d).Thus, the heterojunction photocatalyst with sustained structure and functional groups attribute to its exceptional stability after photocatalytic CO 2 reduction test. Based on the aforementioned results, a plausible underlying mechanism scheme of interfacial electron transfer in CZ/3 wt PCN heterojunction photocatalyst is presented in Fig. 13.According to photoinduced charge transfer and separation (Eqs.6 and 7) of the photocatalytic composite, the CBP of CN (-1.22 eV) is higher compared to reduction potential of CH 4 (-0.24eV) and CO (-0.53 eV).On the other hand, the CBP of CZTS (-0.46 eV) is lower compared to reduction potential of CO (cannot proceed the CO yield by CO 2 reduction) and more negative than reduction potential of CH 4 5,48.While the VBP of both CN and CZTS is higher in comparison with the oxidation potential of H 2 O/O 2 52.Thus, the CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O into CO and CH 4 over the CN based catalysts is found to be thermodynamically feasible 53.Moreover, the DRS results reflect that the LSPR effects of Pt and visible light active CZTS nanoparticles can significantly enhance the visible absorption properties of hybrid composite.In addition, the plasmonic Pt nanoparticles supported over CN surface function as a charge transmission bridge and play a vital role in the electron exchange between CZTS and CN sheets. Since CZTS is a typical visible light photocatalyst and CN is partial visible light responsive photocatalyst, therefore both CZTS and CN can induce electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination.The interfacial electron transfer in underlying mechanism can follow a \"Type I heterojunction transfer\" or a \"Z-scheme transfer\" mechanism scheme. In \"Type I heterojunction transfer\", upon visible light illumination, the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs in CB and VB of CN will transfer to CB and VB of CZTS and the CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation would take place on the CB and VB of CZTS, respectively.Also, the CBP of CZTS is less negative than CO redox potential, only CH 4 would not be generated.As the matter of fact, all of the photoinduced electrons-holes pairs upon visible light illumination would be accumulated on the CZTS in the \"Type I heterojunction\" (Fig. 13), which does not improve the charge separation and also limits the photocatalytic efficiency.Thus \"Type I heterojunction\" mechanism is not feasible to explain the enhanced CH 4 yield rate. Beside, Z-scheme transfer mechanism is more appropriate to explain the enhanced solar to fuel conversion rate.Owing to higher work function ( Pt 5.56 eV), Pt nanoparticles has low Fermi level (E F 0.66 eV vs. NHE) and strong electron accepting ability for the photoinduced electrons.According to TEM analysis, the Pt nanoparticles are uniformly distributed over the CN sheets.As a result, the Pt nanoparticles work as a bridge to accept photoinduced electrons from CB of CZTS and holes from VB of CN, resulting in the formation of Z-scheme photocatalytic system.This improves the transmission of photoinduced charge and retain the stronger oxidationreduction abilities of the composite.Thus, owing to charge transmission bridge function of Pt, the accumulated electrons in CB of CN can strongly reduce CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes at the VB of CZTS participate in the oxidation of H 2 O into OH and H .Besides, the photoinduced electrons remaining in the CB of CZTS would directly participate in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and yield CH Eqs. ( 9) and (10) indicate the generation followed by trapping of photoinduced charge carriers by heterojunctions and Pt metal, consequently, increasing the lifetime of charges to precede oxidation and reduction process.Eqs.(11) and (12) kinetically explain that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction takes place at CB and oxidation of H 2 O takes place at the VB by the activity of electrons and holes, respectively.Eqs. ( 13)- (15) show the generation of H 2, CO and CH 4 through the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Moreover, the Pt nanoparticles encapsulated over CN can store electron owing to its electron-sink feature, function as reduction active sites, which can suppress the photoinduced charge recombination rate, and the LSPR effect further helps to improve visible light adsorption and charge generation.Thus, the photocatalytic performance, particularly the yield of CH 4 is significantly improved because of enriched density of electrons on Pt.In general, the synergistic interaction of multiple charge-transfer channels comprising Z-scheme charge transfer, LSPR and electron sink effects of Pt nanoparticles that can together be responsible for an efficient photoinduced charge separation and surface site activation for CO 2 reduction, which ultimately improves the photocatalytic performance."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "Later, the flow rate of CO 2 H 2 O vapor mixture was stabilized at 5.0 mL/min and the experiment was started by turning on a 400 W xenon solar lamp with 420 nm cut-off filter.", "context": "All commercially available chemicals and solvents involved in the study were procured from Sigma Aldrich (Shanghai, China), and used without further purification unless otherwise mentioned.The g-C 3 N 4 (CN) and Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 (CZTS) nanoparticles were synthesized as described in our previous reports 22,30. A series of CN composites with different Pt content were synthesized using photo-deposition method, whereas platinum acetylacetonate (Pt (C 5 H 7 O 2 ) 2 ) was used as the Pt source.Initially, two different solutions of CN and Pt(C 5 H 7 O 2 ) 2 were prepared separately.In the first solution, 100 mg of CN powder was dissolved in 100 mL solution mixture of DI H 2 O methanol (8:2) whereas, an appropriate amount of Pt(C 5 H 7 O 2 ) 2 was dissolved in 20 mL methanol as the second solution.After 20 min ultrasonication of both solutions, the Pt(C 5 H 7 O 2 ) 2 solution (0.2 mg/mL) was added dropwise into CN solution under the magnetic string and ultra-sonicated for 20 min.Photo-deposition of Pt over CN was performed under the illumination of UV light for 10 h.The resulted product was then washed for several times and dried overnight at 80 C.Finally, the powder was calcined at 400 C for 2 h in air to obtain Pt deposited CN.Following the same procedure, different powders were prepared with various the Pt content (x), denoted by xPCN where x 1, 3 and 5 wt represent the content of Pt over CN sheets.

The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed according to our previous report 21.Briefly, the gas-phase CO 2 reduction was carried out in a lab built stainless-steel cylindrical reactor (total volume of 213 cm 3 ) with a quartz window at top, while high purity CO 2 (air products, 99.99 ) and H 2 O were employed as carbon source and reducing reagent, respectively (supporting information, Fig. S1).First, photocatalyst powder (0.1 g) was uniformly dispersed on a quart plate with an area of 53 cm 2 and placed in the reactor.The assembled reactor was replenished with pure CO 2 several times and vacuumed.Prior to photo-illumination, the CO 2 gas regulated by mass flow controller (MFC) was continuously purged through water bubbler (H 2 O/CO 2 vapor ratio 3.8 vol.) and resulting vapor mixture of CO 2 H 2 O was injected in the assembled reactor at 100 mL/min to saturate the catalyst.Later, the flow rate of CO 2 H 2 O vapor mixture was stabilized at 5.0 mL/min and the experiment was started by turning on a 400 W xenon solar lamp with 420 nm cut-off filter.The gaseous products (CO and CH 4 ) were taken regularly throughout for 8 h and analyzed by an Agilent GC-6890 N gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), serially connected with a capillary column (60 m 0.25 mm 0.25 m, Agilent JW Sci.USA).Helium was used as gas carrier with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.Furthermore, several blank experiments in dark and in the absence of CO 2 reagent were also carried out and pure N 2 with H 2 O vapors were used as a substitute for CO 2 H 2 O vapor.The stability of the photocatalysts was evaluated by repeating the same process for four times after each 1 h illumination without opening the photo-reactor during illumination.The photocatalytic products evolution during photocatalytic reaction were analyzed by FID as per standard curves.Prior to each experiment, the calibration with certified calibration gases was performed.In addition, the isotope tracer experiments using 13 CO 2 were performed on an Agilent MS-5973 GC-mass spectroscopy to verify the source of photocatalytic products.The selectivity of the photocatalytic products (CO and CH 4 ) was estimated with the following equations 6: (1) While, the apparent quantum yield of photocatalytic products (CO and CH 4 ) were calculated with the following equations:"}]}}
