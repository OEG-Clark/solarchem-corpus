Amorphous TiO 2 were loaded on the surface of center-radial pores of DPSNs by direct nucleation and growth at solid-liquid hetero-interface.The abundant SieOH groups on DPSNs are beneficial for this growth by forming SieOeTi bond.With increase of the added TTIP amount from 0.0373 (i.e., X 10) to 0.4476 mL (i.e., X 120), the weight of product largely increases in proportion to X (Table 1), indicating the complete hydrolysis and condensation of TTIP.The amount of the formed amorphous TiO 2 on DPSNs also gradually increases and no other unloaded TiO 2 species are found in the products (TEM images in Fig. S1), suggesting the efficient growth and loading of the formed TiO 2 .After calcination under high temperature, the amorphous TiO 2 layer on DPSNs was changed into TiO 2 NPs due to thermalinduced crystallization and aggregation growth process.In addition, after H 2 reduction, the color of all products changes from white to gray (the mixture of black TiO 2-x and white silica color) (Fig. S2), indicating efficient reduction from TiO 2 to TiO 2-x . As shown in the SEM and TEM images of Fig. 2, a lot of small TiO 2-x NPs uniformly loaded on the surface of center-radial large pores of DPSNs with high distribution density.Moreover, the size of TiO 2-x NPs on the DPSNs continuously increases from 1-2 to 8-12 nm with the increase of the initially added TTIP amount from 0.0373 to 0.2984 mL, while their distribution density gradually decreases due to the formation of larger TiO 2-x NPs.It is worth to note that the TiO 2-x NPs still maintain similar sizes of 9-12 nm even with further increase of TTIP from 0.2984 to 0.4476 mL.Accordingly, the thickness of wrinkled nanosheets of DPSNs gradually increases due to the attachment of more TiO 2-x .During 0-60 of X, the DPSNsX TiO 2-x composites can still maintain the center-radial large pores (Fig. 2a1-e3).However, at X 80, some center-radial large pores of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x composite are partially filled by TiO 2-x NPs (Fig. 2f1-f3).TiO 2-x NPs completely fill center-radial large pores, and some TiO 2-x NPs appear on the surface of DPSNs at X 100 (Fig. 2g1-g3).At X 120, some TiO 2-x NPs are separated from DPSNs120 TiO 2-x (Fig. S3), due to the excessive TTIP addition.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about the well-dispersed loading of ultrafine TiO 2-x NPs (size: 1-2 nm) by controlling the hetero-interface growth. The pore structures of all DPSNsX TiO 2-x were also Fig. 1.Schematic illustration of the fabrication process of DPSNsX TiO 2-x with tunable TiO 2-x sizes by controlling the amount of the added TTIP.

SEM and TEM images of DPSNs (a1-a3), DPSNs10 TiO 2-x (b1-b3), DPSNs20 TiO 2-x (c1-c3), DPSNs40 TiO 2-x (d1-d3), DPSNs60 TiO 2-x (e1-e3), DPSNs80 TiO 2-x (f1-f3) and DPSNs100 TiO 2-x (g1-g3). characterized by N 2 adsorption-desorption measurement (Fig. 3a).As shown in BJH pore size distribution curves (Fig. 3b), with the increase of the initially added TTIP amount, ca.5-50 nm of large mesopores (wide strong peak) of DPSNs10 TiO 2-x gradually change to ca. 2-15 nm of small mesopores (narrow strong peak) and 15-40 nm of large mesopores (wide weak peak) of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , and finally to only ca.2-15 nm of small mesopores of DPSNs100 TiO 2-x .Simultaneously, both their BET specific surface areas and total pore volumes continuously decrease from 314 to 148 m 2 g -1 , and from 1.14 to 0.31 cm 3 g -1 (Table 1), respectively.These results are largely consistent with those from SEM and TEM images (Fig. 2), suggesting the existence of more TiO 2-x NPs on the surface of center-radial pores at higher X.In addition, such a high X just causes a modest loss of specific surface areas.And these values of specific surface areas are still higher than those of many ordered mesoporous TiO The phase change from anatase to rutile did not occur at a high temperature (600 C for 3 h) in the gas flow of 5 H 2 and 95 Ar, which may be attributed to be that anatase TiO 2-x NPs were stabilized by surface adsorbed hydrogen, while rutile NPs were stabilized by surface adsorbed oxygen 46,53.Moreover, with the increase of X, the intensity of diffraction peaks increases.The average crystal sizes of TiO 2-x NPs on DPSNs40 TiO 2-x , DPSNs60 TiO 2-x , DPSNs80 TiO 2-x and DPSNs100 TiO 2-x are calculated to be ca.3.1, 5.3, 7.7 and 7.8 nm, respectively, by using Scherrer's formula based on the major (101) diffraction peak.Raman spectra in Fig. 4b reveal four peaks, which belong to the typical TiO 2 anatase Raman bands.For gray DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , the strongest peak at ca. 144.2 cm -1 shows a visible broadening as well as a blue shifting to 146.2 cm -1 compared with white DPSNs80 TiO 2 .This phenomenon reported in the literatures was ascribed to Vo or Ti 3 centers on the TiO 2-x surface 54,55.High Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 4c,d show the well-dispersed distribution of many small TiO 2-x NPs (sizes: 6-9 nm) with clear crystal lattices on DPSNs60 TiO 2-x , and the sizes of most exposed crystal lattices are measured to be ca.0.337 nm, in accordance with (101) diffraction peak of TiO 2 anatase phase.Noteworthily, the thin disordered surface layer, which was often reported in the previous studies 26272829303156, cannot be clearly found on the surface of the crystalline TiO 2-x core, suggesting low reduction extent.During X 20, no TiO 2 diffraction peaks appear in XRD patterns (Fig. 4a), and no obvious TiO 2-x NPs with clear crystal lattices can be observed in HRTEM image (Fig. S4).The reason may be attributed to the extremely small sizes (1-2 nm) and lower contents of TiO 2-x NPs. The CO 2 photoreduction was carried out to study the photocatalytic activity of a series of DPSNsX TiO 2-x with tunable sizes of TiO 2-x NPs under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp.Background tests by purging argon and without adding NaHCO 3 in the reaction cell were first performed.No CO 2 conversion products (CO or CH 4 ) were detected for all DPSNsX TiO 2-x in the gas chromatograms (Fig. S5), and FTIR spectra in Fig. S6 only show typical Si-O-Si and Ti-O-Ti peaks.Thus, it indicates that the conversion products were not derived from residue organics in the catalysts.Fig. 5 shows the production amounts (in unit of molg-cat -1 (a,c) and molg-TiO 2-x -1 (b,d)) and production rates and CO as a function of irradiation time for all DPSNsX TiO 2-x products.Almost linearity formation amounts on CH 4 and CO evolution can be observed (Fig. 5a-d), which indicates the stability of our CO 2 photoreduction process and photocatalyts.For CO production rates, DPSNs40 TiO 2-x perform the highest one among all these products (Fig. 5f), with 22.4 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 .For CH 4 production rates, no CH 4 is detected for both DPSNs10 TiO 2-x and DPSNs20 TiO 2-x .Furthermore, CH 4 production rate shows an increasing trend with increase of X from 40 to 80, while it decreases when X further increases to 100.Thus, DPSNs80 TiO 2-x possess the highest CH 4 production rate of 124.3 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 among all these products (Fig. 5f).In addition, it is meaningful to normalize the production rate constants of DPSNsX TiO 2-x products with their BET specific surface areas (Table 1).As shown in Fig. S7, DPSNs40 TiO 2-x have the highest normalized CO production rate of 0.079 mol g-TiO 2- x -1 m 2 h -1 , while DPSNs100 TiO 2-x possess the highest normalized CH 4 one of 0.65 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 m 2 h -1 .In order to further evaluate the photocatalytic activity of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , its solar-to-COCH 4 conversion efficiency and apparent photochemical Quantum Efficiency are calculated to be ca.0.065 and 0.37, respectively, based on the equations in supporting information.Noteworthily, during X 20, CO 2 is only photo-reduced into CO.In comparison, during X 40, the photocatalytic products of CO 2 are both CO and CH 4 , indicating that large TiO 2-x NPs with high crystallization degree are beneficial to the generation of CH 4 .These interesting results indicate that these DPSNs X TiO 2-x composites have the distinctly different photocatalytic activity and selectivity, which should be attributed to different surface topology morphologies, the sizes of black TiO 2-x NPs and photoreduction degree of TiO 2-x NPs' surface during H 2 thermal reduction treatment (discussed in detail later).The photocatalytic stability is another significant factor for practical application besides photocatalytic performance.Three-run cycling experiments of CO 2 photoreduction were carried out to inspect it.As exhibited in Fig. 6a, there is not even a slight shrinkage of photocatalytic activity for DPSNs80 TiO 2-x after three successive cycles.In addition, abnormally, the yield of CH 4 suddenly increases a little in fourth hour in each cycling experiments.TEM images of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x before and after three cycle reactions do not show any difference (Fig. 6b-e).These results indicate the superior stability of these DPSNsX TiO 2-x photocatalysts.The reason is still unclear for this abnormal increase of CH 4 yield in fourth hour of each cycling experiments.It may be ascribed to long-time irradiation of UV light in Xe lamp, which may cause the formation of more Vo and/or Ti 3 on the surface of TiO 2-x NPs, thus promoting the photocatalytic reactions.When the irradiation is stopped, the oxygen in air may oxidize the newly formed Vo and/or Ti 3 .Due to the lack of equipment for in situ Vo and Ti 3 characterization, we hope to carry out the in-depth study in the near future. H 2 thermal reduction treatment of TiO 2 NPs and their reduction degrees should have an important impact on photocatalytic performance.As shown in Fig. S8, DPSNs20 TiO 2-x show higher CO production rate (molg-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 : 16.6 vs. 11.4)than DPSNs20 TiO 2 , indicating that TiO 2-x NPs can enhance the CO 2 photoreduction activity.In addition, DPSNsX TiO 2-x with higher reduction degrees can be obtained by controlling H 2 reduction treatment conditions 232425262728.It can be found from Fig. S9a-d that the strongest peak is located at ca. 146.2 cm -1 for DPSNs80 TiO 2-x with gray color, while it shows a bigger blue shifting to 154.3 cm -1 for DPSNs60TiO 2-x with deeper color.It indicates that DPSNs60 TiO 2-x with deeper color have higher reduction degree.The CO and CH 4 production rates of DPSNs60 TiO 2-x with deeper color are 8.3 and 73.3 mol g-TiO 2- x -1 h -1 , respectively, which are lower than those (17.4 and 79.4 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 ) of DPSNs60 TiO 2-x with gray color (Fig. S9e-j).It indicates that the higher reduction degree on the surface of TiO 2-x NPs may be unfavorable for the transportation of photogenerated carriers, thus resulting in lower photocatalytic activity. To investigate the visible-light induced photocatalytic activity, a filter ( 420 nm) is fixed on a 300 W Xe lamp.As shown in Fig. S10, there are not any CO and CH 4 products for DPSNs100 TiO 2 , while there is only a small amount of CO product (2.9 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 in 4 h) for DPSNs100 TiO 2-x .It suggests that high CO 2 photoreduction activity of DPSNsX TiO 2-x should mainly result from UV ( 420 nm)-light activated photocatalysis. There have been many reports about the impressive photocatalytic H 2 evolution performance of black titatias up to now 262728293031.Thus, it is also necessary to investigate photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity of DPSNsX TiO 2-x without Pt loading.By adding lactic acid as the sacrificial agent, under the irradition of 300 W Xe lamp, there is almost no H 2 production for DPSNs10 TiO 2-x .In contrast, the apparent rate constant of H 2 production of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x is ca.21.0 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 (Fig. S11), which is lower than those in most literatures and its CH 4 production rate of 124.3 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 262728293031.It indicates that DPSNsX TiO 2-x have the relatively weak photocatalytic H 2 production ability compared with CO 2 photoreduction. As shown in Table S1, without Pt deposition/loading, our developed DPSNsX TiO 2-x samples, especially DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , show much more enhanced CO 2 photocatalytic activity than those in the literatures .The intrinsic mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction is very complex.The photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts is always closely related to their final properties (band structures, UV-vis Fig. 6.(a) Cycling runs for CO 2 reduction over DPSNs80 TiO 2-x .TEM images of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x before (b,c) and after (d,e) three cycling runs.light absorption, charge separation, specific surface area), which are often affected by TiO 2-x particle sizes, shape, morphology, doping, surface facet, defect content, etc 21,. UV-vis DR spectra in Figs.7a,b and S12 reveal that all DPSNsX TiO 2-x products have a stronger absorption in the vis-NIR region than DPSNsX TiO 2 , and their optical bandgap values are lower than that (3.10 eV) of DPSNs60 TiO 2 .It should result from that the introduction of Ti 3 ions or/and Vo shortens the optical bandgap of TiO 2 , leading to the improvement of light absorption 26272829303151525354555657.In addition, with the increase of X from 10 to 80, their vis-NIR absorption intensity decreases, and their optical bandgap slightly shifts to a higher energy from 2.75 to 2.98 eV.However, further increase of X from 80 to 120 does not cause a further shift of bandgap to a higher energy.It may be attributed to be that the smaller sizes of TiO 2-x NPs are more easily to be reduced (i.e., higher reduction degree) under identical H 2 thermal reduction condition, while 8-12 nm of TiO 2-x NPs should have similar reduction degrees.The introduction of Ti 3 or/and Vo narrows the bandgap of TiO 2-x , thus enhancing the vis-NIR light absorption ability.However, it also weakens the reduction power of electrons 20,58,59. XPS is a powerful tool to study the change of surface chemical bonding.As shown in Fig. 7c, Si, O and Ti elements exist in DPSNsX TiO 2 and DPSNsX TiO 2-x , and the peak intensity values of both Ti 2p and O 1s connected with Ti increase with increase of X (Fig. S13).Noteworthily, DPSNs60 TiO 2 and DPSNsX TiO 2-x samples show only Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 peaks, but no Ti 3 peaks.Compared with DPSNs60 TiO 2 , very slightly blue shift of binding energy positions occurs for DPSNs60 TiO 2-x , DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , and DPSNs100 TiO 2-x , (Fig. 7d), which may be ascibed to the existence of Vo or/and Ti 3 51,60.In comparison, no such shift appears for DPSNs10 TiO 2-x and DPSNs20 TiO 2-x , which may result from very weak peak intensity caused by low TiO 2 content.The valence band (VB) XPS spectra were employed to study the effect of hydrogenation on the electronic band structure of TiO 2 NPs on DPSNs (Fig. 7e) 262728293031.The VB spectrum of DPSNs60 TiO 2 shows the characteristic density of states of TiO 2 .However, after hydrogenation, a slight blue shifts of the absorption edges of TiO 2-x appear on DPSNsX TiO 2-x , suggesting the defects-induced VB mid-gap positions with lower energy.And this value seems to gradually decrease with the decrease of X, suggesting that smaller NPs may have more Vo. As a very sensitive tool to probe paramagnetic species with unpaired electrons, ESR has been widely used to prove the existence of Vo and Ti 3 262728293031.Before ESR measurement, the DPSNs were removed from DPSNsX TiO 2 by selective etching with NaOH solution in order to avoid the effect of silica species.The pristine TiO 2 in DPSNs80 TiO 2- x shows no recognizable resonance signal, suggesting the absence of Vo and Ti 3 , as shown in Fig. 7f.In comparison, a strong ESR peak at a g value of 2.003 is observed in the TiO 2-x in DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , indicating the existence of Vo trapped with an electron 29.However, there was no obvious signal response at g 1.94-1.99,which is usually a typical signal of the Ti 3 species.This result indicates that Vo should be generated after hydrogenation, while no Ti 3 species exist 29.This is reasonable because ambient pressure H 2 Ar treatment has a low reduction ability to generate the Ti 3 species, which is much more (c) XPS full and (d) Ti 2p spectra of DPSNs60 TiO 2 , DPSNs60 TiO 2-x and DPSNs80 TiO 2-x .Note that C element in (a) is from atmosphere.(e) VB XPS spectra of DPSNs60TiO 2 and DPSNsX TiO 2-x .(f) ESR spectra, (g) PL spectra and (h) time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra of DPSNs80 TiO 2 and DPSNs80 TiO 2-x .(h) CO 2 adsorption isotherms on DPSNs60 TiO 2 , DPSNs 60 TiO 2-x and DPSNs80 TiO 2-x at 75 C.difficult to form than Vo 29. PL emission spectrum is a useful method to investigate the recombination efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.The PL spectra in Fig. 7f show that the PL peak intensity of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x is obviously lower than that of DPSNs80 TiO 2 , which indicates that DPSNs80 TiO 2-x has a much lower recombination rate of electrons and holes under light irradiation 61,62, which favors higher photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, nanosecond-level time-resolved fluorescence decay spectrum was performed to study the transfer dynamics of photo-excited charge carrier.As exhibited in time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra of Fig. 7g, the lifetimes are 113.9ns for DPSNs 60 TiO 2 , 249.1 ns for DPSNs60 TiO 2-x and 720.1 ns for DPSNs 80 TiO 2-x .The prolonged lifetime indicates that the efficiencies of the carrier transfer and separation in black TiO 2-x are greatly enhanced, thus the photoexcited charge carriers are more prone to be involved in the redox reactions instead of recombination 63. The adsorption capacity of CO 2 on the catalyst is an important factor that determining CO 2 photoreduction performance.The CO 2 adsorption isotherms in Fig. 7h show that the maximum values at atmospheric pressure (75 C) are 4.8 cm 3 g -1 for DPSNs60 TiO 2-x and 4.4 cm 3 g -1 for DPSNs80 TiO 2-x at P/P 0 0.96, which is approximately twice as much as that of DPSNs60 TiO 2 .The higher CO 2 adsorption capacity should result from adsorption on under-coordinated sites from Vo, which are responsible for capturing and activating CO 2 64. In situ DRIFTS was used to examine the adsorption and chemical activation of CO 1338 to 1342 cm -1 , respectively.The reason for these slight shifts to higher wave numbers is still unclear up to now, and it may be explained by the slightly decreased interaction between m-CO 3 2-(b-CO 3 2-) species and TiO 2-x surface under Xe lamp irradiation.The peak intensity of HCO 3 -increases with prolonged exposure time, while the peak intensity of CO 2 -changes a little.The HCO 3 -and CO 2 -are usually regarded as the intermediate of CH 4 and CO 68.It should be pointed out that the characteristic peak of CH 4 was undetectable due to its nonpolar property.These differences of intermediates can explain the huge distinction in CO 2 photocatalytic activity and selectivity between DPSNs 10 TiO 2-x and DPSNs80 TiO 2-x . Possible mechanism is provided to clarify different photocatalytic activity and selectivity of DPSNsX TiO 2-x NPs with varied particle sizes of black TiO 2-x NPs.The dependences of the morphology, geometric features, and electronic properties on the sizes of TiO 2-x NPs have been carefully demonstrated, as exhibited above.As shown in Fig. 8a, based on the analysis of bandgap (Fig. 7b) and VB (Fig. 7e), the energy band diagrams of DPSNsX TiO 2-x are proposed in comparison with that of DPSNs60 TiO 2 .The Vo-induced VB mid-gap tail states are labeled in diagrams.Moreover, 1-3 nm of smaller TiO 2-x NPs Fig. 8. (a) The proposed energy band diagrams of DPSNsX TiO 2-x in comparison with that of DPSNs60 TiO 2 based on the bandgap (Fig. 7b) and VB (Fig. 7e).(b,c) Possible mechanism of different photocatalytic activity and selectivity of DPSNsX TiO 2-x NPs with varied particle sizes of black TiO 2-x NPs.Noteworthily, 1-3 nm of smaller TiO 2-x NPs have higher reduction degree during H 2 thermal reduction treatment, thus resulting in higher decrease of bandgap.Thus, it increases the vis-NIR light absorption ability.However, it also weakens the reduction power of electrons, which stops the kinetics of the reduction reaction from CO 2 to CH 4 involving eight electrons. should have higher reduction degree compared with 3-12 nm of TiO 2-x NPs during H 2 thermal reduction treatment (Fig. 8b,c), resulting in bigger decrease of optical bandgap.Thus, it increases the vis-NIR light absorption ability.However, it also weakens the reduction power of photogenerated electrons 272829, which stops the kinetics of the reduction reaction from CO 2 to CH 4 involving eight electrons.It is therefore highly desirable to seek for an optimal balance between light absorption ability and electron reduction power.Based on the above characterization and analysis results, the outstanding CO 2 photoreduction performance (Fig. 5) of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x should be attributed to high accessible active surface areas and suitable optical bandgap.On the one hand, high density of TiO 2-x NPs are well-dispersed on the surface of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , and they have appropriate particle sizes of 8-12 nm and suitable reduction degree (i.e., Vo and Ti 3 content).On the other hand, even at such a high X of 80, DPSNs80 TiO 2-x still maintain high specific surface area of 208 m 2 g -1 due to center-radial large pore structures of DPSNs.These combined features improve CO 2 adsorption capacity (Fig. 7i), suppress recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 7g), and enhance carrier transfer and separation in black TiO 2-x (Fig. 7h), thus significantly enhancing CO 2 photoreduction activity (CH 4 and CO production rates: 124.3 and 14.7 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 ) (Fig. 5f).In addition, it is very interesting to achieve high selectivity (89.4) for CH 4 , rather than CO.The exact reason is unclear, but it may result from Vo-induced suitable bandgap (2.98 eV) with -0.05 eV of CB edge (Fig. 8a), which not only can improve the photon utilization efficiency, but also can maintain the reduction power of photogenerated electrons.Moreover, the Vo defective sites on TiO 2-x surface could enhance the adsorption and activation of CO 2 molecules, and thus efficiently lower the reaction barrier of CO 2 /CH 4 262728293031."}, {"llm generation": "DPSNsX TiO 2-x composite photocatalysts", "source":

DPSNs to form DPSNsX TiO 2 TiO 2 was formed on the surface of center-radial pores of DPSNs by direct growth at solid-liquid hetero-interface.Typically, after 0.1 g of DPSNs was dispersed in 25 mL of ethanol under ultrasonic for 1 h, 12.5 mL of ethanol was added into the DPSNs suspension and allowed to stand under magnetic stirring for 10 min.Then, a given amount of titanium (IV) tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) was slowly added.After the mixture was kept for 12 h under intense stirring, 2.5 mL of ultra-pure water (0.5 mL min -1 ) was slowly added into, and the final mixture kept on intense stirring for 2 h.The prepared product was gathered by centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 5 min, which was washed three times with the mixture of ethanol and ultra-pure water.Finally, the precipitate was dried at 60 C and calcined at 550 C for 5 h in Muffle furnace.The added amount of TTIP is regulated to achieve tunable weight ratios of TiO 2 /DPSNs from 10 to 120 (Table 1).The obtained products were named as DPSNsX TiO 2 , here X means the weight ratios of TiO 2 / DPSNs. Reduction from DPSNsX TiO 2 to DPSNsX TiO 2-x Hydrogen thermal reduction treatment in ambient pressure was carried out because it is a simple and straightforward way to use H 2 to reduce partial Ti 4 into Ti 3 on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystals 46,47.Typically, the prepared DPSNsX TiO 2 powder with white color was ground and placed in the ceramic crucible, on which a glass slide was covered with a vent of 2 mm on both sides.Then the powder was reduced in a tube furnace system with the gas flow (50 mL min -1 ) of 5 H 2 and 95 Ar at 600 C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 C min -1 .The obtained gray samples were named as DPSNsX TiO 2-x .It is worth to note that high temperature (400-700 C) was commonly needed for ambient pressure H 2 /Ar reduction, compared to that of high pressure H 2 , due to its weaker reduction capability 29.Thus, in order to effectively reduce the DPSNsX TiO 2-x , 600 C of high temperature was employed. The photoreduction of CO 2 conversion was carried out by a Labsolar-III AG closed circulation system (Beijing Perfect light Technology Co., Ltd., China) 48,49.25 mg of DPSNsX TiO 2-x was ultrasonically dispersed in ultrapure water.Then, the suspension was spread evenly on the sample stage, which is located in the middle of the vacuum reactor.And a thin particle film with an area of ca. 1 cm 2 was formed after static drying.Subsequently, 5 mL of H 2 SO 4 (4 mol L -1 ) was transfused into the vacuum reactor to react with NaHCO 3 to obtain 1 atm of CO 2 gas.The reactor was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300), and the photoreaction temperature was kept at 20 C.The parameter of distance between Xe lamp and samples is fixed at 10 cm.The light intensity on the sample is measured to be about 0.5 W cm -2 by Optical power meter.After reacted for given time, 1 mL of gas was taken out for subsequent qualitative analysis by GC9790II gas chromatography (Zhejiang Fuli Analytical Instrument Co.) with a thermal conductivity detector. The characterization methods were listed in the Supporting Information, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectra, photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra, time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra, UV-vis diffuse reflectance (UV-vis DR) spectra, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and CO 2 adsorption.In situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was performed on the NICOLET iS50 FT-IR for measuring CO 2 adsorption/activation/conversion."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The CO 2 photoreduction was carried out to study the photocatalytic activity of a series of DPSNsX TiO 2-x with tunable sizes of TiO 2-x NPs under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp.", "context": "The schematic illustration of the fabrication strategy of a series of DPSNsX TiO 2-x composite photocatalysts with tunable sizes of TiO 2- x NPs is exhibited in Fig. 1.DPSNs are employed as a catalyst carrier to load many small TiO 2-x NPs on the surface of center-radial pores.TiO 2 can grow on the surface of center-radial pores via solid-liquid heterogeneous interface growth, and its loading amount increases with increase of the addition amount of TiO 2 precursor.After calcination followed by H 2 thermal reduction treatment, black TiO 2-x NPs with tunable sizes are uniformly formed on DPSNs.In order to clarify the structures and morphologies of DPSNsX TiO 2-x , several characterization tools were used, such as SEM, TEM, N 2 sorption, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, etc. As shown in SEM and TEM images of Fig. 2a1-a3, the prepared DPSNs, which are formed by many wrinkled nanosheets (thickness: ca.5-10 nm), have uniform geometric structures.These nanosheets are arranged from particle center to particle surface to constitute the radial pore channels, thus forming uniform spheres with particle sizes of 241 28 nm.The formed center-radial large mesopores and macropores have an irregular slit-like porous structure with a wide surface pore size distribution of ca.52 26 nm.Nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements show that DPSNs have a high BET surface area of 326 m 2 g -1 and a high total pore volume of 1.26 cm 3 g -1 . Amorphous TiO 2 were loaded on the surface of center-radial pores of DPSNs by direct nucleation and growth at solid-liquid hetero-interface.The abundant SieOH groups on DPSNs are beneficial for this growth by forming SieOeTi bond.With increase of the added TTIP amount from 0.0373 (i.e., X 10) to 0.4476 mL (i.e., X 120), the weight of product largely increases in proportion to X (Table 1), indicating the complete hydrolysis and condensation of TTIP.The amount of the formed amorphous TiO 2 on DPSNs also gradually increases and no other unloaded TiO 2 species are found in the products (TEM images in Fig. S1), suggesting the efficient growth and loading of the formed TiO 2 .After calcination under high temperature, the amorphous TiO 2 layer on DPSNs was changed into TiO 2 NPs due to thermalinduced crystallization and aggregation growth process.In addition, after H 2 reduction, the color of all products changes from white to gray (the mixture of black TiO 2-x and white silica color) (Fig. S2), indicating efficient reduction from TiO 2 to TiO 2-x . As shown in the SEM and TEM images of Fig. 2, a lot of small TiO 2-x NPs uniformly loaded on the surface of center-radial large pores of DPSNs with high distribution density.Moreover, the size of TiO 2-x NPs on the DPSNs continuously increases from 1-2 to 8-12 nm with the increase of the initially added TTIP amount from 0.0373 to 0.2984 mL, while their distribution density gradually decreases due to the formation of larger TiO 2-x NPs.It is worth to note that the TiO 2-x NPs still maintain similar sizes of 9-12 nm even with further increase of TTIP from 0.2984 to 0.4476 mL.Accordingly, the thickness of wrinkled nanosheets of DPSNs gradually increases due to the attachment of more TiO 2-x .During 0-60 of X, the DPSNsX TiO 2-x composites can still maintain the center-radial large pores (Fig. 2a1-e3).However, at X 80, some center-radial large pores of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x composite are partially filled by TiO 2-x NPs (Fig. 2f1-f3).TiO 2-x NPs completely fill center-radial large pores, and some TiO 2-x NPs appear on the surface of DPSNs at X 100 (Fig. 2g1-g3).At X 120, some TiO 2-x NPs are separated from DPSNs120 TiO 2-x (Fig. S3), due to the excessive TTIP addition.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about the well-dispersed loading of ultrafine TiO 2-x NPs (size: 1-2 nm) by controlling the hetero-interface growth. The pore structures of all DPSNsX TiO 2-x were also Fig. 1.Schematic illustration of the fabrication process of DPSNsX TiO 2-x with tunable TiO 2-x sizes by controlling the amount of the added TTIP. Fig. 2. SEM and TEM images of DPSNs (a1-a3), DPSNs10 TiO 2-x (b1-b3), DPSNs20 TiO 2-x (c1-c3), DPSNs40 TiO 2-x (d1-d3), DPSNs60 TiO 2-x (e1-e3), DPSNs80 TiO 2-x (f1-f3) and DPSNs100 TiO 2-x (g1-g3). characterized by N 2 adsorption-desorption measurement (Fig. 3a).As shown in BJH pore size distribution curves (Fig. 3b), with the increase of the initially added TTIP amount, ca.5-50 nm of large mesopores (wide strong peak) of DPSNs10 TiO 2-x gradually change to ca. 2-15 nm of small mesopores (narrow strong peak) and 15-40 nm of large mesopores (wide weak peak) of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , and finally to only ca.2-15 nm of small mesopores of DPSNs100 TiO 2-x .Simultaneously, both their BET specific surface areas and total pore volumes continuously decrease from 314 to 148 m 2 g -1 , and from 1.14 to 0.31 cm 3 g -1 (Table 1), respectively.These results are largely consistent with those from SEM and TEM images (Fig. 2), suggesting the existence of more TiO 2-x NPs on the surface of center-radial pores at higher X.In addition, such a high X just causes a modest loss of specific surface areas.And these values of specific surface areas are still higher than those of many ordered mesoporous TiO The phase change from anatase to rutile did not occur at a high temperature (600 C for 3 h) in the gas flow of 5 H 2 and 95 Ar, which may be attributed to be that anatase TiO 2-x NPs were stabilized by surface adsorbed hydrogen, while rutile NPs were stabilized by surface adsorbed oxygen 46,53.Moreover, with the increase of X, the intensity of diffraction peaks increases.The average crystal sizes of TiO 2-x NPs on DPSNs40 TiO 2-x , DPSNs60 TiO 2-x , DPSNs80 TiO 2-x and DPSNs100 TiO 2-x are calculated to be ca.3.1, 5.3, 7.7 and 7.8 nm, respectively, by using Scherrer's formula based on the major (101) diffraction peak.Raman spectra in Fig. 4b reveal four peaks, which belong to the typical TiO 2 anatase Raman bands.For gray DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , the strongest peak at ca. 144.2 cm -1 shows a visible broadening as well as a blue shifting to 146.2 cm -1 compared with white DPSNs80 TiO 2 .This phenomenon reported in the literatures was ascribed to Vo or Ti 3 centers on the TiO 2-x surface 54,55.High Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 4c,d show the well-dispersed distribution of many small TiO 2-x NPs (sizes: 6-9 nm) with clear crystal lattices on DPSNs60 TiO 2-x , and the sizes of most exposed crystal lattices are measured to be ca.0.337 nm, in accordance with (101) diffraction peak of TiO 2 anatase phase.Noteworthily, the thin disordered surface layer, which was often reported in the previous studies 26272829303156, cannot be clearly found on the surface of the crystalline TiO 2-x core, suggesting low reduction extent.During X 20, no TiO 2 diffraction peaks appear in XRD patterns (Fig. 4a), and no obvious TiO 2-x NPs with clear crystal lattices can be observed in HRTEM image (Fig. S4).The reason may be attributed to the extremely small sizes (1-2 nm) and lower contents of TiO 2-x NPs. The CO 2 photoreduction was carried out to study the photocatalytic activity of a series of DPSNsX TiO 2-x with tunable sizes of TiO 2-x NPs under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp.Background tests by purging argon and without adding NaHCO 3 in the reaction cell were first performed.No CO 2 conversion products (CO or CH 4 ) were detected for all DPSNsX TiO 2-x in the gas chromatograms (Fig. S5), and FTIR spectra in Fig. S6 only show typical Si-O-Si and Ti-O-Ti peaks.Thus, it indicates that the conversion products were not derived from residue organics in the catalysts.Fig. 5 shows the production amounts (in unit of molg-cat -1 (a,c) and molg-TiO 2-x -1 (b,d)) and production rates and CO as a function of irradiation time for all DPSNsX TiO 2-x products.Almost linearity formation amounts on CH 4 and CO evolution can be observed (Fig. 5a-d), which indicates the stability of our CO 2 photoreduction process and photocatalyts.For CO production rates, DPSNs40 TiO 2-x perform the highest one among all these products (Fig. 5f), with 22.4 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 .For CH 4 production rates, no CH 4 is detected for both DPSNs10 TiO 2-x and DPSNs20 TiO 2-x .Furthermore, CH 4 production rate shows an increasing trend with increase of X from 40 to 80, while it decreases when X further increases to 100.Thus, DPSNs80 TiO 2-x possess the highest CH 4 production rate of 124.3 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 among all these products (Fig. 5f).In addition, it is meaningful to normalize the production rate constants of DPSNsX TiO 2-x products with their BET specific surface areas (Table 1).As shown in Fig. S7, DPSNs40 TiO 2-x have the highest normalized CO production rate of 0.079 mol g-TiO 2- x -1 m 2 h -1 , while DPSNs100 TiO 2-x possess the highest normalized CH 4 one of 0.65 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 m 2 h -1 .In order to further evaluate the photocatalytic activity of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , its solar-to-COCH 4 conversion efficiency and apparent photochemical Quantum Efficiency are calculated to be ca.0.065 and 0.37, respectively, based on the equations in supporting information.Noteworthily, during X 20, CO 2 is only photo-reduced into CO.In comparison, during X 40, the photocatalytic products of CO 2 are both CO and CH 4 , indicating that large TiO 2-x NPs with high crystallization degree are beneficial to the generation of CH 4 .These interesting results indicate that these DPSNs X TiO 2-x composites have the distinctly different photocatalytic activity and selectivity, which should be attributed to different surface topology morphologies, the sizes of black TiO 2-x NPs and photoreduction degree of TiO 2-x NPs' surface during H 2 thermal reduction treatment (discussed in detail later).The photocatalytic stability is another significant factor for practical application besides photocatalytic performance.Three-run cycling experiments of CO 2 photoreduction were carried out to inspect it.As exhibited in Fig. 6a, there is not even a slight shrinkage of photocatalytic activity for DPSNs80 TiO 2-x after three successive cycles.In addition, abnormally, the yield of CH 4 suddenly increases a little in fourth hour in each cycling experiments.TEM images of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x before and after three cycle reactions do not show any difference (Fig. 6b-e).These results indicate the superior stability of these DPSNsX TiO 2-x photocatalysts.The reason is still unclear for this abnormal increase of CH 4 yield in fourth hour of each cycling experiments.It may be ascribed to long-time irradiation of UV light in Xe lamp, which may cause the formation of more Vo and/or Ti 3 on the surface of TiO 2-x NPs, thus promoting the photocatalytic reactions.When the irradiation is stopped, the oxygen in air may oxidize the newly formed Vo and/or Ti 3 .Due to the lack of equipment for in situ Vo and Ti 3 characterization, we hope to carry out the in-depth study in the near future. H 2 thermal reduction treatment of TiO 2 NPs and their reduction degrees should have an important impact on photocatalytic performance.As shown in Fig. S8, DPSNs20 TiO 2-x show higher CO production rate (molg-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 : 16.6 vs. 11.4)than DPSNs20 TiO 2 , indicating that TiO 2-x NPs can enhance the CO 2 photoreduction activity.In addition, DPSNsX TiO 2-x with higher reduction degrees can be obtained by controlling H 2 reduction treatment conditions 232425262728.It can be found from Fig. S9a-d that the strongest peak is located at ca. 146.2 cm -1 for DPSNs80 TiO 2-x with gray color, while it shows a bigger blue shifting to 154.3 cm -1 for DPSNs60TiO 2-x with deeper color.It indicates that DPSNs60 TiO 2-x with deeper color have higher reduction degree.The CO and CH 4 production rates of DPSNs60 TiO 2-x with deeper color are 8.3 and 73.3 mol g-TiO 2- x -1 h -1 , respectively, which are lower than those (17.4 and 79.4 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 ) of DPSNs60 TiO 2-x with gray color (Fig. S9e-j).It indicates that the higher reduction degree on the surface of TiO 2-x NPs may be unfavorable for the transportation of photogenerated carriers, thus resulting in lower photocatalytic activity. To investigate the visible-light induced photocatalytic activity, a filter ( 420 nm) is fixed on a 300 W Xe lamp.As shown in Fig. S10, there are not any CO and CH 4 products for DPSNs100 TiO 2 , while there is only a small amount of CO product (2.9 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 in 4 h) for DPSNs100 TiO 2-x .It suggests that high CO 2 photoreduction activity of DPSNsX TiO 2-x should mainly result from UV ( 420 nm)-light activated photocatalysis. There have been many reports about the impressive photocatalytic H 2 evolution performance of black titatias up to now 262728293031.Thus, it is also necessary to investigate photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity of DPSNsX TiO 2-x without Pt loading.By adding lactic acid as the sacrificial agent, under the irradition of 300 W Xe lamp, there is almost no H 2 production for DPSNs10 TiO 2-x .In contrast, the apparent rate constant of H 2 production of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x is ca.21.0 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 (Fig. S11), which is lower than those in most literatures and its CH 4 production rate of 124.3 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 262728293031.It indicates that DPSNsX TiO 2-x have the relatively weak photocatalytic H 2 production ability compared with CO 2 photoreduction. As shown in Table S1, without Pt deposition/loading, our developed DPSNsX TiO 2-x samples, especially DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , show much more enhanced CO 2 photocatalytic activity than those in the literatures .The intrinsic mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction is very complex.The photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts is always closely related to their final properties (band structures, UV-vis Fig. 6.(a) Cycling runs for CO 2 reduction over DPSNs80 TiO 2-x .TEM images of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x before (b,c) and after (d,e) three cycling runs.light absorption, charge separation, specific surface area), which are often affected by TiO 2-x particle sizes, shape, morphology, doping, surface facet, defect content, etc 21,. UV-vis DR spectra in Figs.7a,b and S12 reveal that all DPSNsX TiO 2-x products have a stronger absorption in the vis-NIR region than DPSNsX TiO 2 , and their optical bandgap values are lower than that (3.10 eV) of DPSNs60 TiO 2 .It should result from that the introduction of Ti 3 ions or/and Vo shortens the optical bandgap of TiO 2 , leading to the improvement of light absorption 26272829303151525354555657.In addition, with the increase of X from 10 to 80, their vis-NIR absorption intensity decreases, and their optical bandgap slightly shifts to a higher energy from 2.75 to 2.98 eV.However, further increase of X from 80 to 120 does not cause a further shift of bandgap to a higher energy.It may be attributed to be that the smaller sizes of TiO 2-x NPs are more easily to be reduced (i.e., higher reduction degree) under identical H 2 thermal reduction condition, while 8-12 nm of TiO 2-x NPs should have similar reduction degrees.The introduction of Ti 3 or/and Vo narrows the bandgap of TiO 2-x , thus enhancing the vis-NIR light absorption ability.However, it also weakens the reduction power of electrons 20,58,59. XPS is a powerful tool to study the change of surface chemical bonding.As shown in Fig. 7c, Si, O and Ti elements exist in DPSNsX TiO 2 and DPSNsX TiO 2-x , and the peak intensity values of both Ti 2p and O 1s connected with Ti increase with increase of X (Fig. S13).Noteworthily, DPSNs60 TiO 2 and DPSNsX TiO 2-x samples show only Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 peaks, but no Ti 3 peaks.Compared with DPSNs60 TiO 2 , very slightly blue shift of binding energy positions occurs for DPSNs60 TiO 2-x , DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , and DPSNs100 TiO 2-x , (Fig. 7d), which may be ascibed to the existence of Vo or/and Ti 3 51,60.In comparison, no such shift appears for DPSNs10 TiO 2-x and DPSNs20 TiO 2-x , which may result from very weak peak intensity caused by low TiO 2 content.The valence band (VB) XPS spectra were employed to study the effect of hydrogenation on the electronic band structure of TiO 2 NPs on DPSNs (Fig. 7e) 262728293031.The VB spectrum of DPSNs60 TiO 2 shows the characteristic density of states of TiO 2 .However, after hydrogenation, a slight blue shifts of the absorption edges of TiO 2-x appear on DPSNsX TiO 2-x , suggesting the defects-induced VB mid-gap positions with lower energy.And this value seems to gradually decrease with the decrease of X, suggesting that smaller NPs may have more Vo. As a very sensitive tool to probe paramagnetic species with unpaired electrons, ESR has been widely used to prove the existence of Vo and Ti 3 262728293031.Before ESR measurement, the DPSNs were removed from DPSNsX TiO 2 by selective etching with NaOH solution in order to avoid the effect of silica species.The pristine TiO 2 in DPSNs80 TiO 2- x shows no recognizable resonance signal, suggesting the absence of Vo and Ti 3 , as shown in Fig. 7f.In comparison, a strong ESR peak at a g value of 2.003 is observed in the TiO 2-x in DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , indicating the existence of Vo trapped with an electron 29.However, there was no obvious signal response at g 1.94-1.99,which is usually a typical signal of the Ti 3 species.This result indicates that Vo should be generated after hydrogenation, while no Ti 3 species exist 29.This is reasonable because ambient pressure H 2 Ar treatment has a low reduction ability to generate the Ti 3 species, which is much more (c) XPS full and (d) Ti 2p spectra of DPSNs60 TiO 2 , DPSNs60 TiO 2-x and DPSNs80 TiO 2-x .Note that C element in (a) is from atmosphere.(e) VB XPS spectra of DPSNs60TiO 2 and DPSNsX TiO 2-x .(f) ESR spectra, (g) PL spectra and (h) time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra of DPSNs80 TiO 2 and DPSNs80 TiO 2-x .(h) CO 2 adsorption isotherms on DPSNs60 TiO 2 , DPSNs 60 TiO 2-x and DPSNs80 TiO 2-x at 75 C.difficult to form than Vo 29. PL emission spectrum is a useful method to investigate the recombination efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.The PL spectra in Fig. 7f show that the PL peak intensity of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x is obviously lower than that of DPSNs80 TiO 2 , which indicates that DPSNs80 TiO 2-x has a much lower recombination rate of electrons and holes under light irradiation 61,62, which favors higher photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, nanosecond-level time-resolved fluorescence decay spectrum was performed to study the transfer dynamics of photo-excited charge carrier.As exhibited in time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra of Fig. 7g, the lifetimes are 113.9ns for DPSNs 60 TiO 2 , 249.1 ns for DPSNs60 TiO 2-x and 720.1 ns for DPSNs 80 TiO 2-x .The prolonged lifetime indicates that the efficiencies of the carrier transfer and separation in black TiO 2-x are greatly enhanced, thus the photoexcited charge carriers are more prone to be involved in the redox reactions instead of recombination 63. The adsorption capacity of CO 2 on the catalyst is an important factor that determining CO 2 photoreduction performance.The CO 2 adsorption isotherms in Fig. 7h show that the maximum values at atmospheric pressure (75 C) are 4.8 cm 3 g -1 for DPSNs60 TiO 2-x and 4.4 cm 3 g -1 for DPSNs80 TiO 2-x at P/P 0 0.96, which is approximately twice as much as that of DPSNs60 TiO 2 .The higher CO 2 adsorption capacity should result from adsorption on under-coordinated sites from Vo, which are responsible for capturing and activating CO 2 64. In situ DRIFTS was used to examine the adsorption and chemical activation of CO 1338 to 1342 cm -1 , respectively.The reason for these slight shifts to higher wave numbers is still unclear up to now, and it may be explained by the slightly decreased interaction between m-CO 3 2-(b-CO 3 2-) species and TiO 2-x surface under Xe lamp irradiation.The peak intensity of HCO 3 -increases with prolonged exposure time, while the peak intensity of CO 2 -changes a little.The HCO 3 -and CO 2 -are usually regarded as the intermediate of CH 4 and CO 68.It should be pointed out that the characteristic peak of CH 4 was undetectable due to its nonpolar property.These differences of intermediates can explain the huge distinction in CO 2 photocatalytic activity and selectivity between DPSNs 10 TiO 2-x and DPSNs80 TiO 2-x . Possible mechanism is provided to clarify different photocatalytic activity and selectivity of DPSNsX TiO 2-x NPs with varied particle sizes of black TiO 2-x NPs.The dependences of the morphology, geometric features, and electronic properties on the sizes of TiO 2-x NPs have been carefully demonstrated, as exhibited above.As shown in Fig. 8a, based on the analysis of bandgap (Fig. 7b) and VB (Fig. 7e), the energy band diagrams of DPSNsX TiO 2-x are proposed in comparison with that of DPSNs60 TiO 2 .The Vo-induced VB mid-gap tail states are labeled in diagrams.Moreover, 1-3 nm of smaller TiO 2-x NPs Fig. 8. (a) The proposed energy band diagrams of DPSNsX TiO 2-x in comparison with that of DPSNs60 TiO 2 based on the bandgap (Fig. 7b) and VB (Fig. 7e).(b,c) Possible mechanism of different photocatalytic activity and selectivity of DPSNsX TiO 2-x NPs with varied particle sizes of black TiO 2-x NPs.Noteworthily, 1-3 nm of smaller TiO 2-x NPs have higher reduction degree during H 2 thermal reduction treatment, thus resulting in higher decrease of bandgap.Thus, it increases the vis-NIR light absorption ability.However, it also weakens the reduction power of electrons, which stops the kinetics of the reduction reaction from CO 2 to CH 4 involving eight electrons. should have higher reduction degree compared with 3-12 nm of TiO 2-x NPs during H 2 thermal reduction treatment (Fig. 8b,c), resulting in bigger decrease of optical bandgap.Thus, it increases the vis-NIR light absorption ability.However, it also weakens the reduction power of photogenerated electrons 272829, which stops the kinetics of the reduction reaction from CO 2 to CH 4 involving eight electrons.It is therefore highly desirable to seek for an optimal balance between light absorption ability and electron reduction power.Based on the above characterization and analysis results, the outstanding CO 2 photoreduction performance (Fig. 5) of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x should be attributed to high accessible active surface areas and suitable optical bandgap.On the one hand, high density of TiO 2-x NPs are well-dispersed on the surface of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , and they have appropriate particle sizes of 8-12 nm and suitable reduction degree (i.e., Vo and Ti 3 content).On the other hand, even at such a high X of 80, DPSNs80 TiO 2-x still maintain high specific surface area of 208 m 2 g -1 due to center-radial large pore structures of DPSNs.These combined features improve CO 2 adsorption capacity (Fig. 7i), suppress recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 7g), and enhance carrier transfer and separation in black TiO 2-x (Fig. 7h), thus significantly enhancing CO 2 photoreduction activity (CH 4 and CO production rates: 124.3 and 14.7 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 ) (Fig. 5f).In addition, it is very interesting to achieve high selectivity (89.4) for CH 4 , rather than CO.The exact reason is unclear, but it may result from Vo-induced suitable bandgap (2.98 eV) with -0.05 eV of CB edge (Fig. 8a), which not only can improve the photon utilization efficiency, but also can maintain the reduction power of photogenerated electrons.Moreover, the Vo defective sites on TiO 2-x surface could enhance the adsorption and activation of CO 2 molecules, and thus efficiently lower the reaction barrier of CO 2 /CH 4 262728293031."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "Fig. 5.

DPSNs to form DPSNsX TiO 2 TiO 2 was formed on the surface of center-radial pores of DPSNs by direct growth at solid-liquid hetero-interface.Typically, after 0.1 g of DPSNs was dispersed in 25 mL of ethanol under ultrasonic for 1 h, 12.5 mL of ethanol was added into the DPSNs suspension and allowed to stand under magnetic stirring for 10 min.Then, a given amount of titanium (IV) tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) was slowly added.After the mixture was kept for 12 h under intense stirring, 2.5 mL of ultra-pure water (0.5 mL min -1 ) was slowly added into, and the final mixture kept on intense stirring for 2 h.The prepared product was gathered by centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 5 min, which was washed three times with the mixture of ethanol and ultra-pure water.Finally, the precipitate was dried at 60 C and calcined at 550 C for 5 h in Muffle furnace.The added amount of TTIP is regulated to achieve tunable weight ratios of TiO 2 /DPSNs from 10 to 120 (Table 1).The obtained products were named as DPSNsX TiO 2 , here X means the weight ratios of TiO 2 / DPSNs. Reduction from DPSNsX TiO 2 to DPSNsX TiO 2-x Hydrogen thermal reduction treatment in ambient pressure was carried out because it is a simple and straightforward way to use H 2 to reduce partial Ti 4 into Ti 3 on the surface of TiO 2 nanocrystals 46,47.Typically, the prepared DPSNsX TiO 2 powder with white color was ground and placed in the ceramic crucible, on which a glass slide was covered with a vent of 2 mm on both sides.Then the powder was reduced in a tube furnace system with the gas flow (50 mL min -1 ) of 5 H 2 and 95 Ar at 600 C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 C min -1 .The obtained gray samples were named as DPSNsX TiO 2-x .It is worth to note that high temperature (400-700 C) was commonly needed for ambient pressure H 2 /Ar reduction, compared to that of high pressure H 2 , due to its weaker reduction capability 29.Thus, in order to effectively reduce the DPSNsX TiO 2-x , 600 C of high temperature was employed. The photoreduction of CO 2 conversion was carried out by a Labsolar-III AG closed circulation system (Beijing Perfect light Technology Co., Ltd., China) 48,49.25 mg of DPSNsX TiO 2-x was ultrasonically dispersed in ultrapure water.Then, the suspension was spread evenly on the sample stage, which is located in the middle of the vacuum reactor.And a thin particle film with an area of ca. 1 cm 2 was formed after static drying.Subsequently, 5 mL of H 2 SO 4 (4 mol L -1 ) was transfused into the vacuum reactor to react with NaHCO 3 to obtain 1 atm of CO 2 gas.The reactor was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300), and the photoreaction temperature was kept at 20 C.The parameter of distance between Xe lamp and samples is fixed at 10 cm.The light intensity on the sample is measured to be about 0.5 W cm -2 by Optical power meter.After reacted for given time, 1 mL of gas was taken out for subsequent qualitative analysis by GC9790II gas chromatography (Zhejiang Fuli Analytical Instrument Co.) with a thermal conductivity detector.

Amorphous TiO 2 were loaded on the surface of center-radial pores of DPSNs by direct nucleation and growth at solid-liquid hetero-interface.The abundant SieOH groups on DPSNs are beneficial for this growth by forming SieOeTi bond.With increase of the added TTIP amount from 0.0373 (i.e., X 10) to 0.4476 mL (i.e., X 120), the weight of product largely increases in proportion to X (Table 1), indicating the complete hydrolysis and condensation of TTIP.The amount of the formed amorphous TiO 2 on DPSNs also gradually increases and no other unloaded TiO 2 species are found in the products (TEM images in Fig. S1), suggesting the efficient growth and loading of the formed TiO 2 .After calcination under high temperature, the amorphous TiO 2 layer on DPSNs was changed into TiO 2 NPs due to thermalinduced crystallization and aggregation growth process.In addition, after H 2 reduction, the color of all products changes from white to gray (the mixture of black TiO 2-x and white silica color) (Fig. S2), indicating efficient reduction from TiO 2 to TiO 2-x . As shown in the SEM and TEM images of Fig. 2, a lot of small TiO 2-x NPs uniformly loaded on the surface of center-radial large pores of DPSNs with high distribution density.Moreover, the size of TiO 2-x NPs on the DPSNs continuously increases from 1-2 to 8-12 nm with the increase of the initially added TTIP amount from 0.0373 to 0.2984 mL, while their distribution density gradually decreases due to the formation of larger TiO 2-x NPs.It is worth to note that the TiO 2-x NPs still maintain similar sizes of 9-12 nm even with further increase of TTIP from 0.2984 to 0.4476 mL.Accordingly, the thickness of wrinkled nanosheets of DPSNs gradually increases due to the attachment of more TiO 2-x .During 0-60 of X, the DPSNsX TiO 2-x composites can still maintain the center-radial large pores (Fig. 2a1-e3).However, at X 80, some center-radial large pores of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x composite are partially filled by TiO 2-x NPs (Fig. 2f1-f3).TiO 2-x NPs completely fill center-radial large pores, and some TiO 2-x NPs appear on the surface of DPSNs at X 100 (Fig. 2g1-g3).At X 120, some TiO 2-x NPs are separated from DPSNs120 TiO 2-x (Fig. S3), due to the excessive TTIP addition.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about the well-dispersed loading of ultrafine TiO 2-x NPs (size: 1-2 nm) by controlling the hetero-interface growth. The pore structures of all DPSNsX TiO 2-x were also Fig. 1.Schematic illustration of the fabrication process of DPSNsX TiO 2-x with tunable TiO 2-x sizes by controlling the amount of the added TTIP.

SEM and TEM images of DPSNs (a1-a3), DPSNs10 TiO 2-x (b1-b3), DPSNs20 TiO 2-x (c1-c3), DPSNs40 TiO 2-x (d1-d3), DPSNs60 TiO 2-x (e1-e3), DPSNs80 TiO 2-x (f1-f3) and DPSNs100 TiO 2-x (g1-g3). characterized by N 2 adsorption-desorption measurement (Fig. 3a).As shown in BJH pore size distribution curves (Fig. 3b), with the increase of the initially added TTIP amount, ca.5-50 nm of large mesopores (wide strong peak) of DPSNs10 TiO 2-x gradually change to ca. 2-15 nm of small mesopores (narrow strong peak) and 15-40 nm of large mesopores (wide weak peak) of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , and finally to only ca.2-15 nm of small mesopores of DPSNs100 TiO 2-x .Simultaneously, both their BET specific surface areas and total pore volumes continuously decrease from 314 to 148 m 2 g -1 , and from 1.14 to 0.31 cm 3 g -1 (Table 1), respectively.These results are largely consistent with those from SEM and TEM images (Fig. 2), suggesting the existence of more TiO 2-x NPs on the surface of center-radial pores at higher X.In addition, such a high X just causes a modest loss of specific surface areas.And these values of specific surface areas are still higher than those of many ordered mesoporous TiO The phase change from anatase to rutile did not occur at a high temperature (600 C for 3 h) in the gas flow of 5 H 2 and 95 Ar, which may be attributed to be that anatase TiO 2-x NPs were stabilized by surface adsorbed hydrogen, while rutile NPs were stabilized by surface adsorbed oxygen 46,53.Moreover, with the increase of X, the intensity of diffraction peaks increases.The average crystal sizes of TiO 2-x NPs on DPSNs40 TiO 2-x , DPSNs60 TiO 2-x , DPSNs80 TiO 2-x and DPSNs100 TiO 2-x are calculated to be ca.3.1, 5.3, 7.7 and 7.8 nm, respectively, by using Scherrer's formula based on the major (101) diffraction peak.Raman spectra in Fig. 4b reveal four peaks, which belong to the typical TiO 2 anatase Raman bands.For gray DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , the strongest peak at ca. 144.2 cm -1 shows a visible broadening as well as a blue shifting to 146.2 cm -1 compared with white DPSNs80 TiO 2 .This phenomenon reported in the literatures was ascribed to Vo or Ti 3 centers on the TiO 2-x surface 54,55.High Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 4c,d show the well-dispersed distribution of many small TiO 2-x NPs (sizes: 6-9 nm) with clear crystal lattices on DPSNs60 TiO 2-x , and the sizes of most exposed crystal lattices are measured to be ca.0.337 nm, in accordance with (101) diffraction peak of TiO 2 anatase phase.Noteworthily, the thin disordered surface layer, which was often reported in the previous studies 26272829303156, cannot be clearly found on the surface of the crystalline TiO 2-x core, suggesting low reduction extent.During X 20, no TiO 2 diffraction peaks appear in XRD patterns (Fig. 4a), and no obvious TiO 2-x NPs with clear crystal lattices can be observed in HRTEM image (Fig. S4).The reason may be attributed to the extremely small sizes (1-2 nm) and lower contents of TiO 2-x NPs. The CO 2 photoreduction was carried out to study the photocatalytic activity of a series of DPSNsX TiO 2-x with tunable sizes of TiO 2-x NPs under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp.Background tests by purging argon and without adding NaHCO 3 in the reaction cell were first performed.No CO 2 conversion products (CO or CH 4 ) were detected for all DPSNsX TiO 2-x in the gas chromatograms (Fig. S5), and FTIR spectra in Fig. S6 only show typical Si-O-Si and Ti-O-Ti peaks.Thus, it indicates that the conversion products were not derived from residue organics in the catalysts.Fig. 5 shows the production amounts (in unit of molg-cat -1 (a,c) and molg-TiO 2-x -1 (b,d)) and production rates and CO as a function of irradiation time for all DPSNsX TiO 2-x products.Almost linearity formation amounts on CH 4 and CO evolution can be observed (Fig. 5a-d), which indicates the stability of our CO 2 photoreduction process and photocatalyts.For CO production rates, DPSNs40 TiO 2-x perform the highest one among all these products (Fig. 5f), with 22.4 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 .For CH 4 production rates, no CH 4 is detected for both DPSNs10 TiO 2-x and DPSNs20 TiO 2-x .Furthermore, CH 4 production rate shows an increasing trend with increase of X from 40 to 80, while it decreases when X further increases to 100.Thus, DPSNs80 TiO 2-x possess the highest CH 4 production rate of 124.3 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 among all these products (Fig. 5f).In addition, it is meaningful to normalize the production rate constants of DPSNsX TiO 2-x products with their BET specific surface areas (Table 1).As shown in Fig. S7, DPSNs40 TiO 2-x have the highest normalized CO production rate of 0.079 mol g-TiO 2- x -1 m 2 h -1 , while DPSNs100 TiO 2-x possess the highest normalized CH 4 one of 0.65 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 m 2 h -1 .In order to further evaluate the photocatalytic activity of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , its solar-to-COCH 4 conversion efficiency and apparent photochemical Quantum Efficiency are calculated to be ca.0.065 and 0.37, respectively, based on the equations in supporting information.Noteworthily, during X 20, CO 2 is only photo-reduced into CO.In comparison, during X 40, the photocatalytic products of CO 2 are both CO and CH 4 , indicating that large TiO 2-x NPs with high crystallization degree are beneficial to the generation of CH 4 .These interesting results indicate that these DPSNs X TiO 2-x composites have the distinctly different photocatalytic activity and selectivity, which should be attributed to different surface topology morphologies, the sizes of black TiO 2-x NPs and photoreduction degree of TiO 2-x NPs' surface during H 2 thermal reduction treatment (discussed in detail later).The photocatalytic stability is another significant factor for practical application besides photocatalytic performance.Three-run cycling experiments of CO 2 photoreduction were carried out to inspect it.As exhibited in Fig. 6a, there is not even a slight shrinkage of photocatalytic activity for DPSNs80 TiO 2-x after three successive cycles.In addition, abnormally, the yield of CH 4 suddenly increases a little in fourth hour in each cycling experiments.TEM images of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x before and after three cycle reactions do not show any difference (Fig. 6b-e).These results indicate the superior stability of these DPSNsX TiO 2-x photocatalysts.The reason is still unclear for this abnormal increase of CH 4 yield in fourth hour of each cycling experiments.It may be ascribed to long-time irradiation of UV light in Xe lamp, which may cause the formation of more Vo and/or Ti 3 on the surface of TiO 2-x NPs, thus promoting the photocatalytic reactions.When the irradiation is stopped, the oxygen in air may oxidize the newly formed Vo and/or Ti 3 .Due to the lack of equipment for in situ Vo and Ti 3 characterization, we hope to carry out the in-depth study in the near future. H 2 thermal reduction treatment of TiO 2 NPs and their reduction degrees should have an important impact on photocatalytic performance.As shown in Fig. S8, DPSNs20 TiO 2-x show higher CO production rate (molg-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 : 16.6 vs. 11.4)than DPSNs20 TiO 2 , indicating that TiO 2-x NPs can enhance the CO 2 photoreduction activity.In addition, DPSNsX TiO 2-x with higher reduction degrees can be obtained by controlling H 2 reduction treatment conditions 232425262728.It can be found from Fig. S9a-d that the strongest peak is located at ca. 146.2 cm -1 for DPSNs80 TiO 2-x with gray color, while it shows a bigger blue shifting to 154.3 cm -1 for DPSNs60TiO 2-x with deeper color.It indicates that DPSNs60 TiO 2-x with deeper color have higher reduction degree.The CO and CH 4 production rates of DPSNs60 TiO 2-x with deeper color are 8.3 and 73.3 mol g-TiO 2- x -1 h -1 , respectively, which are lower than those (17.4 and 79.4 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 ) of DPSNs60 TiO 2-x with gray color (Fig. S9e-j).It indicates that the higher reduction degree on the surface of TiO 2-x NPs may be unfavorable for the transportation of photogenerated carriers, thus resulting in lower photocatalytic activity. To investigate the visible-light induced photocatalytic activity, a filter ( 420 nm) is fixed on a 300 W Xe lamp.As shown in Fig. S10, there are not any CO and CH 4 products for DPSNs100 TiO 2 , while there is only a small amount of CO product (2.9 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 in 4 h) for DPSNs100 TiO 2-x .It suggests that high CO 2 photoreduction activity of DPSNsX TiO 2-x should mainly result from UV ( 420 nm)-light activated photocatalysis. There have been many reports about the impressive photocatalytic H 2 evolution performance of black titatias up to now 262728293031.Thus, it is also necessary to investigate photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity of DPSNsX TiO 2-x without Pt loading.By adding lactic acid as the sacrificial agent, under the irradition of 300 W Xe lamp, there is almost no H 2 production for DPSNs10 TiO 2-x .In contrast, the apparent rate constant of H 2 production of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x is ca.21.0 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 (Fig. S11), which is lower than those in most literatures and its CH 4 production rate of 124.3 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 262728293031.It indicates that DPSNsX TiO 2-x have the relatively weak photocatalytic H 2 production ability compared with CO 2 photoreduction. As shown in Table S1, without Pt deposition/loading, our developed DPSNsX TiO 2-x samples, especially DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , show much more enhanced CO 2 photocatalytic activity than those in the literatures .The intrinsic mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction is very complex.The photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts is always closely related to their final properties (band structures, UV-vis Fig. 6.(a) Cycling runs for CO 2 reduction over DPSNs80 TiO 2-x .TEM images of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x before (b,c) and after (d,e) three cycling runs.light absorption, charge separation, specific surface area), which are often affected by TiO 2-x particle sizes, shape, morphology, doping, surface facet, defect content, etc 21,. UV-vis DR spectra in Figs.7a,b and S12 reveal that all DPSNsX TiO 2-x products have a stronger absorption in the vis-NIR region than DPSNsX TiO 2 , and their optical bandgap values are lower than that (3.10 eV) of DPSNs60 TiO 2 .It should result from that the introduction of Ti 3 ions or/and Vo shortens the optical bandgap of TiO 2 , leading to the improvement of light absorption 26272829303151525354555657.In addition, with the increase of X from 10 to 80, their vis-NIR absorption intensity decreases, and their optical bandgap slightly shifts to a higher energy from 2.75 to 2.98 eV.However, further increase of X from 80 to 120 does not cause a further shift of bandgap to a higher energy.It may be attributed to be that the smaller sizes of TiO 2-x NPs are more easily to be reduced (i.e., higher reduction degree) under identical H 2 thermal reduction condition, while 8-12 nm of TiO 2-x NPs should have similar reduction degrees.The introduction of Ti 3 or/and Vo narrows the bandgap of TiO 2-x , thus enhancing the vis-NIR light absorption ability.However, it also weakens the reduction power of electrons 20,58,59. XPS is a powerful tool to study the change of surface chemical bonding.As shown in Fig. 7c, Si, O and Ti elements exist in DPSNsX TiO 2 and DPSNsX TiO 2-x , and the peak intensity values of both Ti 2p and O 1s connected with Ti increase with increase of X (Fig. S13).Noteworthily, DPSNs60 TiO 2 and DPSNsX TiO 2-x samples show only Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 peaks, but no Ti 3 peaks.Compared with DPSNs60 TiO 2 , very slightly blue shift of binding energy positions occurs for DPSNs60 TiO 2-x , DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , and DPSNs100 TiO 2-x , (Fig. 7d), which may be ascibed to the existence of Vo or/and Ti 3 51,60.In comparison, no such shift appears for DPSNs10 TiO 2-x and DPSNs20 TiO 2-x , which may result from very weak peak intensity caused by low TiO 2 content.The valence band (VB) XPS spectra were employed to study the effect of hydrogenation on the electronic band structure of TiO 2 NPs on DPSNs (Fig. 7e) 262728293031.The VB spectrum of DPSNs60 TiO 2 shows the characteristic density of states of TiO 2 .However, after hydrogenation, a slight blue shifts of the absorption edges of TiO 2-x appear on DPSNsX TiO 2-x , suggesting the defects-induced VB mid-gap positions with lower energy.And this value seems to gradually decrease with the decrease of X, suggesting that smaller NPs may have more Vo. As a very sensitive tool to probe paramagnetic species with unpaired electrons, ESR has been widely used to prove the existence of Vo and Ti 3 262728293031.Before ESR measurement, the DPSNs were removed from DPSNsX TiO 2 by selective etching with NaOH solution in order to avoid the effect of silica species.The pristine TiO 2 in DPSNs80 TiO 2- x shows no recognizable resonance signal, suggesting the absence of Vo and Ti 3 , as shown in Fig. 7f.In comparison, a strong ESR peak at a g value of 2.003 is observed in the TiO 2-x in DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , indicating the existence of Vo trapped with an electron 29.However, there was no obvious signal response at g 1.94-1.99,which is usually a typical signal of the Ti 3 species.This result indicates that Vo should be generated after hydrogenation, while no Ti 3 species exist 29.This is reasonable because ambient pressure H 2 Ar treatment has a low reduction ability to generate the Ti 3 species, which is much more (c) XPS full and (d) Ti 2p spectra of DPSNs60 TiO 2 , DPSNs60 TiO 2-x and DPSNs80 TiO 2-x .Note that C element in (a) is from atmosphere.(e) VB XPS spectra of DPSNs60TiO 2 and DPSNsX TiO 2-x .(f) ESR spectra, (g) PL spectra and (h) time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra of DPSNs80 TiO 2 and DPSNs80 TiO 2-x .(h) CO 2 adsorption isotherms on DPSNs60 TiO 2 , DPSNs 60 TiO 2-x and DPSNs80 TiO 2-x at 75 C.difficult to form than Vo 29. PL emission spectrum is a useful method to investigate the recombination efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.The PL spectra in Fig. 7f show that the PL peak intensity of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x is obviously lower than that of DPSNs80 TiO 2 , which indicates that DPSNs80 TiO 2-x has a much lower recombination rate of electrons and holes under light irradiation 61,62, which favors higher photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, nanosecond-level time-resolved fluorescence decay spectrum was performed to study the transfer dynamics of photo-excited charge carrier.As exhibited in time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra of Fig. 7g, the lifetimes are 113.9ns for DPSNs 60 TiO 2 , 249.1 ns for DPSNs60 TiO 2-x and 720.1 ns for DPSNs 80 TiO 2-x .The prolonged lifetime indicates that the efficiencies of the carrier transfer and separation in black TiO 2-x are greatly enhanced, thus the photoexcited charge carriers are more prone to be involved in the redox reactions instead of recombination 63. The adsorption capacity of CO 2 on the catalyst is an important factor that determining CO 2 photoreduction performance.The CO 2 adsorption isotherms in Fig. 7h show that the maximum values at atmospheric pressure (75 C) are 4.8 cm 3 g -1 for DPSNs60 TiO 2-x and 4.4 cm 3 g -1 for DPSNs80 TiO 2-x at P/P 0 0.96, which is approximately twice as much as that of DPSNs60 TiO 2 .The higher CO 2 adsorption capacity should result from adsorption on under-coordinated sites from Vo, which are responsible for capturing and activating CO 2 64. In situ DRIFTS was used to examine the adsorption and chemical activation of CO 1338 to 1342 cm -1 , respectively.The reason for these slight shifts to higher wave numbers is still unclear up to now, and it may be explained by the slightly decreased interaction between m-CO 3 2-(b-CO 3 2-) species and TiO 2-x surface under Xe lamp irradiation.The peak intensity of HCO 3 -increases with prolonged exposure time, while the peak intensity of CO 2 -changes a little.The HCO 3 -and CO 2 -are usually regarded as the intermediate of CH 4 and CO 68.It should be pointed out that the characteristic peak of CH 4 was undetectable due to its nonpolar property.These differences of intermediates can explain the huge distinction in CO 2 photocatalytic activity and selectivity between DPSNs 10 TiO 2-x and DPSNs80 TiO 2-x . Possible mechanism is provided to clarify different photocatalytic activity and selectivity of DPSNsX TiO 2-x NPs with varied particle sizes of black TiO 2-x NPs.The dependences of the morphology, geometric features, and electronic properties on the sizes of TiO 2-x NPs have been carefully demonstrated, as exhibited above.As shown in Fig. 8a, based on the analysis of bandgap (Fig. 7b) and VB (Fig. 7e), the energy band diagrams of DPSNsX TiO 2-x are proposed in comparison with that of DPSNs60 TiO 2 .The Vo-induced VB mid-gap tail states are labeled in diagrams.Moreover, 1-3 nm of smaller TiO 2-x NPs Fig. 8. (a) The proposed energy band diagrams of DPSNsX TiO 2-x in comparison with that of DPSNs60 TiO 2 based on the bandgap (Fig. 7b) and VB (Fig. 7e).(b,c) Possible mechanism of different photocatalytic activity and selectivity of DPSNsX TiO 2-x NPs with varied particle sizes of black TiO 2-x NPs.Noteworthily, 1-3 nm of smaller TiO 2-x NPs have higher reduction degree during H 2 thermal reduction treatment, thus resulting in higher decrease of bandgap.Thus, it increases the vis-NIR light absorption ability.However, it also weakens the reduction power of electrons, which stops the kinetics of the reduction reaction from CO 2 to CH 4 involving eight electrons. should have higher reduction degree compared with 3-12 nm of TiO 2-x NPs during H 2 thermal reduction treatment (Fig. 8b,c), resulting in bigger decrease of optical bandgap.Thus, it increases the vis-NIR light absorption ability.However, it also weakens the reduction power of photogenerated electrons 272829, which stops the kinetics of the reduction reaction from CO 2 to CH 4 involving eight electrons.It is therefore highly desirable to seek for an optimal balance between light absorption ability and electron reduction power.Based on the above characterization and analysis results, the outstanding CO 2 photoreduction performance (Fig. 5) of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x should be attributed to high accessible active surface areas and suitable optical bandgap.On the one hand, high density of TiO 2-x NPs are well-dispersed on the surface of DPSNs80 TiO 2-x , and they have appropriate particle sizes of 8-12 nm and suitable reduction degree (i.e., Vo and Ti 3 content).On the other hand, even at such a high X of 80, DPSNs80 TiO 2-x still maintain high specific surface area of 208 m 2 g -1 due to center-radial large pore structures of DPSNs.These combined features improve CO 2 adsorption capacity (Fig. 7i), suppress recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 7g), and enhance carrier transfer and separation in black TiO 2-x (Fig. 7h), thus significantly enhancing CO 2 photoreduction activity (CH 4 and CO production rates: 124.3 and 14.7 mol g-TiO 2-x -1 h -1 ) (Fig. 5f).In addition, it is very interesting to achieve high selectivity (89.4) for CH 4 , rather than CO.The exact reason is unclear, but it may result from Vo-induced suitable bandgap (2.98 eV) with -0.05 eV of CB edge (Fig. 8a), which not only can improve the photon utilization efficiency, but also can maintain the reduction power of photogenerated electrons.Moreover, the Vo defective sites on TiO 2-x surface could enhance the adsorption and activation of CO 2 molecules, and thus efficiently lower the reaction barrier of CO 2 /CH 4 262728293031."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
