the spectrum of the wafer sintered at 400 C for 4 h matches with that of the P-25 Degussa powder, indicating complete removal of the binder.Further increases in the sintering temperature were not attempted to avoid unintentional phase variation compared with the P-25 powder.Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns of Degussa P-25 TiO 2 powder and the TiO 2 wafer sintered at 400 C for 4 h.As seen in the XRD patterns, wafer sintering did not induce an additional phase change, with all observed peaks similar to that of the P-25 powder.The pore size distribution of the wafers was measured using the BJH technique; the gas adsorptiondesorption curves are shown in Figure 4a.A remarkable adsorption at high relative pressures suggests the presence of a high surface area nanoporous structure caused by the packed nanoparticles as indicated by the FESEM image (Figure 1b).The average pore size estimated from the adsorption-desorption curves was about 30 nm as seen in Figure 4b.As mentioned by Varghese et al., 17 photo-generated holes help to ionize water and the electrons reduce CO 2 .The photocatalytic reaction processes are chemically represented as: The nanoparticles of metals (Pt/Cu), which act as co-catalysts, do not directly take part in these reactions; however they help towards the adsorption of gaseous species and the separation of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs.Hence, as a first experiment, TiO 2 wafers sensitized by either Pt or Cu co-catalyst nanoparticles were placed on the bottom of the photocatalytic reaction chambers in a 55 relative humidity CO 2 atmosphere and exposed to 1 h of AM 1.5G illumination.Figure 5a and Figure 5b show the gaseous reaction products as a function of sputter deposition times for, respectively, Cu and Pt deposition.Methane is found to be the major hydrocarbon product, while hydrogen and carbon monoxide are also observed.For Cu coated samples, Figure 5a,a a value that decreased with further increases in sputtering time. The CO formation rate was found to increase with Cu sputtering time, a behavior attributed to enhanced CO 2 adsorption on the Cu sites and subsequent reduction to CO by electron transfer from the metal.However with increasing Cu coverage, depositions beyond 100 s, both light absorption and exposure of water vapor to the TiO 2 surface are reduced, which in turn reduces the possibility of H ion formation through oxidation by the photo-generated holes.Hence in spite of the enhanced CO 2 reduction to CO, further Cu deposition and the corresponding reduced availability of H ions decreases the rate of methane production.The amount of Cu relative to TiO 2 on the wafer surface after 100 s of sputtering, estimated by XPS with a sampling depth of approximately 8 nm, was determined to be 9.6.Since a sputtering time of 100 s yielded a maximum methane formation rate for all further experiments utilizing Cu sensitization Cu was sputtered for 100 s.The effect of Pt sputtering time (200 W, 63 mA, 2 in diameter target) on the product formation rates shows, Figure 5b, that a sputtering time of 8 s yields a maximum amount of methane and hydrogen.Therefore, for all further experiments involving Pt coated wafers, a sputtering time of 8 s was chosen.XPS analysis, 8 nm sampling depth, of wafers coated with Pt sputtered for 8 s showed that the amount of Pt relative to TiO 2 on the wafer surface was 8.7.To evaluate the reaction performance with time, wafers coated with Cu and Pt were illuminated for different durations, 0.25 h to 4 h. Figure 6a and Figure 6b show, respectively, time normalized product formation per unit area (ppm/(cm 2 h)) of Cu and Pt coated wafers.In both cases the methane yield reaches a maximum for 1 h exposure, beyond which it reduces with increasing exposure time.For the Cu coated sample the CO yield reaches a maximum value with 2 h exposure, and then reduces slightly with increasing exposure time.For the Pt coated samples the hydrogen yield increases with time reaching 250 ppm/(cm 2 h) with a 4 h exposure.Pt is a noble metal and its Fermi level is lower than that of the TiO 2 .Hence the photo-excited electrons are easily separated from the corresonding holes in the photo-catalyst (TiO 2 ) and enter Pt, which act as an electron sink.This lowers the chances of electron-hole recombination.In a Pt-TiO 2 system under illumination, therefore, the holes can react with water to produce hydrogen ions, which, in turn, react with electrons to yield hydrogen molecule.As mentioned in the report by Kitano et al. (Appl.Catal.A, 325, 2007, 1), a Pt-TiO 2 system can work as a short-circuited electrochemical cell that promotes hydrogen evolution from water under the light irradiation.For the present experimental conditions the time dependence of the hydrocarbon product yield indicates that both Cu and Pt co-catalysts show maximum activity in the first hour of exposure followed by degradation thereafter.CO 2 gas with moisture content ranging from 0 to 100 was tested in the reaction chamber.Figure 7a and Figure 7b show, respectively, the effect of relative humidity on product formation for wafers coated with Cu and Pt nanoparticles.Experiments with dry CO 2 on both Cu coated and Pt coated wafers yield less than 10 ppm/(cm 2 h) of methane and similar amounts of CO and hydrogen.For Cu coated samples, rates of both methane and CO reach a maximum at about 55 RH and decreases with higher RH values; yields at 100 RH are about 20 ppm/cm 2 h for methane and 9 ppm/(cm 2 h) for CO.A similar trend is observed for the methane yield in Pt coated samples, which begins with 5 ppm/cm 2 h at 0 RH, with a maximum yield of 32 ppm/(cm 2 h) at 55 RH and decreases to 15 ppm/(cm 2 h) at 100 RH.However, hydrogen production increases monotonically and reaches its maximum value of 200 ppm/(cm 2 h) at 100 RH.The optimum moisture content for maximum methane formation is about 55 RH and further increasing the water vapor content inside the reaction chamber leads to degradation of catalysts.With use of the samples in the CO 2 reduction chamber, visual inspection of the Cu sensitized wafers showed the Cu nanoparticles turned from metallic in appearance to dark colored as associated with copper oxide. It has been shown that for gas phase photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 that product yields can be maximized by having both Cu and Pt nanoparticles deposited on the surface of the semiconductor photocatalyst 17.Hence we attempted to increase product formation by sputtering Cu (100 s) on half of the wafer's surface and Pt (8 s) on the other half.The coatings of Pt and Cu were not overlapped in order to avoid the covering of one metal with the other.Figure 8 shows the product formation rates from a Cu-Pt sensitized wafer kept in a 55 RH CO 2 ambient and illuminated for 1 h; the methane yield reaches 49 ppm/(cm 2 h), significantly higher than that of either Cu or Pt coated samples.In order to have a practical and efficient CO 2 conversion process, a dynamic system involving a flow-through configuration is essential, wherein CO 2 and water vapor can be passed through one end of a photocatalytic membrane exposed to solar radiation and hydrocarbon products are collected from the other end.Grimes and coworkers 17,27 conceived the idea of such a photocatalytic flow-through membrane using TiO 2 nanotube arrays.As shown the Fig. 1(a), we attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of nanoporous TiO 2 pellet as a flow-through membrane.Since the pellet was not transparent, light did not reach the other side (of the surface).Therefore, there was no \"photo-catalytic\" reaction expected on that side (bottom part) of the pellet.Referring to Fig. 1a, light from the solar simulator was incident on the top surface of the pellet (coated with Pt and Cu) and caused photo-catalytic reactions to take place; however, because of the lifted geometry and availability of micro-channels (randomly connected pores) in the pellet, the products could permeate through the pellet to the other side, reducing the chances of back-reactions.When the pellet was placed on the bottom of the reaction chamber, the reactants and products are always in close proximity to each other near the top surface and that was expected to enhance the back reaction rate.Furthermore, the other side of the disk was neither exposed to light nor coated with co-catalysts (Cu/Pt) and hence, this side did not take part in the photo-catalytic reactions.In this experiment, keeping the pellet in a CO 2 atmosphere with 55 RH and illuminated for 1 hr., which resulted in a 25 increase in product formation.In the case of methane, 62 ppm/(cm 2 h) was achieved as compared to 49 ppm/(cm 2 h) for the 'static' configuration when was the wafer was simply placed on the floor of the reactor.When converted to volumetric quantity, taking into account the volume of the chamber and STP conditions, 62 ppm/(cm 2 h) of methane amounted to about 3 nMol/cm 2 .h.If the other side of the pellet had been exposed to light and taken part in the photo-catalytic reactions; then the effective product formation per unit surface area would have been reduced because of the increase in the available surface for photo-catalytic reactions.Therefore, we believe that, the increase in product formation could be attributed to the lifted geometry, in which the pellet acted like a flow-through membrane, giving way to the reaction products to be moved away and hence reducing the chances of back-reactions.The use of such wafers configured as flow-through membranes is a viable route for achieving large-scale and low cost photocatalytic solar fuel production."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "Pt is a noble metal and its Fermi level is lower than that of the TiO 2 .Hence the photo-excited electrons are easily separated from the corresonding holes in the photo-catalyst (TiO 2 ) and enter Pt, which act as an electron sink.", "context": "A flow-through configuration (Figure 1a) was implemented by raising the wafer off the bottom of the reaction chamber using a perforated Teflon spacer that allowed, but did not force, gas circulation through the wafer.To maximize the product output, the top surface of the wafer was sensitized with both Cu and Pt Wave nu mber (cm -1 ) nanoparticles, each covering half of the surface area.The photocatalytic product formation rates from such a flow-through configuration has been presented later.Figure 1b is a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) image of the nanoparticle wafer surface.The TiO 2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed, forming a nanoporous structured film.FTIR spectra of the wafers under different sintering conditions are shown in Figure 2, with that for P-25 powder shown for comparison.The FTIR spectrum of the un-sintered wafer shows absorption in the 2800-3000 cm -1 range indicating trace organics.These absorption bands gradually disappear with sintering temperature;

In a passive, flow-through membrane configuration an approximately 25 increase in product output was achieved in comparison to the static configuration.Optimal membrane thickness and membrane pore size has yet to be determined.Greater porosity will allow a greater number of inter-connecting channels for co-catalyst sensitization as well as gas transport, while thicker membranes allow for greater light absorption.Uniform sensitization of the co-catalyst upon the entire surface of the photocatalytic semiconductor, via techniques such as microwave solvothermal 25 or atomic layer deposition (ALD), 28 should further enhance the photocatalytic reaction rates.

Figure 6a and Figure 6b show, respectively, time normalized product formation per unit area (ppm/(cm 2 h)) of Cu and Pt coated wafers.In both cases the methane yield reaches a maximum for 1 h exposure, beyond which it reduces with increasing exposure time.For the Cu coated sample the CO yield reaches a maximum value with 2 h exposure, and then reduces slightly with increasing exposure time.For the Pt coated samples the hydrogen yield increases with time reaching 250 ppm/(cm 2 h) with a 4 h exposure.Pt is a noble metal and its Fermi level is lower than that of the TiO 2 .Hence the photo-excited electrons are easily separated from the corresonding holes in the photo-catalyst (TiO 2 ) and enter Pt, which act as an electron sink.This lowers the chances of electron-hole recombination.In a Pt-TiO 2 system under illumination, therefore, the holes can react with water to produce hydrogen ions, which, in turn, react with electrons to yield hydrogen molecule.As mentioned in the report by Kitano et al. (Appl.Catal.A, 325, 2007, 1), a Pt-TiO 2 system can work as a short-circuited electrochemical cell that promotes hydrogen evolution from water under the light irradiation.For the present experimental conditions the time dependence of the hydrocarbon product yield indicates that both Cu and Pt co-catalysts show maximum activity in the first hour of exposure followed by degradation thereafter.CO 2 gas with moisture content ranging from 0 to 100 was tested in the reaction chamber.Figure 7a and Figure 7b show, respectively, the effect of relative humidity on product formation for wafers coated with Cu and Pt nanoparticles.Experiments with dry CO 2 on both Cu coated and Pt coated wafers yield less than 10 ppm/(cm 2 h) of methane and similar amounts of CO and hydrogen.For Cu coated samples, rates of both methane and CO reach a maximum at about 55 RH and decreases with higher RH values; yields at 100 RH are about 20 ppm/cm 2 h for methane and 9 ppm/(cm 2 h) for CO.A similar trend is observed for the methane yield in Pt coated samples, which begins with 5 ppm/cm 2 h at 0 RH, with a maximum yield of 32 ppm/(cm 2 h) at 55 RH and decreases to 15 ppm/(cm 2 h) at 100 RH.However, hydrogen production increases monotonically and reaches its maximum value of 200 ppm/(cm 2 h) at 100 RH.The optimum moisture content for maximum methane formation is about 55 RH and further increasing the water vapor content inside the reaction chamber leads to degradation of catalysts.With use of the samples in the CO 2 reduction chamber, visual inspection of the Cu sensitized wafers showed the Cu nanoparticles turned from metallic in appearance to dark colored as associated with copper oxide. It has been shown that for gas phase photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 that product yields can be maximized by having both Cu and Pt nanoparticles deposited on the surface of the semiconductor photocatalyst 17.Hence we attempted to increase product formation by sputtering Cu (100 s) on half of the wafer's surface and Pt (8 s) on the other half.The coatings of Pt and Cu were not overlapped in order to avoid the covering of one metal with the other.Figure 8 shows the product formation rates from a Cu-Pt sensitized wafer kept in a 55 RH CO 2 ambient and illuminated for 1 h; the methane yield reaches 49 ppm/(cm 2 h), significantly higher than that of either Cu or Pt coated samples.In order to have a practical and efficient CO 2 conversion process, a dynamic system involving a flow-through configuration is essential, wherein CO 2 and water vapor can be passed through one end of a photocatalytic membrane exposed to solar radiation and hydrocarbon products are collected from the other end.Grimes and coworkers 17,27 conceived the idea of such a photocatalytic flow-through membrane using TiO 2 nanotube arrays.As shown the Fig. 1(a), we attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of nanoporous TiO 2 pellet as a flow-through membrane.Since the pellet was not transparent, light did not reach the other side (of the surface).Therefore, there was no \"photo-catalytic\" reaction expected on that side (bottom part) of the pellet.Referring to Fig. 1a, light from the solar simulator was incident on the top surface of the pellet (coated with Pt and Cu) and caused photo-catalytic reactions to take place; however, because of the lifted geometry and availability of micro-channels (randomly connected pores) in the pellet, the products could permeate through the pellet to the other side, reducing the chances of back-reactions.When the pellet was placed on the bottom of the reaction chamber, the reactants and products are always in close proximity to each other near the top surface and that was expected to enhance the back reaction rate.Furthermore, the other side of the disk was neither exposed to light nor coated with co-catalysts (Cu/Pt) and hence, this side did not take part in the photo-catalytic reactions.In this experiment, keeping the pellet in a CO 2 atmosphere with 55 RH and illuminated for 1 hr., which resulted in a 25 increase in product formation.In the case of methane, 62 ppm/(cm 2 h) was achieved as compared to 49 ppm/(cm 2 h) for the 'static' configuration when was the wafer was simply placed on the floor of the reactor.When converted to volumetric quantity, taking into account the volume of the chamber and STP conditions, 62 ppm/(cm 2 h) of methane amounted to about 3 nMol/cm 2 .h.If the other side of the pellet had been exposed to light and taken part in the photo-catalytic reactions; then the effective product formation per unit surface area would have been reduced because of the increase in the available surface for photo-catalytic reactions.Therefore, we believe that, the increase in product formation could be attributed to the lifted geometry, in which the pellet acted like a flow-through membrane, giving way to the reaction products to be moved away and hence reducing the chances of back-reactions.The use of such wafers configured as flow-through membranes is a viable route for achieving large-scale and low cost photocatalytic solar fuel production."}, {"llm generation": "Cu and/or Pt nanoparticle co-catalysts", "source": "Thin wafers made from P-25 Degussa TiO 2 powder sensitized with Cu and/or Pt nanoparticle co-catalysts have been explored for gas-phase photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .", "context": "Thin wafers made from P-25 Degussa TiO 2 powder sensitized with Cu and/or Pt nanoparticle co-catalysts have been explored for gas-phase photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Sputtered layers of Cu and Pt co-catalysts were deposited on the wafer surface to enhance reaction rates, which were effectively zero when the co-catalysts were not used.We found that optimum amounts of co-catalyst loading on the wafer surface were approximately 9.6 at. of Cu and 8.7 at Pt while the presence of both co-catalysts improved overall reaction rates.Experiments to study the effect of relative humidity (RH) on CO 2 reduction revealed that the reduction products reached a maximum with a RH of 55.Photocatalytic reaction rates were studied as a function of illumination duration with maximum product formation observed for 1 hr exposure.Longer illumination durations led to visible degradation of the metal co-catalysts and hence a reduction in the product formation rates. In a passive, flow-through membrane configuration an approximately 25 increase in product output was achieved in comparison to the static configuration.Optimal membrane thickness and membrane pore size has yet to be determined.Greater porosity will allow a greater number of inter-connecting channels for co-catalyst sensitization as well as gas transport, while thicker membranes allow for greater light absorption.Uniform sensitization of the co-catalyst upon the entire surface of the photocatalytic semiconductor, via techniques such as microwave solvothermal 25 or atomic layer deposition (ALD), 28 should further enhance the photocatalytic reaction rates.

The CO formation rate was found to increase with Cu sputtering time, a behavior attributed to enhanced CO 2 adsorption on the Cu sites and subsequent reduction to CO by electron transfer from the metal.However with increasing Cu coverage, depositions beyond 100 s, both light absorption and exposure of water vapor to the TiO 2 surface are reduced, which in turn reduces the possibility of H ion formation through oxidation by the photo-generated holes.Hence in spite of the enhanced CO 2 reduction to CO, further Cu deposition and the corresponding reduced availability of H ions decreases the rate of methane production.The amount of Cu relative to TiO 2 on the wafer surface after 100 s of sputtering, estimated by XPS with a sampling depth of approximately 8 nm, was determined to be 9.6.Since a sputtering time of 100 s yielded a maximum methane formation rate for all further experiments utilizing Cu sensitization Cu was sputtered for 100 s.The effect of Pt sputtering time (200 W, 63 mA, 2 in diameter target) on the product formation rates shows, Figure 5b, that a sputtering time of 8 s yields a maximum amount of methane and hydrogen.Therefore, for all further experiments involving Pt coated wafers, a sputtering time of 8 s was chosen.XPS analysis, 8 nm sampling depth, of wafers coated with Pt sputtered for 8 s showed that the amount of Pt relative to TiO 2 on the wafer surface was 8.7.To evaluate the reaction performance with time, wafers coated with Cu and Pt were illuminated for different durations, 0.25 h to 4 h. Figure 6a and Figure 6b show, respectively, time normalized product formation per unit area (ppm/(cm 2 h)) of Cu and Pt coated wafers.In both cases the methane yield reaches a maximum for 1 h exposure, beyond which it reduces with increasing exposure time.For the Cu coated sample the CO yield reaches a maximum value with 2 h exposure, and then reduces slightly with increasing exposure time.For the Pt coated samples the hydrogen yield increases with time reaching 250 ppm/(cm 2 h) with a 4 h exposure.Pt is a noble metal and its Fermi level is lower than that of the TiO 2 .Hence the photo-excited electrons are easily separated from the corresonding holes in the photo-catalyst (TiO 2 ) and enter Pt, which act as an electron sink.This lowers the chances of electron-hole recombination.In a Pt-TiO 2 system under illumination, therefore, the holes can react with water to produce hydrogen ions, which, in turn, react with electrons to yield hydrogen molecule.As mentioned in the report by Kitano et al. (Appl.Catal.A, 325, 2007, 1), a Pt-TiO 2 system can work as a short-circuited electrochemical cell that promotes hydrogen evolution from water under the light irradiation.For the present experimental conditions the time dependence of the hydrocarbon product yield indicates that both Cu and Pt co-catalysts show maximum activity in the first hour of exposure followed by degradation thereafter.CO 2 gas with moisture content ranging from 0 to 100 was tested in the reaction chamber.Figure 7a and Figure 7b show, respectively, the effect of relative humidity on product formation for wafers coated with Cu and Pt nanoparticles.Experiments with dry CO 2 on both Cu coated and Pt coated wafers yield less than 10 ppm/(cm 2 h) of methane and similar amounts of CO and hydrogen.For Cu coated samples, rates of both methane and CO reach a maximum at about 55 RH and decreases with higher RH values; yields at 100 RH are about 20 ppm/cm 2 h for methane and 9 ppm/(cm 2 h) for CO.A similar trend is observed for the methane yield in Pt coated samples, which begins with 5 ppm/cm 2 h at 0 RH, with a maximum yield of 32 ppm/(cm 2 h) at 55 RH and decreases to 15 ppm/(cm 2 h) at 100 RH.However, hydrogen production increases monotonically and reaches its maximum value of 200 ppm/(cm 2 h) at 100 RH.The optimum moisture content for maximum methane formation is about 55 RH and further increasing the water vapor content inside the reaction chamber leads to degradation of catalysts.With use of the samples in the CO 2 reduction chamber, visual inspection of the Cu sensitized wafers showed the Cu nanoparticles turned from metallic in appearance to dark colored as associated with copper oxide. It has been shown that for gas phase photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 that product yields can be maximized by having both Cu and Pt nanoparticles deposited on the surface of the semiconductor photocatalyst 17.Hence we attempted to increase product formation by sputtering Cu (100 s) on half of the wafer's surface and Pt (8 s) on the other half.The coatings of Pt and Cu were not overlapped in order to avoid the covering of one metal with the other.Figure 8 shows the product formation rates from a Cu-Pt sensitized wafer kept in a 55 RH CO 2 ambient and illuminated for 1 h; the methane yield reaches 49 ppm/(cm 2 h), significantly higher than that of either Cu or Pt coated samples.In order to have a practical and efficient CO 2 conversion process, a dynamic system involving a flow-through configuration is essential, wherein CO 2 and water vapor can be passed through one end of a photocatalytic membrane exposed to solar radiation and hydrocarbon products are collected from the other end.Grimes and coworkers 17,27 conceived the idea of such a photocatalytic flow-through membrane using TiO 2 nanotube arrays.As shown the Fig. 1(a), we attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of nanoporous TiO 2 pellet as a flow-through membrane.Since the pellet was not transparent, light did not reach the other side (of the surface).Therefore, there was no \"photo-catalytic\" reaction expected on that side (bottom part) of the pellet.Referring to Fig. 1a, light from the solar simulator was incident on the top surface of the pellet (coated with Pt and Cu) and caused photo-catalytic reactions to take place; however, because of the lifted geometry and availability of micro-channels (randomly connected pores) in the pellet, the products could permeate through the pellet to the other side, reducing the chances of back-reactions.When the pellet was placed on the bottom of the reaction chamber, the reactants and products are always in close proximity to each other near the top surface and that was expected to enhance the back reaction rate.Furthermore, the other side of the disk was neither exposed to light nor coated with co-catalysts (Cu/Pt) and hence, this side did not take part in the photo-catalytic reactions.In this experiment, keeping the pellet in a CO 2 atmosphere with 55 RH and illuminated for 1 hr., which resulted in a 25 increase in product formation.In the case of methane, 62 ppm/(cm 2 h) was achieved as compared to 49 ppm/(cm 2 h) for the 'static' configuration when was the wafer was simply placed on the floor of the reactor.When converted to volumetric quantity, taking into account the volume of the chamber and STP conditions, 62 ppm/(cm 2 h) of methane amounted to about 3 nMol/cm 2 .h.If the other side of the pellet had been exposed to light and taken part in the photo-catalytic reactions; then the effective product formation per unit surface area would have been reduced because of the increase in the available surface for photo-catalytic reactions.Therefore, we believe that, the increase in product formation could be attributed to the lifted geometry, in which the pellet acted like a flow-through membrane, giving way to the reaction products to be moved away and hence reducing the chances of back-reactions.The use of such wafers configured as flow-through membranes is a viable route for achieving large-scale and low cost photocatalytic solar fuel production."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Solar Simulator", "source": "For testing the chamber was illuminated under AM 1.5G using a Class A solar simulator (Newport corporation), 100 mW/cm 2 .", "context": "Nanoparticle wafers were fabricated using TiO 2 powder (Degussa-P25, 80 anatase-20 rutile) having an average particle size of 25 nm.Polyethylene glycol (Fluka, PEG-2000), 5 wt. of TiO 2 , was used as a binder to make wafers mechanically robust.TiO 2 nanopowder and PEG were mixed in ethanol and grinded for 2 hours to ensure proper mixing.The resultant slurry was left for 10-12 h under a table lamp for drying at approximately 28 C.

Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was performed in an indigenously designed 7.5 cm 3 stainless steel reaction chamber equipped with valves for filling and sealing of the chamber, a septum for gas sampling, and quartz window through which the sample was illuminated 17.The relative humidity, RH, of the reaction chamber was controlled by mixing dry CO 2 and moist CO 2 (dry gas bubbled through de-ionized water) while keeping the total amount of CO 2 inside the reaction chamber constant.The relative humidity of the gas mixture was measured using an RH probe attached to a Keithley 6517 Electrometer.After placing the wafer inside the reaction chamber it was evacuated to a pressure of 10 mTorr and then flushed with CO 2 of desired RH for several minutes before the valves were closed (first the exit valve, then 10 s later the entrance valve).The total pressure of moisture contained CO 2 was kept close to that of atmospheric pressure in order to perform the photocatalytic reaction in ambient conditions.For testing the chamber was illuminated under AM 1.5G using a Class A solar simulator (Newport corporation), 100 mW/cm 2 .Gas samples were analyzed using a Shimadzu GC 2014 gas chromatograph equipped with FID and TCD detectors.The possibility of sample contamination was investigated by performing photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments replacing water vapor with high purity helium; in all such cases only 1-2 ppm hydrocarbon levels were detected."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Solar Spectrum Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 and Water Vapor Into Hydrocarbons Using TiO2 Nanoparticle Membranes", "context": "Solar Spectrum Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 and Water Vapor Into Hydrocarbons Using TiO2 Nanoparticle Membranes"}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The use of co-catalyst (Cu, Pt)-sensitized TiO 2 nanoparticle wafers in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and water vapor to hydrocarbon fuels, with optimal humidity levels and exposure times established.", "context": "A viable option for recycling carbon dioxide is through the sunlight-powered photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and water vapor into hydrocarbon fuels over highly active nanocatalysts.With photocatalytic CO 2 reduction sunlight, a renewable energy source as durable as the sun, is used to drive the catalytic reaction with the resultant fuel products compatible with the current hydrocarbon-based energy infrastructure.The use of co-catalyst (Cu, Pt)-sensitized TiO 2 nanoparticle wafers in the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and water vapor to hydrocarbon fuels, with optimal humidity levels and exposure times established.We also attempted to increase product formation by sputtering both co-catalysts on the nanoparticle wafer's surface, with the resulting product rates significantly higher than that of either the Cu or Pt coated samples.When the TiO 2 nanoparticle wafers are used in a flow-through membrane implementation we find a significant increase in product rates of formation, including methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide.We believe that nanocatalyst-based flow-through membranes are a viable route for achieving large-scale and low cost photocatalytic solar fuel production."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "It has been shown that for gas phase photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 that product yields can be maximized by having both Cu and Pt nanoparticles deposited on the surface of the semiconductor photocatalyst 17.", "context": "A flow-through configuration (Figure 1a) was implemented by raising the wafer off the bottom of the reaction chamber using a perforated Teflon spacer that allowed, but did not force, gas circulation through the wafer.To maximize the product output, the top surface of the wafer was sensitized with both Cu and Pt Wave nu mber (cm -1 ) nanoparticles, each covering half of the surface area.The photocatalytic product formation rates from such a flow-through configuration has been presented later.Figure 1b is a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) image of the nanoparticle wafer surface.The TiO 2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed, forming a nanoporous structured film.FTIR spectra of the wafers under different sintering conditions are shown in Figure 2, with that for P-25 powder shown for comparison.The FTIR spectrum of the un-sintered wafer shows absorption in the 2800-3000 cm -1 range indicating trace organics.These absorption bands gradually disappear with sintering temperature; the spectrum of the wafer sintered at 400 C for 4 h matches with that of the P-25 Degussa powder, indicating complete removal of the binder.Further increases in the sintering temperature were not attempted to avoid unintentional phase variation compared with the P-25 powder.Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns of Degussa P-25 TiO 2 powder and the TiO 2 wafer sintered at 400 C for 4 h.As seen in the XRD patterns, wafer sintering did not induce an additional phase change, with all observed peaks similar to that of the P-25 powder.The pore size distribution of the wafers was measured using the BJH technique; the gas adsorptiondesorption curves are shown in Figure 4a.A remarkable adsorption at high relative pressures suggests the presence of a high surface area nanoporous structure caused by the packed nanoparticles as indicated by the FESEM image (Figure 1b).The average pore size estimated from the adsorption-desorption curves was about 30 nm as seen in Figure 4b.As mentioned by Varghese et al., 17 photo-generated holes help to ionize water and the electrons reduce CO 2 .The photocatalytic reaction processes are chemically represented as: The nanoparticles of metals (Pt/Cu), which act as co-catalysts, do not directly take part in these reactions; however they help towards the adsorption of gaseous species and the separation of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs.Hence, as a first experiment, TiO 2 wafers sensitized by either Pt or Cu co-catalyst nanoparticles were placed on the bottom of the photocatalytic reaction chambers in a 55 relative humidity CO 2 atmosphere and exposed to 1 h of AM 1.5G illumination.Figure 5a and Figure 5b show the gaseous reaction products as a function of sputter deposition times for, respectively, Cu and Pt deposition.Methane is found to be the major hydrocarbon product, while hydrogen and carbon monoxide are also observed.For Cu coated samples, Figure 5a,a a value that decreased with further increases in sputtering time. The CO formation rate was found to increase with Cu sputtering time, a behavior attributed to enhanced CO 2 adsorption on the Cu sites and subsequent reduction to CO by electron transfer from the metal.However with increasing Cu coverage, depositions beyond 100 s, both light absorption and exposure of water vapor to the TiO 2 surface are reduced, which in turn reduces the possibility of H ion formation through oxidation by the photo-generated holes.Hence in spite of the enhanced CO 2 reduction to CO, further Cu deposition and the corresponding reduced availability of H ions decreases the rate of methane production.The amount of Cu relative to TiO 2 on the wafer surface after 100 s of sputtering, estimated by XPS with a sampling depth of approximately 8 nm, was determined to be 9.6.Since a sputtering time of 100 s yielded a maximum methane formation rate for all further experiments utilizing Cu sensitization Cu was sputtered for 100 s.The effect of Pt sputtering time (200 W, 63 mA, 2 in diameter target) on the product formation rates shows, Figure 5b, that a sputtering time of 8 s yields a maximum amount of methane and hydrogen.Therefore, for all further experiments involving Pt coated wafers, a sputtering time of 8 s was chosen.XPS analysis, 8 nm sampling depth, of wafers coated with Pt sputtered for 8 s showed that the amount of Pt relative to TiO 2 on the wafer surface was 8.7.To evaluate the reaction performance with time, wafers coated with Cu and Pt were illuminated for different durations, 0.25 h to 4 h. Figure 6a and Figure 6b show, respectively, time normalized product formation per unit area (ppm/(cm 2 h)) of Cu and Pt coated wafers.In both cases the methane yield reaches a maximum for 1 h exposure, beyond which it reduces with increasing exposure time.For the Cu coated sample the CO yield reaches a maximum value with 2 h exposure, and then reduces slightly with increasing exposure time.For the Pt coated samples the hydrogen yield increases with time reaching 250 ppm/(cm 2 h) with a 4 h exposure.Pt is a noble metal and its Fermi level is lower than that of the TiO 2 .Hence the photo-excited electrons are easily separated from the corresonding holes in the photo-catalyst (TiO 2 ) and enter Pt, which act as an electron sink.This lowers the chances of electron-hole recombination.In a Pt-TiO 2 system under illumination, therefore, the holes can react with water to produce hydrogen ions, which, in turn, react with electrons to yield hydrogen molecule.As mentioned in the report by Kitano et al. (Appl.Catal.A, 325, 2007, 1), a Pt-TiO 2 system can work as a short-circuited electrochemical cell that promotes hydrogen evolution from water under the light irradiation.For the present experimental conditions the time dependence of the hydrocarbon product yield indicates that both Cu and Pt co-catalysts show maximum activity in the first hour of exposure followed by degradation thereafter.CO 2 gas with moisture content ranging from 0 to 100 was tested in the reaction chamber.Figure 7a and Figure 7b show, respectively, the effect of relative humidity on product formation for wafers coated with Cu and Pt nanoparticles.Experiments with dry CO 2 on both Cu coated and Pt coated wafers yield less than 10 ppm/(cm 2 h) of methane and similar amounts of CO and hydrogen.For Cu coated samples, rates of both methane and CO reach a maximum at about 55 RH and decreases with higher RH values; yields at 100 RH are about 20 ppm/cm 2 h for methane and 9 ppm/(cm 2 h) for CO.A similar trend is observed for the methane yield in Pt coated samples, which begins with 5 ppm/cm 2 h at 0 RH, with a maximum yield of 32 ppm/(cm 2 h) at 55 RH and decreases to 15 ppm/(cm 2 h) at 100 RH.However, hydrogen production increases monotonically and reaches its maximum value of 200 ppm/(cm 2 h) at 100 RH.The optimum moisture content for maximum methane formation is about 55 RH and further increasing the water vapor content inside the reaction chamber leads to degradation of catalysts.With use of the samples in the CO 2 reduction chamber, visual inspection of the Cu sensitized wafers showed the Cu nanoparticles turned from metallic in appearance to dark colored as associated with copper oxide. It has been shown that for gas phase photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 that product yields can be maximized by having both Cu and Pt nanoparticles deposited on the surface of the semiconductor photocatalyst 17.Hence we attempted to increase product formation by sputtering Cu (100 s) on half of the wafer's surface and Pt (8 s) on the other half.The coatings of Pt and Cu were not overlapped in order to avoid the covering of one metal with the other.Figure 8 shows the product formation rates from a Cu-Pt sensitized wafer kept in a 55 RH CO 2 ambient and illuminated for 1 h; the methane yield reaches 49 ppm/(cm 2 h), significantly higher than that of either Cu or Pt coated samples.In order to have a practical and efficient CO 2 conversion process, a dynamic system involving a flow-through configuration is essential, wherein CO 2 and water vapor can be passed through one end of a photocatalytic membrane exposed to solar radiation and hydrocarbon products are collected from the other end.Grimes and coworkers 17,27 conceived the idea of such a photocatalytic flow-through membrane using TiO 2 nanotube arrays.As shown the Fig. 1(a), we attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of nanoporous TiO 2 pellet as a flow-through membrane.Since the pellet was not transparent, light did not reach the other side (of the surface).Therefore, there was no \"photo-catalytic\" reaction expected on that side (bottom part) of the pellet.Referring to Fig. 1a, light from the solar simulator was incident on the top surface of the pellet (coated with Pt and Cu) and caused photo-catalytic reactions to take place; however, because of the lifted geometry and availability of micro-channels (randomly connected pores) in the pellet, the products could permeate through the pellet to the other side, reducing the chances of back-reactions.When the pellet was placed on the bottom of the reaction chamber, the reactants and products are always in close proximity to each other near the top surface and that was expected to enhance the back reaction rate.Furthermore, the other side of the disk was neither exposed to light nor coated with co-catalysts (Cu/Pt) and hence, this side did not take part in the photo-catalytic reactions.In this experiment, keeping the pellet in a CO 2 atmosphere with 55 RH and illuminated for 1 hr., which resulted in a 25 increase in product formation.In the case of methane, 62 ppm/(cm 2 h) was achieved as compared to 49 ppm/(cm 2 h) for the 'static' configuration when was the wafer was simply placed on the floor of the reactor.When converted to volumetric quantity, taking into account the volume of the chamber and STP conditions, 62 ppm/(cm 2 h) of methane amounted to about 3 nMol/cm 2 .h.If the other side of the pellet had been exposed to light and taken part in the photo-catalytic reactions; then the effective product formation per unit surface area would have been reduced because of the increase in the available surface for photo-catalytic reactions.Therefore, we believe that, the increase in product formation could be attributed to the lifted geometry, in which the pellet acted like a flow-through membrane, giving way to the reaction products to be moved away and hence reducing the chances of back-reactions.The use of such wafers configured as flow-through membranes is a viable route for achieving large-scale and low cost photocatalytic solar fuel production."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Thin wafers made from P-25 Degussa TiO 2 powder sensitized with Cu and/or Pt nanoparticle co-catalysts have been explored for gas-phase photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .", "context": "Thin wafers made from P-25 Degussa TiO 2 powder sensitized with Cu and/or Pt nanoparticle co-catalysts have been explored for gas-phase photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Sputtered layers of Cu and Pt co-catalysts were deposited on the wafer surface to enhance reaction rates, which were effectively zero when the co-catalysts were not used.We found that optimum amounts of co-catalyst loading on the wafer surface were approximately 9.6 at. of Cu and 8.7 at Pt while the presence of both co-catalysts improved overall reaction rates.Experiments to study the effect of relative humidity (RH) on CO 2 reduction revealed that the reduction products reached a maximum with a RH of 55.Photocatalytic reaction rates were studied as a function of illumination duration with maximum product formation observed for 1 hr exposure.Longer illumination durations led to visible degradation of the metal co-catalysts and hence a reduction in the product formation rates. In a passive, flow-through membrane configuration an approximately 25 increase in product output was achieved in comparison to the static configuration.Optimal membrane thickness and membrane pore size has yet to be determined.Greater porosity will allow a greater number of inter-connecting channels for co-catalyst sensitization as well as gas transport, while thicker membranes allow for greater light absorption.Uniform sensitization of the co-catalyst upon the entire surface of the photocatalytic semiconductor, via techniques such as microwave solvothermal 25 or atomic layer deposition (ALD), 28 should further enhance the photocatalytic reaction rates.
