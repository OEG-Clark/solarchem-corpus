rubber plugs.Then the reactor was purged with argon for 1 h to thoroughly remove the air.Afterward, 0.3 mL of 2 M H 2 SO 4 (0.006 mol) was elaborately injected into the groove to result in complete transfer of NaHCO 3 into CO 2 gas which was then dissolved in water for reduction reactions.Both NaHCO 3 and H 2 SO 4 did not contact the catalyst in the deionized water.The resulting products CO, CH 4 , and CH 3 OH were monitored and recorded by gas chromatography with an FID detector and a methanizer (PGC-80, PANNA). 2.7.Computational Methods.The DFT calculations of structural optimization, band gap, and density of states were performed using Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP). 32The exchange-correlation interactions were treated by generalized gradient approximation with norm-conserving pseudopotentials parametrized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof. 33n energy cutoff of 350 eV was used.The k-point sampling sets of 5 5 4 were tested.A force tolerance of 0.01 eV A -1 ,

triethanolamine (TEOA), ascorbic acid, dicyandiamide (DCDA), and chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 ) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.All the reagents were not further purified before use.Deionized water was used for all experiments. 2.2.Synthesis of Pristine g-C 3 N 4 and HGONTP Photocatalysts.Typically, pristine g-C 3 N 4 was synthesized by the previously reported method. 44Hydroxyl-grafted oxygen-and nitrogen-linked tri-s-triazine-based polymers (HGONTP) were synthesized as follows: 2 g of DCDA was dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water.The resulting solution was treated through a hydrothermal approach at 160 C, 180 C, or 200 C for 12 h and then freeze-dried for 24 h to afford DCDA-160, DCDA-180, and DCDA-200, respectively.The white solids were further calcined at 600 C for 2 h under N 2 atmosphere.The obtained powders were washed three times with deionized water and dried in vacuum overnight.These products were labeled as HGONTP-160, HGONTP-180, and HGONTP-200, respectively.The synthesis of HGONTP is shown Scheme S1 in Supporting Information. 2.3.Characterizations.The following characterizations were described in refs 44 and 48: powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, electrospray ionization (ESI), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), specific surface area (BET), and photoluminescence (PL). Photoelectrochemical properties were studied in a 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI600E) with a three-electrode system.The catalyst-coated FTO glass, a Pt foil, and a Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively.A 300 W Xe arc lamp (Beijing Perfectlight, PLS-SXE300D) equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter was utilized as the light source.The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded at 1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl over a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz.The photocurrent with ON/OFF cycles was measured at 0 V vs Ag/AgCl.Mott-Schottky plots were obtained using previously reported methods. 44The fabrication of the working electrode (1.67 mg of catalyst cm -2 , active area of 3 cm 2 ) was previously reported by us. 44,48.5.Photocatalytic H 2 Evolution.The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) were carried out in a sealed Pyrex glass reaction cell (Beijing Perfectlight, Labsolar 6A) containing 80 mL of 10 vol TEOA aqueous solution and 100 mg of photocatalyst with photodeposited 3 wt of Pt followed by removal of air using argon gas.Under irradiation from a 300 W xenon lamp (equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter), the produced H 2 was analyzed with a Shimadzu gas chromatograph.The average activities were calculated from five runs.The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was calculated using the following formula: number of evolved hydrogen molecules 2 number of incident photons 100 The light intensities were taken at 420, 500, 600, 700, and 800 nm ( 10 nm at 10 of peak width).2.6.Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction.In a typical procedure, a 300 W Xe lamp with an AM1.5 filter was used as the light source.The photocatalyst (50 mg) was put onto the bottom of a two-neck Pyrex reactor containing 50 mL of deionized water with two parallel planes.NaHCO 3 (0.084 g, 0.001 mol) was carefully put into a groove on one of the necks.The two necks were sealed with rubber plugs.Then the reactor was purged with argon for 1 h to thoroughly remove the air.Afterward, 0.3 mL of 2 M H 2 SO 4 (0.006 mol) was elaborately injected into the groove to result in complete transfer of NaHCO 3 into CO 2 gas which was then dissolved in water for reduction reactions.Both NaHCO 3 and H 2 SO 4 did not contact the catalyst in the deionized water.The resulting products CO, CH 4 , and CH 3 OH were monitored and recorded by gas chromatography with an FID detector and a methanizer (PGC-80, PANNA). 2.7.Computational Methods.The DFT calculations of structural optimization, band gap, and density of states were performed using Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP). 32The exchange-correlation interactions were treated by generalized gradient approximation with norm-conserving pseudopotentials parametrized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof. 33n energy cutoff of 350 eV was used.The k-point sampling sets of 5 5 4 were tested.A force tolerance of 0.01 eV A -1 , energy tolerance of 5.0 10 -7 eV per atom, and maximum displacement of 5.0 10 -4 A were considered.Each atom in the storage models was allowed to relax to the minimum enthalpy without constraints."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "To directly reveal the relationship between activity and structure of the catalyst, primarily, photocatalytic activities of the photocatalysts were evaluated in a standard assay of H 2 production from water under visible light irradiation (3 wt Pt as cocatalyst and 10 vol TEOA as electron donor).", "context": "HGONTP polymers with hydroxyl (OH) and oxygen-linker (C-O-C) groups were prepared by thermal polymerization of hydrothermally pretreated DCDA at a proper temperature (160 C, 180 C, and 200 C), because DCDA cyclization hardly occurs at lower hydrothermal temperatures and decomposes into ammonia and carbon dioxide at higher hydrothermal temperatures in an ambient atmosphere.The ESI mass spectra were recorded to analyze the structures of hydrothermally pretreated DCDA.Four products, melamine (MEL), ammeline (AMN), ammelide (AMD), and cyanuric acid (CYA), were obtained from the DCDA cyclization hydrothermal process (Figure 1a); meanwhile, DCDA disappeared completely after hydrothermal treatment (Figure S1a).The FTIR spectra further revealed the chemical structure of hydrolysis products of DCDA (Figure S1b).The peak at 2164 cm -1 for CN in DCDA became weaker and eventually disappeared while the peak at 810 cm -1 for heptazine rings became stronger at higher hydrothermal temperature, due to the cyclization reaction.Meanwhile, the peak at 3000-3500 cm -1 for the OH/NH 2 groups became broader and stronger, indicative of the hydrolysis of NH 2 group into OH.Clearly, the hydrolysis degree of the NH 2 groups could be controlled by the hydrothermal temperature.More pendant NH 2 groups could be replaced with OH at higher hydrothermal temperatures.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 and HGONTP were synthesized through thermal polymerization of DCDA and its hydrothermal products, respectively (Scheme S1).Organic elemental analysis was performed to reveal the composition of the asprepared samples.As listed in Table S1, the C/N ratio of pristine g-C 3 N 4 was lower than that of HGONTP while HGONTP had a quantity of O higher than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 .The O element was homogeneously distributed in HGONTP (Figure S2).The results indicate that the hydrothermal pretreatment strategy was feasible for introducing oxygen into the tri-s-triazine-based polymer framework.Raman spectra were recorded to reveal the molecular backbones of HGONTP (Figure 1b).The peak at 690 cm -1 for C-N-C linkages 34 in triheptazine of HGONTP decreased gradually when using DCDA hydrothermally pretreated at higher temperature, implying that N in the C-N-C linkages was partially substituted with O. HGONTP showed duller peaks for the heptazine-based framework compared to pristine g-C 3 N 4 , indicative of a disorderly gradient of structure after introducing an O atom into this framework.FTIR spectra were further recorded to confirm HGONTP structures (Figure 1c).The peaks for HGONTP were broader and duller than those for pristine g-C 3 N 4 , indicating a greater disorder in HGONTP.The most solid evidence came from the peaks between 3000 and 3300 cm -1 in g-C 3 N 4 , assigned to the stretching modes of the NH x moieties, 35 which were transformed into a very broad low-intensity band assigned to the OH species in HGONTP.Moreover, the C-N peaks at 1238 and 1404 cm -1 became weaker from pristine g-C 3 N 4 to HGONTP, 36 meaning a decrease of C-NH x .The structures of HGONTP and pristine g-C 3 N 4 were further determined by 13 C NMR spectroscopy (Figure 1d).The high field signal at about 156.8 ppm was assigned to CN 3 moieties, and the low field signal at about 164.2 ppm was related to CN 2 (NH) (C bonded to N linker). 37he high field signal in HGONTP was obviously broadened and shifted to lower field compared to that in g-C 3 N 4 .In addition, the low field signal in HGONTP was shifted to lower field and was divided into two peaks, indicative of a change of linker atoms.The chemical shift of C to low field indicated that the atoms close to C had electronegativity higher than that of N. The crystal structure of as-prepared samples was investigated by XRD (Figure S3).The peaks at 12.8for the in-plane packing of heptazine units became much weaker in HGONTP, indicating that the conjugated system in HGONTP might not be as well-defined as that in g-C 3 N 4 . 38he peak at about 27.3for g-C 3 N 4 is assigned to the interlayer stacking of aromatic segments. 39The peak was broadened and weakened gradually with introduction of C-O-C linkages and OH species into the conjugated framework, indicative of the progressive formation of few-layer structure. 40Furthermore, HGONTP sheets gradually became intertangled in the shrinking structure, and pores appeared with increasing hydrothermal temperature of DCDA (Figure S4). XPS spectroscopy was used to explore the composition and element states in these materials.The XPS peak intensity of O increased gradually from pristine g-C 3 N 4 to HGONTP-200 (Figure S5).The change tendency of O and N from XPS results was consistent with that from OEA results (Table S1). In the high-resolution XPS (HRXPS) spectra of O 1s (Figure 2a), pristine g-C 3 N 4 only showed an adsorbed H 2 O peak at 532.3 eV. 41In contrast, HGONTP samples displayed two new peaks: a high binding energy peak (533.1-533.9eV) for C-O-C species and a low binding energy peak (529.2-529.5 eV) for C-OH species. 42,43Furthermore, the peak intensity of C-O-C species became gradually stronger from HGONTP-160 to HGONTP-200, indicative of more O linkers between tri-striazine units, rather than doped into tri-s-triazine units.The N 1s spectra contained three components at 398.6, 400.0, and 401 eV (Figure 2b), corresponding to bicoordinated N 2c , tricoordinated N 3c , and NH x groups in the heptazine framework, respectively.The peak intensity of NH x gradually decreased from g-C 3 N 4 to HGONTP-200, owing to the substitution of NH x with OH and O groups.Particularly, no new N 1s peak appeared in HGONTP, indicating that no new chemical state of N appeared, i.e., N was not directly bonded to O.The C 1s spectra showed peaks at 288.2, 286.1, and 284.8 eV (Figure 2c), corresponding to N-CN, C-NH x (x 1, 2), and adventitious hydrocarbons, respectively. 44pecifically, a new peak at 289.1 eV for the C-O bond was observed in HGONTP, 45 further implying that O atoms were directly bonded to C rather than to N atoms.As analyzed above, the oxygen moieties in HGONTP were represented as terminal OH groups and C-O-C linkages.HGONTP showed a greatly changed morphology/texture compared to pristine g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 2d).Compared to pristine g-C 3 N 4 sheets, HGONTP sheets displayed a porous structure, especially HGONTP-200.The pore formation should be attributed to the shock of NH 3 released during the substitution of NH x by O-containing groups.N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurements were further used to examine the pore structure (Figure S6 and Table S2).The BET specific surface area (S BET ) of HGONTP increased progressively on going from HGONTP-160 to HGONTP-200.HGONTP-200 had the largest S BET of 96.1 m 2 g -1 .The porous structure of HGONTP would be beneficial to the adsorption of reactants for subsequent activation. 3.2.Photophysical and Photochemical Properties.The optical properties of pristine g-C 3 N 4 and HGONTP are reflected by the DRS spectra (Figure 3a).Pristine g-C 3 N 4 showed an intrinsic adsorption band edge at 452 nm assigned to the characteristic - transition.In contrast, the absorption of HGONTP exhibited a red shift, indicative of narrowed band gaps.Especially, HGONTP-200 exhibited an enhanced adsorption from 450 to 800 nm ascribed to n- electronic transition.It is noted that the n- electronic transition involving lone pair electrons is forbidden in a planar structure but allowed in distorted polymeric units. 34Therefore, there were more distorted and disordered structures in HGONTP due to the introduction of oxygen-containing groups.This disorder would give rise to separated electron and hole states with energies in the band gap, leading to narrower band gaps (Figure S7).To reveal the bandgap levels of the photocatalysts, valence band (VB) XPS spectra were collected (Figure 3c).The maximum VB positions were 2.14, 1.94, 1.88, and 1.87 eV for pristine g-C 3 N 4 , HGONTP-160, HGONTP-180, and HGONTP-200, respectively, corresponding to 1.58, 1.38, 1.32, and 1.31 V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH 7 using the formula E NHE /V VB maximum -4.44 (E NHE : potential of normal hydrogen electrode; of 3.88 eV: the electron work function of the analyzer). 46,47The calculated band energy levels are illustrated in Figure 3d.These results suggested that both conduction band (CB) and VB positions were largely affected by the introduction of the C-O-C linkage into the heptazine-based framework.To further verify their CB positions, Mott-Schottky plots were performed under different frequencies.As shown in Figure S8, both pristine g-C 3 N 4 and HGONTP exhibited positive slopes at frequencies of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 kHz, showing an n-type characteristic of semiconductors. 48The CB potentials determined in Mott-Schottky plots of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , HGONTP-160, HGONTP-180, and HGONTP-200 were about -1.21, -1.52, -1.45, and -1.07 V vs Ag/AgCl (-1.01, -1.32, -1.25, and -0.87 V vs NHE), respectively.The narrowing of the band gap ensures greater solar adsorption but still exhibits sufficient overpotential to drive proton reduction to H 2 .Furthermore, the Mott-Schottky plots revealed that HGONTP samples had a density of charge carriers higher than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 (Figure S8).To understand the relationship between O moieties and the narrowed bandgaps of HGONTP, DFT calculations of the band structure and partial density of states (PDOS) for pristine g-C 3 N 4 and HGONTP were performed.The calculations show that after introducing one C-O-C linkage and OH group into the unit cell of the heptazine-based framework, the bandgap energy decreased from 2.617 to 2.097 eV compared to pristine g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3e,h), which agrees well with the UV-vis DRS results.Both C 2p and N 2p orbitals contribute to the CB of pristine g-C 3 N 4 and HGONTP, while the VB is mainly composed of N 2p orbitals (Figure 3f,i).The band structure of HGONTP lacks the doping level in its forbidden band similar to that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 but differing from that of elemental doped g-C 3 N 4 . 49The results indicate that the oxygen atom does not directly contribute to both CB and VB of HGONTP but changes the relative contribution intensity of the C 2p and N 2p orbitals for CB.Therefore, narrowing of the bandgap of HGONTP compared to pristine g-C 3 N 4 is due to the coexistence of the oxygen-and nitrogen-linkers, rather than oxygen atom doping into the heptazine unit. The oxygen species in HGONTP are expected to affect the hydrophilicity and photoexcited charge carrier separation.As shown in Figure 4a, the contact angle of all HGONTP was smaller than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , meaning stronger hydrophilicity for HGONTP.The contact angle of HGONTP deceased with increasing hydrothermal temperature of DCDA, due to more OH groups introduced into the heptazine-based framework.Higher hydrophilicity allows HGONTP to more easily react with water molecules in the HER process.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra showed that pristine g-C 3 N 4 had fluorescence intensity tremendously higher than that for HGONTP (Figure 4b).Moreover, the dramatically reduced lifetime for photoexcited electron/hole pairs in HGONTP samples indicates an enhanced photoexcited electron/hole pair dissociation (Figure S9 and Table S3).These results indicate that the introduction of oxygen species (C-O-C linkage and OH groups) into the heptazine-based framework would be highly beneficial for the separation of photoexcited charge carriers, which are further corroborated by transient surface photovoltage (SPV) spectra (Figure 4c).The fast component (0.004 s) and slow component (0.008 s) correspond to the separation and diffusion of electron-hole pairs, respectively.The HGONTP samples, especially HGONTP-200, displayed an SPV signal much stronger than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , indicative of better separation and diffusion of electron-hole pairs.Transient photocurrent measurements revealed that HGONTP samples exhibited a sensitive photocurrent response under visible light irradiation (Figure 4d).The photocurrent intensity was well consistent with the SPV signal intensity.The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) can reflect the charge transfer property at the interface between photocatalyst and electrolyte.A smaller arc radius in the EIS plot indicates more efficient charge transfer.The smallest arc radius for HGONTP-200 revealed the lowest resistance of charge transfer (Figure S10).Therefore, the introduction of oxygen species (C-O-C linkage and OH groups) into the heptazine-based framework profoundly promoted photoexcited electron/hole pair separation, interfacial charge migration, and charge carrier density. Activity.To directly reveal the relationship between activity and structure of the catalyst, primarily, photocatalytic activities of the photocatalysts were evaluated in a standard assay of H 2 production from water under visible light irradiation (3 wt Pt as cocatalyst and 10 vol TEOA as electron donor).As shown in Figure 5a, HGONTP samples significantly improved the photocatalytic performance.In particular, HGONTP-200 presented a H 2 evolution rate (4.24 mmol g -1 h -1 ) about 20fold higher than that for pristine g-C 3 N 4 (0.212 mmol g -1 h -1 ).Then, to rule out the influence of cocatalyst on photoactivity improvement, a photocatalytic H 2 generation test in the absence of Pt was conducted.As shown in Figure S11, without Pt as cocatalyst, all HGONTP samples show photocatalytic generation activity higher than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , and HGONTP-200 still displays optimal performance, which confirms that the improvement in H 2 production activity is attributed to the introduction of oxygen species (C-O-C linkage and OH groups) into the framework of the catalyst.More specifically, the outstanding HER performance of HGONTP-200 can be attributed to the introduction of oxygen species into the molecule framework, causing excellent visible light absorption, an appropriate energy level, a large specific surface area, and a strong hydrophilic surface.More interestingly, H 2 evolution tests using different sacrificial agents were conducted (Figure 5b).Ascorbic acid and triethanolamine (TEOA) as acidic and basic sacrificial agents were selected, respectively.The HER rate of HGONTP-200 (6.540 mmol g -1 h -1 ) was 27.7-fold higher than that for pristine g-C 3 N 4 (0.236 mmol g -1 h -1 ) in ascorbic acid under visible light irradiation, while the HER rate was still enhanced to 20.5-fold for HGONTP-200 (4.24 mmol g -1 h -1 ) compared with that for pristine g-C 3 N 4 (0.207 mmol g -1 h -1 ) in basic TEOA.Whether using the acidic or basic sacrificial agent, the HER proceeded stably.This result demonstrated that the C-O-C linkage and OH group are beneficial to proton activation in the HER.Furthermore, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) for the HER over HGONTP-200 was 12.6 at 420 nm (Figure 5c).HGONTP-200 provided a pronounced activity under long wavelength irradiation, and the HER rate reached 0.174 mmol g -1 h -1 at 500 nm with a AQY of 4.1.The photocatalytic HER activity of HGONTP-200 outperforms that for g-C 3 N 4based photocatalysts reported to date (Table S4).Significantly, after being stored in air for 6 months, HGONTP-200 retained the same activity for the HER as that of the fresh sample (Figure S12).To further reveal the affinity of the photocatalyst surface toward reactants dissolved in water, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was performed in water without using cocatalysts and sacrificial agents (Figure 5d).The CO 2 source dissolved in water was provided by the in situ reaction of NaHCO 3 with H 2 SO 4 .Three products (CO, CH 4 , and CH 3 OH) were detected for all photocatalysts due to the rational conductive band energy of the catalyst (Figure S13). 50,51Furthermore, no H 2 evolution was detected in this reaction vessel, which should be attributed to the absence of noble-metal cocatalyst and to the high atmosphere pressure (1 atm) which hindered the formation of H 2 bubbles.Importantly, the dominant CO 2 reduction product from HGONTP samples was CO.The mechanism behind this selectivity can possibly be attributed to the dominant two-electron pathway in photocatalytic process for g-C 3 N 4 , 52 similar to that reported about photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. 5354455 The higher conversion efficiency of CO 2 on HGONTP catalysts compared with that on pristine g-C 3 N 4 may be attributed to more soluble CO 2 adsorbed on the hydrophilic surface of HGONTP compared to pristine g-C 3 N 4 , thereby facilitating CO 2 reduction. 51As shown in Table S5, the HGONTP catalysts showed conversion efficiency of CO 2 much higher than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 .HGONTP-200 showed a high conversion rate of CO 2 (3.732 mol g -1 h -1 ), 11.9 times higher than that for pristine g-C 3 N 4 (0.314 mol g -1 h -1 ).Furthermore, the selectivity for CO production over HGONTP-200 reached 88.4, much higher than that over pristine g-C 3 N 4 (43).Moreover, both CO production activity and selectivity of HGONTP-200 achieved one of the best performances of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reported recently using photocatalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 . 495005152 It was also found that the conversion efficiency and CO production selectivity of CO 2 increased as hydrophilicity increased gradually from pristine g-C 3 N 4 to HGONTP-200.The results indicate that more CO 2 dissolved in water participates in reduction reactions on HGONTP-200 with stronger hydrophilicity."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid (aqueous solution)", "source": "Figure 5.

meanwhile, DCDA disappeared completely after hydrothermal treatment (Figure S1a).The FTIR spectra further revealed the chemical structure of hydrolysis products of DCDA (Figure S1b).The peak at 2164 cm -1 for CN in DCDA became weaker and eventually disappeared while the peak at 810 cm -1 for heptazine rings became stronger at higher hydrothermal temperature, due to the cyclization reaction.Meanwhile, the peak at 3000-3500 cm -1 for the OH/NH 2 groups became broader and stronger, indicative of the hydrolysis of NH 2 group into OH.Clearly, the hydrolysis degree of the NH 2 groups could be controlled by the hydrothermal temperature.More pendant NH 2 groups could be replaced with OH at higher hydrothermal temperatures.Pristine g-C 3 N 4 and HGONTP were synthesized through thermal polymerization of DCDA and its hydrothermal products, respectively (Scheme S1).Organic elemental analysis was performed to reveal the composition of the asprepared samples.As listed in Table S1, the C/N ratio of pristine g-C 3 N 4 was lower than that of HGONTP while HGONTP had a quantity of O higher than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 .The O element was homogeneously distributed in HGONTP (Figure S2).The results indicate that the hydrothermal pretreatment strategy was feasible for introducing oxygen into the tri-s-triazine-based polymer framework.Raman spectra were recorded to reveal the molecular backbones of HGONTP (Figure 1b).The peak at 690 cm -1 for C-N-C linkages 34 in triheptazine of HGONTP decreased gradually when using DCDA hydrothermally pretreated at higher temperature, implying that N in the C-N-C linkages was partially substituted with O. HGONTP showed duller peaks for the heptazine-based framework compared to pristine g-C 3 N 4 , indicative of a disorderly gradient of structure after introducing an O atom into this framework.FTIR spectra were further recorded to confirm HGONTP structures (Figure 1c).The peaks for HGONTP were broader and duller than those for pristine g-C 3 N 4 , indicating a greater disorder in HGONTP.The most solid evidence came from the peaks between 3000 and 3300 cm -1 in g-C 3 N 4 , assigned to the stretching modes of the NH x moieties, 35 which were transformed into a very broad low-intensity band assigned to the OH species in HGONTP.Moreover, the C-N peaks at 1238 and 1404 cm -1 became weaker from pristine g-C 3 N 4 to HGONTP, 36 meaning a decrease of C-NH x .The structures of HGONTP and pristine g-C 3 N 4 were further determined by 13 C NMR spectroscopy (Figure 1d).The high field signal at about 156.8 ppm was assigned to CN 3 moieties, and the low field signal at about 164.2 ppm was related to CN 2 (NH) (C bonded to N linker). 37he high field signal in HGONTP was obviously broadened and shifted to lower field compared to that in g-C 3 N 4 .In addition, the low field signal in HGONTP was shifted to lower field and was divided into two peaks, indicative of a change of linker atoms.The chemical shift of C to low field indicated that the atoms close to C had electronegativity higher than that of N. The crystal structure of as-prepared samples was investigated by XRD (Figure S3).The peaks at 12.8for the in-plane packing of heptazine units became much weaker in HGONTP, indicating that the conjugated system in HGONTP might not be as well-defined as that in g-C 3 N 4 . 38he peak at about 27.3for g-C 3 N 4 is assigned to the interlayer stacking of aromatic segments. 39The peak was broadened and weakened gradually with introduction of C-O-C linkages and OH species into the conjugated framework, indicative of the progressive formation of few-layer structure. 40Furthermore, HGONTP sheets gradually became intertangled in the shrinking structure, and pores appeared with increasing hydrothermal temperature of DCDA (Figure S4). XPS spectroscopy was used to explore the composition and element states in these materials.The XPS peak intensity of O increased gradually from pristine g-C 3 N 4 to HGONTP-200 (Figure S5).The change tendency of O and N from XPS results was consistent with that from OEA results (Table S1). In the high-resolution XPS (HRXPS) spectra of O 1s (Figure 2a), pristine g-C 3 N 4 only showed an adsorbed H 2 O peak at 532.3 eV. 41In contrast, HGONTP samples displayed two new peaks: a high binding energy peak (533.1-533.9eV) for C-O-C species and a low binding energy peak (529.2-529.5 eV) for C-OH species. 42,43Furthermore, the peak intensity of C-O-C species became gradually stronger from HGONTP-160 to HGONTP-200, indicative of more O linkers between tri-striazine units, rather than doped into tri-s-triazine units.The N 1s spectra contained three components at 398.6, 400.0, and 401 eV (Figure 2b), corresponding to bicoordinated N 2c , tricoordinated N 3c , and NH x groups in the heptazine framework, respectively.The peak intensity of NH x gradually decreased from g-C 3 N 4 to HGONTP-200, owing to the substitution of NH x with OH and O groups.Particularly, no new N 1s peak appeared in HGONTP, indicating that no new chemical state of N appeared, i.e., N was not directly bonded to O.The C 1s spectra showed peaks at 288.2, 286.1, and 284.8 eV (Figure 2c), corresponding to N-CN, C-NH x (x 1, 2), and adventitious hydrocarbons, respectively. 44pecifically, a new peak at 289.1 eV for the C-O bond was observed in HGONTP, 45 further implying that O atoms were directly bonded to C rather than to N atoms.As analyzed above, the oxygen moieties in HGONTP were represented as terminal OH groups and C-O-C linkages.HGONTP showed a greatly changed morphology/texture compared to pristine g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 2d).Compared to pristine g-C 3 N 4 sheets, HGONTP sheets displayed a porous structure, especially HGONTP-200.The pore formation should be attributed to the shock of NH 3 released during the substitution of NH x by O-containing groups.N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurements were further used to examine the pore structure (Figure S6 and Table S2).The BET specific surface area (S BET ) of HGONTP increased progressively on going from HGONTP-160 to HGONTP-200.HGONTP-200 had the largest S BET of 96.1 m 2 g -1 .The porous structure of HGONTP would be beneficial to the adsorption of reactants for subsequent activation. 3.2.Photophysical and Photochemical Properties.The optical properties of pristine g-C 3 N 4 and HGONTP are reflected by the DRS spectra (Figure 3a).Pristine g-C 3 N 4 showed an intrinsic adsorption band edge at 452 nm assigned to the characteristic - transition.In contrast, the absorption of HGONTP exhibited a red shift, indicative of narrowed band gaps.Especially, HGONTP-200 exhibited an enhanced adsorption from 450 to 800 nm ascribed to n- electronic transition.It is noted that the n- electronic transition involving lone pair electrons is forbidden in a planar structure but allowed in distorted polymeric units. 34Therefore, there were more distorted and disordered structures in HGONTP due to the introduction of oxygen-containing groups.This disorder would give rise to separated electron and hole states with energies in the band gap, leading to narrower band gaps (Figure S7).To reveal the bandgap levels of the photocatalysts, valence band (VB) XPS spectra were collected (Figure 3c).The maximum VB positions were 2.14, 1.94, 1.88, and 1.87 eV for pristine g-C 3 N 4 , HGONTP-160, HGONTP-180, and HGONTP-200, respectively, corresponding to 1.58, 1.38, 1.32, and 1.31 V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH 7 using the formula E NHE /V VB maximum -4.44 (E NHE : potential of normal hydrogen electrode; of 3.88 eV: the electron work function of the analyzer). 46,47The calculated band energy levels are illustrated in Figure 3d.These results suggested that both conduction band (CB) and VB positions were largely affected by the introduction of the C-O-C linkage into the heptazine-based framework.To further verify their CB positions, Mott-Schottky plots were performed under different frequencies.As shown in Figure S8, both pristine g-C 3 N 4 and HGONTP exhibited positive slopes at frequencies of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 kHz, showing an n-type characteristic of semiconductors. 48The CB potentials determined in Mott-Schottky plots of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , HGONTP-160, HGONTP-180, and HGONTP-200 were about -1.21, -1.52, -1.45, and -1.07 V vs Ag/AgCl (-1.01, -1.32, -1.25, and -0.87 V vs NHE), respectively.The narrowing of the band gap ensures greater solar adsorption but still exhibits sufficient overpotential to drive proton reduction to H 2 .Furthermore, the Mott-Schottky plots revealed that HGONTP samples had a density of charge carriers higher than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 (Figure S8).To understand the relationship between O moieties and the narrowed bandgaps of HGONTP, DFT calculations of the band structure and partial density of states (PDOS) for pristine g-C 3 N 4 and HGONTP were performed.The calculations show that after introducing one C-O-C linkage and OH group into the unit cell of the heptazine-based framework, the bandgap energy decreased from 2.617 to 2.097 eV compared to pristine g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3e,h), which agrees well with the UV-vis DRS results.Both C 2p and N 2p orbitals contribute to the CB of pristine g-C 3 N 4 and HGONTP, while the VB is mainly composed of N 2p orbitals (Figure 3f,i).The band structure of HGONTP lacks the doping level in its forbidden band similar to that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 but differing from that of elemental doped g-C 3 N 4 . 49The results indicate that the oxygen atom does not directly contribute to both CB and VB of HGONTP but changes the relative contribution intensity of the C 2p and N 2p orbitals for CB.Therefore, narrowing of the bandgap of HGONTP compared to pristine g-C 3 N 4 is due to the coexistence of the oxygen-and nitrogen-linkers, rather than oxygen atom doping into the heptazine unit. The oxygen species in HGONTP are expected to affect the hydrophilicity and photoexcited charge carrier separation.As shown in Figure 4a, the contact angle of all HGONTP was smaller than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , meaning stronger hydrophilicity for HGONTP.The contact angle of HGONTP deceased with increasing hydrothermal temperature of DCDA, due to more OH groups introduced into the heptazine-based framework.Higher hydrophilicity allows HGONTP to more easily react with water molecules in the HER process.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra showed that pristine g-C 3 N 4 had fluorescence intensity tremendously higher than that for HGONTP (Figure 4b).Moreover, the dramatically reduced lifetime for photoexcited electron/hole pairs in HGONTP samples indicates an enhanced photoexcited electron/hole pair dissociation (Figure S9 and Table S3).These results indicate that the introduction of oxygen species (C-O-C linkage and OH groups) into the heptazine-based framework would be highly beneficial for the separation of photoexcited charge carriers, which are further corroborated by transient surface photovoltage (SPV) spectra (Figure 4c).The fast component (0.004 s) and slow component (0.008 s) correspond to the separation and diffusion of electron-hole pairs, respectively.The HGONTP samples, especially HGONTP-200, displayed an SPV signal much stronger than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , indicative of better separation and diffusion of electron-hole pairs.Transient photocurrent measurements revealed that HGONTP samples exhibited a sensitive photocurrent response under visible light irradiation (Figure 4d).The photocurrent intensity was well consistent with the SPV signal intensity.The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) can reflect the charge transfer property at the interface between photocatalyst and electrolyte.A smaller arc radius in the EIS plot indicates more efficient charge transfer.The smallest arc radius for HGONTP-200 revealed the lowest resistance of charge transfer (Figure S10).Therefore, the introduction of oxygen species (C-O-C linkage and OH groups) into the heptazine-based framework profoundly promoted photoexcited electron/hole pair separation, interfacial charge migration, and charge carrier density. Activity.To directly reveal the relationship between activity and structure of the catalyst, primarily, photocatalytic activities of the photocatalysts were evaluated in a standard assay of H 2 production from water under visible light irradiation (3 wt Pt as cocatalyst and 10 vol TEOA as electron donor).As shown in Figure 5a, HGONTP samples significantly improved the photocatalytic performance.In particular, HGONTP-200 presented a H 2 evolution rate (4.24 mmol g -1 h -1 ) about 20fold higher than that for pristine g-C 3 N 4 (0.212 mmol g -1 h -1 ).Then, to rule out the influence of cocatalyst on photoactivity improvement, a photocatalytic H 2 generation test in the absence of Pt was conducted.As shown in Figure S11, without Pt as cocatalyst, all HGONTP samples show photocatalytic generation activity higher than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , and HGONTP-200 still displays optimal performance, which confirms that the improvement in H 2 production activity is attributed to the introduction of oxygen species (C-O-C linkage and OH groups) into the framework of the catalyst.More specifically, the outstanding HER performance of HGONTP-200 can be attributed to the introduction of oxygen species into the molecule framework, causing excellent visible light absorption, an appropriate energy level, a large specific surface area, and a strong hydrophilic surface.More interestingly, H 2 evolution tests using different sacrificial agents were conducted (Figure 5b).Ascorbic acid and triethanolamine (TEOA) as acidic and basic sacrificial agents were selected, respectively.The HER rate of HGONTP-200 (6.540 mmol g -1 h -1 ) was 27.7-fold higher than that for pristine g-C 3 N 4 (0.236 mmol g -1 h -1 ) in ascorbic acid under visible light irradiation, while the HER rate was still enhanced to 20.5-fold for HGONTP-200 (4.24 mmol g -1 h -1 ) compared with that for pristine g-C 3 N 4 (0.207 mmol g -1 h -1 ) in basic TEOA.Whether using the acidic or basic sacrificial agent, the HER proceeded stably.This result demonstrated that the C-O-C linkage and OH group are beneficial to proton activation in the HER.Furthermore, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) for the HER over HGONTP-200 was 12.6 at 420 nm (Figure 5c).HGONTP-200 provided a pronounced activity under long wavelength irradiation, and the HER rate reached 0.174 mmol g -1 h -1 at 500 nm with a AQY of 4.1.The photocatalytic HER activity of HGONTP-200 outperforms that for g-C 3 N 4based photocatalysts reported to date (Table S4).Significantly, after being stored in air for 6 months, HGONTP-200 retained the same activity for the HER as that of the fresh sample (Figure S12).To further reveal the affinity of the photocatalyst surface toward reactants dissolved in water, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was performed in water without using cocatalysts and sacrificial agents (Figure 5d).The CO 2 source dissolved in water was provided by the in situ reaction of NaHCO 3 with H 2 SO 4 .Three products (CO, CH 4 , and CH 3 OH) were detected for all photocatalysts due to the rational conductive band energy of the catalyst (Figure S13). 50,51Furthermore, no H 2 evolution was detected in this reaction vessel, which should be attributed to the absence of noble-metal cocatalyst and to the high atmosphere pressure (1 atm) which hindered the formation of H 2 bubbles.Importantly, the dominant CO 2 reduction product from HGONTP samples was CO.The mechanism behind this selectivity can possibly be attributed to the dominant two-electron pathway in photocatalytic process for g-C 3 N 4 , 52 similar to that reported about photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. 5354455 The higher conversion efficiency of CO 2 on HGONTP catalysts compared with that on pristine g-C 3 N 4 may be attributed to more soluble CO 2 adsorbed on the hydrophilic surface of HGONTP compared to pristine g-C 3 N 4 , thereby facilitating CO 2 reduction. 51As shown in Table S5, the HGONTP catalysts showed conversion efficiency of CO 2 much higher than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 .HGONTP-200 showed a high conversion rate of CO 2 (3.732 mol g -1 h -1 ), 11.9 times higher than that for pristine g-C 3 N 4 (0.314 mol g -1 h -1 ).Furthermore, the selectivity for CO production over HGONTP-200 reached 88.4, much higher than that over pristine g-C 3 N 4 (43).Moreover, both CO production activity and selectivity of HGONTP-200 achieved one of the best performances of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reported recently using photocatalysts based on g-C 3 N 4 . 495005152 It was also found that the conversion efficiency and CO production selectivity of CO 2 increased as hydrophilicity increased gradually from pristine g-C 3 N 4 to HGONTP-200.The results indicate that more CO 2 dissolved in water participates in reduction reactions on HGONTP-200 with stronger hydrophilicity."}]}}
