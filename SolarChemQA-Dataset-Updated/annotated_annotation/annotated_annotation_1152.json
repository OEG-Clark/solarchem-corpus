important roles were performed for the research of the charge transfer for the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid.", "context": "The fabrication process of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid was illustrated schematically in Fig. 1a.Firstly, BiVO 4 nanoparticles were formed through the double decomposition reaction between Bi(NO 3 ) 3 and NH 4 VO 3 .Meanwhile, the generated nanoparticles self-assembled into erythroid-like architecture under the inducement of PVP.Then, BMIm C(CN) 3 was adsorbed by this hierarchical scaffold and proceeded into hm-C 4 N 3 on the surfaces of BiVO 4 via in-situ polymerization.BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites with different weight ratios of organic half-metal constituent were prepared under holding this unique erythroid-like architecture.The integration of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is detected through Xray diffraction (XRD) displayed in Fig. 1b.BiVO 4 displays the characteristic feature of zirconium silicate type tetragonal phase crystal structure.The diffraction peaks at 24.4 ,30.7 , 32.7 , 34.7 , 39.5 , 48.4 and 49.9 are assigned to the (2 0 0), (2 1 1), (1 1 2), (2 2 0), (3 0 1), (3 1 2) and (4 0 0) crystal planes which corresponds to the standard PDF card (JCPDS 14-0133) 35.The pristine hm-C 4 N 3 shows a broad peak around 26.1 which can be designated to its (0 0 2) plane.This reveals the interlayer stacked structure and the weak crystallinity of the conjugated aromatic system 22.As a result of the low weight ratio of hm-C 4 N 3 , the XRD patterns of four hybrids are similar to bare BiVO 4 , indicating that the staple scaffold of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 is BiVO 4 .It is worth noting that the peak at 26.1 emerges and becomes stronger for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 while more precursors for hm-C 4 N 3 is added during the preparation.The presence of hm-C 4 N 3 in the hybrids can thus be initially suggested.Furthermore, the FTIR spectra of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites and their constituents are investigated to demonstrate the hybridization of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 .As exhibited in Fig. S1, the pure BiVO 4 shows an asymmetric stretching mode centered at approximately 733 cm -1 which is regard as the vibration of VO 4 3-.Overlapping of these absorption peaks has caused a broad peak in the wavenumber range of 700-900 cm -1 36.The signal at 680 cm -1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of O -Bi -O.For hm-C 4 N 3 , the absorption at 661 cm -1 is originated from the stretching vibration of C -(C) 3 .The bands at 1000-1500 cm -1 and 1576 cm -1 belong to CN heterocycle and C--N stretching vibrations, respectively 22.C 4 N 3 -20 (Fig. S3) shows the uniform-distribution of Bi, O, V and N elements which demonstrates that BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 commonly devote to the construction of the 3D hierarchical structure together.From this point of view, the formation of a thin wrappage of hm-C 4 N 3 on the surface of BiVO 4 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 can be proposed.In addition, the mass fraction of hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).As observed from the TG curves (Fig. S4), hm-C 4 N 3 maintains 12 of the original weight after heating in atmosphere over 650 C. Whereas, BiVO 4 and the composite sample present 2.3 and 3.4 of weight loss upon heating to 800 C. Thence, the weight ratio of hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 can be calculated as 1.9 wt.After more incorporation of hm-C 4 N 3 , the BiVO 4 nanoparticles seem to be adhered evidently by polymeric continuous phase for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15 (Fig. S2b).In particular, the voids in the center of erythroid-like BiVO 4 are stuffed by organic hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 (Fig. S2c), forming evidently continuous exteriors. The TEM image of pristine BiVO 4 is displayed in Fig. S5.As it shows, the hollow structure can be obviously identified by the contrast of the light center and the dark profile.BiVO 4 is constructed by numerous welldefined nanoparticles.The diameter ( 2 m) of this 3D hollow hierarchical architecture is in accordance with the investigation in SEM images.After incorporation of hm-C 4 N 3 , the edge of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 was investigated in detail.As observed in Fig. 1f, the incorporation of hm-C 4 N 3 doesn't have any impact on the structure of BiVO 4 scaffold.A thin amorphous layer is presented on the surface of highly crystallized region (Fig. 1g).The lattice spacing of 0.369 nm is assigned to the (2 0 0) crystal planes of BiVO 4 37 which can be observed from the HRTEM image (Fig. 1h).In addition, the amorphous wrappage can be unambiguously differentiated between the red and blue dash lines.The thin and even coating of hm-C 4 N 3 is benefit to the transmission of incident photons, thus facilitating the synchronism exciting of hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 .Besides, the combinatorial image of HAADF-STEM of the composite and the correlative elemental mapping images of Bi, V, O, N and C elements specifically indicate the homogeneous combination of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 (Fig. 1i-n).At the edge of the sample, the uniform hybridization can also be confirmed (Fig. S6).The formation of numerous heterojunction interfaces can thus be suggested. The composition of BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 hybrid was further revealed by XPS spectra (Fig. 2a).It is observed that BiVO 4 is comprised of Bi, V and O elements.C and N elements can be detected in hm-C 4 N 3 .For BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20, Bi, V, O, C and N elements all emerge, demonstrating the hybridization of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 .Fig. 2b exhibits the C1s high-resolution spectrum of hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.The C1s spectrum of hm-C 4 N 3 can be divided into three peaks at 284.6 eV, 286.1 eV and 287.9 eV which can be assigned to adventitious carbon, center carbon and sp 2 -bonded carbon in triazine rings (N-C--N), respectively 9.After incorporation in BiVO 4 , the binding energies of center carbon and sp 2 2e and f present the high-resolution spectra of Bi4f and V2p for the samples, respectively.For the pure BiVO 4 , the binding energies at 158.7 eV and 164.0 eV can be considered as the Bi4f 7/2 and Bi4f 5/2 , respectively.The difference between these two values is 5.3 eV which is consistent with Bi 3 38,39.The V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 are located at 516.6 eV and 524.1 eV, respectively 40,41.After deposition of hm-C 4 N 3 , the binding energies of Bi4f and V2p both shift to lower values in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.In consideration of the difference of the binding energies for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 compared with that of pure BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 , the electron transfer from hm-C 4 N 3 to BiVO 4 in the composite is supposed to be existing 42.The facile charge transference and strong interfacial interaction are advantageous to separating of photoinduced charge carriers.In particular, the built-in electric field will avail the charge transfer from BiVO 4 to hm-C 4 N 3 after photoexcitation. Fig. 3a displays the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the photocatalysts.BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 exhibit characteristic type IV with H 3 -type hysteresis loops when the pressure ratio (P/P 0 ) is between 0.6 and 1.0, suggesting the existence of mesoporous structure as a result of the convergence of nanoparticles 43,44.The BET specific surface area of BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is 11.61 m 2 /g and 12.26 m 2 /g, respectively.By contrast, bulk hm-C 4 N 3 has no holes while displays no hysteresis loop and its specific surface area is 0.08 m 2 /g (Table S2).As obtained from the distribution curves of pore and size (Fig. 3b), BiVO owns three aperture distribution ranges.The pore size of less than 5 nm is attributed to the closely stacked nanoparticles, the agglomeration of assembles results in the diameter ranging from 5 nm to 9 nm and the pores larger than 15 nm are resulted from the exterior irregular aggregates.It is noticeable that the ratio of the smallest pores decreases for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20, and these pores are stuffed by the polymerized hm-C 4 N 3 .Meanwhile, the aperture range around 5-9 nm and beyond 20 nm becomes narrow (5-7.6 nm and 15-30 nm), manifesting the orientation of shrinkage to small sizes.The fraction of decreased pore sizes evidently elevates.This signifies that the surfaces of BiVO 4 have been wrapped by hm-C 4 N 3 with uniform distributions.Owing to the low ratio and thin thickness of hm-C 4 N 3 , BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 presents slight BET specific surface area and pore structure deviations from the pristine BiVO 4 .These observations are corresponding to the above-discussed SEM and TEM results, and the much abundant and well-defined heterojunction interfaces are thus be constructed. The photo-absorption capacity of the prepared BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrids was researched through UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS).As exhibited in Fig. 3c, the bare BiVO exhibits strong absorbance from 200 nm to 420 nm due to its broad bandgap.The obvious absorption band edge of BiVO 4 is located at 450 nm, which is in consistence with its yellow appearance (inset of Fig. 3c) and the previous report 45.Hm-C 4 N 3 shows much broad absorptions extending to 1200 nm owing to its dark appearance.For the composites, their absorption ability significantly increases both in ultraviolet light and visible light regions, though the weight ratio of hm-C 4 N 3 is low.It is noteworthy that the color of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N composites changes remarkably, which confirms the co-existence of the two materials and the superior light harvesting capacity of hm-C 4 N 3 .Generally, a higher hm-C 4 N 3 content brings about a stronger absorption band, and the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 exhibits the highest photo-absorption property due to the maximum loading amount of hm-C 4 N 3 .Besides, the bandgap energy of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 can be calculated according to the UV-vis DRS spectrum and the formula as follows: The calculated band gap of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is 2.55 eV and 1.42 eV that shown in Fig. 3d.The narrow bandgap of hm-C 4 N 3 is in accordance with its half-metallicity feature. In order to simulate the photosynthesis of green plant, the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion over the as-fabricated samples was performed under Xenon lamp irradiation with the presence of water.The pristine BiVO 4 shows negligible photocatalytic activity towards CO 2 conversion due to the weak reduction capacity, which is in accordance with its inherent band alignment.For hm-C 4 N 3 and the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites, the yield of CO and CH 4 both increases linearly upon extending of the illuminate time (Figs.4a andS7).CO is detected as the major product accompanied by generation of few amounts of CH 4 .The yield of CO for the bare hm-C 4 N 3 is only 34.9 mol g -1 under light irradiation for 6 h.After combination with BiVO 4 , the yield of CO for the compound obviously increases.Accordingly, the transfer of photoinduced electrons from hm-C 4 N 3 to BiVO 4 can be excluded, and the Z-Scheme heterojunction may be formed between BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 can be proposed.Comparison of the hybrids with different ratios of the two components, the CO production on BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 reaches the highest yield of 244.8 mol g -1 , surpassing most of the reported Z-Scheme system used for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion (Table.S3).Due to the inadequate wrappage or redundant deposition of hm-C 4 N 3 , the result of hybridization cannot be fully elaborated.The CO yield for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 is 230.4,185 and 83.8 mol g -1 , respectively.The overall CO and CH 4 evolution rates for hm-C 4 N 3 and the four hybrids are compared in Fig. 4b.The average CO generation rate of pristine hm-C 4 N 3 is 5.8 mol g -1 h -1 .By contrast, the optimized BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 shows 40.8 mol g -1 h -1 productivity of CO that is 7.1 folds higher than the bare hm-C 4 N 3 .In particular, the selectivity of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 over CO generation is significantly beyond 97 and the apparent quantum yield reaches 0.52 at 385 nm.In addition, the apparent quantum yield at 420 nm and 520 nm is also determined as 0.42 and 0.25 , respectively.To evaluate the stability of this photocatalyst, three cycles of recycling test under the same condition were performed.BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 shows neglectable decrease in the yield of CO (Fig. S8).Moreover, long-term activity test was further conducted (Fig. S9), and the yield of CO increases steadily upon irradiation for 24 h.These indicates superior durability and stability of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.Variable control experiments were carried out including no irradiation, CO 2 or photocatalyst, and none of any products can be detected.This firmly indicates that the photoconversion of CO 2 was proceeded by irradiation upon the catalyst.Subsequently, isotropic experiment using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 is conducted to determine the carbon source of the products (Fig. 4c).The produced 13 CO and the introduced 13 CO 2 can be well-separated by the chromatograph and observed at 1.2 min and 1.6 min, respectively.Then, 13 CO is ionized by the mass spectrograph, and the signals locate at m/ z 13, 16 and 29 are recorded (inset of Fig. 4c) which specifically demonstrates that CO 2 provides the carbon source to generate CO. The oxidation half-reaction was also carefully tracked because the overall CO 2 and H 2 O conversion is much close to the photosynthesis of green plant, which is the final goal of utilization of the solar energy.To investigate the oxidation products, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was conducted with H 2 18 O over BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.As shown in Fig. 4d, the generation of 18 O 2 indicates that water oxidation produces O 2 as the product.Meanwhile, 16 O 2 (m/z 32) and 18 O 16 O (m/z 34) are also detected from this isotropic experiment. 16O 2 comes from the dehydration reaction of COOH intermediate generated upon with the photoconversion of CO 2 and the following oxidation.In combination with the few absolute oxygen which disperses in the reaction tank and injection needle, this signal shows high intensity.In addition, the presence of 16 O 18 O is originated from the photocatalytic produced 18 O 2 and 16 O 2 46,47.Since the amount of H 2 18 O is much larger than the evolved H 2 16 O from CO 2 , the peak intensity of 16 O 18 O is lower than that of the 18 O 2 . Based on the results of isotropic experiments using both 13 CO 2 and H 2 18 O, the overall CO 2 and H 2 O conversion to CO and O 2 can be confirmed, orienting to the target of artificial photosynthesis that we expected. To explore the difference of photocatalytic performance between the samples, the deliver behavior of photoinduced charge carriers of BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 was researched by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy at first.BiVO 4 presents an emission band centered at approximately 485 nm which is assigned to its band-to-band emission 48 that shown in Fig. 5a.The peak position is approximately equivalent to the bandgap of BiVO 4 , i.e., 2.55 eV.For hm-C 4 N 3 , strong PL emission peak is observed around 490 nm.The high conductivity and facile migration of electrons may result in the increased recombination rate of photoinduced electron-hole pairs.After combination of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 , the PL intensity of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 decreased significantly, indicating the suppressed rate of recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Immediately, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy of ns-level which can indicate the charge transfer dynamics shows in Fig. 5b.The radiative lifetimes () can be calculated through a biexponential function fitting decay curves (Table S4).The short ( 1 7.26 ns, 51.1 ), long ( 2 78.68ns, 48.9 ) and average ( 42.21ns) fluorescence lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is strikingly more prolonged than that of the pristine BiVO 4 ( 1 5.34 ns, 57.7 ; 2 49.38 ns, 42.3 ; 23.97ns) and hm-C 4 N 3 ( 1 5.52 ns, 56.0 ; 2 49.47 ns, 44.0 ; 24.87ns).Meanwhile, the charge transfer rate can be calculated by k 1/ av 49, and this value for for BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is 0.042 ns -1 , 0.040 ns -1 and 0.024 ns -1 , respectively.The promoted separation of charge carriers, the extended lifetime of holes and electrons and the improved charge transfer imply an increased possibility for their participation in chemical reaction and thence enhanced photocatalytic activity. Photoelectrochemical characterizations were measured to investigate the charge transfer capability of the catalysts.Fig. 5c shows the photocurrent response curves of BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N composites fabricated on the electrodes through turning the irradiation light on and off for several rounds to collect the I-t curve.Both BiVO and hm-C 4 N 3 present small current intensity upon irradiation owing to the serious recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.After hybridization, all BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites display significantly improved photocurrent, implying effectively enhanced charge separation.In particular, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 presents the highest photocurrent intensity, which is benefit to its photocatalytic performance.With less hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25, many BiVO 4 was not enwrapped and combined with hm-C 4 N 3 .When excess organic half-metal material was incorporated, the thick hm-C 4 N 3 may shield the light harvesting for BiVO 4 .Moreover, the transfer distance of the charge carriers in the bulk materials is increased, resulting poor interfacial charge separation.The uneven distribution of hm-C 4 N 3 will also interrupt the uniform contact between BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 . To further elucidate the interfacial charge transport status, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was measured, and a simulated equivalent electrical circuit was provided.As shown in Fig. 5d, the lower electrolyte solution resistance displayed smaller diameter of the EIS curves which represented promoted interfacial charge-carrier transfer ability.The combination of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is demonstrated to be helpful for charge deliver while the hybrids exhibit smaller arc radius than that of their components.The interfacial charge-transfer resistance for the composites is in the order of BiVO The band alignment of hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 was further explored for the elucidation of the migration of photogenerated electrons and holes.According to the Mott-Schottky measurements (Fig. S10), the Fermi level of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is determined as 0.45 eV and -0.43 eV (vs.NHE), respectively.Accordingly, an internal electric field will be built between hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 after the composition.The transfer direction of built-in electric field from hm-C 4 N 3 to BiVO 4 is beneficial for the charge separation and the construction of a Z-Scheme system, which is in accordance with the XPS analyses.On account of the XPS valence band spectra (Fig. S11), the energy levels of VB of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 are estimated to be approximately 2.21 eV and 1.22 eV below the Fermi level.Therefore, the valence band (VB) position of BiVO 4 can be calculated at 2.66 V which is close to the previous report 31.Meanwhile, the valence band of hm-C 4 N 3 is determined as 0.79 V.In addition, their VB levels were further investigated by the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. S12) 50, which showed a high accordance with the above results.Based on the band-gap obtained from UV-DRS measurements, the CB positions of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 are calculated to be 0.11 V and -0.63 V, respectively.The E CB of hm-C 4 N 3 is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 to CO (E -0.53V vs NHE, pH 7) 51.Therefore, based on the view of thermodynamics, hm-C 4 N 3 can be utilized for photoconversion of CO 2 . The photocatalytic degradation towards MB and the exploration of the major reactive species which played important roles were performed for the research of the charge transfer for the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid. O 2 -) 52.As displayed in Fig. 6b, the decomposition efficiency towards MB is obviously suppressed by the addition of these two radical scavengers.In other words, the traditional type-II heterojunction mechanism, the photoinduced electrons of hm-C 4 N 3 transfer to the CB of BiVO OH/H 2 O, 2.34 eV vs. NHE) 54.Thence, it's not feasible for the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composite to adopt the conventional type-II heterojunction model. To further confirm the type of heterojunction for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 , the electron spin resonance (EPR) experiment was conducted with the trapping reagent of DMPO.The radical of OH was generated by obtaining electron from OH -in water and The band alignment diagram of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composite and the specific mechanism of Z-Scheme heterojunction is illustrated in Fig. 6e.Upon irradiation, the electrons on the VB are excited to CB of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 , and the holes are left on the VB of them.As direct solid-state Z-Scheme heterojunction, the electrons on conduction band of BiVO 4 will transfer to the valence band of hm-C 4 N 3 and combined with the holes.Subsequently, the holes will gather on the valance band of BiVO 4 , and the electrons accumulates on the conduction band of hm-C 4 N 3 .Accordingly, the reducibility and oxidizability of the photocatalyst are both promoted. Further insight into the improved photocatalytic performance of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 was revealed by investigation of the reaction Gibbs free energies.Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed on hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 finite clusters with geometry optimization.Hm-C 4 N 3 presents a two-dimensional layered structure, which deposited on the surface of tetragonal crystal phase BiVO 4 .CO absorbing and activating are the initial steps for photoconversion, while the adequate fastening of CO 2 molecule on the catalysts is the prerequisite for high reduction efficiency 8.As can be seen in Fig. 7a, the formation of CO 2 is spontaneous on hm-C 4 N 3 .In particular, the bare hm-C 4 N 3 shows a strong capture capacity towards CO 2 molecules, which is in sharp contrast with the g-C 3 N 4 requiring an energy input 57.This indicates the great promise for hm-C 4 N 3 on CO 2 conversion, and it can be respected as the reactive sites for the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 Z-Scheme photocatalyst (Fig. 7b).After combination with BiVO 4 , this activation capacity is weakened due to charge equilibrium between the two components.As discussed in the XPS results, the decreased electron density on hm-C 4 N 3 is adverse to its adsorption of CO 2 .This conclusion is further demonstrated by the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of the samples (Fig. 7c).Hm-C 4 N 3 shows an extremely powerful CO 2 adsorption ability of 18.65 cm 3 /g when the P/P 0 is 0.03.Whereas, the CO 2 uptakes for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid decreases to 10.92 cm 3 /g resulting from the low content of hm-C 4 N 3 in the hybrid.The CO 2 can be facilely hydrogenated to COOH on the pristine hm-C 4 N 3 via a barrier of 0.27 eV (Fig. S14a).Whereas, this step on BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is an endothermic process (0.79 eV) with an energy barrier of 0.95 eV need to be overcome (Fig. S14a).As observed from the in-situ DRIFTS spectra (Fig. 7d), the signal for COOH at 1558 cm -1 is much prominent on hm-C 4 N 3 both in the dark and under irradiation.This further confirms the superior activation capability of hm-C 4 N 3 towards CO 2 .However, the overall conversion of CO 2 to CO requires the participation of multiple electrons and protons 58.Subsequently, the COOH turns into CO, which absorbed on the photocatalyst.As it can be seen, the formation of CO is much difficult for hm-C 4 N 3 , which is a significantly endothermic process (1.65 eV) and displays a large energy barrier of 1.87 eV (Fig. S14b).The dehydration of COOH is commonly accompanied by one proton and one electron transfer, the severe recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs depressed this process for hm-C 4 N 3 .Moreover, the poor oxidation ability of hm-C 4 N 3 cannot provide adequate protons from water splitting.By contrast, this process readily evolves on BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 via a moderate barrier of 0.67 eV (Fig. S14b), and the Gibbs free energy is decreased by 0.3 eV.Construction of Z-Scheme heterojunction prolongs the lifetime of electrons on hm-C 4 N 3 .What's more, abundant protons can be generated based on the superior water oxidation capability of BiVO 4 , facilitating the reduction of COOH.From the comparison of in-situ DRIFTS spectra before and after the irradiation, the peak for -OH (1650 cm -1 ) originating from water splitting remarkably strengths for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 , demonstrating the fundamental role of BiVO 4 .Moreover, the significantly decreased intensity for COOH signal compared with that of the -OH signifies the conversion of COOH to CO.Finally, CO is liberated from the surface of the catalyst.The weak adsorption capability of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 is benefit for this process.It is worth noting that the variation of relative peak intensity between -OH and COOH is negligible for the pristine hm-C 4 N 3 upon irradiation.This further confirms that the evolution of CO from COOH is the rate-determining step of the reaction, and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 presents the capability to overcome the reaction barrier."}, {"llm generation": "hm-C4N3 and BiVO4", "source": "In summary, a direct Z-Scheme photocatalyst with erythroid-like hierarchical architecture composed by

photocatalytic activity, its CO generation rate reaches 40.8 mol g -1 h -1 with excellent selectivity beyond 97 , exceeding most of the reported Z-Scheme system used for photoreduction of CO 2 .On the one hand, this well-defined Z-Scheme heterojunction can promote the separation of photogenerated electronhole pairs, on the other hand, it enhances the oxidation and reduction capabilities of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 .DFT calculation and in-situ DRIFTS spectra indicate that the process of COOH dehydration is the ratedetermining step.The supplement of proton by H 2 O oxidation from BiVO 4 and the prolonged lifetime of electrons on hm-C 4 N 3 contribute to the remarkable decreased reaction barrier simultaneously.This work proposes a fantastic approach to develop organic half-metal based photocatalyst, and shed new light on the way to the target of artificial photosynthesis. Preparation of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid was fabricated through in-situ polymerization of BMIm C(CN) 3 on BiVO 4 (Fig. 1(a)).Typically, 0.05 g BMIm C(CN) 3 ionic liquid was firstly dissolved in 10 mL ethyl acetate.Then, 1 g BiVO 4 was dispersed in the above mixture and ultrasonicated for 30 min.After that, ethyl acetate was removed by rotary evaporation.The mixture was heated to 400 C with a heating rate of 5 C/min and kept for an hour.The collected sample was alternately washed using ethyl acetate and deionized water.In this way, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites with different ratios of hm-C 4 N 3 (0.1, 0.067, 0.05 and 0.04 g) were gained and expressed as BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 (10:1), BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15 (15:1), BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 (20:1) and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25 (25:1).

Whereas, BiVO 4 and the composite sample present 2.3 and 3.4 of weight loss upon heating to 800 C. Thence, the weight ratio of hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 can be calculated as 1.9 wt.After more incorporation of hm-C 4 N 3 , the BiVO 4 nanoparticles seem to be adhered evidently by polymeric continuous phase for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15 (Fig. S2b).In particular, the voids in the center of erythroid-like BiVO 4 are stuffed by organic hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 (Fig. S2c), forming evidently continuous exteriors. The TEM image of pristine BiVO 4 is displayed in Fig. S5.As it shows, the hollow structure can be obviously identified by the contrast of the light center and the dark profile.BiVO 4 is constructed by numerous welldefined nanoparticles.The diameter ( 2 m) of this 3D hollow hierarchical architecture is in accordance with the investigation in SEM images.After incorporation of hm-C 4 N 3 , the edge of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 was investigated in detail.As observed in Fig. 1f, the incorporation of hm-C 4 N 3 doesn't have any impact on the structure of BiVO 4 scaffold.A thin amorphous layer is presented on the surface of highly crystallized region (Fig. 1g).The lattice spacing of 0.369 nm is assigned to the (2 0 0) crystal planes of BiVO 4 37 which can be observed from the HRTEM image (Fig. 1h).In addition, the amorphous wrappage can be unambiguously differentiated between the red and blue dash lines.The thin and even coating of hm-C 4 N 3 is benefit to the transmission of incident photons, thus facilitating the synchronism exciting of hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 .Besides, the combinatorial image of HAADF-STEM of the composite and the correlative elemental mapping images of Bi, V, O, N and C elements specifically indicate the homogeneous combination of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 (Fig. 1i-n).At the edge of the sample, the uniform hybridization can also be confirmed (Fig. S6).The formation of numerous heterojunction interfaces can thus be suggested. The composition of BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 hybrid was further revealed by XPS spectra (Fig. 2a).It is observed that BiVO 4 is comprised of Bi, V and O elements.C and N elements can be detected in hm-C 4 N 3 .For BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20, Bi, V, O, C and N elements all emerge, demonstrating the hybridization of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 .Fig. 2b exhibits the C1s high-resolution spectrum of hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.The C1s spectrum of hm-C 4 N 3 can be divided into three peaks at 284.6 eV, 286.1 eV and 287.9 eV which can be assigned to adventitious carbon, center carbon and sp 2 -bonded carbon in triazine rings (N-C--N), respectively 9.After incorporation in BiVO 4 , the binding energies of center carbon and sp 2 2e and f present the high-resolution spectra of Bi4f and V2p for the samples, respectively.For the pure BiVO 4 , the binding energies at 158.7 eV and 164.0 eV can be considered as the Bi4f 7/2 and Bi4f 5/2 , respectively.The difference between these two values is 5.3 eV which is consistent with Bi 3 38,39.The V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 are located at 516.6 eV and 524.1 eV, respectively 40,41.After deposition of hm-C 4 N 3 , the binding energies of Bi4f and V2p both shift to lower values in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.In consideration of the difference of the binding energies for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 compared with that of pure BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 , the electron transfer from hm-C 4 N 3 to BiVO 4 in the composite is supposed to be existing 42.The facile charge transference and strong interfacial interaction are advantageous to separating of photoinduced charge carriers.In particular, the built-in electric field will avail the charge transfer from BiVO 4 to hm-C 4 N 3 after photoexcitation. Fig. 3a displays the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the photocatalysts.BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 exhibit characteristic type IV with H 3 -type hysteresis loops when the pressure ratio (P/P 0 ) is between 0.6 and 1.0, suggesting the existence of mesoporous structure as a result of the convergence of nanoparticles 43,44.The BET specific surface area of BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is 11.61 m 2 /g and 12.26 m 2 /g, respectively.By contrast, bulk hm-C 4 N 3 has no holes while displays no hysteresis loop and its specific surface area is 0.08 m 2 /g (Table S2).As obtained from the distribution curves of pore and size (Fig. 3b), BiVO owns three aperture distribution ranges.The pore size of less than 5 nm is attributed to the closely stacked nanoparticles, the agglomeration of assembles results in the diameter ranging from 5 nm to 9 nm and the pores larger than 15 nm are resulted from the exterior irregular aggregates.It is noticeable that the ratio of the smallest pores decreases for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20, and these pores are stuffed by the polymerized hm-C 4 N 3 .Meanwhile, the aperture range around 5-9 nm and beyond 20 nm becomes narrow (5-7.6 nm and 15-30 nm), manifesting the orientation of shrinkage to small sizes.The fraction of decreased pore sizes evidently elevates.This signifies that the surfaces of BiVO 4 have been wrapped by hm-C 4 N 3 with uniform distributions.Owing to the low ratio and thin thickness of hm-C 4 N 3 , BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 presents slight BET specific surface area and pore structure deviations from the pristine BiVO 4 .These observations are corresponding to the above-discussed SEM and TEM results, and the much abundant and well-defined heterojunction interfaces are thus be constructed. The photo-absorption capacity of the prepared BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrids was researched through UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS).As exhibited in Fig. 3c, the bare BiVO exhibits strong absorbance from 200 nm to 420 nm due to its broad bandgap.The obvious absorption band edge of BiVO 4 is located at 450 nm, which is in consistence with its yellow appearance (inset of Fig. 3c) and the previous report 45.Hm-C 4 N 3 shows much broad absorptions extending to 1200 nm owing to its dark appearance.For the composites, their absorption ability significantly increases both in ultraviolet light and visible light regions, though the weight ratio of hm-C 4 N 3 is low.It is noteworthy that the color of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N composites changes remarkably, which confirms the co-existence of the two materials and the superior light harvesting capacity of hm-C 4 N 3 .Generally, a higher hm-C 4 N 3 content brings about a stronger absorption band, and the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 exhibits the highest photo-absorption property due to the maximum loading amount of hm-C 4 N 3 .Besides, the bandgap energy of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 can be calculated according to the UV-vis DRS spectrum and the formula as follows: The calculated band gap of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is 2.55 eV and 1.42 eV that shown in Fig. 3d.The narrow bandgap of hm-C 4 N 3 is in accordance with its half-metallicity feature. In order to simulate the photosynthesis of green plant, the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion over the as-fabricated samples was performed under Xenon lamp irradiation with the presence of water.The pristine BiVO 4 shows negligible photocatalytic activity towards CO 2 conversion due to the weak reduction capacity, which is in accordance with its inherent band alignment.For hm-C 4 N 3 and the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites, the yield of CO and CH 4 both increases linearly upon extending of the illuminate time (Figs.4a andS7).CO is detected as the major product accompanied by generation of few amounts of CH 4 .The yield of CO for the bare hm-C 4 N 3 is only 34.9 mol g -1 under light irradiation for 6 h.After combination with BiVO 4 , the yield of CO for the compound obviously increases.Accordingly, the transfer of photoinduced electrons from hm-C 4 N 3 to BiVO 4 can be excluded, and the Z-Scheme heterojunction may be formed between BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 can be proposed.Comparison of the hybrids with different ratios of the two components, the CO production on BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 reaches the highest yield of 244.8 mol g -1 , surpassing most of the reported Z-Scheme system used for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion (Table.S3).Due to the inadequate wrappage or redundant deposition of hm-C 4 N 3 , the result of hybridization cannot be fully elaborated.The CO yield for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 is 230.4,185 and 83.8 mol g -1 , respectively.The overall CO and CH 4 evolution rates for hm-C 4 N 3 and the four hybrids are compared in Fig. 4b.The average CO generation rate of pristine hm-C 4 N 3 is 5.8 mol g -1 h -1 .By contrast, the optimized BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 shows 40.8 mol g -1 h -1 productivity of CO that is 7.1 folds higher than the bare hm-C 4 N 3 .In particular, the selectivity of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 over CO generation is significantly beyond 97 and the apparent quantum yield reaches 0.52 at 385 nm.In addition, the apparent quantum yield at 420 nm and 520 nm is also determined as 0.42 and 0.25 , respectively.To evaluate the stability of this photocatalyst, three cycles of recycling test under the same condition were performed.BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 shows neglectable decrease in the yield of CO (Fig. S8).Moreover, long-term activity test was further conducted (Fig. S9), and the yield of CO increases steadily upon irradiation for 24 h.These indicates superior durability and stability of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.Variable control experiments were carried out including no irradiation, CO 2 or photocatalyst, and none of any products can be detected.This firmly indicates that the photoconversion of CO 2 was proceeded by irradiation upon the catalyst.Subsequently, isotropic experiment using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 is conducted to determine the carbon source of the products (Fig. 4c).The produced 13 CO and the introduced 13 CO 2 can be well-separated by the chromatograph and observed at 1.2 min and 1.6 min, respectively.Then, 13 CO is ionized by the mass spectrograph, and the signals locate at m/ z 13, 16 and 29 are recorded (inset of Fig. 4c) which specifically demonstrates that CO 2 provides the carbon source to generate CO. The oxidation half-reaction was also carefully tracked because the overall CO 2 and H 2 O conversion is much close to the photosynthesis of green plant, which is the final goal of utilization of the solar energy.To investigate the oxidation products, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was conducted with H 2 18 O over BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.As shown in Fig. 4d, the generation of 18 O 2 indicates that water oxidation produces O 2 as the product.Meanwhile, 16 O 2 (m/z 32) and 18 O 16 O (m/z 34) are also detected from this isotropic experiment. 16O 2 comes from the dehydration reaction of COOH intermediate generated upon with the photoconversion of CO 2 and the following oxidation.In combination with the few absolute oxygen which disperses in the reaction tank and injection needle, this signal shows high intensity.In addition, the presence of 16 O 18 O is originated from the photocatalytic produced 18 O 2 and 16 O 2 46,47.Since the amount of H 2 18 O is much larger than the evolved H 2 16 O from CO 2 , the peak intensity of 16 O 18 O is lower than that of the 18 O 2 . Based on the results of isotropic experiments using both 13 CO 2 and H 2 18 O, the overall CO 2 and H 2 O conversion to CO and O 2 can be confirmed, orienting to the target of artificial photosynthesis that we expected. To explore the difference of photocatalytic performance between the samples, the deliver behavior of photoinduced charge carriers of BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 was researched by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy at first.BiVO 4 presents an emission band centered at approximately 485 nm which is assigned to its band-to-band emission 48 that shown in Fig. 5a.The peak position is approximately equivalent to the bandgap of BiVO 4 , i.e., 2.55 eV.For hm-C 4 N 3 , strong PL emission peak is observed around 490 nm.The high conductivity and facile migration of electrons may result in the increased recombination rate of photoinduced electron-hole pairs.After combination of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 , the PL intensity of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 decreased significantly, indicating the suppressed rate of recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Immediately, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy of ns-level which can indicate the charge transfer dynamics shows in Fig. 5b.The radiative lifetimes () can be calculated through a biexponential function fitting decay curves (Table S4).The short ( 1 7.26 ns, 51.1 ), long ( 2 78.68ns, 48.9 ) and average ( 42.21ns) fluorescence lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is strikingly more prolonged than that of the pristine BiVO 4 ( 1 5.34 ns, 57.7 ; 2 49.38 ns, 42.3 ; 23.97ns) and hm-C 4 N 3 ( 1 5.52 ns, 56.0 ; 2 49.47 ns, 44.0 ; 24.87ns).Meanwhile, the charge transfer rate can be calculated by k 1/ av 49, and this value for for BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is 0.042 ns -1 , 0.040 ns -1 and 0.024 ns -1 , respectively.The promoted separation of charge carriers, the extended lifetime of holes and electrons and the improved charge transfer imply an increased possibility for their participation in chemical reaction and thence enhanced photocatalytic activity. Photoelectrochemical characterizations were measured to investigate the charge transfer capability of the catalysts.Fig. 5c shows the photocurrent response curves of BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N composites fabricated on the electrodes through turning the irradiation light on and off for several rounds to collect the I-t curve.Both BiVO and hm-C 4 N 3 present small current intensity upon irradiation owing to the serious recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.After hybridization, all BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites display significantly improved photocurrent, implying effectively enhanced charge separation.In particular, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 presents the highest photocurrent intensity, which is benefit to its photocatalytic performance.With less hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25, many BiVO 4 was not enwrapped and combined with hm-C 4 N 3 .When excess organic half-metal material was incorporated, the thick hm-C 4 N 3 may shield the light harvesting for BiVO 4 .Moreover, the transfer distance of the charge carriers in the bulk materials is increased, resulting poor interfacial charge separation.The uneven distribution of hm-C 4 N 3 will also interrupt the uniform contact between BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 . To further elucidate the interfacial charge transport status, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was measured, and a simulated equivalent electrical circuit was provided.As shown in Fig. 5d, the lower electrolyte solution resistance displayed smaller diameter of the EIS curves which represented promoted interfacial charge-carrier transfer ability.The combination of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is demonstrated to be helpful for charge deliver while the hybrids exhibit smaller arc radius than that of their components.The interfacial charge-transfer resistance for the composites is in the order of BiVO The band alignment of hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 was further explored for the elucidation of the migration of photogenerated electrons and holes.According to the Mott-Schottky measurements (Fig. S10), the Fermi level of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is determined as 0.45 eV and -0.43 eV (vs.NHE), respectively.Accordingly, an internal electric field will be built between hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 after the composition.The transfer direction of built-in electric field from hm-C 4 N 3 to BiVO 4 is beneficial for the charge separation and the construction of a Z-Scheme system, which is in accordance with the XPS analyses.On account of the XPS valence band spectra (Fig. S11), the energy levels of VB of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 are estimated to be approximately 2.21 eV and 1.22 eV below the Fermi level.Therefore, the valence band (VB) position of BiVO 4 can be calculated at 2.66 V which is close to the previous report 31.Meanwhile, the valence band of hm-C 4 N 3 is determined as 0.79 V.In addition, their VB levels were further investigated by the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. S12) 50, which showed a high accordance with the above results.Based on the band-gap obtained from UV-DRS measurements, the CB positions of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 are calculated to be 0.11 V and -0.63 V, respectively.The E CB of hm-C 4 N 3 is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 to CO (E -0.53V vs NHE, pH 7) 51.Therefore, based on the view of thermodynamics, hm-C 4 N 3 can be utilized for photoconversion of CO 2 . The photocatalytic degradation towards MB and the exploration of the major reactive species which played important roles were performed for the research of the charge transfer for the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid. O 2 -) 52.As displayed in Fig. 6b, the decomposition efficiency towards MB is obviously suppressed by the addition of these two radical scavengers.In other words, the traditional type-II heterojunction mechanism, the photoinduced electrons of hm-C 4 N 3 transfer to the CB of BiVO OH/H 2 O, 2.34 eV vs. NHE) 54.Thence, it's not feasible for the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composite to adopt the conventional type-II heterojunction model. To further confirm the type of heterojunction for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 , the electron spin resonance (EPR) experiment was conducted with the trapping reagent of DMPO.The radical of OH was generated by obtaining electron from OH -in water and The band alignment diagram of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composite and the specific mechanism of Z-Scheme heterojunction is illustrated in Fig. 6e.Upon irradiation, the electrons on the VB are excited to CB of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 , and the holes are left on the VB of them.As direct solid-state Z-Scheme heterojunction, the electrons on conduction band of BiVO 4 will transfer to the valence band of hm-C 4 N 3 and combined with the holes.Subsequently, the holes will gather on the valance band of BiVO 4 , and the electrons accumulates on the conduction band of hm-C 4 N 3 .Accordingly, the reducibility and oxidizability of the photocatalyst are both promoted. Further insight into the improved photocatalytic performance of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 was revealed by investigation of the reaction Gibbs free energies.Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed on hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 finite clusters with geometry optimization.Hm-C 4 N 3 presents a two-dimensional layered structure, which deposited on the surface of tetragonal crystal phase BiVO 4 .CO absorbing and activating are the initial steps for photoconversion, while the adequate fastening of CO 2 molecule on the catalysts is the prerequisite for high reduction efficiency 8.As can be seen in Fig. 7a, the formation of CO 2 is spontaneous on hm-C 4 N 3 .In particular, the bare hm-C 4 N 3 shows a strong capture capacity towards CO 2 molecules, which is in sharp contrast with the g-C 3 N 4 requiring an energy input 57.This indicates the great promise for hm-C 4 N 3 on CO 2 conversion, and it can be respected as the reactive sites for the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 Z-Scheme photocatalyst (Fig. 7b).After combination with BiVO 4 , this activation capacity is weakened due to charge equilibrium between the two components.As discussed in the XPS results, the decreased electron density on hm-C 4 N 3 is adverse to its adsorption of CO 2 .This conclusion is further demonstrated by the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of the samples (Fig. 7c).Hm-C 4 N 3 shows an extremely powerful CO 2 adsorption ability of 18.65 cm 3 /g when the P/P 0 is 0.03.Whereas, the CO 2 uptakes for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid decreases to 10.92 cm 3 /g resulting from the low content of hm-C 4 N 3 in the hybrid.The CO 2 can be facilely hydrogenated to COOH on the pristine hm-C 4 N 3 via a barrier of 0.27 eV (Fig. S14a).Whereas, this step on BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is an endothermic process (0.79 eV) with an energy barrier of 0.95 eV need to be overcome (Fig. S14a).As observed from the in-situ DRIFTS spectra (Fig. 7d), the signal for COOH at 1558 cm -1 is much prominent on hm-C 4 N 3 both in the dark and under irradiation.This further confirms the superior activation capability of hm-C 4 N 3 towards CO 2 .However, the overall conversion of CO 2 to CO requires the participation of multiple electrons and protons 58.Subsequently, the COOH turns into CO, which absorbed on the photocatalyst.As it can be seen, the formation of CO is much difficult for hm-C 4 N 3 , which is a significantly endothermic process (1.65 eV) and displays a large energy barrier of 1.87 eV (Fig. S14b).The dehydration of COOH is commonly accompanied by one proton and one electron transfer, the severe recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs depressed this process for hm-C 4 N 3 .Moreover, the poor oxidation ability of hm-C 4 N 3 cannot provide adequate protons from water splitting.By contrast, this process readily evolves on BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 via a moderate barrier of 0.67 eV (Fig. S14b), and the Gibbs free energy is decreased by 0.3 eV.Construction of Z-Scheme heterojunction prolongs the lifetime of electrons on hm-C 4 N 3 .What's more, abundant protons can be generated based on the superior water oxidation capability of BiVO 4 , facilitating the reduction of COOH.From the comparison of in-situ DRIFTS spectra before and after the irradiation, the peak for -OH (1650 cm -1 ) originating from water splitting remarkably strengths for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 , demonstrating the fundamental role of BiVO 4 .Moreover, the significantly decreased intensity for COOH signal compared with that of the -OH signifies the conversion of COOH to CO.Finally, CO is liberated from the surface of the catalyst.The weak adsorption capability of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 is benefit for this process.It is worth noting that the variation of relative peak intensity between -OH and COOH is negligible for the pristine hm-C 4 N 3 upon irradiation.This further confirms that the evolution of CO from COOH is the rate-determining step of the reaction, and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 presents the capability to overcome the reaction barrier."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "Fig. 6.(a) Degradation curves of methylene blue for different catalysts under visible light;

Preparation of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid was fabricated through in-situ polymerization of BMIm C(CN) 3 on BiVO 4 (Fig. 1(a)).Typically, 0.05 g BMIm C(CN) 3 ionic liquid was firstly dissolved in 10 mL ethyl acetate.Then, 1 g BiVO 4 was dispersed in the above mixture and ultrasonicated for 30 min.After that, ethyl acetate was removed by rotary evaporation.The mixture was heated to 400 C with a heating rate of 5 C/min and kept for an hour.The collected sample was alternately washed using ethyl acetate and deionized water.In this way, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites with different ratios of hm-C 4 N 3 (0.1, 0.067, 0.05 and 0.04 g) were gained and expressed as BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 (10:1), BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15 (15:1), BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 (20:1) and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25 (25:1).

(Shanghai, China).Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 98 , Aladdin) and nitric acid (HNO 3 , 98 , Aladdin) required no further purification for analytical grade. 3D hierarchical erythroid-like BiVO 4 was prepared by elaborate combination of the coprecipitation, template inducement and hydrothermal techniques.Typically, 5.0 mmol (0.58 g) NH 4 VO 3 and 5.0 mmol (2.45 g) Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O were dissolved in 10 mL (2 M) NaOH and 10 mL (4 M) HNO 3 , respectively.The two systems were stirred continuously to form a homogeneous solution.Subsequently, 0.72 mmol (0.25 g) PVP was put into the above two solutions under vigorous stirring.After half an hour, the solution of NH 4 VO 3 was added dropwise to the system of Bi (NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O. Afterward, the mixture was adjusted to neutral (pH 7) with NaOH solution.Then, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 mL) and maintained at 200 C for 3 h with 2 C/min heating speed.Finally, the system was cooled, and the as-obtained product was washed with ethanol and deionized water alternately and freeze dried to collect BiVO 4 powder. Ionic liquid monomer of BMImC(CN) 3 was synthesized referencing to the reported procedure 23.KC(CN) 3 and BMImBr were mixed in deionized water, and the generated BMImC(CN) 3 was extracted by ethyl acetate.The monomer was obtained as a light-yellow oil after rotary evaporation.Hm-C 4 N 3 was obtained through heating of BMImC(CN) 3 at 400 C for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were gained on Brucker ADVANCE D8 diffractometer which was conducted at voltage of 40 kV and current of 40 mA with Cu K radiation source.Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained on Thermo Fisher Scientific NICOLETIS10 with scanning range of 4000-400 cm -1 .Appearances of the photocatalysts were photographed on field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-IT500HR) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).TEM images were obtained on FEI Technai F20 microscope.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI QUANTERA II) was utilized to analyze the elements and the C1s which located at 284.6 eV was regarded as the calibration reference.Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was tested on METTLER TOLEDO TGA/SDTA851E to illustrate the composition of samples.The light harvesting capacity was evaluated on Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer through Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).Time-resolved fluorescence decay (TRF) curves and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were measured under 405 nm excitation while recorded on the spectrometer of Horiba Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog-3.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of the samples was measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm using ASAP 2020 PLUS HD88 at 77 K while the CO 2 adsorption ability was evaluated by ASAP 2460.The electron spin resonance (ESR) was measured on Bruker EMX-Plus ESR spectrometer.In-situ DRIFTS characterization for mechanism elucidation was performed on FT-IR-6300 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). For investigation of the CO 2 photoconversion, the reaction area is 4.2 cm 2 with 100 mg of photocatalyst evenly decentralized on the quartz paper while the total volume of reactor was approximately 420 mL.The air of reactor was extracted three times before irradiation to reach vacuum state, then the high purity CO 2 and 0.4 mL of deionized water were introduced for reaching ambient pressure.The system was kept for several hours to reach the adsorption-desorption equilibrium at dark condition.The light source was supported by a 300 W Xenon lamp for photocatalytic reaction.1 mL of gas was continuously brought out from the container every 1 h interval using a gas chromatography with FID and TCD detectors (GC-2014C, Shimadzu Corp., Japan) for subsequent analysis.The process lasted for 6 h with irradiation.The isotope-labelled analyses were measured applying 13 CO 2 and H 2 18 O to replace the original CO 2 and H 2 O.The gas mixtures were analyzed on a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (QP2010SE, Shimadzu Corp., Japan).Three cycling experiments were measured to estimate the stability of the photocatalyst. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was determined under the same photoconversion condition while the light source was LED with the wavelength of 385 nm, 420 nm and 520 nm (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co. Ltd., China).The AQY was calculated according to the formula as follows: The detailed explanation is shown in supplementary document.The intensity of incident irradiation was determined through a photometer (Newport, 840C).The quantity of incident photons was calculated and shown in Table S1. For photodegradation experiment towards methylene blue, the reaction was irradiated with Xenon lamp.50 mg catalyst was dispersed into 25 mg/L MB solution (100 mL).Then, the system was dark-stirred to achieve an adsorption-desorption equilibrium for 30 min.During the process of irradiation, 5 mL of the solution was drawn out and the photocatalyst was filtered out before testing every 20 min.The concentration of MB was measured by monitoring the Ultraviolet-visible absorption ability using a UV-5100B spectrometer and detected at wavelength of 665 nm. The test of scavengers was carried out to investigate the prominent reactive species generated by the photocatalysts upon irradiation.During the photodegradation of MB, the radicals of O 2 -was scavenged by isopropanol (IPA) and 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), respectively.In addition, these radicals were trapped by DMPO agent while the signals were detected by the ESR technique.Before determination, 10 mg sample was added to 0.5 mL deionized water for detection of OH radical and using 0.5 mL methanol as the solvent for investigation of O 2 radical, respectively.Subsequently, accompanied by ultrasonic dispersion, 50 L of DMPO was added to the above solutions, respectively.The results were collected after 5 min of illumination. CHI760E electrochemical workstation with a standard threeelectrode system was applied for photoelectrochemical tests.The FTO conductive glass was coated by 10 mg catalyst, 0.5 mL deionized water and ethanol, 10 L Nafion solution (5 wt) and used as the working electrode.Pt sheet and Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.The electrolyte was prepared by 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution.Transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained under open circuit potential with the frequency ranged from 0.01 Hz to 10 KHz. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with CASTEP package based on the plane-wave-pseudo-potential algorithm 31.The correlation and exchange interactions were simulated with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional 32.The Tkatchenko -Scheffler method was used to correct the Van der Waals interactions DFT-D 33.While the ultrasoft pseudopotential was used to describe the interactions between the atomic core and the valence electrons with a cutoff energy of 450 eV 34.After the geometry optimization, all atoms were permitted to relax without any restrict until the convergence thresholds of maximum displacement, maximum force and energy were smaller than 0.001 A, 0.03 eV/A and 1.0 10 -5 eV/atom, respectively."}, {"llm generation": "Xenon lamp", "source": "In order to simulate the photosynthesis of green plant, the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion over the as-fabricated samples was performed under Xenon lamp irradiation with the presence of water.", "context": "The fabrication process of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid was illustrated schematically in Fig. 1a.Firstly, BiVO 4 nanoparticles were formed through the double decomposition reaction between Bi(NO 3 ) 3 and NH 4 VO 3 .Meanwhile, the generated nanoparticles self-assembled into erythroid-like architecture under the inducement of PVP.Then, BMIm C(CN) 3 was adsorbed by this hierarchical scaffold and proceeded into hm-C 4 N 3 on the surfaces of BiVO 4 via in-situ polymerization.BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites with different weight ratios of organic half-metal constituent were prepared under holding this unique erythroid-like architecture.The integration of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is detected through Xray diffraction (XRD) displayed in Fig. 1b.BiVO 4 displays the characteristic feature of zirconium silicate type tetragonal phase crystal structure.The diffraction peaks at 24.4 ,30.7 , 32.7 , 34.7 , 39.5 , 48.4 and 49.9 are assigned to the (2 0 0), (2 1 1), (1 1 2), (2 2 0), (3 0 1), (3 1 2) and (4 0 0) crystal planes which corresponds to the standard PDF card (JCPDS 14-0133) 35.The pristine hm-C 4 N 3 shows a broad peak around 26.1 which can be designated to its (0 0 2) plane.This reveals the interlayer stacked structure and the weak crystallinity of the conjugated aromatic system 22.As a result of the low weight ratio of hm-C 4 N 3 , the XRD patterns of four hybrids are similar to bare BiVO 4 , indicating that the staple scaffold of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 is BiVO 4 .It is worth noting that the peak at 26.1 emerges and becomes stronger for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 while more precursors for hm-C 4 N 3 is added during the preparation.The presence of hm-C 4 N 3 in the hybrids can thus be initially suggested.Furthermore, the FTIR spectra of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites and their constituents are investigated to demonstrate the hybridization of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 .As exhibited in Fig. S1, the pure BiVO 4 shows an asymmetric stretching mode centered at approximately 733 cm -1 which is regard as the vibration of VO 4 3-.Overlapping of these absorption peaks has caused a broad peak in the wavenumber range of 700-900 cm -1 36.The signal at 680 cm -1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of O -Bi -O.For hm-C 4 N 3 , the absorption at 661 cm -1 is originated from the stretching vibration of C -(C) 3 .The bands at 1000-1500 cm -1 and 1576 cm -1 belong to CN heterocycle and C--N stretching vibrations, respectively 22.C 4 N 3 -20 (Fig. S3) shows the uniform-distribution of Bi, O, V and N elements which demonstrates that BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 commonly devote to the construction of the 3D hierarchical structure together.From this point of view, the formation of a thin wrappage of hm-C 4 N 3 on the surface of BiVO 4 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 can be proposed.In addition, the mass fraction of hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).As observed from the TG curves (Fig. S4), hm-C 4 N 3 maintains 12 of the original weight after heating in atmosphere over 650 C. Whereas, BiVO 4 and the composite sample present 2.3 and 3.4 of weight loss upon heating to 800 C. Thence, the weight ratio of hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 can be calculated as 1.9 wt.After more incorporation of hm-C 4 N 3 , the BiVO 4 nanoparticles seem to be adhered evidently by polymeric continuous phase for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15 (Fig. S2b).In particular, the voids in the center of erythroid-like BiVO 4 are stuffed by organic hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 (Fig. S2c), forming evidently continuous exteriors. The TEM image of pristine BiVO 4 is displayed in Fig. S5.As it shows, the hollow structure can be obviously identified by the contrast of the light center and the dark profile.BiVO 4 is constructed by numerous welldefined nanoparticles.The diameter ( 2 m) of this 3D hollow hierarchical architecture is in accordance with the investigation in SEM images.After incorporation of hm-C 4 N 3 , the edge of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 was investigated in detail.As observed in Fig. 1f, the incorporation of hm-C 4 N 3 doesn't have any impact on the structure of BiVO 4 scaffold.A thin amorphous layer is presented on the surface of highly crystallized region (Fig. 1g).The lattice spacing of 0.369 nm is assigned to the (2 0 0) crystal planes of BiVO 4 37 which can be observed from the HRTEM image (Fig. 1h).In addition, the amorphous wrappage can be unambiguously differentiated between the red and blue dash lines.The thin and even coating of hm-C 4 N 3 is benefit to the transmission of incident photons, thus facilitating the synchronism exciting of hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 .Besides, the combinatorial image of HAADF-STEM of the composite and the correlative elemental mapping images of Bi, V, O, N and C elements specifically indicate the homogeneous combination of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 (Fig. 1i-n).At the edge of the sample, the uniform hybridization can also be confirmed (Fig. S6).The formation of numerous heterojunction interfaces can thus be suggested. The composition of BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 hybrid was further revealed by XPS spectra (Fig. 2a).It is observed that BiVO 4 is comprised of Bi, V and O elements.C and N elements can be detected in hm-C 4 N 3 .For BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20, Bi, V, O, C and N elements all emerge, demonstrating the hybridization of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 .Fig. 2b exhibits the C1s high-resolution spectrum of hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.The C1s spectrum of hm-C 4 N 3 can be divided into three peaks at 284.6 eV, 286.1 eV and 287.9 eV which can be assigned to adventitious carbon, center carbon and sp 2 -bonded carbon in triazine rings (N-C--N), respectively 9.After incorporation in BiVO 4 , the binding energies of center carbon and sp 2 2e and f present the high-resolution spectra of Bi4f and V2p for the samples, respectively.For the pure BiVO 4 , the binding energies at 158.7 eV and 164.0 eV can be considered as the Bi4f 7/2 and Bi4f 5/2 , respectively.The difference between these two values is 5.3 eV which is consistent with Bi 3 38,39.The V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 are located at 516.6 eV and 524.1 eV, respectively 40,41.After deposition of hm-C 4 N 3 , the binding energies of Bi4f and V2p both shift to lower values in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.In consideration of the difference of the binding energies for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 compared with that of pure BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 , the electron transfer from hm-C 4 N 3 to BiVO 4 in the composite is supposed to be existing 42.The facile charge transference and strong interfacial interaction are advantageous to separating of photoinduced charge carriers.In particular, the built-in electric field will avail the charge transfer from BiVO 4 to hm-C 4 N 3 after photoexcitation. Fig. 3a displays the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the photocatalysts.BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 exhibit characteristic type IV with H 3 -type hysteresis loops when the pressure ratio (P/P 0 ) is between 0.6 and 1.0, suggesting the existence of mesoporous structure as a result of the convergence of nanoparticles 43,44.The BET specific surface area of BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is 11.61 m 2 /g and 12.26 m 2 /g, respectively.By contrast, bulk hm-C 4 N 3 has no holes while displays no hysteresis loop and its specific surface area is 0.08 m 2 /g (Table S2).As obtained from the distribution curves of pore and size (Fig. 3b), BiVO owns three aperture distribution ranges.The pore size of less than 5 nm is attributed to the closely stacked nanoparticles, the agglomeration of assembles results in the diameter ranging from 5 nm to 9 nm and the pores larger than 15 nm are resulted from the exterior irregular aggregates.It is noticeable that the ratio of the smallest pores decreases for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20, and these pores are stuffed by the polymerized hm-C 4 N 3 .Meanwhile, the aperture range around 5-9 nm and beyond 20 nm becomes narrow (5-7.6 nm and 15-30 nm), manifesting the orientation of shrinkage to small sizes.The fraction of decreased pore sizes evidently elevates.This signifies that the surfaces of BiVO 4 have been wrapped by hm-C 4 N 3 with uniform distributions.Owing to the low ratio and thin thickness of hm-C 4 N 3 , BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 presents slight BET specific surface area and pore structure deviations from the pristine BiVO 4 .These observations are corresponding to the above-discussed SEM and TEM results, and the much abundant and well-defined heterojunction interfaces are thus be constructed. The photo-absorption capacity of the prepared BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrids was researched through UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS).As exhibited in Fig. 3c, the bare BiVO exhibits strong absorbance from 200 nm to 420 nm due to its broad bandgap.The obvious absorption band edge of BiVO 4 is located at 450 nm, which is in consistence with its yellow appearance (inset of Fig. 3c) and the previous report 45.Hm-C 4 N 3 shows much broad absorptions extending to 1200 nm owing to its dark appearance.For the composites, their absorption ability significantly increases both in ultraviolet light and visible light regions, though the weight ratio of hm-C 4 N 3 is low.It is noteworthy that the color of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N composites changes remarkably, which confirms the co-existence of the two materials and the superior light harvesting capacity of hm-C 4 N 3 .Generally, a higher hm-C 4 N 3 content brings about a stronger absorption band, and the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 exhibits the highest photo-absorption property due to the maximum loading amount of hm-C 4 N 3 .Besides, the bandgap energy of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 can be calculated according to the UV-vis DRS spectrum and the formula as follows: The calculated band gap of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is 2.55 eV and 1.42 eV that shown in Fig. 3d.The narrow bandgap of hm-C 4 N 3 is in accordance with its half-metallicity feature. In order to simulate the photosynthesis of green plant, the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion over the as-fabricated samples was performed under Xenon lamp irradiation with the presence of water.The pristine BiVO 4 shows negligible photocatalytic activity towards CO 2 conversion due to the weak reduction capacity, which is in accordance with its inherent band alignment.For hm-C 4 N 3 and the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites, the yield of CO and CH 4 both increases linearly upon extending of the illuminate time (Figs.4a andS7).CO is detected as the major product accompanied by generation of few amounts of CH 4 .The yield of CO for the bare hm-C 4 N 3 is only 34.9 mol g -1 under light irradiation for 6 h.After combination with BiVO 4 , the yield of CO for the compound obviously increases.Accordingly, the transfer of photoinduced electrons from hm-C 4 N 3 to BiVO 4 can be excluded, and the Z-Scheme heterojunction may be formed between BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 can be proposed.Comparison of the hybrids with different ratios of the two components, the CO production on BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 reaches the highest yield of 244.8 mol g -1 , surpassing most of the reported Z-Scheme system used for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion (Table.S3).Due to the inadequate wrappage or redundant deposition of hm-C 4 N 3 , the result of hybridization cannot be fully elaborated.The CO yield for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 is 230.4,185 and 83.8 mol g -1 , respectively.The overall CO and CH 4 evolution rates for hm-C 4 N 3 and the four hybrids are compared in Fig. 4b.The average CO generation rate of pristine hm-C 4 N 3 is 5.8 mol g -1 h -1 .By contrast, the optimized BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 shows 40.8 mol g -1 h -1 productivity of CO that is 7.1 folds higher than the bare hm-C 4 N 3 .In particular, the selectivity of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 over CO generation is significantly beyond 97 and the apparent quantum yield reaches 0.52 at 385 nm.In addition, the apparent quantum yield at 420 nm and 520 nm is also determined as 0.42 and 0.25 , respectively.To evaluate the stability of this photocatalyst, three cycles of recycling test under the same condition were performed.BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 shows neglectable decrease in the yield of CO (Fig. S8).Moreover, long-term activity test was further conducted (Fig. S9), and the yield of CO increases steadily upon irradiation for 24 h.These indicates superior durability and stability of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.Variable control experiments were carried out including no irradiation, CO 2 or photocatalyst, and none of any products can be detected.This firmly indicates that the photoconversion of CO 2 was proceeded by irradiation upon the catalyst.Subsequently, isotropic experiment using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 is conducted to determine the carbon source of the products (Fig. 4c).The produced 13 CO and the introduced 13 CO 2 can be well-separated by the chromatograph and observed at 1.2 min and 1.6 min, respectively.Then, 13 CO is ionized by the mass spectrograph, and the signals locate at m/ z 13, 16 and 29 are recorded (inset of Fig. 4c) which specifically demonstrates that CO 2 provides the carbon source to generate CO. The oxidation half-reaction was also carefully tracked because the overall CO 2 and H 2 O conversion is much close to the photosynthesis of green plant, which is the final goal of utilization of the solar energy.To investigate the oxidation products, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was conducted with H 2 18 O over BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.As shown in Fig. 4d, the generation of 18 O 2 indicates that water oxidation produces O 2 as the product.Meanwhile, 16 O 2 (m/z 32) and 18 O 16 O (m/z 34) are also detected from this isotropic experiment. 16O 2 comes from the dehydration reaction of COOH intermediate generated upon with the photoconversion of CO 2 and the following oxidation.In combination with the few absolute oxygen which disperses in the reaction tank and injection needle, this signal shows high intensity.In addition, the presence of 16 O 18 O is originated from the photocatalytic produced 18 O 2 and 16 O 2 46,47.Since the amount of H 2 18 O is much larger than the evolved H 2 16 O from CO 2 , the peak intensity of 16 O 18 O is lower than that of the 18 O 2 . Based on the results of isotropic experiments using both 13 CO 2 and H 2 18 O, the overall CO 2 and H 2 O conversion to CO and O 2 can be confirmed, orienting to the target of artificial photosynthesis that we expected. To explore the difference of photocatalytic performance between the samples, the deliver behavior of photoinduced charge carriers of BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 was researched by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy at first.BiVO 4 presents an emission band centered at approximately 485 nm which is assigned to its band-to-band emission 48 that shown in Fig. 5a.The peak position is approximately equivalent to the bandgap of BiVO 4 , i.e., 2.55 eV.For hm-C 4 N 3 , strong PL emission peak is observed around 490 nm.The high conductivity and facile migration of electrons may result in the increased recombination rate of photoinduced electron-hole pairs.After combination of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 , the PL intensity of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 decreased significantly, indicating the suppressed rate of recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Immediately, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy of ns-level which can indicate the charge transfer dynamics shows in Fig. 5b.The radiative lifetimes () can be calculated through a biexponential function fitting decay curves (Table S4).The short ( 1 7.26 ns, 51.1 ), long ( 2 78.68ns, 48.9 ) and average ( 42.21ns) fluorescence lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is strikingly more prolonged than that of the pristine BiVO 4 ( 1 5.34 ns, 57.7 ; 2 49.38 ns, 42.3 ; 23.97ns) and hm-C 4 N 3 ( 1 5.52 ns, 56.0 ; 2 49.47 ns, 44.0 ; 24.87ns).Meanwhile, the charge transfer rate can be calculated by k 1/ av 49, and this value for for BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is 0.042 ns -1 , 0.040 ns -1 and 0.024 ns -1 , respectively.The promoted separation of charge carriers, the extended lifetime of holes and electrons and the improved charge transfer imply an increased possibility for their participation in chemical reaction and thence enhanced photocatalytic activity. Photoelectrochemical characterizations were measured to investigate the charge transfer capability of the catalysts.Fig. 5c shows the photocurrent response curves of BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N composites fabricated on the electrodes through turning the irradiation light on and off for several rounds to collect the I-t curve.Both BiVO and hm-C 4 N 3 present small current intensity upon irradiation owing to the serious recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.After hybridization, all BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites display significantly improved photocurrent, implying effectively enhanced charge separation.In particular, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 presents the highest photocurrent intensity, which is benefit to its photocatalytic performance.With less hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25, many BiVO 4 was not enwrapped and combined with hm-C 4 N 3 .When excess organic half-metal material was incorporated, the thick hm-C 4 N 3 may shield the light harvesting for BiVO 4 .Moreover, the transfer distance of the charge carriers in the bulk materials is increased, resulting poor interfacial charge separation.The uneven distribution of hm-C 4 N 3 will also interrupt the uniform contact between BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 . To further elucidate the interfacial charge transport status, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was measured, and a simulated equivalent electrical circuit was provided.As shown in Fig. 5d, the lower electrolyte solution resistance displayed smaller diameter of the EIS curves which represented promoted interfacial charge-carrier transfer ability.The combination of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is demonstrated to be helpful for charge deliver while the hybrids exhibit smaller arc radius than that of their components.The interfacial charge-transfer resistance for the composites is in the order of BiVO The band alignment of hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 was further explored for the elucidation of the migration of photogenerated electrons and holes.According to the Mott-Schottky measurements (Fig. S10), the Fermi level of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is determined as 0.45 eV and -0.43 eV (vs.NHE), respectively.Accordingly, an internal electric field will be built between hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 after the composition.The transfer direction of built-in electric field from hm-C 4 N 3 to BiVO 4 is beneficial for the charge separation and the construction of a Z-Scheme system, which is in accordance with the XPS analyses.On account of the XPS valence band spectra (Fig. S11), the energy levels of VB of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 are estimated to be approximately 2.21 eV and 1.22 eV below the Fermi level.Therefore, the valence band (VB) position of BiVO 4 can be calculated at 2.66 V which is close to the previous report 31.Meanwhile, the valence band of hm-C 4 N 3 is determined as 0.79 V.In addition, their VB levels were further investigated by the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. S12) 50, which showed a high accordance with the above results.Based on the band-gap obtained from UV-DRS measurements, the CB positions of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 are calculated to be 0.11 V and -0.63 V, respectively.The E CB of hm-C 4 N 3 is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 to CO (E -0.53V vs NHE, pH 7) 51.Therefore, based on the view of thermodynamics, hm-C 4 N 3 can be utilized for photoconversion of CO 2 . The photocatalytic degradation towards MB and the exploration of the major reactive species which played important roles were performed for the research of the charge transfer for the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid. O 2 -) 52.As displayed in Fig. 6b, the decomposition efficiency towards MB is obviously suppressed by the addition of these two radical scavengers.In other words, the traditional type-II heterojunction mechanism, the photoinduced electrons of hm-C 4 N 3 transfer to the CB of BiVO OH/H 2 O, 2.34 eV vs. NHE) 54.Thence, it's not feasible for the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composite to adopt the conventional type-II heterojunction model. To further confirm the type of heterojunction for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 , the electron spin resonance (EPR) experiment was conducted with the trapping reagent of DMPO.The radical of OH was generated by obtaining electron from OH -in water and The band alignment diagram of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composite and the specific mechanism of Z-Scheme heterojunction is illustrated in Fig. 6e.Upon irradiation, the electrons on the VB are excited to CB of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 , and the holes are left on the VB of them.As direct solid-state Z-Scheme heterojunction, the electrons on conduction band of BiVO 4 will transfer to the valence band of hm-C 4 N 3 and combined with the holes.Subsequently, the holes will gather on the valance band of BiVO 4 , and the electrons accumulates on the conduction band of hm-C 4 N 3 .Accordingly, the reducibility and oxidizability of the photocatalyst are both promoted. Further insight into the improved photocatalytic performance of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 was revealed by investigation of the reaction Gibbs free energies.Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed on hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 finite clusters with geometry optimization.Hm-C 4 N 3 presents a two-dimensional layered structure, which deposited on the surface of tetragonal crystal phase BiVO 4 .CO absorbing and activating are the initial steps for photoconversion, while the adequate fastening of CO 2 molecule on the catalysts is the prerequisite for high reduction efficiency 8.As can be seen in Fig. 7a, the formation of CO 2 is spontaneous on hm-C 4 N 3 .In particular, the bare hm-C 4 N 3 shows a strong capture capacity towards CO 2 molecules, which is in sharp contrast with the g-C 3 N 4 requiring an energy input 57.This indicates the great promise for hm-C 4 N 3 on CO 2 conversion, and it can be respected as the reactive sites for the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 Z-Scheme photocatalyst (Fig. 7b).After combination with BiVO 4 , this activation capacity is weakened due to charge equilibrium between the two components.As discussed in the XPS results, the decreased electron density on hm-C 4 N 3 is adverse to its adsorption of CO 2 .This conclusion is further demonstrated by the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of the samples (Fig. 7c).Hm-C 4 N 3 shows an extremely powerful CO 2 adsorption ability of 18.65 cm 3 /g when the P/P 0 is 0.03.Whereas, the CO 2 uptakes for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid decreases to 10.92 cm 3 /g resulting from the low content of hm-C 4 N 3 in the hybrid.The CO 2 can be facilely hydrogenated to COOH on the pristine hm-C 4 N 3 via a barrier of 0.27 eV (Fig. S14a).Whereas, this step on BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is an endothermic process (0.79 eV) with an energy barrier of 0.95 eV need to be overcome (Fig. S14a).As observed from the in-situ DRIFTS spectra (Fig. 7d), the signal for COOH at 1558 cm -1 is much prominent on hm-C 4 N 3 both in the dark and under irradiation.This further confirms the superior activation capability of hm-C 4 N 3 towards CO 2 .However, the overall conversion of CO 2 to CO requires the participation of multiple electrons and protons 58.Subsequently, the COOH turns into CO, which absorbed on the photocatalyst.As it can be seen, the formation of CO is much difficult for hm-C 4 N 3 , which is a significantly endothermic process (1.65 eV) and displays a large energy barrier of 1.87 eV (Fig. S14b).The dehydration of COOH is commonly accompanied by one proton and one electron transfer, the severe recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs depressed this process for hm-C 4 N 3 .Moreover, the poor oxidation ability of hm-C 4 N 3 cannot provide adequate protons from water splitting.By contrast, this process readily evolves on BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 via a moderate barrier of 0.67 eV (Fig. S14b), and the Gibbs free energy is decreased by 0.3 eV.Construction of Z-Scheme heterojunction prolongs the lifetime of electrons on hm-C 4 N 3 .What's more, abundant protons can be generated based on the superior water oxidation capability of BiVO 4 , facilitating the reduction of COOH.From the comparison of in-situ DRIFTS spectra before and after the irradiation, the peak for -OH (1650 cm -1 ) originating from water splitting remarkably strengths for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 , demonstrating the fundamental role of BiVO 4 .Moreover, the significantly decreased intensity for COOH signal compared with that of the -OH signifies the conversion of COOH to CO.Finally, CO is liberated from the surface of the catalyst.The weak adsorption capability of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 is benefit for this process.It is worth noting that the variation of relative peak intensity between -OH and COOH is negligible for the pristine hm-C 4 N 3 upon irradiation.This further confirms that the evolution of CO from COOH is the rate-determining step of the reaction, and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 presents the capability to overcome the reaction barrier."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid (water)", "source": "In order to simulate the photosynthesis of green plant, the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion over the as-fabricated samples was performed under Xenon lamp irradiation with the presence of water.", "context": "The fabrication process of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid was illustrated schematically in Fig. 1a.Firstly, BiVO 4 nanoparticles were formed through the double decomposition reaction between Bi(NO 3 ) 3 and NH 4 VO 3 .Meanwhile, the generated nanoparticles self-assembled into erythroid-like architecture under the inducement of PVP.Then, BMIm C(CN) 3 was adsorbed by this hierarchical scaffold and proceeded into hm-C 4 N 3 on the surfaces of BiVO 4 via in-situ polymerization.BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites with different weight ratios of organic half-metal constituent were prepared under holding this unique erythroid-like architecture.The integration of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is detected through Xray diffraction (XRD) displayed in Fig. 1b.BiVO 4 displays the characteristic feature of zirconium silicate type tetragonal phase crystal structure.The diffraction peaks at 24.4 ,30.7 , 32.7 , 34.7 , 39.5 , 48.4 and 49.9 are assigned to the (2 0 0), (2 1 1), (1 1 2), (2 2 0), (3 0 1), (3 1 2) and (4 0 0) crystal planes which corresponds to the standard PDF card (JCPDS 14-0133) 35.The pristine hm-C 4 N 3 shows a broad peak around 26.1 which can be designated to its (0 0 2) plane.This reveals the interlayer stacked structure and the weak crystallinity of the conjugated aromatic system 22.As a result of the low weight ratio of hm-C 4 N 3 , the XRD patterns of four hybrids are similar to bare BiVO 4 , indicating that the staple scaffold of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 is BiVO 4 .It is worth noting that the peak at 26.1 emerges and becomes stronger for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 while more precursors for hm-C 4 N 3 is added during the preparation.The presence of hm-C 4 N 3 in the hybrids can thus be initially suggested.Furthermore, the FTIR spectra of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites and their constituents are investigated to demonstrate the hybridization of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 .As exhibited in Fig. S1, the pure BiVO 4 shows an asymmetric stretching mode centered at approximately 733 cm -1 which is regard as the vibration of VO 4 3-.Overlapping of these absorption peaks has caused a broad peak in the wavenumber range of 700-900 cm -1 36.The signal at 680 cm -1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of O -Bi -O.For hm-C 4 N 3 , the absorption at 661 cm -1 is originated from the stretching vibration of C -(C) 3 .The bands at 1000-1500 cm -1 and 1576 cm -1 belong to CN heterocycle and C--N stretching vibrations, respectively 22.C 4 N 3 -20 (Fig. S3) shows the uniform-distribution of Bi, O, V and N elements which demonstrates that BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 commonly devote to the construction of the 3D hierarchical structure together.From this point of view, the formation of a thin wrappage of hm-C 4 N 3 on the surface of BiVO 4 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 can be proposed.In addition, the mass fraction of hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).As observed from the TG curves (Fig. S4), hm-C 4 N 3 maintains 12 of the original weight after heating in atmosphere over 650 C. Whereas, BiVO 4 and the composite sample present 2.3 and 3.4 of weight loss upon heating to 800 C. Thence, the weight ratio of hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 can be calculated as 1.9 wt.After more incorporation of hm-C 4 N 3 , the BiVO 4 nanoparticles seem to be adhered evidently by polymeric continuous phase for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15 (Fig. S2b).In particular, the voids in the center of erythroid-like BiVO 4 are stuffed by organic hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 (Fig. S2c), forming evidently continuous exteriors. The TEM image of pristine BiVO 4 is displayed in Fig. S5.As it shows, the hollow structure can be obviously identified by the contrast of the light center and the dark profile.BiVO 4 is constructed by numerous welldefined nanoparticles.The diameter ( 2 m) of this 3D hollow hierarchical architecture is in accordance with the investigation in SEM images.After incorporation of hm-C 4 N 3 , the edge of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 was investigated in detail.As observed in Fig. 1f, the incorporation of hm-C 4 N 3 doesn't have any impact on the structure of BiVO 4 scaffold.A thin amorphous layer is presented on the surface of highly crystallized region (Fig. 1g).The lattice spacing of 0.369 nm is assigned to the (2 0 0) crystal planes of BiVO 4 37 which can be observed from the HRTEM image (Fig. 1h).In addition, the amorphous wrappage can be unambiguously differentiated between the red and blue dash lines.The thin and even coating of hm-C 4 N 3 is benefit to the transmission of incident photons, thus facilitating the synchronism exciting of hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 .Besides, the combinatorial image of HAADF-STEM of the composite and the correlative elemental mapping images of Bi, V, O, N and C elements specifically indicate the homogeneous combination of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 (Fig. 1i-n).At the edge of the sample, the uniform hybridization can also be confirmed (Fig. S6).The formation of numerous heterojunction interfaces can thus be suggested. The composition of BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 hybrid was further revealed by XPS spectra (Fig. 2a).It is observed that BiVO 4 is comprised of Bi, V and O elements.C and N elements can be detected in hm-C 4 N 3 .For BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20, Bi, V, O, C and N elements all emerge, demonstrating the hybridization of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 .Fig. 2b exhibits the C1s high-resolution spectrum of hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.The C1s spectrum of hm-C 4 N 3 can be divided into three peaks at 284.6 eV, 286.1 eV and 287.9 eV which can be assigned to adventitious carbon, center carbon and sp 2 -bonded carbon in triazine rings (N-C--N), respectively 9.After incorporation in BiVO 4 , the binding energies of center carbon and sp 2 2e and f present the high-resolution spectra of Bi4f and V2p for the samples, respectively.For the pure BiVO 4 , the binding energies at 158.7 eV and 164.0 eV can be considered as the Bi4f 7/2 and Bi4f 5/2 , respectively.The difference between these two values is 5.3 eV which is consistent with Bi 3 38,39.The V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 are located at 516.6 eV and 524.1 eV, respectively 40,41.After deposition of hm-C 4 N 3 , the binding energies of Bi4f and V2p both shift to lower values in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.In consideration of the difference of the binding energies for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 compared with that of pure BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 , the electron transfer from hm-C 4 N 3 to BiVO 4 in the composite is supposed to be existing 42.The facile charge transference and strong interfacial interaction are advantageous to separating of photoinduced charge carriers.In particular, the built-in electric field will avail the charge transfer from BiVO 4 to hm-C 4 N 3 after photoexcitation. Fig. 3a displays the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the photocatalysts.BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 exhibit characteristic type IV with H 3 -type hysteresis loops when the pressure ratio (P/P 0 ) is between 0.6 and 1.0, suggesting the existence of mesoporous structure as a result of the convergence of nanoparticles 43,44.The BET specific surface area of BiVO 4 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is 11.61 m 2 /g and 12.26 m 2 /g, respectively.By contrast, bulk hm-C 4 N 3 has no holes while displays no hysteresis loop and its specific surface area is 0.08 m 2 /g (Table S2).As obtained from the distribution curves of pore and size (Fig. 3b), BiVO owns three aperture distribution ranges.The pore size of less than 5 nm is attributed to the closely stacked nanoparticles, the agglomeration of assembles results in the diameter ranging from 5 nm to 9 nm and the pores larger than 15 nm are resulted from the exterior irregular aggregates.It is noticeable that the ratio of the smallest pores decreases for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20, and these pores are stuffed by the polymerized hm-C 4 N 3 .Meanwhile, the aperture range around 5-9 nm and beyond 20 nm becomes narrow (5-7.6 nm and 15-30 nm), manifesting the orientation of shrinkage to small sizes.The fraction of decreased pore sizes evidently elevates.This signifies that the surfaces of BiVO 4 have been wrapped by hm-C 4 N 3 with uniform distributions.Owing to the low ratio and thin thickness of hm-C 4 N 3 , BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 presents slight BET specific surface area and pore structure deviations from the pristine BiVO 4 .These observations are corresponding to the above-discussed SEM and TEM results, and the much abundant and well-defined heterojunction interfaces are thus be constructed. The photo-absorption capacity of the prepared BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrids was researched through UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS).As exhibited in Fig. 3c, the bare BiVO exhibits strong absorbance from 200 nm to 420 nm due to its broad bandgap.The obvious absorption band edge of BiVO 4 is located at 450 nm, which is in consistence with its yellow appearance (inset of Fig. 3c) and the previous report 45.Hm-C 4 N 3 shows much broad absorptions extending to 1200 nm owing to its dark appearance.For the composites, their absorption ability significantly increases both in ultraviolet light and visible light regions, though the weight ratio of hm-C 4 N 3 is low.It is noteworthy that the color of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N composites changes remarkably, which confirms the co-existence of the two materials and the superior light harvesting capacity of hm-C 4 N 3 .Generally, a higher hm-C 4 N 3 content brings about a stronger absorption band, and the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 exhibits the highest photo-absorption property due to the maximum loading amount of hm-C 4 N 3 .Besides, the bandgap energy of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 can be calculated according to the UV-vis DRS spectrum and the formula as follows: The calculated band gap of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is 2.55 eV and 1.42 eV that shown in Fig. 3d.The narrow bandgap of hm-C 4 N 3 is in accordance with its half-metallicity feature. In order to simulate the photosynthesis of green plant, the photocatalytic CO 2 conversion over the as-fabricated samples was performed under Xenon lamp irradiation with the presence of water.The pristine BiVO 4 shows negligible photocatalytic activity towards CO 2 conversion due to the weak reduction capacity, which is in accordance with its inherent band alignment.For hm-C 4 N 3 and the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites, the yield of CO and CH 4 both increases linearly upon extending of the illuminate time (Figs.4a andS7).CO is detected as the major product accompanied by generation of few amounts of CH 4 .The yield of CO for the bare hm-C 4 N 3 is only 34.9 mol g -1 under light irradiation for 6 h.After combination with BiVO 4 , the yield of CO for the compound obviously increases.Accordingly, the transfer of photoinduced electrons from hm-C 4 N 3 to BiVO 4 can be excluded, and the Z-Scheme heterojunction may be formed between BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 can be proposed.Comparison of the hybrids with different ratios of the two components, the CO production on BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 reaches the highest yield of 244.8 mol g -1 , surpassing most of the reported Z-Scheme system used for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion (Table.S3).Due to the inadequate wrappage or redundant deposition of hm-C 4 N 3 , the result of hybridization cannot be fully elaborated.The CO yield for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -15, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -10 is 230.4,185 and 83.8 mol g -1 , respectively.The overall CO and CH 4 evolution rates for hm-C 4 N 3 and the four hybrids are compared in Fig. 4b.The average CO generation rate of pristine hm-C 4 N 3 is 5.8 mol g -1 h -1 .By contrast, the optimized BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 shows 40.8 mol g -1 h -1 productivity of CO that is 7.1 folds higher than the bare hm-C 4 N 3 .In particular, the selectivity of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 over CO generation is significantly beyond 97 and the apparent quantum yield reaches 0.52 at 385 nm.In addition, the apparent quantum yield at 420 nm and 520 nm is also determined as 0.42 and 0.25 , respectively.To evaluate the stability of this photocatalyst, three cycles of recycling test under the same condition were performed.BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 shows neglectable decrease in the yield of CO (Fig. S8).Moreover, long-term activity test was further conducted (Fig. S9), and the yield of CO increases steadily upon irradiation for 24 h.These indicates superior durability and stability of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.Variable control experiments were carried out including no irradiation, CO 2 or photocatalyst, and none of any products can be detected.This firmly indicates that the photoconversion of CO 2 was proceeded by irradiation upon the catalyst.Subsequently, isotropic experiment using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 is conducted to determine the carbon source of the products (Fig. 4c).The produced 13 CO and the introduced 13 CO 2 can be well-separated by the chromatograph and observed at 1.2 min and 1.6 min, respectively.Then, 13 CO is ionized by the mass spectrograph, and the signals locate at m/ z 13, 16 and 29 are recorded (inset of Fig. 4c) which specifically demonstrates that CO 2 provides the carbon source to generate CO. The oxidation half-reaction was also carefully tracked because the overall CO 2 and H 2 O conversion is much close to the photosynthesis of green plant, which is the final goal of utilization of the solar energy.To investigate the oxidation products, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was conducted with H 2 18 O over BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20.As shown in Fig. 4d, the generation of 18 O 2 indicates that water oxidation produces O 2 as the product.Meanwhile, 16 O 2 (m/z 32) and 18 O 16 O (m/z 34) are also detected from this isotropic experiment. 16O 2 comes from the dehydration reaction of COOH intermediate generated upon with the photoconversion of CO 2 and the following oxidation.In combination with the few absolute oxygen which disperses in the reaction tank and injection needle, this signal shows high intensity.In addition, the presence of 16 O 18 O is originated from the photocatalytic produced 18 O 2 and 16 O 2 46,47.Since the amount of H 2 18 O is much larger than the evolved H 2 16 O from CO 2 , the peak intensity of 16 O 18 O is lower than that of the 18 O 2 . Based on the results of isotropic experiments using both 13 CO 2 and H 2 18 O, the overall CO 2 and H 2 O conversion to CO and O 2 can be confirmed, orienting to the target of artificial photosynthesis that we expected. To explore the difference of photocatalytic performance between the samples, the deliver behavior of photoinduced charge carriers of BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 was researched by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy at first.BiVO 4 presents an emission band centered at approximately 485 nm which is assigned to its band-to-band emission 48 that shown in Fig. 5a.The peak position is approximately equivalent to the bandgap of BiVO 4 , i.e., 2.55 eV.For hm-C 4 N 3 , strong PL emission peak is observed around 490 nm.The high conductivity and facile migration of electrons may result in the increased recombination rate of photoinduced electron-hole pairs.After combination of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 , the PL intensity of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 decreased significantly, indicating the suppressed rate of recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Immediately, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy of ns-level which can indicate the charge transfer dynamics shows in Fig. 5b.The radiative lifetimes () can be calculated through a biexponential function fitting decay curves (Table S4).The short ( 1 7.26 ns, 51.1 ), long ( 2 78.68ns, 48.9 ) and average ( 42.21ns) fluorescence lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is strikingly more prolonged than that of the pristine BiVO 4 ( 1 5.34 ns, 57.7 ; 2 49.38 ns, 42.3 ; 23.97ns) and hm-C 4 N 3 ( 1 5.52 ns, 56.0 ; 2 49.47 ns, 44.0 ; 24.87ns).Meanwhile, the charge transfer rate can be calculated by k 1/ av 49, and this value for for BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is 0.042 ns -1 , 0.040 ns -1 and 0.024 ns -1 , respectively.The promoted separation of charge carriers, the extended lifetime of holes and electrons and the improved charge transfer imply an increased possibility for their participation in chemical reaction and thence enhanced photocatalytic activity. Photoelectrochemical characterizations were measured to investigate the charge transfer capability of the catalysts.Fig. 5c shows the photocurrent response curves of BiVO 4 , hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N composites fabricated on the electrodes through turning the irradiation light on and off for several rounds to collect the I-t curve.Both BiVO and hm-C 4 N 3 present small current intensity upon irradiation owing to the serious recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.After hybridization, all BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composites display significantly improved photocurrent, implying effectively enhanced charge separation.In particular, BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 presents the highest photocurrent intensity, which is benefit to its photocatalytic performance.With less hm-C 4 N 3 in BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -25, many BiVO 4 was not enwrapped and combined with hm-C 4 N 3 .When excess organic half-metal material was incorporated, the thick hm-C 4 N 3 may shield the light harvesting for BiVO 4 .Moreover, the transfer distance of the charge carriers in the bulk materials is increased, resulting poor interfacial charge separation.The uneven distribution of hm-C 4 N 3 will also interrupt the uniform contact between BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 . To further elucidate the interfacial charge transport status, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was measured, and a simulated equivalent electrical circuit was provided.As shown in Fig. 5d, the lower electrolyte solution resistance displayed smaller diameter of the EIS curves which represented promoted interfacial charge-carrier transfer ability.The combination of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is demonstrated to be helpful for charge deliver while the hybrids exhibit smaller arc radius than that of their components.The interfacial charge-transfer resistance for the composites is in the order of BiVO The band alignment of hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 was further explored for the elucidation of the migration of photogenerated electrons and holes.According to the Mott-Schottky measurements (Fig. S10), the Fermi level of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 is determined as 0.45 eV and -0.43 eV (vs.NHE), respectively.Accordingly, an internal electric field will be built between hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 after the composition.The transfer direction of built-in electric field from hm-C 4 N 3 to BiVO 4 is beneficial for the charge separation and the construction of a Z-Scheme system, which is in accordance with the XPS analyses.On account of the XPS valence band spectra (Fig. S11), the energy levels of VB of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 are estimated to be approximately 2.21 eV and 1.22 eV below the Fermi level.Therefore, the valence band (VB) position of BiVO 4 can be calculated at 2.66 V which is close to the previous report 31.Meanwhile, the valence band of hm-C 4 N 3 is determined as 0.79 V.In addition, their VB levels were further investigated by the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. S12) 50, which showed a high accordance with the above results.Based on the band-gap obtained from UV-DRS measurements, the CB positions of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 are calculated to be 0.11 V and -0.63 V, respectively.The E CB of hm-C 4 N 3 is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 to CO (E -0.53V vs NHE, pH 7) 51.Therefore, based on the view of thermodynamics, hm-C 4 N 3 can be utilized for photoconversion of CO 2 . The photocatalytic degradation towards MB and the exploration of the major reactive species which played important roles were performed for the research of the charge transfer for the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid. O 2 -) 52.As displayed in Fig. 6b, the decomposition efficiency towards MB is obviously suppressed by the addition of these two radical scavengers.In other words, the traditional type-II heterojunction mechanism, the photoinduced electrons of hm-C 4 N 3 transfer to the CB of BiVO OH/H 2 O, 2.34 eV vs. NHE) 54.Thence, it's not feasible for the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composite to adopt the conventional type-II heterojunction model. To further confirm the type of heterojunction for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 , the electron spin resonance (EPR) experiment was conducted with the trapping reagent of DMPO.The radical of OH was generated by obtaining electron from OH -in water and The band alignment diagram of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 composite and the specific mechanism of Z-Scheme heterojunction is illustrated in Fig. 6e.Upon irradiation, the electrons on the VB are excited to CB of BiVO 4 and hm-C 4 N 3 , and the holes are left on the VB of them.As direct solid-state Z-Scheme heterojunction, the electrons on conduction band of BiVO 4 will transfer to the valence band of hm-C 4 N 3 and combined with the holes.Subsequently, the holes will gather on the valance band of BiVO 4 , and the electrons accumulates on the conduction band of hm-C 4 N 3 .Accordingly, the reducibility and oxidizability of the photocatalyst are both promoted. Further insight into the improved photocatalytic performance of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 was revealed by investigation of the reaction Gibbs free energies.Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed on hm-C 4 N 3 and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 finite clusters with geometry optimization.Hm-C 4 N 3 presents a two-dimensional layered structure, which deposited on the surface of tetragonal crystal phase BiVO 4 .CO absorbing and activating are the initial steps for photoconversion, while the adequate fastening of CO 2 molecule on the catalysts is the prerequisite for high reduction efficiency 8.As can be seen in Fig. 7a, the formation of CO 2 is spontaneous on hm-C 4 N 3 .In particular, the bare hm-C 4 N 3 shows a strong capture capacity towards CO 2 molecules, which is in sharp contrast with the g-C 3 N 4 requiring an energy input 57.This indicates the great promise for hm-C 4 N 3 on CO 2 conversion, and it can be respected as the reactive sites for the BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 Z-Scheme photocatalyst (Fig. 7b).After combination with BiVO 4 , this activation capacity is weakened due to charge equilibrium between the two components.As discussed in the XPS results, the decreased electron density on hm-C 4 N 3 is adverse to its adsorption of CO 2 .This conclusion is further demonstrated by the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of the samples (Fig. 7c).Hm-C 4 N 3 shows an extremely powerful CO 2 adsorption ability of 18.65 cm 3 /g when the P/P 0 is 0.03.Whereas, the CO 2 uptakes for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 hybrid decreases to 10.92 cm 3 /g resulting from the low content of hm-C 4 N 3 in the hybrid.The CO 2 can be facilely hydrogenated to COOH on the pristine hm-C 4 N 3 via a barrier of 0.27 eV (Fig. S14a).Whereas, this step on BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 -20 is an endothermic process (0.79 eV) with an energy barrier of 0.95 eV need to be overcome (Fig. S14a).As observed from the in-situ DRIFTS spectra (Fig. 7d), the signal for COOH at 1558 cm -1 is much prominent on hm-C 4 N 3 both in the dark and under irradiation.This further confirms the superior activation capability of hm-C 4 N 3 towards CO 2 .However, the overall conversion of CO 2 to CO requires the participation of multiple electrons and protons 58.Subsequently, the COOH turns into CO, which absorbed on the photocatalyst.As it can be seen, the formation of CO is much difficult for hm-C 4 N 3 , which is a significantly endothermic process (1.65 eV) and displays a large energy barrier of 1.87 eV (Fig. S14b).The dehydration of COOH is commonly accompanied by one proton and one electron transfer, the severe recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs depressed this process for hm-C 4 N 3 .Moreover, the poor oxidation ability of hm-C 4 N 3 cannot provide adequate protons from water splitting.By contrast, this process readily evolves on BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 via a moderate barrier of 0.67 eV (Fig. S14b), and the Gibbs free energy is decreased by 0.3 eV.Construction of Z-Scheme heterojunction prolongs the lifetime of electrons on hm-C 4 N 3 .What's more, abundant protons can be generated based on the superior water oxidation capability of BiVO 4 , facilitating the reduction of COOH.From the comparison of in-situ DRIFTS spectra before and after the irradiation, the peak for -OH (1650 cm -1 ) originating from water splitting remarkably strengths for BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 , demonstrating the fundamental role of BiVO 4 .Moreover, the significantly decreased intensity for COOH signal compared with that of the -OH signifies the conversion of COOH to CO.Finally, CO is liberated from the surface of the catalyst.The weak adsorption capability of BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 is benefit for this process.It is worth noting that the variation of relative peak intensity between -OH and COOH is negligible for the pristine hm-C 4 N 3 upon irradiation.This further confirms that the evolution of CO from COOH is the rate-determining step of the reaction, and BiVO 4 /hm-C 4 N 3 presents the capability to overcome the reaction barrier."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
