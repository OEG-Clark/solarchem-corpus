CA was dissolved in deionized water and added into titanium oxynitrate solution.The molar ratios of CA/Ti and NO 3 -/CA were kept constant at 2 and 3.After adjusting the pH with ammonia to 6-7, the mixture solution was evaporated at 70 C to gradually form a clear organic or brown-colored gel.The precursor gel was baked at 150 C in a muffle furnace and expanded, then was auto-ignited at about 250 C.Finally, the puffy, porous gray powders were calcined at 500 C for 2 h in air.In the case of doped titania, different amounts of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O were added in the mixture solution of CA and TiO(NO 3 ) 2 .The obtained Ce/TiO 2 nanoparticles with different Ce doping concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, and 3) are denoted as CT-0.5, CT-1, CT-2, and CT-3, respectively. The crystalline phase of the as-prepared catalysts was identified by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) on an X'Pert PRO diffractometer using Cu K radiation ( 0.1542 nm) in the range of 10-80with a step of 1/min.The crystal size was calculated by Scherrer's equation.Specific surface areas of the catalysts were measured by N 2 adsorption in a Tristar 3000 BET analyzer (Micromeritics, US).The surface morphology of the catalysts was examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) with FEI Nova NanoSEM 450 instrument.The inner structure of the catalysts was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI, Tecnai G2 20) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, HR-TEM Tecnai G 2 F30).X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the catalysts were recorded on a Shimadzu/KRATOS AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600 W equipped with Al/Mg K radiation.The UV-vis absorbance spectra of the catalysts were measured with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 950).The photoluminescence spectra (PL) of the catalysts were obtained by a fluorescence spectrometer (Jasco, FP-6500) using a 325 nm UV light as the excitation source. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 under UV light irradiation was carried out in a homemade apparatus (Fig. 1).A stirred batch annular reactor (length 20 cm, inner diameter 6 cm, internal volume 500 cm 3 ) with a suspended catalyst was illuminated by a 9 W Hg lamp (Philips Electronics Ltd., Holland, TUV 9 W P-S) situated in the center of the quartz tube.The peak light intensity of the lamp at 254 nm was around 1.70 mW/cm 2 .The catalyst powder (0.5 g) was suspended in 400 ml of 0.2 M NaOH solutions for typical batches.Supercritical fluid-grade CO 2 with a certified maximum of hydrocarbons less than 1 ppm was used as the carbon source.A magnetic stirrer at the bottom agitated the catalyst-suspended solution to prevent sedimentation of the catalyst.The temperature and pH of the solution and the pressure of the gas phase were continuously monitored. Prior to the illumination, CO 2 was bubbled with a constant flow through the stirred suspension for at least 1 h to purge the air and to saturate the solution.Then, the flow rate was reduced to 5 ml/min for another 30 min to stabilize the flow.The reactor was tightly closed and the pressure was maintained at 0.15 Mpa.Then the photocatalytic reaction was begun by switching on the Hg lamp. The gas phase samples were analyzed using a GC through a six-way valve.The volume of the sample loop is 1 ml.The GC is equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column for hydrocarbons.N 2 was used as the carrier gas and the flow rate was 32 ml/min.The oven temperature was 80 C.The calibration with certified calibration gases (0.5 mol CH 4 , 0.08 mol C 2 H 6 , and 99.999 mol CO 2 ) was performed before each experimental run. The liquid samples were taken at various times during the irradiation.Small aliquots of the suspension were withdrawn by a syringe, filtered through a Millipore filter membrane and then analyzed using a modified method for colorimetric HCHO determination by chromotropic acid 24.The concentration of HCHO in liquid samples was determined by reacting with chromotropic acid in the presence of sulfuric acid to form a purple monocationic chromogen.A PerkinElmer, Lambda 950 spectrophotometer was used for all absorbance measurements.In order to determine the CH 3 OH in liquid samples, the liquid aliquots were oxidized by KMnO 4 solution and then reduced by NaHSO 3 solution to transform CH 3 OH in the samples into HCHO for analysis.The five-point calibration was done by plotting absorbance against HCHO concentration for each calibration level."}, {"llm generation": "Ce doped TiO2", "source": "Fig. 2A shows the XRD patterns of the Ce doped TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 catalysts.", "context": "3.1.Characteristics of the as-prepared catalysts 3.1.1.Structural and surface characteristics of the as-prepared catalysts The crystal structure of the catalysts was analyzed by XRD.Fig. 2A shows the XRD patterns of the Ce doped TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 catalysts.As shown, TiO 2 in all the samples existed as anatase and no peaks corresponding to rutile were observed, even in pure TiO 2 .In general, TiO 2 would transform from anatase into rutile after calcination for 2 h.Considering the literatures 20,21, it should be noticed that the transformation did not necessarily happen, which could be influenced by the preparation procedure.L. Matejova et al. 20 prepared pure TiO 2 using a sol-gel method with the help of nonionic surfactant Triton X-114 C. Their results showed that the TiO 2 only existed as anatase after calcination at 500 C for 2 h.Zhao et al. 21 prepared TiO 2 using a different sol-gel method, and they found that the TiO 2 existed as both anatase and rutile phases after calcination at 500 C for 2 h. In addition, no peaks corresponding to Ce species were observed.Ce 4 ions in TiO 2 can exist in different types, which depend on the synthesis method and doping content of Ce 20,25.Matejova et al. 20 synthesized Ce doped TiO 2 by a sol-gel method.Their XRD results showed that no peaks corresponding to Ce species could be observed even with doping concentration up to 10 mol.They stated that when the doping content of Ce was smaller than 5 mol, Ce 4 ions could be doped into the lattice of TiO 2 , substituting the Ti 4 in anatase lattice.When more Ce (5-10 mol) was loaded, the TiO 2 lattice would be saturated by Ce 4 ions and rest of Ce existed as CeO 2 , either in amorphous phase or small nuclei.Fang et al. 25 prepared cerium doped TiO 2 using an acid catalyzed sol-gel method and their XRD results indicated that only anatase was formed below 0.5 wt. of Ce, and CeO 2 appeared above 0.5 wt. of Ce.Based on these facts and our results, we speculated that Ce 4 ions in our catalysts could exist in three types, including Ce 4 ions doped into the lattice of TiO 2 , amorphous CeO 2 phase or small CeO 2 nuclei.In general, doping Ce into TiO 2 lattice will lead to the expansion of anatase cell volume, because Ti 4 ions (0.68 A) can be substituted by Ce 4 ions (0.92 A) which have larger ionic radii 20.In our work, the cell parameters of all the samples were obtained from Rietveld refinement (summarized in Table 1).The cell volumes of the samples increased with the doping content of Ce, demonstrating that the occupation of anatase lattice by Ce 4 ions took place.The crystallite sizes of the samples were calculated using Scherrer's equation according to the (101) TiO 2 peak (Fig. 2B, Table 1).The average crystallite sizes of the samples decreased with the increase of Ce doping concentration, indicating that doping of Ce could inhibit the growth of TiO 2 crystal grain.This is in accordance with the result of ref. 25. Fig. 3 shows the FE-SEM, TEM and HR-TEM images of CT-1 catalyst.The FE-SEM (Fig. 3A) and TEM (Fig. 3B) figures show that CT-1 catalyst has spherical particles that distribute uniformly.The average particle size of the particles is ca.20 nm, which is consistent with the results of XRD.The HR-TEM figure (Fig. 3C) shows that TiO 2 in CT-1 exists in anatase phase, which is also in line with the results of XRD.No amorphous CeO 2 phase, but very small CeO 2 nanoparticles (2 nm) which can be CeO 2 nuclei were found in the HR-TEM figure.Combining the results of XRD, we could conclude that Ce 4 ions in CT catalysts existed in two forms, Ce 4 ions doped into the lattice of TiO 2 and small CeO 2 nuclei.N 2 adsorption-desorption was applied to explore the textual property of the prepared catalysts.surface area of 29.8 m 2 g -1 .The doping of a small content of Ce in TiO 2 remarkably increased the surface area to ca. 90 m 2 g -1 .Further increasing the Ce content to 3 increased the surface area to 121.3 m 2 g -1 .The increased surface area can be ascribed to the smaller TiO 2 particle size due to Ce doping, as evidenced in the results of XRD (Table 1) The chemical states of Ce, Ti, and O on the surface of the catalysts were analyzed by XPS (Fig. 4).The Ti 2p spectra of all the samples are shown in Fig. 4A.The binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 in different catalysts were about 464.5 and 458.7 eV, respectively.This indicated that Ti existed as Ti 4 but not Ti 3 over the CT catalysts, which agreed well with the values reported in the literature 252627.It could be also observed that the Ti 2p XPS peaks became broader after the addition of Ce, which was attributed to the heterogeneous environments of Ti 4 in CT catalysts 25. The Ce 3d spectra of CT catalysts are presented in Fig. 4B.XPS peaks denoted as u, u, u, and v, v, v were attributed to Ce 4 while u and v were assigned to Ce 3 , following the convention established by Burroughs et al. 28.Therefore, a mixture of Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states existed on the surface of CT catalysts, which was in good agreement with the studies of Fang et al. 25 and Gao et al. 29. Fig. 4C shows the O 1s spectra of the catalysts.The spectra are composed of three overlapping peaks.The peak of O A , with a binding energy of about 530.0 eV, contributes to the lattice oxygen in the metal oxides 25,30.Two shoulder peaks at the higher binding energy side are observed due to chemisorbed oxygen and/or weakly bonded oxygen species (O B ), and surface oxygen by hydroxyl species and/or adsorbed water species present as contaminants at the surface (O C ) 31,32.Based on the area integral of the three peaks, the ratio of O B to O T (O T O A O B O C ) for all samples was calculated as shown in Table 2.It is observed that the introduction of Ce species can effectively enhance the O B concentration on the surfaces of CT catalysts.This is because Ce 3 could create charge imbalance, vacancies, and unsaturated chemical bonds on the catalysts surface 30.These made the chemisorbed oxygen and/or weakly bonded oxygen species on the catalyst surface. The UV-vis absorbance spectra of pure TiO 2 and CT catalysts are shown in Fig. 5.The CT samples showed stronger visible light absorption compared with pure TiO 2 , and the intensity of the absorption enhanced with the increase of Ce doping content, which could be attributed to the photosensitizing effect of CeO 2 14,33. Fig. 6 shows the PL spectra of pure TiO 2 and CT catalysts.The PL spectra of the CT catalysts were basically the same as that of the pure TiO 2 , except lower fluorescence intensity.All the samples exhibited obvious PL signals at approximately 420 and 470 nm, respectively.The former one may result from the band-edge free exciton luminescence of TiO 2 34, while the other one may be the bound exciton luminescence caused by the surface defects of TiO 2 35.The intensity of fluorescence of CT nanoparticles first declined and then increased with the increase of doping content of Ce.The intensity of CT-1 was the lowest among all the samples.Fluorescence of semiconductor was caused by the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs and the intensity of fluorescence declined with the decrease in the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs 34.Therefore, the photoluminescence spectra revealed that proper doping of Ce could effectively reduce the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs, which was benefit for the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency. Three blank condition tests were conducted to obtain baselines: (1) with catalyst, but without UV light irradiation, (2) with UV light irradiation, but without catalyst and (3) with catalyst and UV light irradiation, but using N 2 as the feed gas instead of CO 2 .No hydrocarbon products were detected under these conditions.This indicated that light irradiation and catalyst were both necessary for the process of photocatalysis, and CO 2 was the only carbon source.The photocatalytic activities of CT-0.5, CT-1, CT-2, CT-3 and pure TiO 2 were evaluated in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under UV light irradiation.CH 3 OH and HCHO were recognized as the liquid products and CH 4 as the gaseous product.Other possible products such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, formic acid, and ethylene might also be formed, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration. Fig. 7 shows the yields of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 of CT catalysts with various Ce doping concentrations after UV light irradiation for 8 h.CH 3 OH was found to be the main product and CT samples exhibited Fig. 6.The photoluminescence spectra of the CT samples.much higher activity than pure TiO 2 sample and P25.CT-1 showed the highest photocatalytic activity with a maximum CH 3 OH yield of 188 mol/g, which was much higher than that of TiO 2 based catalyst in previous work 23, indicating that proper doping of Ce could improve the activity of TiO 2 catalyst effectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activities of CT catalysts can be ascribed to their unique structure with favorable properties.First, the introduction of Ce species increases the surface area of the catalyst, resulting in high absorption capacities to CO 2 and water.Second, XPS results show the existence of a mixture of Ce 3 and Ce 4 .Ce 3 can interact with holes 14 to generate Ce 4 and Ce 4 can capture electrons to be reduced to Ce 3 33.These reduced Ce 3 and oxidized Ce 4 species can subsequently transfer the charges to the species present in the reaction, so the electron-hole pairs are separated effectively, leading to a higher quantum efficiency of photocatalytic reaction.Finally, surface chemisorbed oxygen species enhanced by the addition of Ce species can easily capture electrons and produce surface oxygen species with strong reduction capability 14, inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and promoting the reduction of CO 2 . Among all the products, CH 3 OH was the main product and the yield of CH 4 was the lowest.This was in line with other studies that CH 3 OH and HCHO were the main products when the TiO 2 catalyst suspended in an aqueous phase 7,36 but CH 4 was one of the main products of CO 2 photoreduction with water vapor 10,20.The mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction is actually complex.Most researchers agree that this process is based on proton-assisted and multielectrontransfer instead of single electron transfer 37.The selective formation of CH 3 OH is owing to the compromise between charge transfer and thermodynamics.CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 are formed through these reactions 38: Based on the reduction potentials for the products, the order of yields should be CH 4 N CH 3 OH N HCHO in the case that the supply of protons and electrons is high enough 37.Nevertheless, the formation of HCHO needs four protons and four electrons while CH 4 formation needs eight protons and eight electrons.Considering that the NaHCO 3 solution is alkaline, the concentration of protons in it is relatively low, which is not advantageous to the formation of CH 4 10. The yields of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 of CT-1 versus irradiation time are shown in Fig. 8.The yields increased but the production rates decreased gradually with the increase of irradiation time, which could be ascribed to the saturation of the adsorption sites on the TiO 2 surface with intermediate products 39.To confirm the influence of product desorption, a regeneration experiment was done (Fig. 9).After CT-1 catalyst was under irradiation for 24 h, the concentration of hydrocarbons in the reactor no longer changed, indicating complete stoppage of the photoreduction (not shown here).Then the used CT-1 catalyst was collected by filtration and then washed by deionized water to remove the adsorbed products.The used catalyst was again put in the reactor to start the photocatalysis experiment after drying.The production of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 was again observed but at lower level than that of fresh catalyst.The result implied that the used CT-1 catalyst was partially regenerated after washing with water.The regeneration effect demonstrated that desorption of the products obviously affected the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. As temperature has an important influence on desorption of the reaction products, the photocatalytic activity of CT-1 catalyst under different temperatures was investigated (Fig. 10).The yields increased with the reaction temperature increased from 30 to 70 C.This can be well explained by the relationship between the temperature and desorption of reaction products, that is high reaction temperature is helpful for desorption of the intermediates 40, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity. The mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in liquid phase has been discussed elsewhere 414243.When the catalyst is under UV light irradiation, the photo-excited electrons can be captured by the carbonate species to form HCOOH intermediate, followed by further reduction to HCHO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 41,42.The details of the process can be described as follows.First, photo-excited electrons attack carbonate species to form formyloxyl radical: Then HCOO can continue to capture electrons to form formate ion, which is further protonated to produce HCOOH 43. Finally, HCOOH can be reduced to HCHO, CH 3 OH, and CH 4 ."}, {"llm generation": "pure TiO2", "source": "Fig. 2A shows the XRD patterns of the Ce doped TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 catalysts.", "context": "3.1.Characteristics of the as-prepared catalysts 3.1.1.Structural and surface characteristics of the as-prepared catalysts The crystal structure of the catalysts was analyzed by XRD.Fig. 2A shows the XRD patterns of the Ce doped TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 catalysts.As shown, TiO 2 in all the samples existed as anatase and no peaks corresponding to rutile were observed, even in pure TiO 2 .In general, TiO 2 would transform from anatase into rutile after calcination for 2 h.Considering the literatures 20,21, it should be noticed that the transformation did not necessarily happen, which could be influenced by the preparation procedure.L.

The mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in liquid phase has been discussed elsewhere 414243.When the catalyst is under UV light irradiation, the photo-excited electrons can be captured by the carbonate species to form HCOOH intermediate, followed by further reduction to HCHO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 41,42.The details of the process can be described as follows.First, photo-excited electrons attack carbonate species to form formyloxyl radical: Then HCOO can continue to capture electrons to form formate ion, which is further protonated to produce HCOOH 43. Finally, HCOOH can be reduced to HCHO, CH 3 OH, and CH 4 ."}, {"llm generation": "CT-0.5, CT-1, CT-2, CT-3", "source": "The photocatalytic activities of CT-0.5, CT-1, CT-2, CT-3 and pure TiO 2 were evaluated in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under UV light irradiation.", "context": "3.1.Characteristics of the as-prepared catalysts 3.1.1.Structural and surface characteristics of the as-prepared catalysts The crystal structure of the catalysts was analyzed by XRD.Fig. 2A shows the XRD patterns of the Ce doped TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 catalysts.As shown, TiO 2 in all the samples existed as anatase and no peaks corresponding to rutile were observed, even in pure TiO 2 .In general, TiO 2 would transform from anatase into rutile after calcination for 2 h.Considering the literatures 20,21, it should be noticed that the transformation did not necessarily happen, which could be influenced by the preparation procedure.L. Matejova et al. 20 prepared pure TiO 2 using a sol-gel method with the help of nonionic surfactant Triton X-114 C. Their results showed that the TiO 2 only existed as anatase after calcination at 500 C for 2 h.Zhao et al. 21 prepared TiO 2 using a different sol-gel method, and they found that the TiO 2 existed as both anatase and rutile phases after calcination at 500 C for 2 h. In addition, no peaks corresponding to Ce species were observed.Ce 4 ions in TiO 2 can exist in different types, which depend on the synthesis method and doping content of Ce 20,25.Matejova et al. 20 synthesized Ce doped TiO 2 by a sol-gel method.Their XRD results showed that no peaks corresponding to Ce species could be observed even with doping concentration up to 10 mol.They stated that when the doping content of Ce was smaller than 5 mol, Ce 4 ions could be doped into the lattice of TiO 2 , substituting the Ti 4 in anatase lattice.When more Ce (5-10 mol) was loaded, the TiO 2 lattice would be saturated by Ce 4 ions and rest of Ce existed as CeO 2 , either in amorphous phase or small nuclei.Fang et al. 25 prepared cerium doped TiO 2 using an acid catalyzed sol-gel method and their XRD results indicated that only anatase was formed below 0.5 wt. of Ce, and CeO 2 appeared above 0.5 wt. of Ce.Based on these facts and our results, we speculated that Ce 4 ions in our catalysts could exist in three types, including Ce 4 ions doped into the lattice of TiO 2 , amorphous CeO 2 phase or small CeO 2 nuclei.In general, doping Ce into TiO 2 lattice will lead to the expansion of anatase cell volume, because Ti 4 ions (0.68 A) can be substituted by Ce 4 ions (0.92 A) which have larger ionic radii 20.In our work, the cell parameters of all the samples were obtained from Rietveld refinement (summarized in Table 1).The cell volumes of the samples increased with the doping content of Ce, demonstrating that the occupation of anatase lattice by Ce 4 ions took place.The crystallite sizes of the samples were calculated using Scherrer's equation according to the (101) TiO 2 peak (Fig. 2B, Table 1).The average crystallite sizes of the samples decreased with the increase of Ce doping concentration, indicating that doping of Ce could inhibit the growth of TiO 2 crystal grain.This is in accordance with the result of ref. 25. Fig. 3 shows the FE-SEM, TEM and HR-TEM images of CT-1 catalyst.The FE-SEM (Fig. 3A) and TEM (Fig. 3B) figures show that CT-1 catalyst has spherical particles that distribute uniformly.The average particle size of the particles is ca.20 nm, which is consistent with the results of XRD.The HR-TEM figure (Fig. 3C) shows that TiO 2 in CT-1 exists in anatase phase, which is also in line with the results of XRD.No amorphous CeO 2 phase, but very small CeO 2 nanoparticles (2 nm) which can be CeO 2 nuclei were found in the HR-TEM figure.Combining the results of XRD, we could conclude that Ce 4 ions in CT catalysts existed in two forms, Ce 4 ions doped into the lattice of TiO 2 and small CeO 2 nuclei.N 2 adsorption-desorption was applied to explore the textual property of the prepared catalysts.surface area of 29.8 m 2 g -1 .The doping of a small content of Ce in TiO 2 remarkably increased the surface area to ca. 90 m 2 g -1 .Further increasing the Ce content to 3 increased the surface area to 121.3 m 2 g -1 .The increased surface area can be ascribed to the smaller TiO 2 particle size due to Ce doping, as evidenced in the results of XRD (Table 1) The chemical states of Ce, Ti, and O on the surface of the catalysts were analyzed by XPS (Fig. 4).The Ti 2p spectra of all the samples are shown in Fig. 4A.The binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 in different catalysts were about 464.5 and 458.7 eV, respectively.This indicated that Ti existed as Ti 4 but not Ti 3 over the CT catalysts, which agreed well with the values reported in the literature 252627.It could be also observed that the Ti 2p XPS peaks became broader after the addition of Ce, which was attributed to the heterogeneous environments of Ti 4 in CT catalysts 25. The Ce 3d spectra of CT catalysts are presented in Fig. 4B.XPS peaks denoted as u, u, u, and v, v, v were attributed to Ce 4 while u and v were assigned to Ce 3 , following the convention established by Burroughs et al. 28.Therefore, a mixture of Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states existed on the surface of CT catalysts, which was in good agreement with the studies of Fang et al. 25 and Gao et al. 29. Fig. 4C shows the O 1s spectra of the catalysts.The spectra are composed of three overlapping peaks.The peak of O A , with a binding energy of about 530.0 eV, contributes to the lattice oxygen in the metal oxides 25,30.Two shoulder peaks at the higher binding energy side are observed due to chemisorbed oxygen and/or weakly bonded oxygen species (O B ), and surface oxygen by hydroxyl species and/or adsorbed water species present as contaminants at the surface (O C ) 31,32.Based on the area integral of the three peaks, the ratio of O B to O T (O T O A O B O C ) for all samples was calculated as shown in Table 2.It is observed that the introduction of Ce species can effectively enhance the O B concentration on the surfaces of CT catalysts.This is because Ce 3 could create charge imbalance, vacancies, and unsaturated chemical bonds on the catalysts surface 30.These made the chemisorbed oxygen and/or weakly bonded oxygen species on the catalyst surface. The UV-vis absorbance spectra of pure TiO 2 and CT catalysts are shown in Fig. 5.The CT samples showed stronger visible light absorption compared with pure TiO 2 , and the intensity of the absorption enhanced with the increase of Ce doping content, which could be attributed to the photosensitizing effect of CeO 2 14,33. Fig. 6 shows the PL spectra of pure TiO 2 and CT catalysts.The PL spectra of the CT catalysts were basically the same as that of the pure TiO 2 , except lower fluorescence intensity.All the samples exhibited obvious PL signals at approximately 420 and 470 nm, respectively.The former one may result from the band-edge free exciton luminescence of TiO 2 34, while the other one may be the bound exciton luminescence caused by the surface defects of TiO 2 35.The intensity of fluorescence of CT nanoparticles first declined and then increased with the increase of doping content of Ce.The intensity of CT-1 was the lowest among all the samples.Fluorescence of semiconductor was caused by the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs and the intensity of fluorescence declined with the decrease in the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs 34.Therefore, the photoluminescence spectra revealed that proper doping of Ce could effectively reduce the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs, which was benefit for the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency. Three blank condition tests were conducted to obtain baselines: (1) with catalyst, but without UV light irradiation, (2) with UV light irradiation, but without catalyst and (3) with catalyst and UV light irradiation, but using N 2 as the feed gas instead of CO 2 .No hydrocarbon products were detected under these conditions.This indicated that light irradiation and catalyst were both necessary for the process of photocatalysis, and CO 2 was the only carbon source.The photocatalytic activities of CT-0.5, CT-1, CT-2, CT-3 and pure TiO 2 were evaluated in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under UV light irradiation.CH 3 OH and HCHO were recognized as the liquid products and CH 4 as the gaseous product.Other possible products such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, formic acid, and ethylene might also be formed, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration. Fig. 7 shows the yields of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 of CT catalysts with various Ce doping concentrations after UV light irradiation for 8 h.CH 3 OH was found to be the main product and CT samples exhibited Fig. 6.The photoluminescence spectra of the CT samples.much higher activity than pure TiO 2 sample and P25.CT-1 showed the highest photocatalytic activity with a maximum CH 3 OH yield of 188 mol/g, which was much higher than that of TiO 2 based catalyst in previous work 23, indicating that proper doping of Ce could improve the activity of TiO 2 catalyst effectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activities of CT catalysts can be ascribed to their unique structure with favorable properties.First, the introduction of Ce species increases the surface area of the catalyst, resulting in high absorption capacities to CO 2 and water.Second, XPS results show the existence of a mixture of Ce 3 and Ce 4 .Ce 3 can interact with holes 14 to generate Ce 4 and Ce 4 can capture electrons to be reduced to Ce 3 33.These reduced Ce 3 and oxidized Ce 4 species can subsequently transfer the charges to the species present in the reaction, so the electron-hole pairs are separated effectively, leading to a higher quantum efficiency of photocatalytic reaction.Finally, surface chemisorbed oxygen species enhanced by the addition of Ce species can easily capture electrons and produce surface oxygen species with strong reduction capability 14, inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and promoting the reduction of CO 2 . Among all the products, CH 3 OH was the main product and the yield of CH 4 was the lowest.This was in line with other studies that CH 3 OH and HCHO were the main products when the TiO 2 catalyst suspended in an aqueous phase 7,36 but CH 4 was one of the main products of CO 2 photoreduction with water vapor 10,20.The mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction is actually complex.Most researchers agree that this process is based on proton-assisted and multielectrontransfer instead of single electron transfer 37.The selective formation of CH 3 OH is owing to the compromise between charge transfer and thermodynamics.CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 are formed through these reactions 38: Based on the reduction potentials for the products, the order of yields should be CH 4 N CH 3 OH N HCHO in the case that the supply of protons and electrons is high enough 37.Nevertheless, the formation of HCHO needs four protons and four electrons while CH 4 formation needs eight protons and eight electrons.Considering that the NaHCO 3 solution is alkaline, the concentration of protons in it is relatively low, which is not advantageous to the formation of CH 4 10. The yields of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 of CT-1 versus irradiation time are shown in Fig. 8.The yields increased but the production rates decreased gradually with the increase of irradiation time, which could be ascribed to the saturation of the adsorption sites on the TiO 2 surface with intermediate products 39.To confirm the influence of product desorption, a regeneration experiment was done (Fig. 9).After CT-1 catalyst was under irradiation for 24 h, the concentration of hydrocarbons in the reactor no longer changed, indicating complete stoppage of the photoreduction (not shown here).Then the used CT-1 catalyst was collected by filtration and then washed by deionized water to remove the adsorbed products.The used catalyst was again put in the reactor to start the photocatalysis experiment after drying.The production of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 was again observed but at lower level than that of fresh catalyst.The result implied that the used CT-1 catalyst was partially regenerated after washing with water.The regeneration effect demonstrated that desorption of the products obviously affected the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. As temperature has an important influence on desorption of the reaction products, the photocatalytic activity of CT-1 catalyst under different temperatures was investigated (Fig. 10).The yields increased with the reaction temperature increased from 30 to 70 C.This can be well explained by the relationship between the temperature and desorption of reaction products, that is high reaction temperature is helpful for desorption of the intermediates 40, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity. The mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in liquid phase has been discussed elsewhere 414243.When the catalyst is under UV light irradiation, the photo-excited electrons can be captured by the carbonate species to form HCOOH intermediate, followed by further reduction to HCHO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 41,42.The details of the process can be described as follows.First, photo-excited electrons attack carbonate species to form formyloxyl radical: Then HCOO can continue to capture electrons to form formate ion, which is further protonated to produce HCOOH 43.

The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 under UV light irradiation was carried out in a homemade apparatus (Fig. 1).A stirred batch annular reactor (length 20 cm, inner diameter 6 cm, internal volume 500 cm 3 ) with a suspended catalyst was illuminated by a 9 W Hg lamp (Philips Electronics Ltd., Holland, TUV 9 W P-S) situated in the center of the quartz tube.The peak light intensity of the lamp at 254 nm was around 1.70 mW/cm 2 .The catalyst powder (0.5 g) was suspended in 400 ml of 0.2 M NaOH solutions for typical batches.Supercritical fluid-grade CO 2 with a certified maximum of hydrocarbons less than 1 ppm was used as the carbon source.A magnetic stirrer at the bottom agitated the catalyst-suspended solution to prevent sedimentation of the catalyst.The temperature and pH of the solution and the pressure of the gas phase were continuously monitored. Prior to the illumination, CO 2 was bubbled with a constant flow through the stirred suspension for at least 1 h to purge the air and to saturate the solution.Then, the flow rate was reduced to 5 ml/min for another 30 min to stabilize the flow.The reactor was tightly closed and the pressure was maintained at 0.15 Mpa.Then the photocatalytic reaction was begun by switching on the Hg lamp. The gas phase samples were analyzed using a GC through a six-way valve.The volume of the sample loop is 1 ml.The GC is equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column for hydrocarbons.N 2 was used as the carrier gas and the flow rate was 32 ml/min.The oven temperature was 80 C.The calibration with certified calibration gases (0.5 mol CH 4 , 0.08 mol C 2 H 6 , and 99.999 mol CO 2 ) was performed before each experimental run. The liquid samples were taken at various times during the irradiation.Small aliquots of the suspension were withdrawn by a syringe, filtered through a Millipore filter membrane and then analyzed using a modified method for colorimetric HCHO determination by chromotropic acid 24.The concentration of HCHO in liquid samples was determined by reacting with chromotropic acid in the presence of sulfuric acid to form a purple monocationic chromogen.A PerkinElmer, Lambda 950 spectrophotometer was used for all absorbance measurements.In order to determine the CH 3 OH in liquid samples, the liquid aliquots were oxidized by KMnO 4 solution and then reduced by NaHSO 3 solution to transform CH 3 OH in the samples into HCHO for analysis.The five-point calibration was done by plotting absorbance against HCHO concentration for each calibration level."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "The photocatalytic activities of CT-0.5, CT-1, CT-2, CT-3 and pure TiO 2 were evaluated in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under UV light irradiation.", "context": "3.1.Characteristics of the as-prepared catalysts 3.1.1.Structural and surface characteristics of the as-prepared catalysts The crystal structure of the catalysts was analyzed by XRD.Fig. 2A shows the XRD patterns of the Ce doped TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 catalysts.As shown, TiO 2 in all the samples existed as anatase and no peaks corresponding to rutile were observed, even in pure TiO 2 .In general, TiO 2 would transform from anatase into rutile after calcination for 2 h.Considering the literatures 20,21, it should be noticed that the transformation did not necessarily happen, which could be influenced by the preparation procedure.L. Matejova et al. 20 prepared pure TiO 2 using a sol-gel method with the help of nonionic surfactant Triton X-114 C. Their results showed that the TiO 2 only existed as anatase after calcination at 500 C for 2 h.Zhao et al. 21 prepared TiO 2 using a different sol-gel method, and they found that the TiO 2 existed as both anatase and rutile phases after calcination at 500 C for 2 h. In addition, no peaks corresponding to Ce species were observed.Ce 4 ions in TiO 2 can exist in different types, which depend on the synthesis method and doping content of Ce 20,25.Matejova et al. 20 synthesized Ce doped TiO 2 by a sol-gel method.Their XRD results showed that no peaks corresponding to Ce species could be observed even with doping concentration up to 10 mol.They stated that when the doping content of Ce was smaller than 5 mol, Ce 4 ions could be doped into the lattice of TiO 2 , substituting the Ti 4 in anatase lattice.When more Ce (5-10 mol) was loaded, the TiO 2 lattice would be saturated by Ce 4 ions and rest of Ce existed as CeO 2 , either in amorphous phase or small nuclei.Fang et al. 25 prepared cerium doped TiO 2 using an acid catalyzed sol-gel method and their XRD results indicated that only anatase was formed below 0.5 wt. of Ce, and CeO 2 appeared above 0.5 wt. of Ce.Based on these facts and our results, we speculated that Ce 4 ions in our catalysts could exist in three types, including Ce 4 ions doped into the lattice of TiO 2 , amorphous CeO 2 phase or small CeO 2 nuclei.In general, doping Ce into TiO 2 lattice will lead to the expansion of anatase cell volume, because Ti 4 ions (0.68 A) can be substituted by Ce 4 ions (0.92 A) which have larger ionic radii 20.In our work, the cell parameters of all the samples were obtained from Rietveld refinement (summarized in Table 1).The cell volumes of the samples increased with the doping content of Ce, demonstrating that the occupation of anatase lattice by Ce 4 ions took place.The crystallite sizes of the samples were calculated using Scherrer's equation according to the (101) TiO 2 peak (Fig. 2B, Table 1).The average crystallite sizes of the samples decreased with the increase of Ce doping concentration, indicating that doping of Ce could inhibit the growth of TiO 2 crystal grain.This is in accordance with the result of ref. 25. Fig. 3 shows the FE-SEM, TEM and HR-TEM images of CT-1 catalyst.The FE-SEM (Fig. 3A) and TEM (Fig. 3B) figures show that CT-1 catalyst has spherical particles that distribute uniformly.The average particle size of the particles is ca.20 nm, which is consistent with the results of XRD.The HR-TEM figure (Fig. 3C) shows that TiO 2 in CT-1 exists in anatase phase, which is also in line with the results of XRD.No amorphous CeO 2 phase, but very small CeO 2 nanoparticles (2 nm) which can be CeO 2 nuclei were found in the HR-TEM figure.Combining the results of XRD, we could conclude that Ce 4 ions in CT catalysts existed in two forms, Ce 4 ions doped into the lattice of TiO 2 and small CeO 2 nuclei.N 2 adsorption-desorption was applied to explore the textual property of the prepared catalysts.surface area of 29.8 m 2 g -1 .The doping of a small content of Ce in TiO 2 remarkably increased the surface area to ca. 90 m 2 g -1 .Further increasing the Ce content to 3 increased the surface area to 121.3 m 2 g -1 .The increased surface area can be ascribed to the smaller TiO 2 particle size due to Ce doping, as evidenced in the results of XRD (Table 1) The chemical states of Ce, Ti, and O on the surface of the catalysts were analyzed by XPS (Fig. 4).The Ti 2p spectra of all the samples are shown in Fig. 4A.The binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 in different catalysts were about 464.5 and 458.7 eV, respectively.This indicated that Ti existed as Ti 4 but not Ti 3 over the CT catalysts, which agreed well with the values reported in the literature 252627.It could be also observed that the Ti 2p XPS peaks became broader after the addition of Ce, which was attributed to the heterogeneous environments of Ti 4 in CT catalysts 25. The Ce 3d spectra of CT catalysts are presented in Fig. 4B.XPS peaks denoted as u, u, u, and v, v, v were attributed to Ce 4 while u and v were assigned to Ce 3 , following the convention established by Burroughs et al. 28.Therefore, a mixture of Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states existed on the surface of CT catalysts, which was in good agreement with the studies of Fang et al. 25 and Gao et al. 29. Fig. 4C shows the O 1s spectra of the catalysts.The spectra are composed of three overlapping peaks.The peak of O A , with a binding energy of about 530.0 eV, contributes to the lattice oxygen in the metal oxides 25,30.Two shoulder peaks at the higher binding energy side are observed due to chemisorbed oxygen and/or weakly bonded oxygen species (O B ), and surface oxygen by hydroxyl species and/or adsorbed water species present as contaminants at the surface (O C ) 31,32.Based on the area integral of the three peaks, the ratio of O B to O T (O T O A O B O C ) for all samples was calculated as shown in Table 2.It is observed that the introduction of Ce species can effectively enhance the O B concentration on the surfaces of CT catalysts.This is because Ce 3 could create charge imbalance, vacancies, and unsaturated chemical bonds on the catalysts surface 30.These made the chemisorbed oxygen and/or weakly bonded oxygen species on the catalyst surface. The UV-vis absorbance spectra of pure TiO 2 and CT catalysts are shown in Fig. 5.The CT samples showed stronger visible light absorption compared with pure TiO 2 , and the intensity of the absorption enhanced with the increase of Ce doping content, which could be attributed to the photosensitizing effect of CeO 2 14,33. Fig. 6 shows the PL spectra of pure TiO 2 and CT catalysts.The PL spectra of the CT catalysts were basically the same as that of the pure TiO 2 , except lower fluorescence intensity.All the samples exhibited obvious PL signals at approximately 420 and 470 nm, respectively.The former one may result from the band-edge free exciton luminescence of TiO 2 34, while the other one may be the bound exciton luminescence caused by the surface defects of TiO 2 35.The intensity of fluorescence of CT nanoparticles first declined and then increased with the increase of doping content of Ce.The intensity of CT-1 was the lowest among all the samples.Fluorescence of semiconductor was caused by the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs and the intensity of fluorescence declined with the decrease in the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs 34.Therefore, the photoluminescence spectra revealed that proper doping of Ce could effectively reduce the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs, which was benefit for the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency. Three blank condition tests were conducted to obtain baselines: (1) with catalyst, but without UV light irradiation, (2) with UV light irradiation, but without catalyst and (3) with catalyst and UV light irradiation, but using N 2 as the feed gas instead of CO 2 .No hydrocarbon products were detected under these conditions.This indicated that light irradiation and catalyst were both necessary for the process of photocatalysis, and CO 2 was the only carbon source.The photocatalytic activities of CT-0.5, CT-1, CT-2, CT-3 and pure TiO 2 were evaluated in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under UV light irradiation.CH 3 OH and HCHO were recognized as the liquid products and CH 4 as the gaseous product.Other possible products such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, formic acid, and ethylene might also be formed, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration. Fig. 7 shows the yields of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 of CT catalysts with various Ce doping concentrations after UV light irradiation for 8 h.CH 3 OH was found to be the main product and CT samples exhibited Fig. 6.The photoluminescence spectra of the CT samples.much higher activity than pure TiO 2 sample and P25.CT-1 showed the highest photocatalytic activity with a maximum CH 3 OH yield of 188 mol/g, which was much higher than that of TiO 2 based catalyst in previous work 23, indicating that proper doping of Ce could improve the activity of TiO 2 catalyst effectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activities of CT catalysts can be ascribed to their unique structure with favorable properties.First, the introduction of Ce species increases the surface area of the catalyst, resulting in high absorption capacities to CO 2 and water.Second, XPS results show the existence of a mixture of Ce 3 and Ce 4 .Ce 3 can interact with holes 14 to generate Ce 4 and Ce 4 can capture electrons to be reduced to Ce 3 33.These reduced Ce 3 and oxidized Ce 4 species can subsequently transfer the charges to the species present in the reaction, so the electron-hole pairs are separated effectively, leading to a higher quantum efficiency of photocatalytic reaction.Finally, surface chemisorbed oxygen species enhanced by the addition of Ce species can easily capture electrons and produce surface oxygen species with strong reduction capability 14, inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and promoting the reduction of CO 2 . Among all the products, CH 3 OH was the main product and the yield of CH 4 was the lowest.This was in line with other studies that CH 3 OH and HCHO were the main products when the TiO 2 catalyst suspended in an aqueous phase 7,36 but CH 4 was one of the main products of CO 2 photoreduction with water vapor 10,20.The mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction is actually complex.Most researchers agree that this process is based on proton-assisted and multielectrontransfer instead of single electron transfer 37.The selective formation of CH 3 OH is owing to the compromise between charge transfer and thermodynamics.CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 are formed through these reactions 38: Based on the reduction potentials for the products, the order of yields should be CH 4 N CH 3 OH N HCHO in the case that the supply of protons and electrons is high enough 37.Nevertheless, the formation of HCHO needs four protons and four electrons while CH 4 formation needs eight protons and eight electrons.Considering that the NaHCO 3 solution is alkaline, the concentration of protons in it is relatively low, which is not advantageous to the formation of CH 4 10. The yields of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 of CT-1 versus irradiation time are shown in Fig. 8.The yields increased but the production rates decreased gradually with the increase of irradiation time, which could be ascribed to the saturation of the adsorption sites on the TiO 2 surface with intermediate products 39.To confirm the influence of product desorption, a regeneration experiment was done (Fig. 9).After CT-1 catalyst was under irradiation for 24 h, the concentration of hydrocarbons in the reactor no longer changed, indicating complete stoppage of the photoreduction (not shown here).Then the used CT-1 catalyst was collected by filtration and then washed by deionized water to remove the adsorbed products.The used catalyst was again put in the reactor to start the photocatalysis experiment after drying.The production of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 was again observed but at lower level than that of fresh catalyst.The result implied that the used CT-1 catalyst was partially regenerated after washing with water.The regeneration effect demonstrated that desorption of the products obviously affected the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. As temperature has an important influence on desorption of the reaction products, the photocatalytic activity of CT-1 catalyst under different temperatures was investigated (Fig. 10).The yields increased with the reaction temperature increased from 30 to 70 C.This can be well explained by the relationship between the temperature and desorption of reaction products, that is high reaction temperature is helpful for desorption of the intermediates 40, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity. The mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in liquid phase has been discussed elsewhere 414243.When the catalyst is under UV light irradiation, the photo-excited electrons can be captured by the carbonate species to form HCOOH intermediate, followed by further reduction to HCHO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 41,42.The details of the process can be described as follows.First, photo-excited electrons attack carbonate species to form formyloxyl radical: Then HCOO can continue to capture electrons to form formate ion, which is further protonated to produce HCOOH 43. Finally, HCOOH can be reduced to HCHO, CH 3 OH, and CH 4 ."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Fig. 7.

The gas phase samples were analyzed using a GC through a six-way valve.The volume of the sample loop is 1 ml.The GC is equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column for hydrocarbons.N 2 was used as the carrier gas and the flow rate was 32 ml/min.The oven temperature was 80 C.The calibration with certified calibration gases (0.5 mol CH 4 , 0.08 mol C 2 H 6 , and 99.999 mol CO 2 ) was performed before each experimental run. The liquid samples were taken at various times during the irradiation.Small aliquots of the suspension were withdrawn by a syringe, filtered through a Millipore filter membrane and then analyzed using a modified method for colorimetric HCHO determination by chromotropic acid 24.The concentration of HCHO in liquid samples was determined by reacting with chromotropic acid in the presence of sulfuric acid to form a purple monocationic chromogen.A PerkinElmer, Lambda 950 spectrophotometer was used for all absorbance measurements.In order to determine the CH 3 OH in liquid samples, the liquid aliquots were oxidized by KMnO 4 solution and then reduced by NaHSO 3 solution to transform CH 3 OH in the samples into HCHO for analysis.The five-point calibration was done by plotting absorbance against HCHO concentration for each calibration level."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Efficient photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into liquid products over cerium doped titania nanoparticles synthesized by a sol\u2013gel auto-ignited method", "context": "Efficient photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into liquid products over cerium doped titania nanoparticles synthesized by a sol\u2013gel auto-ignited method"}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The catalyst was well characterized and used as photocatalysts to convert CO 2 and H 2 O into hydrocarbons, including CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 , in liquid phase.", "context": "Cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticles were synthesized through a simple sol-gel auto-ignited method.Ce doping inhibited the growth of TiO 2 particles and increased the surface area of the catalysts.The catalyst was well characterized and used as photocatalysts to convert CO 2 and H 2 O into hydrocarbons, including CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 , in liquid phase.CH 3 OH was found to be the primary product with a highest yield of 188 mol/g obtained by 1 Ce doped TiO 2 catalyst after UV irradiation for 8 h, which was much higher than that of pure TiO 2 and P25.The selective formation of CH 3 OH can be ascribed to the compromise between charge transfer and thermodynamics.The introduction of CeO 2 can enhance the chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of the catalyst and the existence of Ce 3 /Ce 4 mixture can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, resulting in remarkable activity of cerium doped TiO 2 catalyst.Desorption of the reaction products plays an important role on the deactivation of the catalyst."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid (0.2 M NaOH solutions)", "source": "The catalyst powder (0.5 g) was suspended in 400 ml of 0.2 M NaOH solutions for typical batches.", "context": "Cerium doped TiO 2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a sol-gel auto-ignited method.Analytical grade titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4 ), citric acid (CA) and Cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O) were used as received.TiO(NO 3 ) 2 as the titanium source was prepared from TiCl 4 according to the following procedure: TiCl 4 was first dissolved in deionized water to hydrolyze, then TiO 2 nH 2 O was precipitated by the addition of excess aqueous ammonia.After filtration, the precipitate was washed with deionized water until free of Cl -ions.The precipitate was dissolved by different amounts of concentrated HNO 3 .

Matejova et al. 20 prepared pure TiO 2 using a sol-gel method with the help of nonionic surfactant Triton X-114 C. Their results showed that the TiO 2 only existed as anatase after calcination at 500 C for 2 h.Zhao et al. 21 prepared TiO 2 using a different sol-gel method, and they found that the TiO 2 existed as both anatase and rutile phases after calcination at 500 C for 2 h. In addition, no peaks corresponding to Ce species were observed.Ce 4 ions in TiO 2 can exist in different types, which depend on the synthesis method and doping content of Ce 20,25.Matejova et al. 20 synthesized Ce doped TiO 2 by a sol-gel method.Their XRD results showed that no peaks corresponding to Ce species could be observed even with doping concentration up to 10 mol.They stated that when the doping content of Ce was smaller than 5 mol, Ce 4 ions could be doped into the lattice of TiO 2 , substituting the Ti 4 in anatase lattice.When more Ce (5-10 mol) was loaded, the TiO 2 lattice would be saturated by Ce 4 ions and rest of Ce existed as CeO 2 , either in amorphous phase or small nuclei.Fang et al. 25 prepared cerium doped TiO 2 using an acid catalyzed sol-gel method and their XRD results indicated that only anatase was formed below 0.5 wt. of Ce, and CeO 2 appeared above 0.5 wt. of Ce.Based on these facts and our results, we speculated that Ce 4 ions in our catalysts could exist in three types, including Ce 4 ions doped into the lattice of TiO 2 , amorphous CeO 2 phase or small CeO 2 nuclei.In general, doping Ce into TiO 2 lattice will lead to the expansion of anatase cell volume, because Ti 4 ions (0.68 A) can be substituted by Ce 4 ions (0.92 A) which have larger ionic radii 20.In our work, the cell parameters of all the samples were obtained from Rietveld refinement (summarized in Table 1).The cell volumes of the samples increased with the doping content of Ce, demonstrating that the occupation of anatase lattice by Ce 4 ions took place.The crystallite sizes of the samples were calculated using Scherrer's equation according to the (101) TiO 2 peak (Fig. 2B, Table 1).The average crystallite sizes of the samples decreased with the increase of Ce doping concentration, indicating that doping of Ce could inhibit the growth of TiO 2 crystal grain.This is in accordance with the result of ref. 25. Fig. 3 shows the FE-SEM, TEM and HR-TEM images of CT-1 catalyst.The FE-SEM (Fig. 3A) and TEM (Fig. 3B) figures show that CT-1 catalyst has spherical particles that distribute uniformly.The average particle size of the particles is ca.20 nm, which is consistent with the results of XRD.The HR-TEM figure (Fig. 3C) shows that TiO 2 in CT-1 exists in anatase phase, which is also in line with the results of XRD.No amorphous CeO 2 phase, but very small CeO 2 nanoparticles (2 nm) which can be CeO 2 nuclei were found in the HR-TEM figure.Combining the results of XRD, we could conclude that Ce 4 ions in CT catalysts existed in two forms, Ce 4 ions doped into the lattice of TiO 2 and small CeO 2 nuclei.N 2 adsorption-desorption was applied to explore the textual property of the prepared catalysts.surface area of 29.8 m 2 g -1 .The doping of a small content of Ce in TiO 2 remarkably increased the surface area to ca. 90 m 2 g -1 .Further increasing the Ce content to 3 increased the surface area to 121.3 m 2 g -1 .The increased surface area can be ascribed to the smaller TiO 2 particle size due to Ce doping, as evidenced in the results of XRD (Table 1) The chemical states of Ce, Ti, and O on the surface of the catalysts were analyzed by XPS (Fig. 4).The Ti 2p spectra of all the samples are shown in Fig. 4A.The binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 in different catalysts were about 464.5 and 458.7 eV, respectively.This indicated that Ti existed as Ti 4 but not Ti 3 over the CT catalysts, which agreed well with the values reported in the literature 252627.It could be also observed that the Ti 2p XPS peaks became broader after the addition of Ce, which was attributed to the heterogeneous environments of Ti 4 in CT catalysts 25. The Ce 3d spectra of CT catalysts are presented in Fig. 4B.XPS peaks denoted as u, u, u, and v, v, v were attributed to Ce 4 while u and v were assigned to Ce 3 , following the convention established by Burroughs et al. 28.Therefore, a mixture of Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states existed on the surface of CT catalysts, which was in good agreement with the studies of Fang et al. 25 and Gao et al. 29. Fig. 4C shows the O 1s spectra of the catalysts.The spectra are composed of three overlapping peaks.The peak of O A , with a binding energy of about 530.0 eV, contributes to the lattice oxygen in the metal oxides 25,30.Two shoulder peaks at the higher binding energy side are observed due to chemisorbed oxygen and/or weakly bonded oxygen species (O B ), and surface oxygen by hydroxyl species and/or adsorbed water species present as contaminants at the surface (O C ) 31,32.Based on the area integral of the three peaks, the ratio of O B to O T (O T O A O B O C ) for all samples was calculated as shown in Table 2.It is observed that the introduction of Ce species can effectively enhance the O B concentration on the surfaces of CT catalysts.This is because Ce 3 could create charge imbalance, vacancies, and unsaturated chemical bonds on the catalysts surface 30.These made the chemisorbed oxygen and/or weakly bonded oxygen species on the catalyst surface. The UV-vis absorbance spectra of pure TiO 2 and CT catalysts are shown in Fig. 5.The CT samples showed stronger visible light absorption compared with pure TiO 2 , and the intensity of the absorption enhanced with the increase of Ce doping content, which could be attributed to the photosensitizing effect of CeO 2 14,33. Fig. 6 shows the PL spectra of pure TiO 2 and CT catalysts.The PL spectra of the CT catalysts were basically the same as that of the pure TiO 2 , except lower fluorescence intensity.All the samples exhibited obvious PL signals at approximately 420 and 470 nm, respectively.The former one may result from the band-edge free exciton luminescence of TiO 2 34, while the other one may be the bound exciton luminescence caused by the surface defects of TiO 2 35.The intensity of fluorescence of CT nanoparticles first declined and then increased with the increase of doping content of Ce.The intensity of CT-1 was the lowest among all the samples.Fluorescence of semiconductor was caused by the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs and the intensity of fluorescence declined with the decrease in the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs 34.Therefore, the photoluminescence spectra revealed that proper doping of Ce could effectively reduce the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs, which was benefit for the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency. Three blank condition tests were conducted to obtain baselines: (1) with catalyst, but without UV light irradiation, (2) with UV light irradiation, but without catalyst and (3) with catalyst and UV light irradiation, but using N 2 as the feed gas instead of CO 2 .No hydrocarbon products were detected under these conditions.This indicated that light irradiation and catalyst were both necessary for the process of photocatalysis, and CO 2 was the only carbon source.The photocatalytic activities of CT-0.5, CT-1, CT-2, CT-3 and pure TiO 2 were evaluated in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under UV light irradiation.CH 3 OH and HCHO were recognized as the liquid products and CH 4 as the gaseous product.Other possible products such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, formic acid, and ethylene might also be formed, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration. Fig. 7 shows the yields of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 of CT catalysts with various Ce doping concentrations after UV light irradiation for 8 h.CH 3 OH was found to be the main product and CT samples exhibited Fig. 6.The photoluminescence spectra of the CT samples.much higher activity than pure TiO 2 sample and P25.CT-1 showed the highest photocatalytic activity with a maximum CH 3 OH yield of 188 mol/g, which was much higher than that of TiO 2 based catalyst in previous work 23, indicating that proper doping of Ce could improve the activity of TiO 2 catalyst effectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activities of CT catalysts can be ascribed to their unique structure with favorable properties.First, the introduction of Ce species increases the surface area of the catalyst, resulting in high absorption capacities to CO 2 and water.Second, XPS results show the existence of a mixture of Ce 3 and Ce 4 .Ce 3 can interact with holes 14 to generate Ce 4 and Ce 4 can capture electrons to be reduced to Ce 3 33.These reduced Ce 3 and oxidized Ce 4 species can subsequently transfer the charges to the species present in the reaction, so the electron-hole pairs are separated effectively, leading to a higher quantum efficiency of photocatalytic reaction.Finally, surface chemisorbed oxygen species enhanced by the addition of Ce species can easily capture electrons and produce surface oxygen species with strong reduction capability 14, inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and promoting the reduction of CO 2 . Among all the products, CH 3 OH was the main product and the yield of CH 4 was the lowest.This was in line with other studies that CH 3 OH and HCHO were the main products when the TiO 2 catalyst suspended in an aqueous phase 7,36 but CH 4 was one of the main products of CO 2 photoreduction with water vapor 10,20.The mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction is actually complex.Most researchers agree that this process is based on proton-assisted and multielectrontransfer instead of single electron transfer 37.The selective formation of CH 3 OH is owing to the compromise between charge transfer and thermodynamics.CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 are formed through these reactions 38: Based on the reduction potentials for the products, the order of yields should be CH 4 N CH 3 OH N HCHO in the case that the supply of protons and electrons is high enough 37.Nevertheless, the formation of HCHO needs four protons and four electrons while CH 4 formation needs eight protons and eight electrons.Considering that the NaHCO 3 solution is alkaline, the concentration of protons in it is relatively low, which is not advantageous to the formation of CH 4 10. The yields of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 of CT-1 versus irradiation time are shown in Fig. 8.The yields increased but the production rates decreased gradually with the increase of irradiation time, which could be ascribed to the saturation of the adsorption sites on the TiO 2 surface with intermediate products 39.To confirm the influence of product desorption, a regeneration experiment was done (Fig. 9).After CT-1 catalyst was under irradiation for 24 h, the concentration of hydrocarbons in the reactor no longer changed, indicating complete stoppage of the photoreduction (not shown here).Then the used CT-1 catalyst was collected by filtration and then washed by deionized water to remove the adsorbed products.The used catalyst was again put in the reactor to start the photocatalysis experiment after drying.The production of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 was again observed but at lower level than that of fresh catalyst.The result implied that the used CT-1 catalyst was partially regenerated after washing with water.The regeneration effect demonstrated that desorption of the products obviously affected the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. As temperature has an important influence on desorption of the reaction products, the photocatalytic activity of CT-1 catalyst under different temperatures was investigated (Fig. 10).The yields increased with the reaction temperature increased from 30 to 70 C.This can be well explained by the relationship between the temperature and desorption of reaction products, that is high reaction temperature is helpful for desorption of the intermediates 40, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity. The mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in liquid phase has been discussed elsewhere 414243.When the catalyst is under UV light irradiation, the photo-excited electrons can be captured by the carbonate species to form HCOOH intermediate, followed by further reduction to HCHO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 41,42.The details of the process can be described as follows.First, photo-excited electrons attack carbonate species to form formyloxyl radical: Then HCOO can continue to capture electrons to form formate ion, which is further protonated to produce HCOOH 43. Finally, HCOOH can be reduced to HCHO, CH 3 OH, and CH 4 ."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid (liquid phase)", "source": "The mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in liquid phase has been discussed elsewhere 414243.", "context": "3.1.Characteristics of the as-prepared catalysts 3.1.1.Structural and surface characteristics of the as-prepared catalysts The crystal structure of the catalysts was analyzed by XRD.Fig. 2A shows the XRD patterns of the Ce doped TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 catalysts.As shown, TiO 2 in all the samples existed as anatase and no peaks corresponding to rutile were observed, even in pure TiO 2 .In general, TiO 2 would transform from anatase into rutile after calcination for 2 h.Considering the literatures 20,21, it should be noticed that the transformation did not necessarily happen, which could be influenced by the preparation procedure.L.

Among all the products, CH 3 OH was the main product and the yield of CH 4 was the lowest.This was in line with other studies that CH 3 OH and HCHO were the main products when the TiO 2 catalyst suspended in an aqueous phase 7,36 but CH 4 was one of the main products of CO 2 photoreduction with water vapor 10,20.The mechanism of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction is actually complex.Most researchers agree that this process is based on proton-assisted and multielectrontransfer instead of single electron transfer 37.The selective formation of CH 3 OH is owing to the compromise between charge transfer and thermodynamics.CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 are formed through these reactions 38: Based on the reduction potentials for the products, the order of yields should be CH 4 N CH 3 OH N HCHO in the case that the supply of protons and electrons is high enough 37.Nevertheless, the formation of HCHO needs four protons and four electrons while CH 4 formation needs eight protons and eight electrons.Considering that the NaHCO 3 solution is alkaline, the concentration of protons in it is relatively low, which is not advantageous to the formation of CH 4 10. The yields of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 of CT-1 versus irradiation time are shown in Fig. 8.The yields increased but the production rates decreased gradually with the increase of irradiation time, which could be ascribed to the saturation of the adsorption sites on the TiO 2 surface with intermediate products 39.To confirm the influence of product desorption, a regeneration experiment was done (Fig. 9).After CT-1 catalyst was under irradiation for 24 h, the concentration of hydrocarbons in the reactor no longer changed, indicating complete stoppage of the photoreduction (not shown here).Then the used CT-1 catalyst was collected by filtration and then washed by deionized water to remove the adsorbed products.The used catalyst was again put in the reactor to start the photocatalysis experiment after drying.The production of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 was again observed but at lower level than that of fresh catalyst.The result implied that the used CT-1 catalyst was partially regenerated after washing with water.The regeneration effect demonstrated that desorption of the products obviously affected the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. As temperature has an important influence on desorption of the reaction products, the photocatalytic activity of CT-1 catalyst under different temperatures was investigated (Fig. 10).The yields increased with the reaction temperature increased from 30 to 70 C.This can be well explained by the relationship between the temperature and desorption of reaction products, that is high reaction temperature is helpful for desorption of the intermediates 40, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity. The mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in liquid phase has been discussed elsewhere 414243.When the catalyst is under UV light irradiation, the photo-excited electrons can be captured by the carbonate species to form HCOOH intermediate, followed by further reduction to HCHO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 41,42.The details of the process can be described as follows.First, photo-excited electrons attack carbonate species to form formyloxyl radical: Then HCOO can continue to capture electrons to form formate ion, which is further protonated to produce HCOOH 43. Finally, HCOOH can be reduced to HCHO, CH 3 OH, and CH 4 ."}, {"llm generation": "Gas (water vapor)", "source": "CH 3 OH and HCHO were the main products when the TiO 2 catalyst suspended in an aqueous phase 7,36 but CH 4 was one of the main products of CO 2 photoreduction with water vapor 10,20.", "context": "3.1.Characteristics of the as-prepared catalysts 3.1.1.Structural and surface characteristics of the as-prepared catalysts The crystal structure of the catalysts was analyzed by XRD.Fig. 2A shows the XRD patterns of the Ce doped TiO 2 and pure TiO 2 catalysts.As shown, TiO 2 in all the samples existed as anatase and no peaks corresponding to rutile were observed, even in pure TiO 2 .In general, TiO 2 would transform from anatase into rutile after calcination for 2 h.Considering the literatures 20,21, it should be noticed that the transformation did not necessarily happen, which could be influenced by the preparation procedure.L. Matejova et al. 20 prepared pure TiO 2 using a sol-gel method with the help of nonionic surfactant Triton X-114 C. Their results showed that the TiO 2 only existed as anatase after calcination at 500 C for 2 h.Zhao et al. 21 prepared TiO 2 using a different sol-gel method, and they found that the TiO 2 existed as both anatase and rutile phases after calcination at 500 C for 2 h. In addition, no peaks corresponding to Ce species were observed.Ce 4 ions in TiO 2 can exist in different types, which depend on the synthesis method and doping content of Ce 20,25.Matejova et al. 20 synthesized Ce doped TiO 2 by a sol-gel method.Their XRD results showed that no peaks corresponding to Ce species could be observed even with doping concentration up to 10 mol.They stated that when the doping content of Ce was smaller than 5 mol, Ce 4 ions could be doped into the lattice of TiO 2 , substituting the Ti 4 in anatase lattice.When more Ce (5-10 mol) was loaded, the TiO 2 lattice would be saturated by Ce 4 ions and rest of Ce existed as CeO 2 , either in amorphous phase or small nuclei.Fang et al. 25 prepared cerium doped TiO 2 using an acid catalyzed sol-gel method and their XRD results indicated that only anatase was formed below 0.5 wt. of Ce, and CeO 2 appeared above 0.5 wt. of Ce.Based on these facts and our results, we speculated that Ce 4 ions in our catalysts could exist in three types, including Ce 4 ions doped into the lattice of TiO 2 , amorphous CeO 2 phase or small CeO 2 nuclei.In general, doping Ce into TiO 2 lattice will lead to the expansion of anatase cell volume, because Ti 4 ions (0.68 A) can be substituted by Ce 4 ions (0.92 A) which have larger ionic radii 20.In our work, the cell parameters of all the samples were obtained from Rietveld refinement (summarized in Table 1).The cell volumes of the samples increased with the doping content of Ce, demonstrating that the occupation of anatase lattice by Ce 4 ions took place.The crystallite sizes of the samples were calculated using Scherrer's equation according to the (101) TiO 2 peak (Fig. 2B, Table 1).The average crystallite sizes of the samples decreased with the increase of Ce doping concentration, indicating that doping of Ce could inhibit the growth of TiO 2 crystal grain.This is in accordance with the result of ref. 25. Fig. 3 shows the FE-SEM, TEM and HR-TEM images of CT-1 catalyst.The FE-SEM (Fig. 3A) and TEM (Fig. 3B) figures show that CT-1 catalyst has spherical particles that distribute uniformly.The average particle size of the particles is ca.20 nm, which is consistent with the results of XRD.The HR-TEM figure (Fig. 3C) shows that TiO 2 in CT-1 exists in anatase phase, which is also in line with the results of XRD.No amorphous CeO 2 phase, but very small CeO 2 nanoparticles (2 nm) which can be CeO 2 nuclei were found in the HR-TEM figure.Combining the results of XRD, we could conclude that Ce 4 ions in CT catalysts existed in two forms, Ce 4 ions doped into the lattice of TiO 2 and small CeO 2 nuclei.N 2 adsorption-desorption was applied to explore the textual property of the prepared catalysts.surface area of 29.8 m 2 g -1 .The doping of a small content of Ce in TiO 2 remarkably increased the surface area to ca. 90 m 2 g -1 .Further increasing the Ce content to 3 increased the surface area to 121.3 m 2 g -1 .The increased surface area can be ascribed to the smaller TiO 2 particle size due to Ce doping, as evidenced in the results of XRD (Table 1) The chemical states of Ce, Ti, and O on the surface of the catalysts were analyzed by XPS (Fig. 4).The Ti 2p spectra of all the samples are shown in Fig. 4A.The binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 in different catalysts were about 464.5 and 458.7 eV, respectively.This indicated that Ti existed as Ti 4 but not Ti 3 over the CT catalysts, which agreed well with the values reported in the literature 252627.It could be also observed that the Ti 2p XPS peaks became broader after the addition of Ce, which was attributed to the heterogeneous environments of Ti 4 in CT catalysts 25. The Ce 3d spectra of CT catalysts are presented in Fig. 4B.XPS peaks denoted as u, u, u, and v, v, v were attributed to Ce 4 while u and v were assigned to Ce 3 , following the convention established by Burroughs et al. 28.Therefore, a mixture of Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation states existed on the surface of CT catalysts, which was in good agreement with the studies of Fang et al. 25 and Gao et al. 29. Fig. 4C shows the O 1s spectra of the catalysts.The spectra are composed of three overlapping peaks.The peak of O A , with a binding energy of about 530.0 eV, contributes to the lattice oxygen in the metal oxides 25,30.Two shoulder peaks at the higher binding energy side are observed due to chemisorbed oxygen and/or weakly bonded oxygen species (O B ), and surface oxygen by hydroxyl species and/or adsorbed water species present as contaminants at the surface (O C ) 31,32.Based on the area integral of the three peaks, the ratio of O B to O T (O T O A O B O C ) for all samples was calculated as shown in Table 2.It is observed that the introduction of Ce species can effectively enhance the O B concentration on the surfaces of CT catalysts.This is because Ce 3 could create charge imbalance, vacancies, and unsaturated chemical bonds on the catalysts surface 30.These made the chemisorbed oxygen and/or weakly bonded oxygen species on the catalyst surface. The UV-vis absorbance spectra of pure TiO 2 and CT catalysts are shown in Fig. 5.The CT samples showed stronger visible light absorption compared with pure TiO 2 , and the intensity of the absorption enhanced with the increase of Ce doping content, which could be attributed to the photosensitizing effect of CeO 2 14,33. Fig. 6 shows the PL spectra of pure TiO 2 and CT catalysts.The PL spectra of the CT catalysts were basically the same as that of the pure TiO 2 , except lower fluorescence intensity.All the samples exhibited obvious PL signals at approximately 420 and 470 nm, respectively.The former one may result from the band-edge free exciton luminescence of TiO 2 34, while the other one may be the bound exciton luminescence caused by the surface defects of TiO 2 35.The intensity of fluorescence of CT nanoparticles first declined and then increased with the increase of doping content of Ce.The intensity of CT-1 was the lowest among all the samples.Fluorescence of semiconductor was caused by the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs and the intensity of fluorescence declined with the decrease in the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs 34.Therefore, the photoluminescence spectra revealed that proper doping of Ce could effectively reduce the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs, which was benefit for the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency. Three blank condition tests were conducted to obtain baselines: (1) with catalyst, but without UV light irradiation, (2) with UV light irradiation, but without catalyst and (3) with catalyst and UV light irradiation, but using N 2 as the feed gas instead of CO 2 .No hydrocarbon products were detected under these conditions.This indicated that light irradiation and catalyst were both necessary for the process of photocatalysis, and CO 2 was the only carbon source.The photocatalytic activities of CT-0.5, CT-1, CT-2, CT-3 and pure TiO 2 were evaluated in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under UV light irradiation.CH 3 OH and HCHO were recognized as the liquid products and CH 4 as the gaseous product.Other possible products such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, formic acid, and ethylene might also be formed, but they were undetectable in our GC configuration. Fig. 7 shows the yields of CH 3 OH, HCHO, and CH 4 of CT catalysts with various Ce doping concentrations after UV light irradiation for 8 h.CH 3 OH was found to be the main product and CT samples exhibited Fig. 6.The photoluminescence spectra of the CT samples.much higher activity than pure TiO 2 sample and P25.CT-1 showed the highest photocatalytic activity with a maximum CH 3 OH yield of 188 mol/g, which was much higher than that of TiO 2 based catalyst in previous work 23, indicating that proper doping of Ce could improve the activity of TiO 2 catalyst effectively.
