Ordered cubic mesoporous silica KIT-6 template was synthesized as the reported procedure except enlarging the amount by ten times 14.Mesoporous g-C 3 N 4 was synthesized by the simple chemical vapor deposition method using melamine as the precursor.In a typical synthesis, 6.0 g of melamine powder was placed in the bottom of the alumina crucible (50 mL), then 2.0 g of KIT-6 template was homogeneously dispersed on the surface of melamine.This crucible with a cover was first heat treatmented at 320 1C for 4 h in the muffle furnace with a heating rate of 10 K/ min, during this process, the melamine will be evaporated and deposited in the mesoporous channels of the KIT-6 template, then the temperature was increased to 550 1C for 3 h with a heating ramp of 2 K/min to form g-C 3 N 4 .After that, the upper layer of g-C 3 N 4 /silica composite was treated with an aqueous solution hydrofluoric acid to remove the silica template.The obtained ordered cubic mesoporous g-C 3 N 4 was denoted as Meso-g-C 3 N 4 .For comparison, a flake-like g-C 3 N 4 was synthesized by the direct pyrolysis of melamine at 550 1C according to the literature 15.

The photocatalytic activity of the Meso-g-C 3 N 4 was evaluated by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under UV light.Typically, catalyst powder (0.1 g) was dispersed on the stainless omentum which was fixed in the center of reactor.Prior to illumination, the reactor was vacuumed and purged with the CO 2 H 2 O mixture at about 20 mL/min for 2 h to establish an adsorption-desorption balance.After that, the reactor was tightly closed and the Hg lamp was then switched on to start the experiment.The distance between the substrate and Hg lamp was 15 cm, the reaction temperature and pressure were maintained at 30 1C and 110 kPa, respectively.The gas phase products were taken at various time during the irradiation and analyzed by gas chromatography."}, {"llm generation": "Meso-g-C 3 N 4, flake-like g-C 3 N 4", "source": "Herein, Meso-g-C 3 N 4 and flake-like g-C 3 N 4 were tested for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.", "context": "The low-angle XRD pattern in Fig. 1a shows two diffraction peaks in the range of 214 0.5-1.51corresponding to (1 1 0) and (2 1 0) reflections of the 3D cubic (I4 1 32) symmetry 16, indicating that the obtained g-C 3 N 4 kept the cubic mesoporous structure after the removal of the silica template, which was further confirmed by the TEM analysis as shown in Fig. 1b.The wideangle XRD pattern of Meso-g-C 3 N 4 given in the inset of Fig. 1a exhibits two distinct characteristic diffraction peaks at around 13.2 and 27.31, which can be respectively indexed to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) reflections of typical graphitic carbon nitride 16. Fig. 2a gives the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm and corresponding pore size distribution curve of the Meso-g-C 3 N 4 sample.The isotherm exhibits a type-IV curve with an H 2 hysteresis loop at P/P 0 of 0.4-0.9, which is a characteristic of mesoporous non-siliceous materials prepared by the hard template method 17.The pore size distribution curve (Fig. 2a inset) shows a uniform mesopore with a pore size of about 3.5 nm, which is consistent with the result of high resolution TEM image (Fig. 1b inset).Furthermore, this Meso-g-C 3 N 4 has a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 129.8 m 2 g A 1 and a relative large pore volume of 0.157 cm 3 g A 1 , which are much higher than that of flake-like g-C 3 N 4 obtained by the direct pyrolysis of melamine at 550 1C 15. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the Meso-g-C 3 N 4 and flake-like g-C 3 N 4 in the range of 300-700 nm was examined and the results are shown in Fig. 2b.Compared to flake-like g-C 3 N 4 , it is apparent that the Meso-g-C 3 N 4 has an enhanced absorption between 350 and 700 nm in the UV-vis spectra.In addition, the optical band gap energy of the Meso-g-C 3 N 4 (2.79 eV) displays a slight red-shift with respect to that of flakelike g-C 3 N 4 (2.82 eV) (Fig. 2b inset), which are consistent with the DRS result.The improved characteristics for the Meso-g-C 3 N 4 may be ascribed to its ordered mesoporous structure, enlarged surface area and multiple scatting enable it to harvest light more efficiently 18,19.One of the promising applications of graphitic carbon nitrides is that they can function as photocatalysts for environmental and energy applications.Herein, Meso-g-C 3 N 4 and flake-like g-C 3 N 4 were tested for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O. Fig. 3 shows the evolution of CO as a function of irradiation time over two catalysts.From the curves, it is found that the yield of CO is increased with the irradiation time for both catalysts, and the Meso-g-C 3 N 4 exhibits much higher activity than flake-like g-C 3 N 4 .After 7 h of irradiation, the yield of CO on the Meso-g-C 3 N 4 is up to 3.48 mmol g A 1 cat.The excellent photocatalytic activity of the Meso-g-C 3 N 4 sample can be attributed to its unique 3D open-pore system which facilitates the reactant diffusion into the bulk of catalyst and hence provide fast intraparticle molecular transfer.Meanwhile, the high surface area can enhance the light harvesting as well as the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules."}, {"llm generation": "mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride", "source": "Because of these characteristics, the obtained mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.", "context": "Ordered mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride was successfully synthesized by a simple chemical vapor deposition method using melamine as the precursor.XRD, nitrogen sorption and TEM results reveal that the obtained graphitic carbon nitride possesses an ordered 3D cubic mesostructure with high surface area and uniform pore size.Also an enhanced light absorption and a slight red-shift phenomenon are observed from UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra when compared with flake-like g-C 3 N 4 .Because of these characteristics, the obtained mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity in the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.
