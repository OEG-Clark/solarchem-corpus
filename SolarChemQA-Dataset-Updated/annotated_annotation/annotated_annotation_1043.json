Ltd. (Shanghai, China) provided the commercial 40 hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution and tetrabutyl titanate.All experimental chemicals fall into the analytical class. The preparation of PHL refers to the previously reported method.(Leschinnsky et al., 2009;Shi et al., 2011;Shen et al., 2011;Li et al., 2019).The poplar wood chips were pretreated in a horizontal temperature-controlled digester (No. 2611, KRK company, Tokyo, Japan).The poplar wood chips were mixed with deionized water at 1:6 ratio of solid to liquid (w/v).The pretreatment conditions were 170 C and retention 60 min with the heating rate approximately 2.5 C/min.After pretreatment, cool the digester to room temperature by cold water.Then filtration with a 200-mesh slurry bag, the pre-hydrolysate was stored in refrigerator at 4 C before later use or analysis. The synthesizing process of TiO 2 nanosheets was that 3 mL of HF solution and 25 mL of tetrabutyl titanate were well mixed by stirring for 30 min (Yu et al., 2014).The mixture was taken out from the autoclave, and then synthesized at 200 C for 24 h in an oven.After cooling down, the TiO 2 sample was removed from autoclave, filtered and washed with water and ethanol in squence, and then dried at 60 C before being used for the experiments. The preparation process of composite catalyst of C/TiO 2 indicated below: 1 mL, 2 mL, 3 mL and 4 mL of hydrolysate were respectively diluted to 20 mL, then mixed with 0.3 g of TiO 2 under vigorous stirring for 2 h.The mixture samples were filtered and placed in tube furnace and calcined with argon gas at 500 C for 3 h.Subsequently, the samples were collected and marked as C/TiO 2 -1, C/TiO 2 -2, C/TiO 2 -3, and C/ TiO 2 -4 sample based on hydrolysate dosage for analysis and detection in subsequent experiments. The sugars in PHL were determinated with an ion chromatography (Dionex ICS-5000 DC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) with a CarboPac PA10 column, EC detector.5-Hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF), furfural and acetic acid in PHL were analyzed using HPLC (LC-20CE, Shimadzu Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with a Diamonsil C18 (2) column, UV-vis detector (Snelders et al., 2014).The BET surface areas of the samples were determined by a Kubo 1000 analyzer.FTIR with a spectrometer (ALPHA-T, Bruker, Germany) was employed for analyzing the groups of lignin or TiO 2 samples.The element contents of samples were evaluated via the element analyzer (Vario EL, Elementar, Germany).The samples crystallinity was analyzed by an X-ray diffraction (SmartLabSE, Rigaku, Japan) equipped with Cu KX-ray radiation.Raman spectra of samples were recorded on a laser confocal Raman Spectrometer (inVia, RENISHAW, England) under the wavelength of 532 nm.The surface morphologies of samples were analyzed by SEM (Regulus 8220, Hitachi, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 5.0 kV.The morphology of samples was obtained by TEM (JEM 2100, Japan) with a copper network for placing samples.To analyze the optical performance, the ultraviolet absorbability of all samples was detected by a UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan), and a BaSO 4 integrating sphere was used as a reference.The CO 2 adsorption and desorption measurements of samples by using a Kubo 1000 analyzer under high purity CO 2 gas environment.The spectra of phot-luminescence (PL) recorded via a fluorospectro photometer (F-7100, Hitachi, Japan) under the excitation wavelength of 320 nm. The photoconversion process of CO 2 was examined under the irradiation of ultraviolet-visible light (UV-vis) from a 300 W PLT-SXE300 xenon lamp.Firstly, 0.1 g sample and 100 mL H 2 O were mixed and stirred for 15 min in a quartz reactor.Then, the gaseous CO 2 (99.99 ) was pumped into the quartz reactor for 15 min at temperature of 15 C. Afterwards, sealed the reactor and switched on the xenon lamp.Within set period of time, the gas was sampled with a microsampler, and then monitored by a gaschromatograph (GC-7920, Beijing, China) carried with a FID detector and Propark Q column."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2", "source": "We verified that part of the dissolved lignin in the PHL was adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2 in the process: about 19.50 of the dissolved lignin and 2.80 of the total dissolved xylose and xylan were adsorbed onto the TiO 2 surface.", "context": "Pre-hydrolysis is a separated process of hemicellulose and lignin from the raw materials through a hydrothermal pretreatment method (Guo et al., 2020).PHL was collected from the liquid after pre-hydrolysis.The dissolved organic component of the PHL were shown in Table 1.Xylose and xylan were the main sugars in PHL, which derives from the degradation of hemicellulose, and their concentration were 2.98 g/L and 10.23 g/L, respectively.In addition, lignin, as the main by-product of the pre-hydrolysis process, had a concentration 5.27 g/L in the PHL, which was not conducive to the separation of sugars.Moreover, the concentration of acetic acid was 2.55 g/L, which derived from the removal of acetyl groups on the side chains from the hemicellulose (Zhang et al., 2010).Furfural (0.99 g/L) and 5-HMF (0.06 g/L) were mainly attributed to the degradation of pentose and hexose (Yemis and Mazza, 2011). The scheme of the synthesis process for lignin carbon quantum dots was shown in Fig. 1.We verified that part of the dissolved lignin in the PHL was adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2 in the process: about 19.50 of the dissolved lignin and 2.80 of the total dissolved xylose and xylan were adsorbed onto the TiO 2 surface.Fig. 1 indicated that the C/TiO 2 -X samples possessed a darker color compared to pristine TiO 2 .Subsequently, Fig. S1 provides the N 2 -adsorption isotherm of C/TiO 2 -3 and pristine TiO 2 .The surface area of original TiO 2 and C/TiO 2 -3 were 50.49m 2 /g and 21.89 m 2 /g, respectively.Typical functional groups of these two samples (C/TiO 2 -3 and original TiO 2 ) were detected by FTIR (Fig. S2).It was clearly observed that the unique Ti-O-Ti stretching vibrations of TiO 2 ranged from 700 cm -1 to 500 cm -1 (Sarteep et al., 2016;Bae and Choi, 2003).The stretching vibrations at 3426 and 1625 cm -1 assigned to OHbond.While the peaks observed at 1331 cm -1 showed the C-H or CO-bond derived from syringyl lignin patterns (Zhou et al., 2020).It may be concluded that lignin in PHL was absorbed on TiO 2 surface.The high temperature treatment resulted in a lower element carbon content of 0.99 , which was due to the degradation of lignin to generate gas or volatile products during the high-temperature pyrolysis process (Brebu and Vasile, 2010;Faravelli et al., 2010).implying that the diffraction peaks of C-TiO 2 samples have no obvious changes in terms of primary titanium dioxide.Fig. 2b indicated that the unique anatase Raman bands were presented in original TiO 2 and C/ TiO 2 Raman spectra.The peaks in various modes of the anatase phase of TiO 2 were given as follows: 142 cm -1 corresponding to E g , 195 cm -1 corresponding to E g , 395 cm -1 corresponding to B 1g , 513 cm -1 corresponding to A 1g and 639 cm -1 corresponding to Eg (Jiang et al., 2019;Chen et al., 2011;Pan et al., 2013;Jiang et al., 2017).The above results indicated the introduction of carbon quantum dots has no influence on the crystalline structures of TiO 2 . Subsequently, the morphologies of the as-prepared samples were investigated via TEM and SEM.3a, b, c andd, which indicated C/TiO 2 composite maintained the morphology of primary TiO 2 nanosheet.In addition, Fig. 4 provides the TEM pictures of pristine TiO 2 and C/TiO 2 -3.As described in Fig. 4, the sizes of pristine TiO 2 and C/TiO 2 -3 sample have no obvious change.Fig. 4a exhibits the length and width of TiO 2 nanosheets were 100 nm and 50 nm, respectively.Fig. 4b indicates that the lattice spacing of the nanosheet is ca.0.349 nm, agreeing with the 101 plane D-spacing of anatase titanium dioxide (0.351 nm).As can be seen from Fig. 4c-d, many C dots were uniformly distributed on TiO 2 surface with a size of about 3 nm.Fig. S3 shows the results obtained from the TEM images of the C/TiO 2 -3 sample after three photocatalytic cycles.It was clearly observed that the lignin-based carbon quantum dots were still uniformly fixed on the TiO 2 nanosheets, indicating C/TiO 2 -3 photocatalysts were very stable. Correspondingly, the optical properties of samples were analyzed via UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 5a).Compared to original TiO 2 , the C/TiO 2 -X samples show obvious absorbance red shift, indicating that the introduction of lignin-derived carbon quantum dots has leaded to the variation of TiO 2 absorption behavior.PL spectra was used to investigate photo-generated holes and electrons recombination rate, and the result was exhibited in Fig. 5b.As shown in this PL spectrum, the main emission peak position of C/TiO 2 -3 is located at about 403 nm, which is similar with the pristine TiO 2 sample.In addition, It can be seen that the emission intensity of C/TiO 2 -3 decreased, exhibiting a lower recombination rate than pristine TiO 2 sample.This result implies that C/TiO 2 -X can exhibit better photocatalytic activity compared to pristine TiO 2 . The CO 2 adsorption isotherms of pristine TiO 2 and C/TiO 2 -3 were performed under ambient conditions (298 K) and the analyzing results were provided in Fig. 6.Fig. 6 indicates that the CO 2 adsorption capacities of C/TiO 2 -3 were higher than pristine TiO 2 .Among them, C/ TiO 2 -3 capacity was about 1.4 times as much as the original TiO 2 , which showed best performance.Conclusively, lignin-based carbon quantum dots can improve TiO 2 capacity of CO 2 adsorption. The conductivities of C/TiO 2 -X composite were analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).As shown in Fig. 7a, this result suggests that the radius of the C/TiO 2 -3 sample was much smaller than the pristine TiO 2 sample, which is beneficial to photocatalytic activity.The photocurrent of the C/TiO 2 -3 and pristine TiO 2 samples were tested in a 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 solution by using a 300 W xenon lamp and shown in Fig. 7b.As can be seen the photocurrent intensity of the pristine TiO 2 was much lower than C/TiO 2 -3, indicating the C/TiO 2 -3 sample exhibited higher carrier separation efficiency.Fig. 7c shows the C/TiO 2 -X activities of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under UV-vis light irradiation.Primary TiO 2 was also tested under same conditions for comparing.It was observed that C/TiO 2 -3 sample exhibited much better activity of CO 2 reduction than TiO 2 .After 4 h of irradiation, the CO 2 reduction activity of the C/TiO 2 -3 sample was about three times compared to primary TiO 2 .In addition, we have performed cyclic photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments of the C/TiO 2 -3 sample to verify the recyclability and stability of composite.The result was shown in Fig. 7d.It can be seen that C/TiO 2 -3 sample exhibited relatively stable cyclic performance. According to the above experimental results, we proposed a possible reaction mechanism of C/TiO 2 -3 composites to enhance the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction, which were shown in Fig. 8. TiO 2 generates electrons and holes under the UV-vis irradiation, and then the e-flowed to the surface of lignin-based carbon quantum, thereby reducing the CO 2 to CO gas.The lignin-based carbon quantum dots made the photogenerated electrons and holes realize the effective spatial separation, and the left h oxidized the H 2 O to produce O 2 .In addition, it improved the CO 2 adsorption capacity, obtaining more CO 2 molecule to be transferred into CO gas."}, {"llm generation": "semiconductor photocatalysts", "source": "The reasonable utilization of lignin in poplar pre-hydrolysis liquor (PHL) derived from pulp and paper industry was achieved via combining the biomass with semiconductor photocatalysts.", "context": "The reasonable utilization of lignin in poplar pre-hydrolysis liquor (PHL) derived from pulp and paper industry was achieved via combining the biomass with semiconductor photocatalysts.The result indicated that 19.50 of the dissolved lignin and 2.80 of the total dissolved xylose and xylan were adsorbed onto the TiO 2 surface.Lignin of PHL was transferred into carbon quantum dots, immobilized on TiO 2 nanosheets, which improved both the separation efficiency of photogenerated carrier and CO 2 adsorption capacity of TiO 2 nanosheets.The lignin carbon quantum dots immobilized on TiO 2 nanosheets increased the efficiency of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of the TiO 2 nanosheets by 300 .

The scheme of the synthesis process for lignin carbon quantum dots was shown in Fig. 1.We verified that part of the dissolved lignin in the PHL was adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2 in the process: about 19.50 of the dissolved lignin and 2.80 of the total dissolved xylose and xylan were adsorbed onto the TiO 2 surface.Fig. 1 indicated that the C/TiO 2 -X samples possessed a darker color compared to pristine TiO 2 .Subsequently, Fig. S1 provides the N 2 -adsorption isotherm of C/TiO 2 -3 and pristine TiO 2 .The surface area of original TiO 2 and C/TiO 2 -3 were 50.49m 2 /g and 21.89 m 2 /g, respectively.Typical functional groups of these two samples (C/TiO 2 -3 and original TiO 2 ) were detected by FTIR (Fig. S2).It was clearly observed that the unique Ti-O-Ti stretching vibrations of TiO 2 ranged from 700 cm -1 to 500 cm -1 (Sarteep et al., 2016;Bae and Choi, 2003).The stretching vibrations at 3426 and 1625 cm -1 assigned to OHbond.While the peaks observed at 1331 cm -1 showed the C-H or CO-bond derived from syringyl lignin patterns (Zhou et al., 2020).It may be concluded that lignin in PHL was absorbed on TiO 2 surface.The high temperature treatment resulted in a lower element carbon content of 0.99 , which was due to the degradation of lignin to generate gas or volatile products during the high-temperature pyrolysis process (Brebu and Vasile, 2010;Faravelli et al., 2010).implying that the diffraction peaks of C-TiO 2 samples have no obvious changes in terms of primary titanium dioxide.Fig. 2b indicated that the unique anatase Raman bands were presented in original TiO 2 and C/ TiO 2 Raman spectra.The peaks in various modes of the anatase phase of TiO 2 were given as follows: 142 cm -1 corresponding to E g , 195 cm -1 corresponding to E g , 395 cm -1 corresponding to B 1g , 513 cm -1 corresponding to A 1g and 639 cm -1 corresponding to Eg (Jiang et al., 2019;Chen et al., 2011;Pan et al., 2013;Jiang et al., 2017).The above results indicated the introduction of carbon quantum dots has no influence on the crystalline structures of TiO 2 . Subsequently, the morphologies of the as-prepared samples were investigated via TEM and SEM.3a, b, c andd, which indicated C/TiO 2 composite maintained the morphology of primary TiO 2 nanosheet.In addition, Fig. 4 provides the TEM pictures of pristine TiO 2 and C/TiO 2 -3.As described in Fig. 4, the sizes of pristine TiO 2 and C/TiO 2 -3 sample have no obvious change.Fig. 4a exhibits the length and width of TiO 2 nanosheets were 100 nm and 50 nm, respectively.Fig. 4b indicates that the lattice spacing of the nanosheet is ca.0.349 nm, agreeing with the 101 plane D-spacing of anatase titanium dioxide (0.351 nm).As can be seen from Fig. 4c-d, many C dots were uniformly distributed on TiO 2 surface with a size of about 3 nm.Fig. S3 shows the results obtained from the TEM images of the C/TiO 2 -3 sample after three photocatalytic cycles.It was clearly observed that the lignin-based carbon quantum dots were still uniformly fixed on the TiO 2 nanosheets, indicating C/TiO 2 -3 photocatalysts were very stable. Correspondingly, the optical properties of samples were analyzed via UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 5a).Compared to original TiO 2 , the C/TiO 2 -X samples show obvious absorbance red shift, indicating that the introduction of lignin-derived carbon quantum dots has leaded to the variation of TiO 2 absorption behavior.PL spectra was used to investigate photo-generated holes and electrons recombination rate, and the result was exhibited in Fig. 5b.As shown in this PL spectrum, the main emission peak position of C/TiO 2 -3 is located at about 403 nm, which is similar with the pristine TiO 2 sample.In addition, It can be seen that the emission intensity of C/TiO 2 -3 decreased, exhibiting a lower recombination rate than pristine TiO 2 sample.This result implies that C/TiO 2 -X can exhibit better photocatalytic activity compared to pristine TiO 2 . The CO 2 adsorption isotherms of pristine TiO 2 and C/TiO 2 -3 were performed under ambient conditions (298 K) and the analyzing results were provided in Fig. 6.Fig. 6 indicates that the CO 2 adsorption capacities of C/TiO 2 -3 were higher than pristine TiO 2 .Among them, C/ TiO 2 -3 capacity was about 1.4 times as much as the original TiO 2 , which showed best performance.Conclusively, lignin-based carbon quantum dots can improve TiO 2 capacity of CO 2 adsorption. The conductivities of C/TiO 2 -X composite were analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).As shown in Fig. 7a, this result suggests that the radius of the C/TiO 2 -3 sample was much smaller than the pristine TiO 2 sample, which is beneficial to photocatalytic activity.The photocurrent of the C/TiO 2 -3 and pristine TiO 2 samples were tested in a 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 solution by using a 300 W xenon lamp and shown in Fig. 7b.As can be seen the photocurrent intensity of the pristine TiO 2 was much lower than C/TiO 2 -3, indicating the C/TiO 2 -3 sample exhibited higher carrier separation efficiency.Fig. 7c shows the C/TiO 2 -X activities of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under UV-vis light irradiation.Primary TiO 2 was also tested under same conditions for comparing.It was observed that C/TiO 2 -3 sample exhibited much better activity of CO 2 reduction than TiO 2 .After 4 h of irradiation, the CO 2 reduction activity of the C/TiO 2 -3 sample was about three times compared to primary TiO 2 .In addition, we have performed cyclic photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments of the C/TiO 2 -3 sample to verify the recyclability and stability of composite.The result was shown in Fig. 7d.It can be seen that C/TiO 2 -3 sample exhibited relatively stable cyclic performance. According to the above experimental results, we proposed a possible reaction mechanism of C/TiO 2 -3 composites to enhance the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction, which were shown in Fig. 8. TiO 2 generates electrons and holes under the UV-vis irradiation, and then the e-flowed to the surface of lignin-based carbon quantum, thereby reducing the CO 2 to CO gas.The lignin-based carbon quantum dots made the photogenerated electrons and holes realize the effective spatial separation, and the left h oxidized the H 2 O to produce O 2 .In addition, it improved the CO 2 adsorption capacity, obtaining more CO 2 molecule to be transferred into CO gas."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Reasonable utilization of lignin in pre-hydrolysis liquor (PHL) is very important for the economic benefit of papermaking industry.", "context": "Reasonable utilization of lignin in pre-hydrolysis liquor (PHL) is very important for the economic benefit of papermaking industry.In this paper, lignin in poplar pre-hydrolysis liquor (PHL) was effectively adsorbed by TiO 2 nanosheets, realizing the purification of PHL.Subsequently, lignin was carbonized via thermal desorption for forming the carbon quantum dots immobilized on TiO 2 nanosheets surface, which can improve both the separation efficiency of photogenerated carrier and CO 2 adsorption capacity of TiO 2 , as a result the efficiency of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of C/TiO 2 increased 300 compared to the TiO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Firstly, 0.1 g sample and 100 mL H 2 O were mixed and stirred for 15 min in a quartz reactor.", "context": "Poplar wood chips were taken from a papermaking factory located in the east of China.Poplar chips for experiment were first screened and washed, and then kept in a polypropylene ziplock bag to balance moisture for use.Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.

The sugars in PHL were determinated with an ion chromatography (Dionex ICS-5000 DC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) with a CarboPac PA10 column, EC detector.5-Hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF), furfural and acetic acid in PHL were analyzed using HPLC (LC-20CE, Shimadzu Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with a Diamonsil C18 (2) column, UV-vis detector (Snelders et al., 2014).The BET surface areas of the samples were determined by a Kubo 1000 analyzer.FTIR with a spectrometer (ALPHA-T, Bruker, Germany) was employed for analyzing the groups of lignin or TiO 2 samples.The element contents of samples were evaluated via the element analyzer (Vario EL, Elementar, Germany).The samples crystallinity was analyzed by an X-ray diffraction (SmartLabSE, Rigaku, Japan) equipped with Cu KX-ray radiation.Raman spectra of samples were recorded on a laser confocal Raman Spectrometer (inVia, RENISHAW, England) under the wavelength of 532 nm.The surface morphologies of samples were analyzed by SEM (Regulus 8220, Hitachi, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 5.0 kV.The morphology of samples was obtained by TEM (JEM 2100, Japan) with a copper network for placing samples.To analyze the optical performance, the ultraviolet absorbability of all samples was detected by a UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan), and a BaSO 4 integrating sphere was used as a reference.The CO 2 adsorption and desorption measurements of samples by using a Kubo 1000 analyzer under high purity CO 2 gas environment.The spectra of phot-luminescence (PL) recorded via a fluorospectro photometer (F-7100, Hitachi, Japan) under the excitation wavelength of 320 nm. The photoconversion process of CO 2 was examined under the irradiation of ultraviolet-visible light (UV-vis) from a 300 W PLT-SXE300 xenon lamp.Firstly, 0.1 g sample and 100 mL H 2 O were mixed and stirred for 15 min in a quartz reactor.Then, the gaseous CO 2 (99.99 ) was pumped into the quartz reactor for 15 min at temperature of 15 C. Afterwards, sealed the reactor and switched on the xenon lamp.Within set period of time, the gas was sampled with a microsampler, and then monitored by a gaschromatograph (GC-7920, Beijing, China) carried with a FID detector and Propark Q column."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The photocurrent of the C/TiO 2 -3 and pristine TiO 2 samples were tested in a 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 solution by using a 300 W xenon lamp and shown in Fig. 7b.", "context": "Pre-hydrolysis is a separated process of hemicellulose and lignin from the raw materials through a hydrothermal pretreatment method (Guo et al., 2020).PHL was collected from the liquid after pre-hydrolysis.The dissolved organic component of the PHL were shown in Table 1.Xylose and xylan were the main sugars in PHL, which derives from the degradation of hemicellulose, and their concentration were 2.98 g/L and 10.23 g/L, respectively.In addition, lignin, as the main by-product of the pre-hydrolysis process, had a concentration 5.27 g/L in the PHL, which was not conducive to the separation of sugars.Moreover, the concentration of acetic acid was 2.55 g/L, which derived from the removal of acetyl groups on the side chains from the hemicellulose (Zhang et al., 2010).Furfural (0.99 g/L) and 5-HMF (0.06 g/L) were mainly attributed to the degradation of pentose and hexose (Yemis and Mazza, 2011). The scheme of the synthesis process for lignin carbon quantum dots was shown in Fig. 1.We verified that part of the dissolved lignin in the PHL was adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2 in the process: about 19.50 of the dissolved lignin and 2.80 of the total dissolved xylose and xylan were adsorbed onto the TiO 2 surface.Fig. 1 indicated that the C/TiO 2 -X samples possessed a darker color compared to pristine TiO 2 .Subsequently, Fig. S1 provides the N 2 -adsorption isotherm of C/TiO 2 -3 and pristine TiO 2 .The surface area of original TiO 2 and C/TiO 2 -3 were 50.49m 2 /g and 21.89 m 2 /g, respectively.Typical functional groups of these two samples (C/TiO 2 -3 and original TiO 2 ) were detected by FTIR (Fig. S2).It was clearly observed that the unique Ti-O-Ti stretching vibrations of TiO 2 ranged from 700 cm -1 to 500 cm -1 (Sarteep et al., 2016;Bae and Choi, 2003).The stretching vibrations at 3426 and 1625 cm -1 assigned to OHbond.While the peaks observed at 1331 cm -1 showed the C-H or CO-bond derived from syringyl lignin patterns (Zhou et al., 2020).It may be concluded that lignin in PHL was absorbed on TiO 2 surface.The high temperature treatment resulted in a lower element carbon content of 0.99 , which was due to the degradation of lignin to generate gas or volatile products during the high-temperature pyrolysis process (Brebu and Vasile, 2010;Faravelli et al., 2010).implying that the diffraction peaks of C-TiO 2 samples have no obvious changes in terms of primary titanium dioxide.Fig. 2b indicated that the unique anatase Raman bands were presented in original TiO 2 and C/ TiO 2 Raman spectra.The peaks in various modes of the anatase phase of TiO 2 were given as follows: 142 cm -1 corresponding to E g , 195 cm -1 corresponding to E g , 395 cm -1 corresponding to B 1g , 513 cm -1 corresponding to A 1g and 639 cm -1 corresponding to Eg (Jiang et al., 2019;Chen et al., 2011;Pan et al., 2013;Jiang et al., 2017).The above results indicated the introduction of carbon quantum dots has no influence on the crystalline structures of TiO 2 . Subsequently, the morphologies of the as-prepared samples were investigated via TEM and SEM.3a, b, c andd, which indicated C/TiO 2 composite maintained the morphology of primary TiO 2 nanosheet.In addition, Fig. 4 provides the TEM pictures of pristine TiO 2 and C/TiO 2 -3.As described in Fig. 4, the sizes of pristine TiO 2 and C/TiO 2 -3 sample have no obvious change.Fig. 4a exhibits the length and width of TiO 2 nanosheets were 100 nm and 50 nm, respectively.Fig. 4b indicates that the lattice spacing of the nanosheet is ca.0.349 nm, agreeing with the 101 plane D-spacing of anatase titanium dioxide (0.351 nm).As can be seen from Fig. 4c-d, many C dots were uniformly distributed on TiO 2 surface with a size of about 3 nm.Fig. S3 shows the results obtained from the TEM images of the C/TiO 2 -3 sample after three photocatalytic cycles.It was clearly observed that the lignin-based carbon quantum dots were still uniformly fixed on the TiO 2 nanosheets, indicating C/TiO 2 -3 photocatalysts were very stable. Correspondingly, the optical properties of samples were analyzed via UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 5a).Compared to original TiO 2 , the C/TiO 2 -X samples show obvious absorbance red shift, indicating that the introduction of lignin-derived carbon quantum dots has leaded to the variation of TiO 2 absorption behavior.PL spectra was used to investigate photo-generated holes and electrons recombination rate, and the result was exhibited in Fig. 5b.As shown in this PL spectrum, the main emission peak position of C/TiO 2 -3 is located at about 403 nm, which is similar with the pristine TiO 2 sample.In addition, It can be seen that the emission intensity of C/TiO 2 -3 decreased, exhibiting a lower recombination rate than pristine TiO 2 sample.This result implies that C/TiO 2 -X can exhibit better photocatalytic activity compared to pristine TiO 2 . The CO 2 adsorption isotherms of pristine TiO 2 and C/TiO 2 -3 were performed under ambient conditions (298 K) and the analyzing results were provided in Fig. 6.Fig. 6 indicates that the CO 2 adsorption capacities of C/TiO 2 -3 were higher than pristine TiO 2 .Among them, C/ TiO 2 -3 capacity was about 1.4 times as much as the original TiO 2 , which showed best performance.Conclusively, lignin-based carbon quantum dots can improve TiO 2 capacity of CO 2 adsorption. The conductivities of C/TiO 2 -X composite were analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).As shown in Fig. 7a, this result suggests that the radius of the C/TiO 2 -3 sample was much smaller than the pristine TiO 2 sample, which is beneficial to photocatalytic activity.The photocurrent of the C/TiO 2 -3 and pristine TiO 2 samples were tested in a 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 solution by using a 300 W xenon lamp and shown in Fig. 7b.As can be seen the photocurrent intensity of the pristine TiO 2 was much lower than C/TiO 2 -3, indicating the C/TiO 2 -3 sample exhibited higher carrier separation efficiency.Fig. 7c shows the C/TiO 2 -X activities of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under UV-vis light irradiation.Primary TiO 2 was also tested under same conditions for comparing.It was observed that C/TiO 2 -3 sample exhibited much better activity of CO 2 reduction than TiO 2 .After 4 h of irradiation, the CO 2 reduction activity of the C/TiO 2 -3 sample was about three times compared to primary TiO 2 .In addition, we have performed cyclic photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments of the C/TiO 2 -3 sample to verify the recyclability and stability of composite.The result was shown in Fig. 7d.It can be seen that C/TiO 2 -3 sample exhibited relatively stable cyclic performance. According to the above experimental results, we proposed a possible reaction mechanism of C/TiO 2 -3 composites to enhance the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction, which were shown in Fig. 8. TiO 2 generates electrons and holes under the UV-vis irradiation, and then the e-flowed to the surface of lignin-based carbon quantum, thereby reducing the CO 2 to CO gas.The lignin-based carbon quantum dots made the photogenerated electrons and holes realize the effective spatial separation, and the left h oxidized the H 2 O to produce O 2 .In addition, it improved the CO 2 adsorption capacity, obtaining more CO 2 molecule to be transferred into CO gas."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The reasonable utilization of lignin in poplar pre-hydrolysis liquor (PHL) derived from pulp and paper industry was achieved via combining the biomass with semiconductor photocatalysts.", "context": "The reasonable utilization of lignin in poplar pre-hydrolysis liquor (PHL) derived from pulp and paper industry was achieved via combining the biomass with semiconductor photocatalysts.The result indicated that 19.50 of the dissolved lignin and 2.80 of the total dissolved xylose and xylan were adsorbed onto the TiO 2 surface.Lignin of PHL was transferred into carbon quantum dots, immobilized on TiO 2 nanosheets, which improved both the separation efficiency of photogenerated carrier and CO 2 adsorption capacity of TiO 2 nanosheets.The lignin carbon quantum dots immobilized on TiO 2 nanosheets increased the efficiency of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of the TiO 2 nanosheets by 300 .
