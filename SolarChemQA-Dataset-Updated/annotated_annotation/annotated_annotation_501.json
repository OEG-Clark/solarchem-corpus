Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out at room temperature in a sealed 320 ml stainless steel photoreactor with a quartz window and a 300 W Xe light source.50 mg of sample was dispersed in 5 ml of water by ultrasonication for 5 min and charged in the photoreactor.Prior to irradiation, the reaction mixture was purged with bubbling CO 2 at 1 bar for 2 h at 6 ml min -1 in the dark to degas air from the solution and saturate with CO 2 .The reaction mixture was subsequently continuously irradiated with UV-vis light using a 300 W Xe Toption Group.Ltd TOP-X300 lamp (spectral output shown in Fig. S1), and aliquots of the reaction mixture periodically withdrawn with a 1 ml air-tight gas syringe for analysis on a Shimadzu Tracera GC-2010 Plus chromatograph fitted with a Carboxen1010 (30 m 0.53 mm 0.1 m) column with a He carrier gas and Barrier Ionization Detector.Liquid products were also analysed periodically from separate aliquots on an Agilent 1260 HPLC fitted with a Hi Plex column, however no carbon-containing liquid products were detected in this study.P25 was pre-dried in air at 200 C for 4 h prior to use in reference experiments to remove trace carbonaceous residues, which resulted in small quantities of evolved CO and CH 4 during control experiments under nitrogen in the absence of CO 2 .Selectivity for reactively-formed CO was calculated from Eq.

The morphology of P25, CoAl-LDH and 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH were investigated by SEM and TEM.Fig. 1a andb shows that the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite exhibits the sand rose structure typical of layered double hydroxides, comprising 4-5 m spherical agglomerates of two dimensional CoAl-LDH nanoplatelets approximately 20 nm thick and several hundred nanometers across (Fig. S2a).TEM revealed additional structural features, namely irregular nanoparticles spanning 20-50 nm indicative of P25 (Fig. S2b), uniformly dispersed throughout, and decorating, the nanoplatelets (Fig. 1c-e).Elemental EDX mapping confirmed a relatively high and uniform distribution of titania throughout the CoAl-LDH matrix (Fig. S2).High resolution imaging confirms existence of a well-defined titania-CoAl-LDH heterojunction interface, with lattice fringes consistent with the CoAl-LDH layer (0.55 nm) 24 and (001) plane of anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles (0.24 nm) 38. Powder XRD confirmed that the nanocomposites contained both crystalline CoAl-LDH and P25 components for all titania loadings (Fig. S3).The CoAl-LDH was evidenced by reflections consistent with (003), ( 006), ( 009), ( 012), ( 018), (110), and (113), characteristic of the pure CoAl-LDH reference (PDF-38-0487) with an interlayer spacing of 0.748 nm (d 003 ), indicating the presence of interlayer CO 3 2-and water 39, with additional reflections characteristic of anatase (PDF-21-1272) and rutile (PDF-21-1276) titania.Dimensions of both titania and CoAl-LDH crystallites were independent of titania loading (Table 1), confirming that the nanocomposite composition could be varied over a wide range (10-40 wt) without altering the phase or morphology of either component.The measured TEM thickness of a cation layer in the reference CoAl-LDH was 0.55 nm; combining this with the theoretical ionic radius of CO 3 2of 0.18 nm yields a predicted basal spacing (sum of a CoAl sheet and the interlayer gap) of 0.74 nm, consistent with that experimentally obtained by XRD of 0.75 nm for both the reference CoAl-LDH and the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite.A physical mixture of P25 and CoAl-LDH reference materials in a 1:4 mass ratio (i.e.20 wt P25) exhibited an almost identical diffraction pattern to the equivalent nanocomposite, highlighting that P25 encapsulation did not affect the crystallinity of either component. Surface properties of the P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposites were subsequently explored by DRIFTS (Fig. S4), which confirmed the presence of vibrational bands at 3490 and 1560 cm -1 , identical to those observed for the CoAl-LDH reference, and consequently assigned to the O H stretch and bending modes of interlayer water molecules, respectively, and additional bands at 1355 and 770 cm -1 likewise attributed to respective stretch and bending modes of interlayer CO 3 2-anions 394041.The P25 reference exhibited a strong band around 700 cm -1 associated with Ti O stretches and bending modes, and a weak feature at 3300 cm -1 corresponding to the O H stretch of physisorbed water 42.Surface functionalities on the physical mixture mirrored those of the equivalent nanocomposite. Nitrogen porosimetry of P25CoAl-LDH revealed type II adsorption-desorption isotherms characteristic of macroporous materials (or non-porous materials possessing large interparticle voids) with H3-type hysteresis loops (Fig. S5).The magnitude of the hysteresis was inversely proportional to the P25 content, reflecting its primary origin in the CoAl-LDH component; according to IUPAC classification, H3 hysteresis loops arise from non-rigid aggregates of plate-like particles such as microporous clays 43.Despite their evolving porosity, all nanocomposites exhibited similar BET surface areas around 55 m 2 g -1 (Table 1), with negligible difference between the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite and a simple physical mixture of the two components in the same mass ratio. Optical properties of DRUVS of the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite and P25 and CoAl-LDH reference materials are compared in Fig. 2. P25 showed the expected strong absorption band in the UV centered around 300 nm and subsequent sharp cut-off 385 nm reflecting its extremely poor visible photoactivity, corresponding to an optical band gap of 3.20 eV (Fig. S6a).In contrast, the CoAl-LDH reference displayed two distinct absorption features, including a broad band in the visible region centered around 500 nm attributable to d-d transitions of octahedral Co 2 within the CoAl-LDH layer 44.The d states of Co 2 are split into t2g and eg orbitals in an octahedral environment, with further splitting of t 2g and e g orbitals due to spin-spin exchange interactions 45,46.In ligand field theory, the ground state of Co 2 d 7 is 4T 1g (4F) and the first excited state is 4T 1g (4P).However there are three spin-allowed transitions, 4T 2g 4T 1g (F), 4A 2g 4T 1g (F) and 4T 1g (P) 4T 1g (F) which give rise to the broad visible absorption band for CoAl-LDH in Fig. 2. The associated optical band gap for CoAl-LDH was 2.1 eV (Fig. S6b).The 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite exhibits features intermediate between its constituent components, with a prominent UV absorption due to P25 nanoparticles superimposed on the visible light responsive CoAl-LDH aggregates.Heterojunction formation is indicated by a shift to higher wavelength in the absorption cut off edge between the UV and visible regions relative to a 20 wt P25 CoAl-LDH physical mixture. The electronic structure of the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite was further investigated by XPS.Fig. 3 shows the resulting Co 2p and Ti 2p XP core level spectra, and those of the CoAl-LDH and P25 reference materials.The Co 2p spectra of the CoAl-LDH reference exhibited the expected spin-orbit split doublet (Fig. 3a), with 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 components at 780.68 and 796.93 eV binding energy respectively and satellites at 786.47 and 802.23 eV indicative of high-spin divalent Co 2 species within the CoAl-LDH layers 30,47.Fig. 3b shows that the corresponding Ti 2p spin-orbit split doublet for the P25 reference, with 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 components at 458.37 and 464.20 eV respectively consistent with a Ti 4 oxidation state 48.Similar electronic environments were observed for Co and Ti within the 20 wt P25 CoAl-LDH heterostructure, but with a small increase in the Co 2p 3/2 binding energy (to 781.04 eV) and concomitant decrease in the Ti 2p 3/2 binding energy (to 458.15 eV) relative to the two references.Quantitatively similar shifts were reported following the formation of core-shell nanocomposites between hollow TiO 2 nanospheres and an encapsulating CoAl-LDH shell 30, and are consistent with initial state binding energy changes arising from electron transfer from the CoAl-LDH to P25.Neither shift was evident in the Co or Ti 2p XP spectra for a physical mixture of P25 and CoAl-LDH, highlighting the unique nanocomposite electronic structure. Valence band maximum (VBM) edge potentials for the CoAl-LDH and P25 references were also determined by valence band XPS (Fig. 3c andd) from the intercept of the tangent to the density of states at the Fermi edge as 1.35 eV and 2.83 eV respectively, in agreement with the literature 30,49.These values can be used in conjunction with the preceding optical band gap energies to calculate corresponding conduction band maximum (CBM) potentials of -0.75 eV (CoAl-LDH) and -0.37 (P25) respectively.Band bending and charge transfer associated with heterojunction formation within 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH was explored by determining the valence band offset E VBM of the CoAl-LDH relative to P25 component, according to Eq. ( 5) 50,51: where is the energy difference between the Co 2p 3/2 and VBM in the pure CoAl-LDH reference, E Ti CL -E Ti V is the energy difference between the Ti 2p 3/2 and the VBM in the P25 reference, and E CL E Co CL -E Ti CL is the energy difference between the Co 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 core levels (CLs) at the P25 CoAl-LDH heterojunction.The resulting E VBM was 0.95 eV, indicating significant band bending due to heterojunction formation.The corresponding conduction band offset E CBM of the CoAl-LDH relative to P25 component was determined according to Eq. ( 6): where E g CoAl-LDH and E g P25 are the band gaps of the references, 2.1 eV and 3.2 eV respectively, resulting in a E CBM of 0.15 eV.These energy levels and band offsets are depicted in Fig. 4a, and indicative of a type-II (staggered) band alignment at the P25CoAl-LDH heterojunction, and the associated band bending before and after contact between the titania and CoAl-LDH components illustrated in Fig. 4b.This band alignment is considered advantageous for the transport of photogenerated charge carriers, which in this instance is expected to results in hole-rich CoAl-LDH layers and electron-rich P25 nanoparticles, i.e. a heterojunction promoting electron-hole separation. Charge transport within the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH was further probed through steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy following 380 nm excitation.P25 exhibited a single weak emission peak around 470 nm (Fig. 5a) arising from charge recombination on oxygen vacancies within titania 49,52, whereas the CoAl-LDH reference exhibited two emission peaks at 470 nm (strong) and 525 nm (medium) associated with ligand field transitions 4T2g 4T1 g (F) and 4T1 g (P) 4 T1 g (F) observed commonly in octahedral cobalt(II) compounds 46,53, similar to previous reports for Co-Al-LDHs 30,49.The PL spectra of the nanocomposite was intermediate between the references, with the 470 nm peak intensity significantly lower than that of pure CoAl-LDH, while the 520 nm peak was extremely weak relative to a simple 20 wt P25 CoAl-LDH physical mixture, evidencing supressed electron-hole recombination 30,36 Time-resolved PL spectroscopy provided additional insight into photogenerated charge carrier dynamics (Fig. 5b) from the resulting decay curves which were fitted with a biexponential function according to Eq. ( 7) below 46,54. where A is a constant employed in the baseline correction, B 1 and B 2 are constants corresponding to non-radiative and radiative relaxation processes originating from the direct formation of free charge carrier and the indirect formation of self-trapped excitons respectively 55, 1 and 2 the corresponding decay lifetimes associated with the recombination of photogenerated holes and electrons, and t is time.The average charge carrier lifetime () was calculated from Eq. ( 8) 54: Fitted parameters are summarized in Table 2 for the P25 and CoAl-LDH references and 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH, with 2 a measure of the goodness of fit and close to unity for all three samples indicating excellent agreement with experimental data (typical literature fits are 1.0-1.25 46,54).For 20 wt P25 CoAl-LDH, 7.03 ns, almost double that of CoAl-LDH (3.54 ns), five times longer than that of P25 (1.5 ns), and also much higher than that of a physical mixture of P25 and CoAl-LDH (3.99 ns), revealing significantly slower electron-hole pair recombination in the nanocomposite than any reference material, a synergy we attribute to the associated heterojunction between and charge trapping on the P25 and CoAl-LDH components.The values in Table 2 are comparable to literature reports of 1 and 2 of 0.3 and 4.5 ns for P25 56 ( 1.16 ns) and 1 and 2 of 0.4 and 1.5 ns for pure anatase 57, and 1 and 2 of 3.2 and 4.0 ns for a related NiFe-LDH 58 ( 5.5 ns); it is interesting to note that composite formation between the latter NiFe-LDH and an amorphous layered g-C 3 N 4 also prolonged the photogenerated charge lifetime to 8.6 ns 58. The photocatalytic performance was determined of P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite for the aqueous phase CO 2 reduction under UV-vis irradiation in the absence of a sacrificial hole acceptor, which was compared with that of P25 and CoAl-LDH references (Fig. 6).In order to discount possible artefacts arising from carbon contamination and confirm water as the proton source 59, a number of control experiments were first performed in the absence of CO 2 , H 2 O, catalyst or light, which confirmed that all four elements were required to observe any reaction products (Fig. S7).Only three products were observed in all cases, CO, H 2 and O 2 , with no hydrocarbons detected in either the gas or liquid phase.P25 exhibited the poorest photoactivity for CO 2 reduction or water oxidation, presumably reflecting fast charge carrier recombination, low CO 2 absorptivity and its conduction band maximum potential of -0.37 eV (Fig. 4), which is too low to drive CO 2 2H 2e - CO H 2 O (E 00 -0.53eV at pH 7) but sufficient to drive significant proton reduction to hydrogen (Fig. 6b).The CoAl-LDH reference by comparison produced appreciable CO and oxygen (Fig. 6a andc), reflecting its higher conduction band maximum of -0.75 eV and longer average charge carrier lifetime .All P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposites evidenced a synergy between constituent semiconductor components, with superior CO and oxygen productivity to either reference material alone, or a 20 wt P25 CoAl-LDH physical mixture which exhibited only 0.84 mol h -1 g -1 CO.Since the physicochemical properties of each component (phase, crystallite size, surface area, CO 2 chemisorption capacity and formal oxidation state) in the nanocomposites are identical to (or a simple average) of the reference materials, this synergy is attributable directly to heterojunction formation and the associated spatial separation of electrons and holes and attendant slow recombination rate.The P25CoAl-LDH materials displayed a volcano dependence of CO 2 photoreduction performance on P25 content, with maximum CO and O 2 productivity, and a CO selectivity of 94 (Fig. S8) for 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH; this equated to a 2.5 and 5.5 fold increase in CO productivity relative to CoAl-LDH and P25 references.The CO:O 2 product stoichiometry was between 1.78:1 and 1.96:1 for all nanocomposites and CoAl-LDH reference, very close to the 2:1 stoichiometry expected if CO 2 photoreduction was the only catalytic process operating: CO 2 reduction to CO is a 2e -process, in contrast to water oxidation which is a four electron process, 2H 2 O O 2 4H 4e -, hence two CO molecules are formed for each O 2 molecule from water splitting.The exception is the P25 reference, for which significantly more oxygen was evolved than anticipated, reflecting a higher propensity for water oxidation consistent with the observed highest rate of H 2 production in Fig. 6b.Synergy between the two semiconductors was further demonstrated by comparing CO productivity for the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH under UV-vis versus visible light irradiation which yielded values of 2.21 versus 0.714 mol h -1 g -1 respectively, highlighting the importance of hole generation on the P25 component through UV excitation (and subsequent transport to the LDH component hindering recombination with photoexcited electrons).Our CO productivities are significantly higher than literature reports for diverse inorganic heterostructure photocatalysts (Table S1), which span 0.25-1.74mol h -1 g -1 60616263646566676869.Apparent quantum efficiencies for CO production over the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH estimated around 0.10 under 365 nm irradiation (using a UV band pass filter), orders of magnitude higher than the few values reported for CO 2 photoreduction over 'high performance' heterogeneous photocatalysts such as ZrOCo/IrO x inorganic polynuclear oxide clusters (0.001 60), reduced graphene oxide-amine-titanium dioxide nanocomposites (0.0094 70) and SrNb 2 O 6 nanoplates (0.065 71).The apparent quantum efficiency for 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH of 0.03 at 475 nm (visible band pass filter) is also much higher than recent reports for Fe (0.0013, 72) and Ni (0.01 73) homogeneous photocatalysts, which also require organic sensitizers or electron donors.Future studies will investigate the impact of titania morphology on nanocomposite physicochemical properties and photocatalytic performance, however preliminary tests show that substituting anatase nanorods 74, for P25 in the synthesis improves CO productivity (Fig. S10) presumably due to their superior charge transport properties and suppressed charge recombination. Photocatalytic stability of the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite was subsequently explored over three consecutive reactions, in between each of which the catalyst was filtered and washed with water, then replaced in the photoreactor which in turn was charged with fresh deionized water and purged again with CO 2 .Around 90 of the original photocatalytic activity was retained after two recycles (Fig. 6d), a key requirement for any practical catalyst, and a common limitation for new photocatalysts 75. Photocatalytic studies of solar fuel production often utilize a hole scavenger, typically an organic alcohol 767778, to improve productivity, however such organic scavengers are a potential source of carbon containing products, and hence artefacts, during CO 2 photoreduction.We therefore examined the impact of 2-propanol addition as a hole scavenger during the irradiation of the P25 reference in the absence of CO 2 .Significant yields of both gas and liquid phase hydrocarbons (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH) were observed following 2-propanol addition (Fig. S9) Scheme 2. Proposed mechanism of CO2 photoreduction due to heterojunction formation within over P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite. which must therefore have arisen from the scavenger.This highlights the importance of adequate control experiments and the exercise of due care in conducting CO 2 photoreduction to eliminate possible contributions from both deliberate organic contaminants (such as scavengers) and accidental organic residues arising from e.g.catalyst precursors and/or solvents used for photoreactor cleaning. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposites is proposed to occur as follows.Upon visible light irradiation, electrons photoexcited into the conduction band of the CoAl-LDH component (band gap of 2.1 eV) pass across the heterojunction into the conduction band of P25, where CO 2 , either weakly chemisorbed directly at the titania surface or spilled over onto titania facets proximate to the basic CoAl-LDH support, undergoes reduction (likely via the CO 2 -anion radical in a proton-coupled process) as illustrated in Scheme 2. In parallel, holes photogenerated in the P25 component (band gap of 3.2 eV) by UV light transfer across the heterojunction into the valence band of CoAl-LDH, where they oxidize chemisorbed water at the LDH surface to liberate dioxygen, with the concomitant protons migrating across the nanojunction interface to P25 and the activated CO 2 -to liberate CO and water."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xe Toption Group.Ltd TOP-X300 lamp", "source": "The reaction mixture was subsequently continuously irradiated with UV-vis light using a 300 W Xe Toption Group.Ltd TOP-X300 lamp (spectral output shown in Fig. S1), and aliquots of the reaction mixture periodically withdrawn with a 1 ml air-tight gas syringe for analysis on a Shimadzu Tracera GC-2010 Plus chromatograph fitted with a Carboxen1010 (30 m 0.53 mm 0.1 m) column with a He carrier gas and Barrier Ionization Detector.", "context": "Reagents Co(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (Sigma, 99), Al(NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O (Sigma, 99), P25 (Sigma), NH 4 F (Sigma, 99) and urea (Sigma, 99.9) were used as received.All other chemical reagents used in this work were analytical grade and used without further purification.Hierarchical P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposites were prepared by a modified one-pot hydrothermal method (employing a urea decomposition method previously used to prepare Au/NiAl-LDH oxidation catalysts 35), with NH 4 F as a structure-directing agent.Briefly, a known mass of P25 was dispersed in deionized water by ultrasonication (Elmasonic S100H, 5 min/550 W/50 Hz), to which 0.006 mols Co(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O, 0.002 mols Al(NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O, 0.04 mols urea and 0.01 mols NH 4 F were dissolved.The resulting suspension was aged in a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave at 120 C for 24 h.The precipitate obtained was washed with deionized water until the washings were pH neutral, then dried overnight at 60 C in vacuum to yield the final P25CoAl-LDH material.The mass of P25 in the initial suspension was varied to produce P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposites containing between 0 and 40 wt titania.A similar method, omitting P25, was adopted to prepare a pure CoAl-LDH reference.

The morphology of P25, CoAl-LDH and 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH were investigated by SEM and TEM.Fig. 1a andb shows that the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite exhibits the sand rose structure typical of layered double hydroxides, comprising 4-5 m spherical agglomerates of two dimensional CoAl-LDH nanoplatelets approximately 20 nm thick and several hundred nanometers across (Fig. S2a).TEM revealed additional structural features, namely irregular nanoparticles spanning 20-50 nm indicative of P25 (Fig. S2b), uniformly dispersed throughout, and decorating, the nanoplatelets (Fig. 1c-e).Elemental EDX mapping confirmed a relatively high and uniform distribution of titania throughout the CoAl-LDH matrix (Fig. S2).High resolution imaging confirms existence of a well-defined titania-CoAl-LDH heterojunction interface, with lattice fringes consistent with the CoAl-LDH layer (0.55 nm) 24 and (001) plane of anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles (0.24 nm) 38. Powder XRD confirmed that the nanocomposites contained both crystalline CoAl-LDH and P25 components for all titania loadings (Fig. S3).The CoAl-LDH was evidenced by reflections consistent with (003), ( 006), ( 009), ( 012), ( 018), (110), and (113), characteristic of the pure CoAl-LDH reference (PDF-38-0487) with an interlayer spacing of 0.748 nm (d 003 ), indicating the presence of interlayer CO 3 2-and water 39, with additional reflections characteristic of anatase (PDF-21-1272) and rutile (PDF-21-1276) titania.Dimensions of both titania and CoAl-LDH crystallites were independent of titania loading (Table 1), confirming that the nanocomposite composition could be varied over a wide range (10-40 wt) without altering the phase or morphology of either component.The measured TEM thickness of a cation layer in the reference CoAl-LDH was 0.55 nm; combining this with the theoretical ionic radius of CO 3 2of 0.18 nm yields a predicted basal spacing (sum of a CoAl sheet and the interlayer gap) of 0.74 nm, consistent with that experimentally obtained by XRD of 0.75 nm for both the reference CoAl-LDH and the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite.A physical mixture of P25 and CoAl-LDH reference materials in a 1:4 mass ratio (i.e.20 wt P25) exhibited an almost identical diffraction pattern to the equivalent nanocomposite, highlighting that P25 encapsulation did not affect the crystallinity of either component. Surface properties of the P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposites were subsequently explored by DRIFTS (Fig. S4), which confirmed the presence of vibrational bands at 3490 and 1560 cm -1 , identical to those observed for the CoAl-LDH reference, and consequently assigned to the O H stretch and bending modes of interlayer water molecules, respectively, and additional bands at 1355 and 770 cm -1 likewise attributed to respective stretch and bending modes of interlayer CO 3 2-anions 394041.The P25 reference exhibited a strong band around 700 cm -1 associated with Ti O stretches and bending modes, and a weak feature at 3300 cm -1 corresponding to the O H stretch of physisorbed water 42.Surface functionalities on the physical mixture mirrored those of the equivalent nanocomposite. Nitrogen porosimetry of P25CoAl-LDH revealed type II adsorption-desorption isotherms characteristic of macroporous materials (or non-porous materials possessing large interparticle voids) with H3-type hysteresis loops (Fig. S5).The magnitude of the hysteresis was inversely proportional to the P25 content, reflecting its primary origin in the CoAl-LDH component; according to IUPAC classification, H3 hysteresis loops arise from non-rigid aggregates of plate-like particles such as microporous clays 43.Despite their evolving porosity, all nanocomposites exhibited similar BET surface areas around 55 m 2 g -1 (Table 1), with negligible difference between the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite and a simple physical mixture of the two components in the same mass ratio. Optical properties of DRUVS of the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite and P25 and CoAl-LDH reference materials are compared in Fig. 2. P25 showed the expected strong absorption band in the UV centered around 300 nm and subsequent sharp cut-off 385 nm reflecting its extremely poor visible photoactivity, corresponding to an optical band gap of 3.20 eV (Fig. S6a).In contrast, the CoAl-LDH reference displayed two distinct absorption features, including a broad band in the visible region centered around 500 nm attributable to d-d transitions of octahedral Co 2 within the CoAl-LDH layer 44.The d states of Co 2 are split into t2g and eg orbitals in an octahedral environment, with further splitting of t 2g and e g orbitals due to spin-spin exchange interactions 45,46.In ligand field theory, the ground state of Co 2 d 7 is 4T 1g (4F) and the first excited state is 4T 1g (4P).However there are three spin-allowed transitions, 4T 2g 4T 1g (F), 4A 2g 4T 1g (F) and 4T 1g (P) 4T 1g (F) which give rise to the broad visible absorption band for CoAl-LDH in Fig. 2. The associated optical band gap for CoAl-LDH was 2.1 eV (Fig. S6b).The 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite exhibits features intermediate between its constituent components, with a prominent UV absorption due to P25 nanoparticles superimposed on the visible light responsive CoAl-LDH aggregates.Heterojunction formation is indicated by a shift to higher wavelength in the absorption cut off edge between the UV and visible regions relative to a 20 wt P25 CoAl-LDH physical mixture. The electronic structure of the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite was further investigated by XPS.Fig. 3 shows the resulting Co 2p and Ti 2p XP core level spectra, and those of the CoAl-LDH and P25 reference materials.The Co 2p spectra of the CoAl-LDH reference exhibited the expected spin-orbit split doublet (Fig. 3a), with 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 components at 780.68 and 796.93 eV binding energy respectively and satellites at 786.47 and 802.23 eV indicative of high-spin divalent Co 2 species within the CoAl-LDH layers 30,47.Fig. 3b shows that the corresponding Ti 2p spin-orbit split doublet for the P25 reference, with 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 components at 458.37 and 464.20 eV respectively consistent with a Ti 4 oxidation state 48.Similar electronic environments were observed for Co and Ti within the 20 wt P25 CoAl-LDH heterostructure, but with a small increase in the Co 2p 3/2 binding energy (to 781.04 eV) and concomitant decrease in the Ti 2p 3/2 binding energy (to 458.15 eV) relative to the two references.Quantitatively similar shifts were reported following the formation of core-shell nanocomposites between hollow TiO 2 nanospheres and an encapsulating CoAl-LDH shell 30, and are consistent with initial state binding energy changes arising from electron transfer from the CoAl-LDH to P25.Neither shift was evident in the Co or Ti 2p XP spectra for a physical mixture of P25 and CoAl-LDH, highlighting the unique nanocomposite electronic structure. Valence band maximum (VBM) edge potentials for the CoAl-LDH and P25 references were also determined by valence band XPS (Fig. 3c andd) from the intercept of the tangent to the density of states at the Fermi edge as 1.35 eV and 2.83 eV respectively, in agreement with the literature 30,49.These values can be used in conjunction with the preceding optical band gap energies to calculate corresponding conduction band maximum (CBM) potentials of -0.75 eV (CoAl-LDH) and -0.37 (P25) respectively.Band bending and charge transfer associated with heterojunction formation within 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH was explored by determining the valence band offset E VBM of the CoAl-LDH relative to P25 component, according to Eq. ( 5) 50,51: where is the energy difference between the Co 2p 3/2 and VBM in the pure CoAl-LDH reference, E Ti CL -E Ti V is the energy difference between the Ti 2p 3/2 and the VBM in the P25 reference, and E CL E Co CL -E Ti CL is the energy difference between the Co 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 core levels (CLs) at the P25 CoAl-LDH heterojunction.The resulting E VBM was 0.95 eV, indicating significant band bending due to heterojunction formation.The corresponding conduction band offset E CBM of the CoAl-LDH relative to P25 component was determined according to Eq. ( 6): where E g CoAl-LDH and E g P25 are the band gaps of the references, 2.1 eV and 3.2 eV respectively, resulting in a E CBM of 0.15 eV.These energy levels and band offsets are depicted in Fig. 4a, and indicative of a type-II (staggered) band alignment at the P25CoAl-LDH heterojunction, and the associated band bending before and after contact between the titania and CoAl-LDH components illustrated in Fig. 4b.This band alignment is considered advantageous for the transport of photogenerated charge carriers, which in this instance is expected to results in hole-rich CoAl-LDH layers and electron-rich P25 nanoparticles, i.e. a heterojunction promoting electron-hole separation. Charge transport within the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH was further probed through steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy following 380 nm excitation.P25 exhibited a single weak emission peak around 470 nm (Fig. 5a) arising from charge recombination on oxygen vacancies within titania 49,52, whereas the CoAl-LDH reference exhibited two emission peaks at 470 nm (strong) and 525 nm (medium) associated with ligand field transitions 4T2g 4T1 g (F) and 4T1 g (P) 4 T1 g (F) observed commonly in octahedral cobalt(II) compounds 46,53, similar to previous reports for Co-Al-LDHs 30,49.The PL spectra of the nanocomposite was intermediate between the references, with the 470 nm peak intensity significantly lower than that of pure CoAl-LDH, while the 520 nm peak was extremely weak relative to a simple 20 wt P25 CoAl-LDH physical mixture, evidencing supressed electron-hole recombination 30,36 Time-resolved PL spectroscopy provided additional insight into photogenerated charge carrier dynamics (Fig. 5b) from the resulting decay curves which were fitted with a biexponential function according to Eq.

( 8) 54: Fitted parameters are summarized in Table 2 for the P25 and CoAl-LDH references and 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH, with 2 a measure of the goodness of fit and close to unity for all three samples indicating excellent agreement with experimental data (typical literature fits are 1.0-1.25 46,54).For 20 wt P25 CoAl-LDH, 7.03 ns, almost double that of CoAl-LDH (3.54 ns), five times longer than that of P25 (1.5 ns), and also much higher than that of a physical mixture of P25 and CoAl-LDH (3.99 ns), revealing significantly slower electron-hole pair recombination in the nanocomposite than any reference material, a synergy we attribute to the associated heterojunction between and charge trapping on the P25 and CoAl-LDH components.The values in Table 2 are comparable to literature reports of 1 and 2 of 0.3 and 4.5 ns for P25 56 ( 1.16 ns) and 1 and 2 of 0.4 and 1.5 ns for pure anatase 57, and 1 and 2 of 3.2 and 4.0 ns for a related NiFe-LDH 58 ( 5.5 ns); it is interesting to note that composite formation between the latter NiFe-LDH and an amorphous layered g-C 3 N 4 also prolonged the photogenerated charge lifetime to 8.6 ns 58. The photocatalytic performance was determined of P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite for the aqueous phase CO 2 reduction under UV-vis irradiation in the absence of a sacrificial hole acceptor, which was compared with that of P25 and CoAl-LDH references (Fig. 6).In order to discount possible artefacts arising from carbon contamination and confirm water as the proton source 59, a number of control experiments were first performed in the absence of CO 2 , H 2 O, catalyst or light, which confirmed that all four elements were required to observe any reaction products (Fig. S7).Only three products were observed in all cases, CO, H 2 and O 2 , with no hydrocarbons detected in either the gas or liquid phase.P25 exhibited the poorest photoactivity for CO 2 reduction or water oxidation, presumably reflecting fast charge carrier recombination, low CO 2 absorptivity and its conduction band maximum potential of -0.37 eV (Fig. 4), which is too low to drive CO 2 2H 2e - CO H 2 O (E 00 -0.53eV at pH 7) but sufficient to drive significant proton reduction to hydrogen (Fig. 6b).The CoAl-LDH reference by comparison produced appreciable CO and oxygen (Fig. 6a andc), reflecting its higher conduction band maximum of -0.75 eV and longer average charge carrier lifetime .All P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposites evidenced a synergy between constituent semiconductor components, with superior CO and oxygen productivity to either reference material alone, or a 20 wt P25 CoAl-LDH physical mixture which exhibited only 0.84 mol h -1 g -1 CO.Since the physicochemical properties of each component (phase, crystallite size, surface area, CO 2 chemisorption capacity and formal oxidation state) in the nanocomposites are identical to (or a simple average) of the reference materials, this synergy is attributable directly to heterojunction formation and the associated spatial separation of electrons and holes and attendant slow recombination rate.The P25CoAl-LDH materials displayed a volcano dependence of CO 2 photoreduction performance on P25 content, with maximum CO and O 2 productivity, and a CO selectivity of 94 (Fig. S8) for 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH; this equated to a 2.5 and 5.5 fold increase in CO productivity relative to CoAl-LDH and P25 references.The CO:O 2 product stoichiometry was between 1.78:1 and 1.96:1 for all nanocomposites and CoAl-LDH reference, very close to the 2:1 stoichiometry expected if CO 2 photoreduction was the only catalytic process operating: CO 2 reduction to CO is a 2e -process, in contrast to water oxidation which is a four electron process, 2H 2 O O 2 4H 4e -, hence two CO molecules are formed for each O 2 molecule from water splitting.The exception is the P25 reference, for which significantly more oxygen was evolved than anticipated, reflecting a higher propensity for water oxidation consistent with the observed highest rate of H 2 production in Fig. 6b.Synergy between the two semiconductors was further demonstrated by comparing CO productivity for the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH under UV-vis versus visible light irradiation which yielded values of 2.21 versus 0.714 mol h -1 g -1 respectively, highlighting the importance of hole generation on the P25 component through UV excitation (and subsequent transport to the LDH component hindering recombination with photoexcited electrons).Our CO productivities are significantly higher than literature reports for diverse inorganic heterostructure photocatalysts (Table S1), which span 0.25-1.74mol h -1 g -1 60616263646566676869.Apparent quantum efficiencies for CO production over the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH estimated around 0.10 under 365 nm irradiation (using a UV band pass filter), orders of magnitude higher than the few values reported for CO 2 photoreduction over 'high performance' heterogeneous photocatalysts such as ZrOCo/IrO x inorganic polynuclear oxide clusters (0.001 60), reduced graphene oxide-amine-titanium dioxide nanocomposites (0.0094 70) and SrNb 2 O 6 nanoplates (0.065 71).The apparent quantum efficiency for 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH of 0.03 at 475 nm (visible band pass filter) is also much higher than recent reports for Fe (0.0013, 72) and Ni (0.01 73) homogeneous photocatalysts, which also require organic sensitizers or electron donors.Future studies will investigate the impact of titania morphology on nanocomposite physicochemical properties and photocatalytic performance, however preliminary tests show that substituting anatase nanorods 74, for P25 in the synthesis improves CO productivity (Fig. S10) presumably due to their superior charge transport properties and suppressed charge recombination. Photocatalytic stability of the 20 wt P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite was subsequently explored over three consecutive reactions, in between each of which the catalyst was filtered and washed with water, then replaced in the photoreactor which in turn was charged with fresh deionized water and purged again with CO 2 .Around 90 of the original photocatalytic activity was retained after two recycles (Fig. 6d), a key requirement for any practical catalyst, and a common limitation for new photocatalysts 75. Photocatalytic studies of solar fuel production often utilize a hole scavenger, typically an organic alcohol 767778, to improve productivity, however such organic scavengers are a potential source of carbon containing products, and hence artefacts, during CO 2 photoreduction.We therefore examined the impact of 2-propanol addition as a hole scavenger during the irradiation of the P25 reference in the absence of CO 2 .Significant yields of both gas and liquid phase hydrocarbons (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH) were observed following 2-propanol addition (Fig. S9) Scheme 2. Proposed mechanism of CO2 photoreduction due to heterojunction formation within over P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposite. which must therefore have arisen from the scavenger.This highlights the importance of adequate control experiments and the exercise of due care in conducting CO 2 photoreduction to eliminate possible contributions from both deliberate organic contaminants (such as scavengers) and accidental organic residues arising from e.g.catalyst precursors and/or solvents used for photoreactor cleaning. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposites is proposed to occur as follows.Upon visible light irradiation, electrons photoexcited into the conduction band of the CoAl-LDH component (band gap of 2.1 eV) pass across the heterojunction into the conduction band of P25, where CO 2 , either weakly chemisorbed directly at the titania surface or spilled over onto titania facets proximate to the basic CoAl-LDH support, undergoes reduction (likely via the CO 2 -anion radical in a proton-coupled process) as illustrated in Scheme 2. In parallel, holes photogenerated in the P25 component (band gap of 3.2 eV) by UV light transfer across the heterojunction into the valence band of CoAl-LDH, where they oxidize chemisorbed water at the LDH surface to liberate dioxygen, with the concomitant protons migrating across the nanojunction interface to P25 and the activated CO 2 -to liberate CO and water."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The resulting P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposites exhibit a strong synergy between semiconductor components, resulting in excellent activity and selectivity (90) under full spectrum irradiation for the aqueous phase photoreduction of CO 2 to CO, with water as the proton source; optimal photoactivity and selectivity occurs for 20 wt P25 incorporation which likely maximizes the heterojunction interface.", "context": "A facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposites is reported, which affords a uniform dispersion of UV photoactive titania nanoparticles throughout a visible light photoactive CoAl-LDH matrix.Attendant formation of a type-II heterojunction between the visible and UV semiconductor components confers enhanced photoinduced charge carrier lifetimes, presumably through spatial separation of photoexcited charge carriers, with electron transfer from the CoAl-LDH to P25 and concomitant reverse hole transfer from P25 to the CoAl-LDH.The resulting P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposites exhibit a strong synergy between semiconductor components, resulting in excellent activity and selectivity (90) under full spectrum irradiation for the aqueous phase photoreduction of CO 2 to CO, with water as the proton source; optimal photoactivity and selectivity occurs for 20 wt P25 incorporation which likely maximizes the heterojunction interface.These low cost P25CoAl-LDH nanocomposites also exhibit a good apparent quantum efficiency for CO production, and excellent stability over multiple recycles.
