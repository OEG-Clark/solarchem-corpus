as-prepared samples was evaluated via decomposition of model pollutant CIP, which represents the antibiotic contaminants, under simulated sunlight irradiation.", "context": "As shown in Fig. 1a, the crystal structures of as-prepared pure HHBs, N-HHBs and Pt/N-HHBs were investigated by XRD.Both of the main diffraction peaks of these as-prepared samples can be well indexed to the standard XRD card of tetragonal phase BiOCl (JCPDS No. 06-0249) 42, demonstrating that the unique crystal structure of HHBs was reserved after introducing the N and Pt.The diffraction peaks at 11.9, 25.9, 32.5, 33.4, 40.9, 46.6, 49.7, 54.1, and 58.6were corresponded to (0 0 1), (1 0 1), (1 1 0), (1 0 2), (1 1 2), (2 0 0), (1 1 3), (2 1 1), and (2 1 2) plans of BiOCl, respectively.As for pure HHBs, the peak (0 0 1) was attributed to the stacked CleBieOeBieCl layers along the c axis, shown in inset of Fig. 1b.The CleBieOeBieCl structures are composed of Bi 2 O 2 layers sandwiched between two Cl m layers and the structure held together by van der Walls interaction force along the c axis 18.The intensities of XRD diffraction peak could be used to indentify different growth orientations of crystal facet 42.The (1 1 0) peak at 32.5was relatively strong, which is perpendicular to the plane (0 0 1), indicating that the as-prepared BiOCl crystal grows preferentially along 1 1 0 direction.After the deposition of Pt, a weak diffraction peak at 2 39.76forPt can be observed, which could be indexed to the standard XRD card of metallic Pt (JCPDS No. 04-0802).In the inset of Fig. 1a, the diffraction peak (0 0 1) shifted slightly towards a higher angle after N doping, indicating that the N ion replaced the O in the crystal lattice of HHBs 43.Besides, no any other impurity peaks were observed in Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs, revealing that the doping of N and Pt had not influence the lattice structure of HHBs.To further testify the presence of the surface Pt, the EDS spectra of Pt 1 / N 0.25 -HHBs sample was determined.Fig. 1b illustrated the EDS analysis of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs where the weight percentage of Bi, O, Cl, N and Pt was about 76.99, 9.85, 5.57, 2.92 and 4.67, respectively, further certifying the existence of N and Pt. The specific microstructures and morphologies of as-prepared samples were further investigated via SEM, TEM and HRTEM.As depicted in SEM image (Fig. 2a), the HHBs was self-assembled by numerous interleaving nanosheets with small thickness, which can induce the effective separation of photocarriers to improve the photocatalytic activity, and the diameter of HHBs was around 1.5 um.As shown in Fig. S1, in the absence of PVP, the obtained BiOCl showed a nanoplate morphology.However, after addition of different concentrations of citric acid with PVP, the morphology of BiOCl gradually changed from nanoflower to hollow microspheres.Hence, we conclude that the exist of PVP in the system has played an important role in the formation of self-assembled flower-like and hollow microspherical superstructures.Notably, it can be observed that the formation of the hollow spherical structure may be ascribed to the strong synergetic effect between PVP and citric acid.After N and Pt decoration (Fig. 2b), the structure morphology of samples was nearly unchanged, which may be attributed to much lower loading content of the two elements.It can be seen from the TEM image (Fig. 2c) that the Pt had uniformly dispersed on the HHBs with an average size of about 4 nm, indicating that the Pt was successfully loaded on the surface of HHBs, which was consistent with the results of XRD and EDS.HRTEM image of as-prepared sample (Fig. 2d) showed the clear plane (1 1 0) interplanar spacing of 0.280 nm, which was in agreement with the (1 1 0) diffraction peak of XRD pattern of tetragonal phase BiOCl.Meanwhile, there existed a clear lattice fringes (0.196 nm), which was corresponding to (2 0 0) plane of Pt, certifying the existence of Pt.The elemental mapping images (Fig. 2e) showed the element distribution of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs, and it can The detailed information about the chemical states of all elements in Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample was investigated via XPS spectra, as shown in Fig. 3.As depicted in the survey scan spectrum (Fig. 3a), the peaks of Bi, O, Cl elements could be identified in the pure HHBs samples whereas additional peak of N and Pt element observed in as-prepared Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample, which was in conformity to the result of EDS.Besides, the additional peak of C 1s in survey spectrum could be attribute to the instrument itself 44.Furthermore, the high resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f was shown in Fig. 3b, which can be divided into two peaks at 159.06 and 164.55 eV, corresponding to Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 of Bi 3 , respectively 45.The binding energy at 529.82 eV in O 1s spectra (Fig. 3c) was corresponding to O 2-of BieO bond in the sample, and the peak located at 531.34 eV can be attributed to the chemisorbed oxygen 46.The Cl 2p spectra in Fig. 3d demonstrated two peaks at 199.51 and 197.89 eV, which were ascribed to Cl 2p 1/2 and Cl 2p 3/2 , respectively, indicating the existence of Cl -ions.In addition, Fig. 3e presents the XPS spectra of doping element N 1s, where the binding energy at 399.82 eV can be assigned to BieN bond in the BiOCl lattice 43,47.Also, as shown in Fig. 3f, the double peaks at 73.36 and 76.54 eV were assigned to Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 , respectively, and the Pt was in the chemical state of Pt 0 based on the results of binding energy in literatures 48,49.Hence, depending on these results, we concluded that the co-doping of N and Pt on hollow hierarchical BiOCl sphere can be obtained by the present synthesis method. To clarify the effects of modification elements on the photocatalytic performance of HHBs, the optical absorption properties were investigated by DRS spectrum in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm, as shown in Fig. 4a.For HHBs, the pores on the surface of catalyst could provide light transfer paths for distribution of light into the inner surfaces of porous architecture (Scheme S1), hence the light activation can be notably improved due to the multiple reflections of light within the chamber of catalyst.As depicted in Fig. S2, the HHBs had a somewhat higher light absorption capacity than ordinary spherical BiOCl, which can be attribute to such multiple reflections of light.The adsorption edge of shifted from about 374 nm to nearly 407 nm after N doping.Comparatively, after further deposition of Pt on the surface of N-HHBs, the light absorption range of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs gradually extended meanwhile the intensity relatively enhanced, which could be ascribed to the plasma resonance effect of Pt nano-particles 50. Based on the DRS spectrum, the band gap (Eg) of as-prepared samples had been calculated through the Tauc equation 51: (h) 2/ n A(h -Eg), where h, , A and Eg represent the photon energy, absorption coefficient, a proportional constant and the band gap, respectively.In above equation, the n value depends on the type of optical transition of a semiconductor material (for direct transition n 1 and for indirect transition n 4) and here the n is 4 for HHBs 42.Then, the band gaps of as-prepared samples can be calculated from the plots of (h) 1/2 h relationship, as shown in the Fig. 4b.The Eg of a semiconductor is decided by the linear region of above plots, which is located above the optical absorption edge.Correspondingly, the corresponding Eg of HHBs, N 0.25 -HHBs, Pt 1 /HHBs and Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs composite photocatalysts were calculated to be 3.31 eV, 3.04 eV, 2.75 eV and 2.41 eV, respectively.It can be found that the band gap of HHBs was decreased (from 3.31 eV to 3.04 eV) after N doping, and the band gap of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample was narrow down to 2.75 eV after Pt was loaded on the surface of N 0.25 -HHBs.The results showed that the decoration of N and Pt can narrow down the Eg of semiconductor, and thus improving the visible light adsorption, which was in good agreement with the conclusion of previous literature reports 36,52. The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples was evaluated via decomposition of model pollutant CIP, which represents the antibiotic contaminants, under simulated sunlight irradiation.As typical photocatalytic degradation was shown in Fig. 5a, the Abs values of pollutants notably decreased with increasing of time.The photodegradation curves (c/c 0 ) of CIP with and without Pt y /N x -HHBs photocatalysts with different amount of Pt and N modification were shown in Fig. 5b.As can be seen in the figure, the concentration of CIP without photocatalyst was almost not changed both in dark and under simulated sunlight irradiation, suggesting the stability of CIP.In initial 30 min in the dark, the concentration of CIP with as-prepared samples was decreased somewhat, indicating the improved adsorption capacity due to the particular hollow hierarchical architecture of HHBs.From 30 min to 60 min in the dark, the removal efficiency of CIP was negligible, indicating that the system had established the adsorption-desorption equilibrium.Compared with the as-prepared HHBs (44.97) and Inversely, the introduction of higher content of Pt will covers the active sites of N 0.25 -HHBs, thus hinder the carriers transport at the electrolyte/semiconductor interface 50.Furthermore, the photocatalytic degradation of CIP was further analyzed by kinetic equation.The reaction rate (k) can be obtained via the slopes of the following pseudo-first-order kinetics plot 37,53: -ln (C/C 0 ) kt (Fig. 5c), where C 0 and C represent the concentration of CIP at light irradiation times of 0 (min) and t (min), and k (min -1 ) is the apparent reaction rate constant.As is well known, the higher k value indicates the higher photocatalytic activity.It can be discovered that Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs had the highest k value (0.011 min -1 ) for the decomposition of CIP, which was 2.2 and 3.6 times higher than that of N 0.25 -HHBs (0.005 min -1 ) and pure HHBs (0.003 min -1 ), respectively, which further suggested the best photocatalytic degradation activity of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs.The excellent photocatalytic performance of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs may be due to its complicated surface structures, excellent lightharvesting abilities, and considerably photogenerated electron-holes separation efficiency. In addition to photocatalytic activity, the stability of the samples is another significant factor for its practical application 54.The photocatalytic degradation activity of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs composite for CIP had no obvious decrease during the five cycles (still higher than 75, as shown in Fig. 5d), suggesting the excellent photocatalytic stability of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs under simulated sunlight irradiation.As a comparison, the recycling tests of HHBs and BiOCl nanosheet samples were also investigated.It could be found that the photocatalytic stability of HHBs sample for CIP degradation was decreased in the absence of elements doping but higher than that of BiOCl nanosheet sample, indicating the improved photocatalytic stability after morphology controlling and elements doping.Besides, the stability of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample can also be certified via SEM and XRD analysis of used sample.As can be seen from Fig. S3, the crystal structure and morphology of the sample did not show significant changes.As a result, it was confirmed that the structure and degradation performance of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs could be maintained at least for five cycling experiment.In addition to remarkable photodegradation performance for CIP, the Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample also showed excellent photodegradation performance for RhB solution, as a simulated organic dye pollutant, under simulated sunlight irradiation.As the increasing of light irradiation time, the color of the RhB solution tends to change from red to colorless (Fig. S4a).As depicted in Fig. S4b, 97.92 and 47.3 of RhB were degraded after 30 min with the existence of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs and HHBs, respectively, suggesting the improved photocatalytic activity of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs.The k value of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs for RhB degradation was obtained to be 0.144 min -1 (Fig. S4c), which was 10 times higher than that of HHBs (0.014 min -1 ).Table S1 showed a comparison of RhB and CIP degradation efficiency over different photocatalysts.It can be seen that the as-prepared sample showed better photocatalytic activity than other catalysts with higher or similar concentration.Therefore, these results suggesting that the Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample can be effectively used in effluent treatment. To further demonstrate the excellent photocatalytic performance of Pt y /N x -HHBs, photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into fuels was investigated under the simulated sunlight irradiation for eight hours.The reaction was investigated in NaOH (0.2 M) solution to improve the solubility of carbon dioxide, where some certain carbonates species can form.Then, these carbonates adsorb on the surface of photocatalyst thus increasing the possibility of CO 2 reduction reaction at ambient temperature and pressure 55.The different control experiments like purging N 2 instead of CO 2 , without light irradiation or photocatalyst dosage were performed during the reaction.The results of control experiments did not show a significant CO 2 photoreduction activity, indicating that the photoreduction reaction was absolutely due to photocatalysis and the CO 2 was indeed the carbon source.It can be monitored that the main products of CO 2 reduction were ethanol and methanol, and there were no obvious other products can be found in the liquid system.Fig. 6a depicted the yield of ethanol and methanol depend on the light irradiation time over the different as-prepared samples.It was found that the yield of ethanol and methanol was increased gradually with the increasement of irradiation time.Compared to pure HHBs, the N 0.25 -HHBs and Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs composites both showed the better photocatalytic performance in CO 2 reduction, which can be in a good agreement with degradation experiment results.After 8 h, the yields of methanol and ethanol for N 0.25 -HHBs sample can up to 213.9 and 75.6 mol/g cat , respectively, which were obviously higher than those of pure HHBs.It can be seen from the previous literatures 56,57, the doped nitrogen in the catalyst can form a (N-C) bond with the carbon in CO 2 , thus greatly increasing the carbon dioxide adsorption capacity, which can also boost the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction efficiency of N 0.25 -HHBs sample.After the deposition of Pt, the methanol and ethanol yields in 8 h can be further increased to 328.7 and 113.2 mol/g cat , respectively, which can be attribute to the improved separation efficiency of photoexcited electron-hole pairs due to the trapping role of metallic Pt.As shown in the inset of Fig. 6a, the methanol and ethanol production rates over Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs reached 41.08 and 14.15 mol/hg cat , respectively, which were 3.37 and 3.76 times higher than those of HHBs.It can be seen from Table S2, the as-prepared sample showed relatively superior photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction than the other catalysts mentioned in previous literature.It was found that Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs also exhibited stable photoreduction activity for CO 2 within 4 cycles (Fig. 6b).From above results, it can be concluded that the decoration of HHBs via Pt/N codoped can be a promising photocatalyst for both organic pollutant photodegradation and CO 2 photoreduction. The transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers in photocatalysis process are another crucial problem of photocatalytic activity 58.The N/Pt codoping and special morphology structure of HHBs can accelerate the charge transfer and hence inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers.Then, this can be confirmed by the investigation of transient photocurrent responses of the samples under the simulated sunlight irradiation, as shown in Fig. 7a.In all cyclic experiments, the photocurrent density increased sharply when the sample was illuminated, and decreased rapidly when the light was turned off.It can be observed that the Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs composite had the highest photocurrent density, followed by Pt 1 /HHBs and N 0.25 -HHBs, while the HHBs composite showed the lowest photocurrent density.After five cycles, the photocurrent density remained stable and renewable.It should be noted that a stronger photocurrent density suggests the more efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers 59. The EIS was investigated to further confirm the interface transfer performance and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.What is widely accepted that the smaller radius of circular arc in EIS Nyquist curves indicates the better separation efficiency of electronhole pairs 60,61.As depicted in EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 7b), Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs composite showed the minimum arc radius among the all asprepared samples, suggesting the enhanced charge separation efficiency after Pt/N codoped.To further reveal the improved charge separation, the Bode-phase plots of as-prepared samples were given in Fig. 7c.It can be seen that the characteristic frequency peaks of decorated HHBs samples slightly lower than that of single HHBs, in which the Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs showed the lowest frequency.Since the lifetime () of the injected electrons is definitely related to the frequency (f): 1/(2f), it can be seen that the peak shifts to a lower frequency reflects a more rapid electron transport process 62.Notably, according to the above equation, it is obvious that the electron lifetime of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs was higher than that of other samples, indicating the faster charge transfer and greatly inhibited charge recombination in Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample. The influence of co-doped N and Pt on the charge properties of asprepared samples was further investigated by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy ( excitation 325 nm), and the results were shown in Fig. 7d.PL spectrum is an effectively method to evaluate the separation rate of photogenerated charge carriers in photocatalyst particles 63,64.Mostly, a lower PL intensity suggests a higher separation rate of photogenerated charge carriers.As can be seen from the PL spectrum, the PL intensity of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample was remarkably lower than N 0.25 -HHBs which was lower than HHBs as well, suggesting its higher separation rate of photogenerated carriers.Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs can remarkably restrain the recombination of charge carriers due to the existence of Pt nanoparticles as an electron trap to enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 65.Besides, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of HHBs could transfer to the Pt surface, thus inhibiting the recombination of electron-hole pairs 41. CO 2 -TPD was conducted to reveal the CO 2 adsorption performance of as-prepared samples, as shown in Fig. S5.Commonly, the desorption peak area reflects the number of active sites on the surface of the catalyst, while the desorption temperature reflects the adsorption strength of the corresponding species on the active sites 66.According to the figure, all samples showed a strong peak at around 250-350 C, which is generally considered as a medium-strong CO 2 adsorption peak of catalyst, suggesting that all samples have CO 2 adsorption capacity.With the doping of N, the adsorption peak area of N-HHBs was significantly larger than that of HHBs.For Pt doped N-HHBs, it can be found that the adsorption peak area further increased compared with that of N-HHBs, indicating that the adsorption capacity of the adsorption site is enhanced after platinum doping.It can be seen from the above result that Pt/N-HHBs and N-HHBs have a better basic site type and distribution than pure HHBs.This is a critical matter why the decorated samples were more active than HHBs in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In order to examine the main active species in the photocatalytic degradation, a series of radical trapping experiments were conducted in the existence of EDTA, and benzoquinone (BQ), isopropanol (IPA) scavengers for trapping h , O 2-and OH, respectively.It can be clearly seen from the Fig. 8a that the decomposition efficiency of CIP over the samples were significantly decreased with the existence of BQ and EDTA, suggesting that O 2-and h were generated during the degradation process of CIP as active species.However, it should be noted that the h species was the main contributing ones rather than O 2 -for removal of CIP over N 0.25 -HHBs, while the O 2 -was the main contributing ones over Pt 1 -HHBs photocatalysts.Significantly, both of the O 2 -and h species played a dominant role in the Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs composite system, which might be contributing to the synergistic effect of the N and Pt elements.According to the trapping experiment results, the possible reactions were proposed to explain the degradation mechanism of the pollutants, as follows: (2) (3) To estimate the band structure of HHBs, Fig. S4d showed the Mott-Sckottky plot with HHBs being working electrodes.The V fb (flat potential) of HHBs obtained from the intercept of linear region was -0.378 eV (vs Ag/AgCl at pH 7), and the positive slope indicated that the as-prepared sample was a n-type semiconductor.Whereafter, the value of V fb was converted to NHE potential via E(NHE) E(Ag/ AgCl) 0.197 eV.In general, the conduction band (CB) of n-type semiconductor is considered to be 0-0.1 eV higher than the V fb , relying on the carrier concentration and electron effective mass 676869.Here, the V fb was considered to be about 0.05 eV below the CB, and CB of HHBs was calculated to be -0.231eV vs. NHE.Obviously, the CB of HHBs was higher than E(O 2 /O 2 -) -0.046eV, but lower than the redox potentials of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (-0.38 eV, Eq. ( 4)) and CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (-0.33 eV vs. NHE, pH 7, Eq. ( 5 8) and ( 9)) 70,71.Furthermore, there was no gas like CH 4 or CO produced in this system, which can be attributed to a fact that the gas products like CO and CH 4 can be only produced via photoreduction of CO 2 molecule 72,73.Besides, the CB of HHBs was lower than the redox potentials of CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24eV, Eq. ( 6)) and CO 2 /CO (-0.53 eV vs. NHE, pH 7, Eq. ( 7)). According to the above experiments and characterization results, the proposed organic pollutant degradation and CO 2 photoreductrion mechanism over Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs were illustrated in Fig. 8b.First, the doping of N introduced an impurity energy level above the VB of Pt 1 / N 0.25 -HHBs, inducing a greater light absorption range, thus improved the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.There is no denying that the electrons can be easily photoexcited from impurity energy level to the CB of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs under the light irradiation.Then, driven by the trapping role of Pt, the electrons in the CB of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs would be transferred to the surface of Pt, which could further enhance the separation of charge carriers.At the same time, a Schottky barrier was formed at the interface between Pt and N 0.25 -HHBs, which inhibited the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.Accordingly, more methanol (ethanol) and O 2 -were formed owing to the more electrons reacting with CO 3 2-and oxygen, respectively.The separation of photogenerated electrons leads to a certain amount of h being collected in the impurity energy level introduced by N doping and then degrades the organic pollutant.Hence, combining all factors discussed above, the significantly improved photocatalytic activity of Pt 1 / N 0.25 -HHBs could be attributed to the scattering effect and surface reflecting resulted from the special hierarchical architecture, N doping that narrows the Eg, and Pt that promotes the charge transfer and carrier separation."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Typically, the 100 mL of pollutant solution suspended with photocatalysts was continuously stirred in the dark to obtain the equilibrium adsorption-desorption, then the mixture was exposed to a 300 W Xenon light source.", "context": "The as-prepared Pt and N co-doped HHBs was prepared via a in situ hydrothermal process.In detail, 0.011 g PVP (K30), 1.2 mmol of ammonium citrate and a certain amount of KCl were dissolved into 94 mL deionized water, and stirred for 30 min at 88 C.Subsequently, 6 mL of 0.15 mol/L Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O-HNO 3 solution was dropwise added into the above solution followed by continuous stirring for 2 h.Then, a certain amount of H 2 PtCl 6 solution (1 mg/mL) was dropwise added into the solution.After being stirred for another 1 h, the resulting precursor solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave Scheme 1.

The different control experiments like purging N 2 instead of CO 2 , without light irradiation or photocatalyst dosage were performed during the reaction. The results of control experiments did not show a significant CO 2 photoreduction activity, indicating that the photoreduction reaction was absolutely due to photocatalysis and the CO 2 was indeed the carbon source. It can be monitored that the main products of CO 2 reduction were ethanol and methanol, and there were no obvious other products can be found in the liquid system.", "context": "As shown in Fig. 1a, the crystal structures of as-prepared pure HHBs, N-HHBs and Pt/N-HHBs were investigated by XRD.Both of the main diffraction peaks of these as-prepared samples can be well indexed to the standard XRD card of tetragonal phase BiOCl (JCPDS No. 06-0249) 42, demonstrating that the unique crystal structure of HHBs was reserved after introducing the N and Pt.The diffraction peaks at 11.9, 25.9, 32.5, 33.4, 40.9, 46.6, 49.7, 54.1, and 58.6were corresponded to (0 0 1), (1 0 1), (1 1 0), (1 0 2), (1 1 2), (2 0 0), (1 1 3), (2 1 1), and (2 1 2) plans of BiOCl, respectively.As for pure HHBs, the peak (0 0 1) was attributed to the stacked CleBieOeBieCl layers along the c axis, shown in inset of Fig. 1b.The CleBieOeBieCl structures are composed of Bi 2 O 2 layers sandwiched between two Cl m layers and the structure held together by van der Walls interaction force along the c axis 18.The intensities of XRD diffraction peak could be used to indentify different growth orientations of crystal facet 42.The (1 1 0) peak at 32.5was relatively strong, which is perpendicular to the plane (0 0 1), indicating that the as-prepared BiOCl crystal grows preferentially along 1 1 0 direction.After the deposition of Pt, a weak diffraction peak at 2 39.76forPt can be observed, which could be indexed to the standard XRD card of metallic Pt (JCPDS No. 04-0802).In the inset of Fig. 1a, the diffraction peak (0 0 1) shifted slightly towards a higher angle after N doping, indicating that the N ion replaced the O in the crystal lattice of HHBs 43.Besides, no any other impurity peaks were observed in Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs, revealing that the doping of N and Pt had not influence the lattice structure of HHBs.To further testify the presence of the surface Pt, the EDS spectra of Pt 1 / N 0.25 -HHBs sample was determined.Fig. 1b illustrated the EDS analysis of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs where the weight percentage of Bi, O, Cl, N and Pt was about 76.99, 9.85, 5.57, 2.92 and 4.67, respectively, further certifying the existence of N and Pt. The specific microstructures and morphologies of as-prepared samples were further investigated via SEM, TEM and HRTEM.As depicted in SEM image (Fig. 2a), the HHBs was self-assembled by numerous interleaving nanosheets with small thickness, which can induce the effective separation of photocarriers to improve the photocatalytic activity, and the diameter of HHBs was around 1.5 um.As shown in Fig. S1, in the absence of PVP, the obtained BiOCl showed a nanoplate morphology.However, after addition of different concentrations of citric acid with PVP, the morphology of BiOCl gradually changed from nanoflower to hollow microspheres.Hence, we conclude that the exist of PVP in the system has played an important role in the formation of self-assembled flower-like and hollow microspherical superstructures.Notably, it can be observed that the formation of the hollow spherical structure may be ascribed to the strong synergetic effect between PVP and citric acid.After N and Pt decoration (Fig. 2b), the structure morphology of samples was nearly unchanged, which may be attributed to much lower loading content of the two elements.It can be seen from the TEM image (Fig. 2c) that the Pt had uniformly dispersed on the HHBs with an average size of about 4 nm, indicating that the Pt was successfully loaded on the surface of HHBs, which was consistent with the results of XRD and EDS.HRTEM image of as-prepared sample (Fig. 2d) showed the clear plane (1 1 0) interplanar spacing of 0.280 nm, which was in agreement with the (1 1 0) diffraction peak of XRD pattern of tetragonal phase BiOCl.Meanwhile, there existed a clear lattice fringes (0.196 nm), which was corresponding to (2 0 0) plane of Pt, certifying the existence of Pt.The elemental mapping images (Fig. 2e) showed the element distribution of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs, and it can The detailed information about the chemical states of all elements in Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample was investigated via XPS spectra, as shown in Fig. 3.As depicted in the survey scan spectrum (Fig. 3a), the peaks of Bi, O, Cl elements could be identified in the pure HHBs samples whereas additional peak of N and Pt element observed in as-prepared Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample, which was in conformity to the result of EDS.Besides, the additional peak of C 1s in survey spectrum could be attribute to the instrument itself 44.Furthermore, the high resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f was shown in Fig. 3b, which can be divided into two peaks at 159.06 and 164.55 eV, corresponding to Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 of Bi 3 , respectively 45.The binding energy at 529.82 eV in O 1s spectra (Fig. 3c) was corresponding to O 2-of BieO bond in the sample, and the peak located at 531.34 eV can be attributed to the chemisorbed oxygen 46.The Cl 2p spectra in Fig. 3d demonstrated two peaks at 199.51 and 197.89 eV, which were ascribed to Cl 2p 1/2 and Cl 2p 3/2 , respectively, indicating the existence of Cl -ions.In addition, Fig. 3e presents the XPS spectra of doping element N 1s, where the binding energy at 399.82 eV can be assigned to BieN bond in the BiOCl lattice 43,47.Also, as shown in Fig. 3f, the double peaks at 73.36 and 76.54 eV were assigned to Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 , respectively, and the Pt was in the chemical state of Pt 0 based on the results of binding energy in literatures 48,49.Hence, depending on these results, we concluded that the co-doping of N and Pt on hollow hierarchical BiOCl sphere can be obtained by the present synthesis method. To clarify the effects of modification elements on the photocatalytic performance of HHBs, the optical absorption properties were investigated by DRS spectrum in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm, as shown in Fig. 4a.For HHBs, the pores on the surface of catalyst could provide light transfer paths for distribution of light into the inner surfaces of porous architecture (Scheme S1), hence the light activation can be notably improved due to the multiple reflections of light within the chamber of catalyst.As depicted in Fig. S2, the HHBs had a somewhat higher light absorption capacity than ordinary spherical BiOCl, which can be attribute to such multiple reflections of light.The adsorption edge of shifted from about 374 nm to nearly 407 nm after N doping.Comparatively, after further deposition of Pt on the surface of N-HHBs, the light absorption range of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs gradually extended meanwhile the intensity relatively enhanced, which could be ascribed to the plasma resonance effect of Pt nano-particles 50. Based on the DRS spectrum, the band gap (Eg) of as-prepared samples had been calculated through the Tauc equation 51: (h) 2/ n A(h -Eg), where h, , A and Eg represent the photon energy, absorption coefficient, a proportional constant and the band gap, respectively.In above equation, the n value depends on the type of optical transition of a semiconductor material (for direct transition n 1 and for indirect transition n 4) and here the n is 4 for HHBs 42.Then, the band gaps of as-prepared samples can be calculated from the plots of (h) 1/2 h relationship, as shown in the Fig. 4b.The Eg of a semiconductor is decided by the linear region of above plots, which is located above the optical absorption edge.Correspondingly, the corresponding Eg of HHBs, N 0.25 -HHBs, Pt 1 /HHBs and Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs composite photocatalysts were calculated to be 3.31 eV, 3.04 eV, 2.75 eV and 2.41 eV, respectively.It can be found that the band gap of HHBs was decreased (from 3.31 eV to 3.04 eV) after N doping, and the band gap of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample was narrow down to 2.75 eV after Pt was loaded on the surface of N 0.25 -HHBs.The results showed that the decoration of N and Pt can narrow down the Eg of semiconductor, and thus improving the visible light adsorption, which was in good agreement with the conclusion of previous literature reports 36,52. The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples was evaluated via decomposition of model pollutant CIP, which represents the antibiotic contaminants, under simulated sunlight irradiation.As typical photocatalytic degradation was shown in Fig. 5a, the Abs values of pollutants notably decreased with increasing of time.The photodegradation curves (c/c 0 ) of CIP with and without Pt y /N x -HHBs photocatalysts with different amount of Pt and N modification were shown in Fig. 5b.As can be seen in the figure, the concentration of CIP without photocatalyst was almost not changed both in dark and under simulated sunlight irradiation, suggesting the stability of CIP.In initial 30 min in the dark, the concentration of CIP with as-prepared samples was decreased somewhat, indicating the improved adsorption capacity due to the particular hollow hierarchical architecture of HHBs.From 30 min to 60 min in the dark, the removal efficiency of CIP was negligible, indicating that the system had established the adsorption-desorption equilibrium.Compared with the as-prepared HHBs (44.97) and Inversely, the introduction of higher content of Pt will covers the active sites of N 0.25 -HHBs, thus hinder the carriers transport at the electrolyte/semiconductor interface 50.Furthermore, the photocatalytic degradation of CIP was further analyzed by kinetic equation.The reaction rate (k) can be obtained via the slopes of the following pseudo-first-order kinetics plot 37,53: -ln (C/C 0 ) kt (Fig. 5c), where C 0 and C represent the concentration of CIP at light irradiation times of 0 (min) and t (min), and k (min -1 ) is the apparent reaction rate constant.As is well known, the higher k value indicates the higher photocatalytic activity.It can be discovered that Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs had the highest k value (0.011 min -1 ) for the decomposition of CIP, which was 2.2 and 3.6 times higher than that of N 0.25 -HHBs (0.005 min -1 ) and pure HHBs (0.003 min -1 ), respectively, which further suggested the best photocatalytic degradation activity of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs.The excellent photocatalytic performance of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs may be due to its complicated surface structures, excellent lightharvesting abilities, and considerably photogenerated electron-holes separation efficiency. In addition to photocatalytic activity, the stability of the samples is another significant factor for its practical application 54.The photocatalytic degradation activity of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs composite for CIP had no obvious decrease during the five cycles (still higher than 75, as shown in Fig. 5d), suggesting the excellent photocatalytic stability of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs under simulated sunlight irradiation.As a comparison, the recycling tests of HHBs and BiOCl nanosheet samples were also investigated.It could be found that the photocatalytic stability of HHBs sample for CIP degradation was decreased in the absence of elements doping but higher than that of BiOCl nanosheet sample, indicating the improved photocatalytic stability after morphology controlling and elements doping.Besides, the stability of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample can also be certified via SEM and XRD analysis of used sample.As can be seen from Fig. S3, the crystal structure and morphology of the sample did not show significant changes.As a result, it was confirmed that the structure and degradation performance of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs could be maintained at least for five cycling experiment.In addition to remarkable photodegradation performance for CIP, the Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample also showed excellent photodegradation performance for RhB solution, as a simulated organic dye pollutant, under simulated sunlight irradiation.As the increasing of light irradiation time, the color of the RhB solution tends to change from red to colorless (Fig. S4a).As depicted in Fig. S4b, 97.92 and 47.3 of RhB were degraded after 30 min with the existence of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs and HHBs, respectively, suggesting the improved photocatalytic activity of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs.The k value of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs for RhB degradation was obtained to be 0.144 min -1 (Fig. S4c), which was 10 times higher than that of HHBs (0.014 min -1 ).Table S1 showed a comparison of RhB and CIP degradation efficiency over different photocatalysts.It can be seen that the as-prepared sample showed better photocatalytic activity than other catalysts with higher or similar concentration.Therefore, these results suggesting that the Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample can be effectively used in effluent treatment. To further demonstrate the excellent photocatalytic performance of Pt y /N x -HHBs, photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into fuels was investigated under the simulated sunlight irradiation for eight hours.The reaction was investigated in NaOH (0.2 M) solution to improve the solubility of carbon dioxide, where some certain carbonates species can form.Then, these carbonates adsorb on the surface of photocatalyst thus increasing the possibility of CO 2 reduction reaction at ambient temperature and pressure 55.The different control experiments like purging N 2 instead of CO 2 , without light irradiation or photocatalyst dosage were performed during the reaction.The results of control experiments did not show a significant CO 2 photoreduction activity, indicating that the photoreduction reaction was absolutely due to photocatalysis and the CO 2 was indeed the carbon source.It can be monitored that the main products of CO 2 reduction were ethanol and methanol, and there were no obvious other products can be found in the liquid system.Fig. 6a depicted the yield of ethanol and methanol depend on the light irradiation time over the different as-prepared samples.It was found that the yield of ethanol and methanol was increased gradually with the increasement of irradiation time.Compared to pure HHBs, the N 0.25 -HHBs and Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs composites both showed the better photocatalytic performance in CO 2 reduction, which can be in a good agreement with degradation experiment results.After 8 h, the yields of methanol and ethanol for N 0.25 -HHBs sample can up to 213.9 and 75.6 mol/g cat , respectively, which were obviously higher than those of pure HHBs.It can be seen from the previous literatures 56,57, the doped nitrogen in the catalyst can form a (N-C) bond with the carbon in CO 2 , thus greatly increasing the carbon dioxide adsorption capacity, which can also boost the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction efficiency of N 0.25 -HHBs sample.After the deposition of Pt, the methanol and ethanol yields in 8 h can be further increased to 328.7 and 113.2 mol/g cat , respectively, which can be attribute to the improved separation efficiency of photoexcited electron-hole pairs due to the trapping role of metallic Pt.As shown in the inset of Fig. 6a, the methanol and ethanol production rates over Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs reached 41.08 and 14.15 mol/hg cat , respectively, which were 3.37 and 3.76 times higher than those of HHBs.It can be seen from Table S2, the as-prepared sample showed relatively superior photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction than the other catalysts mentioned in previous literature.It was found that Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs also exhibited stable photoreduction activity for CO 2 within 4 cycles (Fig. 6b).From above results, it can be concluded that the decoration of HHBs via Pt/N codoped can be a promising photocatalyst for both organic pollutant photodegradation and CO 2 photoreduction. The transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers in photocatalysis process are another crucial problem of photocatalytic activity 58.The N/Pt codoping and special morphology structure of HHBs can accelerate the charge transfer and hence inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers.Then, this can be confirmed by the investigation of transient photocurrent responses of the samples under the simulated sunlight irradiation, as shown in Fig. 7a.In all cyclic experiments, the photocurrent density increased sharply when the sample was illuminated, and decreased rapidly when the light was turned off.It can be observed that the Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs composite had the highest photocurrent density, followed by Pt 1 /HHBs and N 0.25 -HHBs, while the HHBs composite showed the lowest photocurrent density.After five cycles, the photocurrent density remained stable and renewable.It should be noted that a stronger photocurrent density suggests the more efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers 59. The EIS was investigated to further confirm the interface transfer performance and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.What is widely accepted that the smaller radius of circular arc in EIS Nyquist curves indicates the better separation efficiency of electronhole pairs 60,61.As depicted in EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 7b), Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs composite showed the minimum arc radius among the all asprepared samples, suggesting the enhanced charge separation efficiency after Pt/N codoped.To further reveal the improved charge separation, the Bode-phase plots of as-prepared samples were given in Fig. 7c.It can be seen that the characteristic frequency peaks of decorated HHBs samples slightly lower than that of single HHBs, in which the Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs showed the lowest frequency.Since the lifetime () of the injected electrons is definitely related to the frequency (f): 1/(2f), it can be seen that the peak shifts to a lower frequency reflects a more rapid electron transport process 62.Notably, according to the above equation, it is obvious that the electron lifetime of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs was higher than that of other samples, indicating the faster charge transfer and greatly inhibited charge recombination in Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample. The influence of co-doped N and Pt on the charge properties of asprepared samples was further investigated by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy ( excitation 325 nm), and the results were shown in Fig. 7d.PL spectrum is an effectively method to evaluate the separation rate of photogenerated charge carriers in photocatalyst particles 63,64.Mostly, a lower PL intensity suggests a higher separation rate of photogenerated charge carriers.As can be seen from the PL spectrum, the PL intensity of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs sample was remarkably lower than N 0.25 -HHBs which was lower than HHBs as well, suggesting its higher separation rate of photogenerated carriers.Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs can remarkably restrain the recombination of charge carriers due to the existence of Pt nanoparticles as an electron trap to enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 65.Besides, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of HHBs could transfer to the Pt surface, thus inhibiting the recombination of electron-hole pairs 41. CO 2 -TPD was conducted to reveal the CO 2 adsorption performance of as-prepared samples, as shown in Fig. S5.Commonly, the desorption peak area reflects the number of active sites on the surface of the catalyst, while the desorption temperature reflects the adsorption strength of the corresponding species on the active sites 66.According to the figure, all samples showed a strong peak at around 250-350 C, which is generally considered as a medium-strong CO 2 adsorption peak of catalyst, suggesting that all samples have CO 2 adsorption capacity.With the doping of N, the adsorption peak area of N-HHBs was significantly larger than that of HHBs.For Pt doped N-HHBs, it can be found that the adsorption peak area further increased compared with that of N-HHBs, indicating that the adsorption capacity of the adsorption site is enhanced after platinum doping.It can be seen from the above result that Pt/N-HHBs and N-HHBs have a better basic site type and distribution than pure HHBs.This is a critical matter why the decorated samples were more active than HHBs in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . In order to examine the main active species in the photocatalytic degradation, a series of radical trapping experiments were conducted in the existence of EDTA, and benzoquinone (BQ), isopropanol (IPA) scavengers for trapping h , O 2-and OH, respectively.It can be clearly seen from the Fig. 8a that the decomposition efficiency of CIP over the samples were significantly decreased with the existence of BQ and EDTA, suggesting that O 2-and h were generated during the degradation process of CIP as active species.However, it should be noted that the h species was the main contributing ones rather than O 2 -for removal of CIP over N 0.25 -HHBs, while the O 2 -was the main contributing ones over Pt 1 -HHBs photocatalysts.Significantly, both of the O 2 -and h species played a dominant role in the Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs composite system, which might be contributing to the synergistic effect of the N and Pt elements.According to the trapping experiment results, the possible reactions were proposed to explain the degradation mechanism of the pollutants, as follows: (2) (3) To estimate the band structure of HHBs, Fig. S4d showed the Mott-Sckottky plot with HHBs being working electrodes.The V fb (flat potential) of HHBs obtained from the intercept of linear region was -0.378 eV (vs Ag/AgCl at pH 7), and the positive slope indicated that the as-prepared sample was a n-type semiconductor.Whereafter, the value of V fb was converted to NHE potential via E(NHE) E(Ag/ AgCl) 0.197 eV.In general, the conduction band (CB) of n-type semiconductor is considered to be 0-0.1 eV higher than the V fb , relying on the carrier concentration and electron effective mass 676869.Here, the V fb was considered to be about 0.05 eV below the CB, and CB of HHBs was calculated to be -0.231eV vs. NHE.Obviously, the CB of HHBs was higher than E(O 2 /O 2 -) -0.046eV, but lower than the redox potentials of CO 2 /CH 3 OH (-0.38 eV, Eq. ( 4)) and CO 2 /C 2 H 5 OH (-0.33 eV vs. NHE, pH 7, Eq. ( 5 8) and ( 9)) 70,71.Furthermore, there was no gas like CH 4 or CO produced in this system, which can be attributed to a fact that the gas products like CO and CH 4 can be only produced via photoreduction of CO 2 molecule 72,73.Besides, the CB of HHBs was lower than the redox potentials of CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24eV, Eq. ( 6)) and CO 2 /CO (-0.53 eV vs. NHE, pH 7, Eq. ( 7)). According to the above experiments and characterization results, the proposed organic pollutant degradation and CO 2 photoreductrion mechanism over Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs were illustrated in Fig. 8b.First, the doping of N introduced an impurity energy level above the VB of Pt 1 / N 0.25 -HHBs, inducing a greater light absorption range, thus improved the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.There is no denying that the electrons can be easily photoexcited from impurity energy level to the CB of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs under the light irradiation.Then, driven by the trapping role of Pt, the electrons in the CB of Pt 1 /N 0.25 -HHBs would be transferred to the surface of Pt, which could further enhance the separation of charge carriers.At the same time, a Schottky barrier was formed at the interface between Pt and N 0.25 -HHBs, which inhibited the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.Accordingly, more methanol (ethanol) and O 2 -were formed owing to the more electrons reacting with CO 3 2-and oxygen, respectively.The separation of photogenerated electrons leads to a certain amount of h being collected in the impurity energy level introduced by N doping and then degrades the organic pollutant.Hence, combining all factors discussed above, the significantly improved photocatalytic activity of Pt 1 / N 0.25 -HHBs could be attributed to the scattering effect and surface reflecting resulted from the special hierarchical architecture, N doping that narrows the Eg, and Pt that promotes the charge transfer and carrier separation."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "Typically, the 100 mL of pollutant solution suspended with photocatalysts was continuously stirred in the dark to obtain the equilibrium adsorption-desorption, then the mixture was exposed to a 300 W Xenon light source.", "context": "The as-prepared Pt and N co-doped HHBs was prepared via a in situ hydrothermal process.In detail, 0.011 g PVP (K30), 1.2 mmol of ammonium citrate and a certain amount of KCl were dissolved into 94 mL deionized water, and stirred for 30 min at 88 C.Subsequently, 6 mL of 0.15 mol/L Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O-HNO 3 solution was dropwise added into the above solution followed by continuous stirring for 2 h.Then, a certain amount of H 2 PtCl 6 solution (1 mg/mL) was dropwise added into the solution.After being stirred for another 1 h, the resulting precursor solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave Scheme 1.
