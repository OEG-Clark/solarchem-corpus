All samples exhibited a tetragonal structure of anatase TiO 2 according to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) card (no.21-1272) 23.The strong diffraction peaks at 2 24.83,37.42, 47.41, 53.33, 54.84, 62.26, 69.52, and 74.68correspond to the (101), (004), ( 200), (105), ( 221), (204), (220), and (215) planes, respectively.In addition, the reflection peaks located at 2 22.9, 23.4, 24.1, 26.3, 28.3, 33.9, 41.3, 49.6, and 55.2for all samples can be indexed to the (020), (002), ( 200), (120), (112), (202), ( 222), (140), and (420) facets of the hexagonal WO 3 structure (JCPDS card no.33-1387), respectively 18.The (200), (220), and (311) diffraction peaks for face-centered cubic Au (JCPDS card no.01-1174) appeared for all samples at 2 44.5,64.2, and 76.6, respectively.Furthermore, no reflection peaks of Pd were observed in all XRD patterns because either a small amount of Pd was present or the crystallite size of Pd nanoparticles was too small.Based on the Debye-Scherrer formula, the crystal sizes of TiO 2 and WO 3 were estimated to be approximately 10.8 and 24.6 nm, respectively. TEM was further used to study the microstructure of 0.5 wt Pd- 7a.As illustrated in Fig. 7b, the O 1 s XPS spectrum, which has a main peak centered around 529.3 eV, corresponds to that of Ti-O-Ti from the lattice (oxygen in anatase TiO 2 ).From Fig. 7c, two binding energy peaks are present at approximately 34.9 and 36.7 eV that can be assigned to W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 , respectively, and these are associated with the valence of W 6 in WO 3 .Two binding energy peaks are located at approximately 335.6 and 339.4 eV (Fig. 7d), which can be ascribed to Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 , respectively.These indicate the formation of Pdnanoparticles (metallic Pd).As depicted in Fig. 7e, the XPS spectrum of Au 4f of the as-prepared Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 exhibit two peaks at approximately 82 and 88.4 eV that can be assigned to Au 4f 7/2 and Au 4f 5/2 , respectively, and are attributed to Au in the metallic state (Au).The bimetals Pd and Au coexisted on the 0.5 wt Pd-0.1 wt Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 . PL analysis was performed to study the interfacial charge transfer and separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons and holes in the obtained photocatalysts.PL spectra of TiO 2 , TiO 2 -WO 3 , 0.5 wt Pd/TiO 2 -WO 3 , and 0.5 wt Pd-0.1 wt Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 were compared at room temperature, with the results illustrated in Fig. 8. TiO 2 displayed an intense PL emission peak at approximately 510 nm, which can be attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to the TiO 2 valance band, whereas TiO 2 -WO 3 demonstrated lower photoluminescence intensity, likely because the WO 3 played a key role in surface charge-hole separation.The emission peak intensity of Pd/TiO 2 -WO 3 and Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 decreased dramatically and shifted slightly to a higher wavelength, which can be explained by a decrease of the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs produced by noble metal doping, which was in accordance with the UV-vis spectra results. The BET specific surface areas of TiO 2 , TiO 2 -WO 3 , and Pd-Au/ TiO 2 -WO 3 are listed in Table 2.The surface areas were 47.2, 40.4,and 72.2 m 2 g -1 for TiO 2 , TiO 2 -WO 3 , and Pd-Au/TiO 2 WO 3 , respectively.After loading WO 3 , the specific surface area of TiO 2 -WO 3 slightly decreased, which was likely caused by the presence of WO 3 not making a substantial morphological change to the surface of TiO 2 .However, an increase in the BET surface area was observed in Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 , which may have been caused by the dispersion of TiO 2 -WO 3 by Au and Pd nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained photocatalysts was evaluated using CO 2 photoreduction.CO and CH 4 gas products were observed.The photocatalytic results for the CH 4 and CO yield versus reaction time are presented in Fig. 9.All photocatalysts showed a gradual increase in yields of both CH 4 and CO along with the irradiation time.The results in Fig. 9 reveal that it preceded a long reaction time and that the product yield versus reaction time curve was linear.Highpurity 99.99 CO 2 gas was also used; thus, the carbon source was primarily from CO 2 .Among the photocatalysts, 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/ TiO 2 -WO 3 exhibited the highest CO 2 photoreduction efficiency (Table 3).The maximum CH 4 yield was 39.1 mol g -1 h -1 over 0.5 wt Pd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 compared with 0.9 mol g -1 h -1 from using TiO 2 alone.The evolution rate of CO over 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/ TiO 2 -WO 3 was approximately 271.3 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 247 times higher than that of TiO 2 alone (1.1 mol g -1 h -1 ).Fig. 9 and Table 3 also provide details on the bimetallic promotion effect (CH 4 :39.1 mol g -1 h -1 ), demonstrating that this effect was stronger than that of single Pd metal (CH 4 :15.1 mol g -1 h -1 ).The enhanced photocatalytic performance of 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 was likely because of the relatively high specific surface area (72.7 m 2 /g), as listed in Table 2. Additionally, the active reactive site numbers increased.Another reason is the high UV-vis range absorption (Figs. 5 and6) and low recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.As indicated by the PL spectra (Fig. 8), the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs produced by doping with two noble metals (Pd and Au) was reduced. A cyclic parallel test was performed to evaluate the stability and recyclability of 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 .As shown in Fig. 10, no significant loss of photocatalytic activities occurred (the yield of CO and CH 4 ) after 60 days.Additionally, the error bar (double standard deviation value) was small.The carbon source was confirmed to have primarily come from CO 2 .Moreover, the as-prepared photocatalyst was indicated to possess excellent recyclability and long-term stability for practical application.A quantum yield was calculated using the parameters of production yields (Fig. 9 and Table 3), power of photons (140 W m -2 ), and wavelength ( 400 nm) of the power in the system 32.The quantum yields of the photocatalytic system depicted in Fig. 9d were 1.05 and 1.82 of CH 4 and CO, respectively. Informed by the aforementioned experimental results and discussion, the overall proposed mechanism 23,30 for CO 2 photoreduction over 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 was determined.It is displayed in Fig. 11 and outlined in Eq. ( 1)-( 5 CO 2 and H 2 O molecules were adsorbed preferentially on the surface of 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 because of the relatively high specific surface area.Under visible light, 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 with a comparatively short band gap was photoexcited to generate electrons and holes (Eq.( 1)), and the photoexcited electrons were efficiently extracted using the Au and Pd nanoparticles.H 2 O molecules were oxidized by the photoexcited holes to form hydroxyl radicals (OH) and protons (H ) (Eq. ( 2)).The photoexcited electrons were then trapped by CO 2 molecules.This process could reduce the amount of CO 2 by producing CO (Eq.( 3)).The aforementioned photoexcited electrons and produced CO reacted with surface adsorbed CO 2 in the presence of protons to yield CH 4 (Eqs.( 4) and ( 5)) 23.The promotion effect from bimetal loading was caused by the Pd and Au nanoparticles acting as the electron-transfer mediator, rapidly transferring the photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 .Additionally, the photoexcited holes were transported to the surface of the 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 .Simultaneously, the Pd and Au nanoparticles acted as the CO 2 photoreduction active sites and improved the photocatalytic activity (Eqs.(3) to ( 5)).Owing to the lower valence band (VB) of WO 3 compared with that of TiO 2 , the holes on the VB of TiO 2 migrated to the VB of WO 3 .The reversed migration of the charge carriers efficiently inhibited recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs, leading to clearly enhanced CO 2 photoreduction.Another reason is the synergy effect, which was caused by the addition of bimetals (Fig. 11) 33, generated electrons from the Au surface plasma effect of irradiation that were transferred to Pd to improve the photocatalytic activity (Fig. 11).This can improve the activity of photocatalytic reactions (Eqs.(3) to ( 5))."}, {"llm generation": "0.5 wtPd/TiO 2 -WO 3", "source": "The XRD patterns were v0.5 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 , 0.5 wtPd/TiO 2 -WO 3 , and 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 , as illustrated in Fig. 2.", "context": "The XRD patterns were v0.5 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 , 0.5 wtPd/TiO 2 -WO 3 , and 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 , as illustrated in Fig. 2.

( 2)).The photoexcited electrons were then trapped by CO 2 molecules.This process could reduce the amount of CO 2 by producing CO (Eq.( 3)).The aforementioned photoexcited electrons and produced CO reacted with surface adsorbed CO 2 in the presence of protons to yield CH 4 (Eqs.( 4) and ( 5)) 23.The promotion effect from bimetal loading was caused by the Pd and Au nanoparticles acting as the electron-transfer mediator, rapidly transferring the photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 .Additionally, the photoexcited holes were transported to the surface of the 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 .Simultaneously, the Pd and Au nanoparticles acted as the CO 2 photoreduction active sites and improved the photocatalytic activity (Eqs.(3) to ( 5)).Owing to the lower valence band (VB) of WO 3 compared with that of TiO 2 , the holes on the VB of TiO 2 migrated to the VB of WO 3 .The reversed migration of the charge carriers efficiently inhibited recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs, leading to clearly enhanced CO 2 photoreduction.Another reason is the synergy effect, which was caused by the addition of bimetals (Fig. 11) 33, generated electrons from the Au surface plasma effect of irradiation that were transferred to Pd to improve the photocatalytic activity (Fig. 11).This can improve the activity of photocatalytic reactions (Eqs.(3) to ( 5))."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2", "source": "The maximum CH 4 yield was 39.1 mol g -1 h -1 over 0.5 wt Pd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 compared with 0.9 mol g -1 h -1 from using TiO 2 alone.", "context": "The XRD patterns were v0.5 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 , 0.5 wtPd/TiO 2 -WO 3 , and 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 , as illustrated in Fig. 2.

TEM was further used to study the microstructure of 0.5 wt Pd- 7a.As illustrated in Fig. 7b, the O 1 s XPS spectrum, which has a main peak centered around 529.3 eV, corresponds to that of Ti-O-Ti from the lattice (oxygen in anatase TiO 2 ).From Fig. 7c, two binding energy peaks are present at approximately 34.9 and 36.7 eV that can be assigned to W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 , respectively, and these are associated with the valence of W 6 in WO 3 .Two binding energy peaks are located at approximately 335.6 and 339.4 eV (Fig. 7d), which can be ascribed to Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 , respectively.These indicate the formation of Pdnanoparticles (metallic Pd).As depicted in Fig. 7e, the XPS spectrum of Au 4f of the as-prepared Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 exhibit two peaks at approximately 82 and 88.4 eV that can be assigned to Au 4f 7/2 and Au 4f 5/2 , respectively, and are attributed to Au in the metallic state (Au).The bimetals Pd and Au coexisted on the 0.5 wt Pd-0.1 wt Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 .

TiO 2 displayed an intense PL emission peak at approximately 510 nm, which can be attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to the TiO 2 valance band, whereas TiO 2 -WO 3 demonstrated lower photoluminescence intensity, likely because the WO 3 played a key role in surface charge-hole separation.The emission peak intensity of Pd/TiO 2 -WO 3 and Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 decreased dramatically and shifted slightly to a higher wavelength, which can be explained by a decrease of the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs produced by noble metal doping, which was in accordance with the UV-vis spectra results.

( 2)).The photoexcited electrons were then trapped by CO 2 molecules.This process could reduce the amount of CO 2 by producing CO (Eq.( 3)).The aforementioned photoexcited electrons and produced CO reacted with surface adsorbed CO 2 in the presence of protons to yield CH 4 (Eqs.( 4) and ( 5)) 23.The promotion effect from bimetal loading was caused by the Pd and Au nanoparticles acting as the electron-transfer mediator, rapidly transferring the photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 .Additionally, the photoexcited holes were transported to the surface of the 0.5 wtPd-0.1 wtAu/TiO 2 -WO 3 .Simultaneously, the Pd and Au nanoparticles acted as the CO 2 photoreduction active sites and improved the photocatalytic activity (Eqs.(3) to ( 5)).Owing to the lower valence band (VB) of WO 3 compared with that of TiO 2 , the holes on the VB of TiO 2 migrated to the VB of WO 3 .The reversed migration of the charge carriers efficiently inhibited recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs, leading to clearly enhanced CO 2 photoreduction.Another reason is the synergy effect, which was caused by the addition of bimetals (Fig. 11) 33, generated electrons from the Au surface plasma effect of irradiation that were transferred to Pd to improve the photocatalytic activity (Fig. 11).This can improve the activity of photocatalytic reactions (Eqs.(3) to ( 5))."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "400-W Hg lamp", "source": "The resulting obtained photocatalysts were irradiated using a 400-W Hg lamp as the light source.", "context": "TiOSO 4 (99.9),H 2 WO 4 (99), and C 2 H 5 OH (99.9) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MI, USA).H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O (99.95), Pd(NO 3 ) 2 (99.9), and HAuCl 4 3H 2 O (99.99) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemicals Ltd.
