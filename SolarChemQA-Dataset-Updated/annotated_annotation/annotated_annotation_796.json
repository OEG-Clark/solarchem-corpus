Binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 nanocomposites.The g-C3N4/BiVO4 composite photocatalysts with different loading amounts of BiVO4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple substrate-directed liquid phase deposition method.The preformed g-C3N4 nanosheets (sample C) were used as the substrate to direct the deposition of the BiVO4 nanoparticles.Firstly, 0.5 g of g-C3N4 nanosheets was suspended into 100 mL deionized water under sonication for 30 min.Subsequently, bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)35H2O) and ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3), with a mole ratio of 1:1, were added to the above suspension under violent stirring, and the optimized initial mass percentage of BiVO4 to g-C3N4 was 15.The mixed suspension was violently stirred for another 30 min.After this, the precipitate was centrifuged and washed with deionized water several times to remove impurities.The collected precipitate was dried overnight in a drying oven at 80 C.Finally, the dried powders were ground and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 C/min to enhance the interfacial interactions between the g-C3N4 nanosheets and BiVO4 nanoparticles.The as-obtained binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 nanocomposite photocatalysts are named CB.For comparison, a pure BiVO4 photocatalyst was also prepared under identical conditions and procedures but in the absence of the g-C3N4 nanosheets; the obtained sample is denoted as B. Ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites.The ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites were prepared by a simple sodium borohydride (NaBH4)-induced in-situ reduction method, using the above-prepared binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 nanocomposites with the best photocatalytic performances (that is, sample CB) as the substrate.For a typical synthesis, 0.2 g of sample CB was first dispersed into 50 mL deionized water under magnetic stirring for 10 min.Then, 50 mL of dilute NaBH4 solution was added dropwise into the above suspension; the optimized initial molar ratio of NaBH4 to BiVO4 was 0.4.After 10 min, the products were collected and washed with deionized water three times and dried at 50 C for 12 h in a vacuum drying oven.The obtained sample is denoted as CBB.

The bifunctional photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposite and other control samples were evaluated in terms of the aerobic photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2.For the former, a 350-W Xenon lamp (Changzhou Siyu, China) equipped with a 420-nm UV-cutoff filter was used as the visible light source.The distance between the lamp and reactor remained at a constant height of 15 cm.Before light illumination, 50 mg of each photocatalyst was suspended in a 50 mL 10 mg/L aqueous RhB solution under vigorous stirring.The suspensions were continuously stirred for another 30 min in the dark to reach an adsorption-desorption equilibrium between the photocatalysts and RhB molecules prior to light irradiation.During light irradiation, 3 mL of the suspensions were extracted at regular time intervals and centrifuged to remove the photocatalysts.The residual concentration of RhB was monitored by a UV-2550 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).To determine the dominant reactive oxidative species (ROSs), 2-propanol (IPA) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (Tempol) were introduced as scavengers for hydroxyl radicals (OH) and superoxide radicals (O2 -), respectively, during the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation reaction under otherwise identical conditions. For the anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2, all the measurements were carried out at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure in a 200-mL homemade two-neck Pyrex top-irradiation reactor.The two necks of the reactor were sealed with silicone rubber septums to form a closed system.A 300-W Xenon lamp (PerfectLight, PLS-SXE300, China) with a 420-nm UV-cutoff filter was used as the light source and was positioned ca. 15 cm above the reactor.As a typical photocatalytic experiment, 100 mg of the photocatalyst was uniformly deposited onto the bottom of the reactor.Prior to the light irradiation, the reactor was sealed and purged by blowing nitrogen for 45 min to ensure the anaerobic conditions of the reaction system.In each testing experiment, CO2 and H2O vapor were in-situ produced by the reaction of NaHCO3 powder and aqueous H2SO4 solution inside a specially designed groove in one neck of the reactor.The NaHCO3 powder (0.084 g) was put into the groove before sealing, while the aqueous H2SO4 solution (2 M, 0.3 mL) was injected into the groove by a syringe before light irradiation.After 1 h of light irradiation, the gas products extracted from the reactor were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with two flame-ionized detectors and a thermal conductivity detector.High-purity helium was used as the carrier gas in the gas chromatography.The retention time and yield of each detected gas product were determined and calibrated with a standard gas mixture. The anaerobic photocatalytic degradation of the aqueous RhB solution over sample CBB was conducted in the above anaerobic reaction system under identical conditions, except that the 50 mL aqueous RhB solution (10 mg/L) was introduced, instead of the NaHCO3 powder and aqueous H2SO4 solution to produce CO2 and H2O vapor.The gas products and concentration change of the aqueous RhB solution were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-7890B, Agilent) and UV-visible spectrophotometry (UV-2550, Shimadzu), respectively."}, {"llm generation": "g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites", "source": "The ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites were prepared by a simple sodium borohydride (NaBH4)-induced in-situ reduction method, using the above-prepared binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 nanocomposites with the best photocatalytic performances (that is, sample CB) as the substrate.", "context": "g-C3N4 nanosheets.All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and used without further purification.Typically, the bulk g-C3N4 was obtained by direct heating of 10 g melamine at 550 C for 4 h with a ramping rate of 5 C/min in a semi-closed alumina crucible with a cover.After cooling to room temperature, the bulk g-C3N4 was ground into yellow powder and reannealed at 550 C in air for a further 2 h to transform the bulk g-C3N4 into g-C3N4 nanosheets, involving thermal oxidation etching.The obtained g-C3N4 nanosheet products are denoted as C for simplicity.

Obviously, the phase structure of BiVO4 in sample B comprised both the monoclinic scheelite (m-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0688) and tetragonal zircon structure (t-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0133) 4950515253.The phase structure is usually of great importance for the photocatalytic activity, as it largely determines the band structures and surface properties.Moreover, it is well-documented that photocatalysts with mixed phase struc-tures could form phase junctions to enhance the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes 49.For sample C, two typical diffraction peaks at 12.9 and 27.6 were recorded, which can be indexed to the 100 and 002 planes of g-C3N4, corresponding to the in-plane structural packing motif and interlayer stacking of aromatic systems, respectively.The XRD patterns for samples CB and CBB were rather similar to that for sample B. Comparing with the XRD pattern for sample C, the typical peak at 12.9 for g-C3N4 phase in sample CB and CBB was almost invisible, while the typical peak at 27.6 for the g-C3N4 phase in samples CB and CBB was largely weakened.There may be several possible reasons for this decrease in peak in-tensity.For example, a decrease in the planar size of the g-C3N4 nanosheets may occur by etching during the liquid phase deposition process, followed by the thermally induced crystallization process of the BiVO4 nanoparticles.Additionally, the coverage of the g-C3N4 nanosheets with highly crystalline BiVO4 nanoparticles may shield, to some extent, the XRD signals for the g-C3N4 phase.It is worth noting that no obvious shift in the peak position was observed in the binary (CB) and ternary (CBB) nanocomposites, suggesting no lattice doping occurred during the synthesis processes.It is noted that because of the tiny amount of reduced metallic Bi nanoparticles, no characteristic XRD signal for metallic Bi was observed in sample CBB. XPS was conducted to further determine the detailed surface elemental compositions and their chemical states, and to unveil the strong interactions between distinct phases in sample CBB.The XPS survey spectrum for sample CBB is displayed in Fig. 3(a), in which the XPS peaks for the C, N, Bi, V, and O elements can be well resolved.The high-resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f before and after Ar etching are shown in Fig. 3(b).Because of the instability of metallic Bi upon oxidation in air, only the XPS peaks centered at 158.82 and 164.13 eV were recorded before Ar etching, which are typically ascribed to the Bi-O bonds of elemental Bi 70717273.Furthermore, it is common that a thin bismuth oxide layer will easily form on the surface of the metallic Bi upon exposure to air 70717273.After Ar etching of sample CBB, the characteristic XPS peaks corresponding to Bi-Bi bonding significantly appeared at around 156. 74 and the defect-containing sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in the graphitic domains, respectively.The latter is possibly assigned to the N-CN coordination in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.The fitted four peaks of the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3(d)), centered at around 398.67, 399.86, 401.17, and 404.85 eV, can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen involved in the triazine rings (C-NC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups, amino functional groups having a hydrogen atom (C-N-H), and excitations, respectively, in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.Importantly, the dominant peaks of C 1s and N 1s in sample CBB shifted to higher binding energies relative to the reference 272829303132333435.From the high-resolution XPS spectrum of V 2p in Fig. 3(e), the binding energies at 516.51 and 523.81 eV are assigned to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, respectively.For the high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s in Fig. 3(f), the peak with binding energy at 529.54 eV was attributed to crystal lattice oxygen of BiVO4 in the form of Bi2O2 2 , while the peak at 531.45 eV was ascribed to the hydroxyl groups on the surface 4950515253.It is worth noting that the shifts of the C 1s and N 1s peaks towards higher binding energies were accompanied with the shifts of the Bi 4f, V 2p and O 1s peaks towards lower binding energies in sample CBB.This result indicates the decrease in the electron density on the C and N moieties, the simultaneous increase in the electron density on the Bi, V, and O moieties, and that a built-in electric field formed at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface.In combination, it was manifested that a strong interaction existed between the g-C3N4 phase and the BiVO4 phase in the nanocomposite (sample CBB), rather than a simple physical mixture.Moreover, it was supposed that upon light irradiation, electron transfer from BiVO4 to g-C3N4 would be favored due to the electrostatic effects of the built-in electric field, suggesting an S-scheme junction across the interface in sample CBB. The morphology of the samples was firstly investigated by the SEM images (Fig. S1).A sheet-like uniform morphology was observed for pure g-C3N4 (sample C, Fig. S1(a)), whereas, concave cube-like larger microcrystals were observed for pure BiVO4 (sample B, Fig. S1(b)).The overall morphologies of the binary (sample CB, Fig. S1(c)) and the ternary (sample CBB, Fig. S1(d)) nanocomposites were quite similar, comparable to that of pure g-C3N4.Interestingly, in both samples CB and CBB, no bulk BiVO4 microcrystals were observed, while most evolved into nanoflakes, nanorods, or irregular nanoparticles, which were mainly attached to the g-C3N4 host.Such an observation was further confirmed by the corresponding TEM image for sample CBB (Fig. 4(a)).Many nanoparticles in the form of nanoflakes, nanorods, or of irregular shape were deposited on the surface of the transparent g-C3N4 nanosheets.The inset of Fig. 4(a) corresponds to the SAED patterns of sample CBB, indicating the polycrystalline features of the multicomponent nanocomposites.The corresponding HRTEM image (Fig. 4(b)) revealed that highly crystalline monoclinic BiVO4 (m-BiVO4), surrounded by some amorphous Bi nanoparticles, were deposited on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets.The clear lattice fringe spacing of 0.31 nm corresponded to the (121) crystal plane of monoclinic BiVO4 4950515253. Considering the abundant sheet-like morphology of monoclinic BiVO4 in the nanocomposites, it was supposed that these monoclinic BiVO4 nanosheets were largely attached to the g-C3N4 nanosheets via the m-BiVO4(001)/g-C3N4(001) interface.To further clearly demonstrate the elemental distribution in the nanocomposites (sample CBB), the EDS elemental mappings of C, N, Bi, V, and O (Figs. 4(d)-(i)) of sample CBB were obtained on the corresponding HAADF-STEM image, shown in Fig. 4(c), which was the same observation zone in Fig. 4(a).The C and N distribution profiles correspond to the transparent underlayer in Fig. 4(a), while the Bi, V, and O distribution profiles correspond well to the overall appearance of the surface-deposited nanoparticles in Figs.4(a) and(c).Combining the above XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, and EDS results, it was clear that binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 and ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites were successfully constructed with a well-contacted interface. The porous structures of samples B, C, CB, and CBB were investigated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. S2(a).All the samples had isotherms of type IV, according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller classification, indicating the presence of mesopores (2-50 nm).The sorption isotherms of samples C, CB, and CBB were very similar, suggesting their comparable porous structures.The introduction of BiVO4 and the Bi nanoparticles to couple with the g-C3N4 nanosheets had a tiny influence on the microstructures.The sorption isotherms of sample B were otherwise very different, having almost no adsorption in the wide relative pressure (P/P0) range, and only a minor hysteresis loop at high P/P0, suggesting there were much less mesopores in sample B, in good agreement with the corresponding pore size distribution.In fact, as shown in Table S1, the specific surface area of sample B was only 19 m 2 /g, much smaller than that of samples C, CB, and CBB (50 m 2 /g).The hysteresis loops for samples C, CB, and CBB covered a considerably wide range of relative pressures, suggesting their wide bimodal mesopore size distributions, as confirmed by the corresponding broad BJH pore-size distributions (Fig. S2(b)).Typically, they had two main mesopore peaks centered at around 4 and 45 nm.Moreover, the isotherms for samples C, CB, and CBB showed high adsorption at high P/P0 approaching 1.0, implying the existence of large mesopores and macropores.The formation of various mesopores and macropores is due to the intra-and inter-agglomeration 1011. It is well known that CO2 adsorption on the surface of a photocatalyst is key to initiating the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.Furthermore, the CO2 adsorption capacity is a significant factor influencing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency 1011.As shown in Fig. S3, all the samples showed an almost linear relationship between the CO2 adsorption capacity and the relative pressure (P/P0) in the higher P/P0 range of 0.3-1.0.Such a characteristic indicates a dominant physical interaction between CO2 and the various samples; thus, the specific surface area was found to be the most important influencing factor.In particular, with the increasing SBET from sample B to samples C and CB, the CO2 adsorption capacity steadily increased.Meanwhile, in the lower P/P0 range of 0-0.3, a relatively faster increase in CO2 uptake was recorded for all the samples, particularly for sample CBB, indicating the occurrence of the chemical adsorption of CO2.The chemical adsorption of CO2 on sample B is minor, suggesting that the chemical interaction between CO2 and BiVO4 is weak.However, samples C, CB, and CBB have much stronger chemical adsorption.This is probably due to the stronger interaction of the g-C3N4 moieties, which have abundant amino functional groups (XPS results), with the CO2 molecules.In particular, the in-situ reduction step to fabricate sample CBB might lead to further surface functionalization of g-C3N4 to enhance the chemical adsorption of CO2. The band structures of the photocatalysts could be revealed by combined optical and electrochemical analyses.Specifically, the bandgap energies can be estimated by analyzing the optical absorption spectrum.The UV-vis DRS spectra were measured to study the optical properties and electronic structures of the as-prepared samples (Fig. 5).All the four samples have good absorption in the visible light region.The optical absorption edges of samples C and B were approximately estimated to be 450 and 525 nm, respectively (Fig. 5(a)).The absorption curves for samples CB and CBB are located between those of samples B and C (Fig. 5(a)).In particular, because of the SPR effects of the in-situ generated Bi nanoparticles 61,70, sample CBB exhibited a slight promotion in visible light absorption above 500 nm, compared with sample CB.The bandgap energy (Eg) values of samples B and C can be evaluated using the following equation: h B (h -Eg) n/2 where is the absorption coefficient, is the frequency of the light, h is Planck's constant, B is the absorption constant, and n 1 or 4 depending on the nature of the semiconductor (direct or indirect bandgap, respectively) 60.Both g-C3N4 and BiVO4 are direct bandgap semiconductors, consequently, Eg can be estimated from a plot of ( h) 2 versus (h).The interception of the tangent to the x-axis would give a good approximation of Eg of the samples.As the absorbance (A) is proportional to the absorption coefficient (), the value of A was used as a substitute of in the present study, as in Fig. 5(b).Here, the Eg values of samples B and C were estimated to be 2.40 and 2.83 eV, respectively, which agree well with the reported values 49.Moreover, the conduction band energy (ECB) of a photocatalyst can be calculated according to the following equation (Mulliken electronegativity theory): ECB -E e -0.5Eg, where is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor photocatalyst, E e is the energy of the free electron in the hydrogen scale (approximately 4.5 eV), and Eg is the bandgap energy 60.The values for BiVO4 and g-C3N4 are 6.04 and 4.66 eV, respectively 60, so the calculated CB potentials for samples B and C were approximately 0.34 and -1.26 V, respectively.Combined with the value of Eg, the VB potentials of samples B and C were, thus, calculated to be 2.74 and 1.57V vs. NHE, respectively.The band structures of the BiVO4 (sample B) and g-C3N4 (sample C) photocatalysts are illustrated in Fig. S4. As the charge separation and transfer efficiency play a critical role in the final photocatalytic performance, we combined the transient photocurrent and EIS analyses to clarify the charge dynamic process in the different photocatalysts (Fig. 6).The transient photocurrent responses were recorded at a bias potential of 0.4 V for several on-off cycles under visible light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 6(a), for all the samples, the photocurrent reached a constant value when the light was on, and decreased to zero when the light was off.The photocurrents of both samples B and C were obviously lower than those of the other two composite samples.It was suggested that the interfacial hybridization of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 in sample CB was beneficial for the charge separation.Moreover, after introducing a certain amount of Bi nanoparticles in sample CBB, the photocurrent was further increased, relative to sample CB.It was supposed that a portion of Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acted as an electron bridge, promoting the interfacial charge transfer.EIS analysis is a powerful tool to study the electrochemical charge transfer behavior at high frequency 3,11.Fig. 6(b) shows the EIS spectra in the Nyquist mode in the frequency range of 100 kHz -1 kHz for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB.The Nyquist plot can be interpreted in terms of the equivalent circuit, as displayed in the inset.In the equivalent circuit, Rs is the solution resistance, CPE is the constant phase element for the electrolyte/electrode interface, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the interface of the electrode/electrolyte 3,11.The arcs in the Nyquist plot are related to the charge transfer at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.The fitted Rct values were 46.8, 42.0, 38.2, and 34.4 for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB, respectively.Sample CBB, with the lowest Rct, presented the best charge transfer efficiency.Over-all, it can be concluded that the charge transfer rate in sample CB can be improved because of the reduced charge recombination by forming a heterojunction, compared to those in samples B and C. By introducing a portion of Bi nanoparticles at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acting as an electron bridge, the charge transfer rate in sample CBB could be further enhanced. In this study, Rhodamine B (RhB) was chosen as the target pollutant to evaluate the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of the as-prepared samples under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).As presented in Fig. 7(a), sample CBB shows the best aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity in the degradation of the RhB molecules.The temporal changes in the absorption spectra of the RhB aqueous solution (10 mg/L) upon visible light irradiation over sample C are illustrated in Fig. 7(b).It is noted that the maximum absorption band (wavelength corresponding to the maximal absorbance, max) of the reaction solution gradually shifted from 554 to 495 nm during the photocatalytic degradation of RhB.This hypsochromic shift in max of the RhB solution corresponds to the step-by-step de-ethylation of RhB to give N,N,N'-triethyl rhodamine (TER, 539 nm), N,N'-diethyl rhodamine (DER, 522 nm), N-ethyl rhodamine (MER, 510 nm), and rhodamine at 495 nm 50.As shown in Fig. 7(c), the degree of de-ethylation can be represented by the blue shift in the wavelength of the maximum absorption: max 554 -max 50.Importantly, as for all the samples, de-ethylation occurred dominantly in the early stage; at the end of this stage, there was a leap in max, then, max was very limited (Fig. 7(c)), indicating that the de-ethylation process was almost terminated and the mineralization process of rhodamine (decomposition of the conjugated structure of rhodamine to small molecules) was initiated 50.In this regard, there are two distinctive stages of the aerobic photocatalytic RhB oxidation process: de-ethylation and mineralization.Generally, the rate of de-ethylation is higher than that of the following mineralization process, and very limited changes in the spectral intensity are recorded at the maximal absorption during miner- alization.The photocatalytic oxidation rate of RhB can be approximately calculated based on the de-ethylation process of RhB.The photocatalytic degradation kinetics of RhB during de-ethylation can be described using a pseudo first order reaction model, expressed by the following: -ln(C/C0) kt, where C0 and C are the initial and final RhB concentrations, respectively; k is the pseudo first order rate constant; and t represents the light irradiation time.The k values can be estimated from the ln (A0/A) vs. t plot, as shown in Fig. 7(d).Sample CBB had the highest k value of 0.067 min -1 , much higher than that of samples B (0.005 min -1 ), C (0.033 min -1 ), and CB (0.051 min -1 ).The aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of sample CBB is obviously better than that of some previously reported similar materials 525354555657585960. It is worth noting that, during the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation processes, RhB could be usually degraded completely into CO2, which is generally regarded as the ideal harmless product for organic pollution control.However, in terms of carbon cycling, CO2 is not an ideal product because it is a typical greenhouse gas; thus, it is highly desirable to reduce the above-generated CO2 into other value-added chemicals or fuels.In this study, the possibility of the anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals using the various as-prepared samples was also evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).The anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 involves a series of complicated processes, i.e., charge generation and transfer, C-O bond breaking, and C-H and O-H bond formation 12.The main reactions during photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O are as follows 12. CO2 2H 2e - CO H2O E 0 redox -0.24V The anaerobic photocatalytic gaseous reduction of CO2 in the presence of water vapor was performed under visible light irradiation for 1 h at atmospheric pressure.As shown in Fig. 8, the evolution of CO was recorded as the main product for all the samples, while some other reduction products such as H2, CH4, and CH3OH could also be detected for the binary and ternary composites.As CH3OH, CH4, and H2 are important industrial chemicals and fuels, their selective production over samples CB and CBB suggests the significance of the construction of a composite photocatalyst.More specifically, owing to the formation of the heterojunction between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, a trace amount of CH4 and a small amount of H2 were detected for sample CB, but the yield of CO considerably decreased.In contrast, for sample CBB, while much more multi-electron reduc- tion products (CH4 and CH3OH) were generated, the yields of the two-electron reduction products (CO and H2) also significantly increased.The efficient charge transfer and surface enrichment in composite photocatalysts would favor the generation of multi-electron reduction products.The above separated aerobic photocatalytic oxidation and anaerobic photocatalytic reduction experiments clearly demonstrate the dual functionality of the designed composite photocatalyst.As illustrated in Fig. 1, these results imply the possibility of achieving photocatalytic carbon cycling by the integration of the aerobic oxidation and anaerobic reduction processes.However, the two-pot reaction systems, involving RhB to CO2 followed by CO2 to solar fuels, will be complicated in operation.Under this consideration, the direct conversion of RhB to solar fuels under anaerobic conditions in one-pot was also studied over the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalysts.The anaerobic photocatalytic degradation of the aqueous RhB solution over sample CBB was also performed in the anaerobic reaction system under identical conditions, except that 50-mL aqueous RhB solution (10 mg/L) was introduced instead of CO2 and H2O vapor.The one-pot anaerobic photocatalytic result is shown in Fig. 8(b).The RhB degradation efficiency was approximately 30 in 1 h, which was much lower than that conducted under aerobic conditions.This result suggests that oxygen was important for enhancing the photocatalytic RhB removal process.Interestingly, CO, as the major gas product, was indeed detected.The yield (0.63 mol/(gh) was much lower than that obtained from the photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O vapor.More complex reaction processes are involved in the one-pot anaerobic reaction system, while the overall photocatalytic conversion efficiency can be further improved by promoting the anaerobic RhB oxidation efficiency, which would compete with the water splitting process that is crucial for CO hydrogenation. As shown above, the photocatalytic activities of samples CB and CBB were tremendously enhanced because of the formation of the heterojunction; thus, it is essential to understand the synergetic mechanism in the binary and ternary composite system.Combing the XPS analyses of sample CBB (Fig. 2) with the band structure analyses of the g-C3N4 and BiVO4 photocatalyst (Fig. 8), the formation of the S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst probably accounts for the promotion of the charge dynamics (Fig. S2) and photocatalytic efficiency.Such an assumption was further confirmed by the following results of the density functional theory (DFT) calculation and scavenger studies 30,65666768. The calculations were conducted using the CASTEP mode of Materials Studio according to DFT 74757677.The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof form exchange-correlation functional was used within the generalized gradient approximation.The geometry optimization and electrostatic potential calculations were completed with the cutoff energy of 380 eV and Monkhorst-Pack grids of 2 5 1 for the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane, and 3 3 1 for the monolayer g-C3N4.The convergence thresholds for the geometry optimization were set as: energy of 5.0 10 -6 eV/atom, maximum force of 0.01 eV/A, and maximum stress of 0.02 GPa.The optimized models and calculated average potential profiles of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane and monolayer g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 9. The Fermi energy of the semiconductor is one important parameter for estimating the charge transfer between the interfaces of two semiconductor materials, and can be calculated by: Evac -EF where Evac and EF are the electrostatic potential of the vacuum energy and Fermi energy, respectively 74757677.The calculated work functions of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4 were 6.92 and 4.23 eV, respectively.The Fermi energy of the g-C3N4 was higher than that of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet.Upon the interfacial contact between the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4, electrons will transfer from g-C3N4 to the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet until their Fermi energies reach the same level.As a consequence, this leads to the decrease of electron density of g-C3N4 and an increase in BiVO4, implying the formation of a built-in electric field at the BiVO4 and g-C3N4 interface (Fig. S5).It is worth noting that the direction of the abovementioned built-in electric field is from the g-C3N4 surface to the BiVO4 surface, which is beneficial to the vectorial interfacial transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers from the CB of BiVO4 to the VB of g-C3N4 during the photocatalytic reaction processes (Fig. S5).Overall, the DFT calculation suggests the formation of an S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst 74757677.By a simple comparison of the OH -/OH and O2/O2 -redox potentials versus the CB and VB potentials of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 (Fig. S4), it is clear that OH radicals cannot be generated over pure g-C3N4, but can be generated over pure BiVO4.On the contrary, O2 -radicals cannot be generated over pure BiVO4, but can be generated over pure g-C3N4.Such assumptions have been well confirmed by the scavenger studies.IPA as the OH scavenger and Tempol as the O2 -scavenger were introduced in the respective reaction system for the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation to determine the involved main ROSs over each photocatalyst (Fig. 10).Importantly, in the sample B-based photocatalytic system, the degradation efficiency was obviously inhibited after introduction of IPA as the scavenger of OH, suggesting the weak reductive ability of the photogenerated electrons in BiVO4, while the main ROS were h -derived oxidative species (OH).In contrast, the degradation efficiency of the sample C-based photocatalytic system was inhibited after introduction of Tempol as the scavenger of O2 -, suggesting the weak oxidative ability of the photogenerated holes in BiVO4, while the main ROS were e --derived oxidative species (O2 -).After the formation of the heterostructure between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, both O2 -and OH significantly contributed to the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation over samples CB and CBB.This result suggests that in the g-C3N4/BiVO4 binary nanocom-posites, both the photoexcited holes with strong oxidative ability from the VB of BiVO4 and the photoexcited electrons with strong reductive ability from the CB of g-C3N4 were retained, and an S-scheme hybrid photocatalyst system was established.Moreover, after introduction of the Bi nanoparticles, the synergetic photocatalytic mechanism did not vary, sustaining the S-scheme interfacial charge transfer in the g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 ternary nanocomposites.In fact, metallic Bi nanoparticles, as an important component of CBB ternary photocatalysts, may have three basic functions 67.First, the plasmonic effects of Bi nanoparticles enhance the visible light absorption ability (Fig. 5(a)).Second, the field effects of plasmonic Bi nanoparticles enhance the charge separation efficiency (Fig. 6).Third, a portion of metallic Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of the S-scheme of g-C3N4/BiVO4 may promote the interfacial charge transfer by acting as an S-scheme electron mediator (Fig. 6), similar to the roles of the Au nanoparticles in the Au/CdS/TiO2 hybrid system 66. The complex photocatalytic mechanism of the S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst is demonstrated in Fig. 11.First, for the light harvesting process, there are three active visible light absorption centers, being the g-C3N4 nanosheets, BiVO4, and surface-decorated metallic Bi nanoparticles.In particular, due to the SPR effects, the metallic Bi nanoparticles enhanced the visible light absorption capacity.Second, for the charge transfer processes, due to the formation of a built-in electric field at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface, S-scheme interfacial charge transfer, that is the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of BiVO4 toward the VB of g-C3N4, dominated upon light irradiation.Moreover, the metallic Bi nanoparticles acted as an S-scheme electron mediator to promote the interfacial charge transfer in the ternary S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid system.Incidentally, the photoexcited hot electrons from the metallic Bi nanoparticles transferred to the CB of the BiVO4 moiety, then toward the VB of g-C3N4, inhibiting the charge recombination.As a consequence, the holes in g-C3N4 and the electrons in BiVO4 with poor redox ability were sacrificed, and the electrons in g-C3N4 and the holes in BiVO4 with strong redox ability remained and were spatially separated, which together modulate the charge potentials and dynamics to suit the"}, {"llm generation": "g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst", "source": "A ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst was fabricated and employed to establish artificial CO2 cycling.", "context": "A ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst was fabricated and employed to establish artificial CO2 cycling.The as-prepared g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst was demonstrated to be an efficient bifunctional photocatalyst system, which not only showed enhanced aerobic photocatalytic oxidation performance in degrading organic pollutants, but also exhibited impressive anaerobic photocatalytic reduction performance in CO2 valorization.Such a bifunctional g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst system will pave the way for further development of integrated aerobic-anaerobic reaction systems for photocatalytic carbon cycling.Based on combined XPS analyses, scavenger studies, and DFT calculations, it is suggested that the excellent bifunctional photocatalytic performance of the g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst is associated with the formation of efficient S-scheme hybrid junctions, which not only largely promote suitable charge dynamics, but also sustain favorable charge potentials.Furthermore, the introduction of metallic Bi nanoparticles not only enhanced the visible light absorption by SPR effects, but also promoted the interfacial charge transfer by S-scheme bridging effects.Further studies would be devoted to the construction of an integrated aerobic-anaerobic reaction system and the application of the bifunctional S-scheme hybrid photocatalyst for simultaneous environmental protection and energy production based on artificial CO2 cycling processes.

Obviously, the phase structure of BiVO4 in sample B comprised both the monoclinic scheelite (m-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0688) and tetragonal zircon structure (t-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0133) 4950515253.The phase structure is usually of great importance for the photocatalytic activity, as it largely determines the band structures and surface properties.Moreover, it is well-documented that photocatalysts with mixed phase struc-tures could form phase junctions to enhance the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes 49.For sample C, two typical diffraction peaks at 12.9 and 27.6 were recorded, which can be indexed to the 100 and 002 planes of g-C3N4, corresponding to the in-plane structural packing motif and interlayer stacking of aromatic systems, respectively.The XRD patterns for samples CB and CBB were rather similar to that for sample B. Comparing with the XRD pattern for sample C, the typical peak at 12.9 for g-C3N4 phase in sample CB and CBB was almost invisible, while the typical peak at 27.6 for the g-C3N4 phase in samples CB and CBB was largely weakened.There may be several possible reasons for this decrease in peak in-tensity.For example, a decrease in the planar size of the g-C3N4 nanosheets may occur by etching during the liquid phase deposition process, followed by the thermally induced crystallization process of the BiVO4 nanoparticles.Additionally, the coverage of the g-C3N4 nanosheets with highly crystalline BiVO4 nanoparticles may shield, to some extent, the XRD signals for the g-C3N4 phase.It is worth noting that no obvious shift in the peak position was observed in the binary (CB) and ternary (CBB) nanocomposites, suggesting no lattice doping occurred during the synthesis processes.It is noted that because of the tiny amount of reduced metallic Bi nanoparticles, no characteristic XRD signal for metallic Bi was observed in sample CBB. XPS was conducted to further determine the detailed surface elemental compositions and their chemical states, and to unveil the strong interactions between distinct phases in sample CBB.The XPS survey spectrum for sample CBB is displayed in Fig. 3(a), in which the XPS peaks for the C, N, Bi, V, and O elements can be well resolved.The high-resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f before and after Ar etching are shown in Fig. 3(b).Because of the instability of metallic Bi upon oxidation in air, only the XPS peaks centered at 158.82 and 164.13 eV were recorded before Ar etching, which are typically ascribed to the Bi-O bonds of elemental Bi 70717273.Furthermore, it is common that a thin bismuth oxide layer will easily form on the surface of the metallic Bi upon exposure to air 70717273.After Ar etching of sample CBB, the characteristic XPS peaks corresponding to Bi-Bi bonding significantly appeared at around 156. 74 and the defect-containing sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in the graphitic domains, respectively.The latter is possibly assigned to the N-CN coordination in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.The fitted four peaks of the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3(d)), centered at around 398.67, 399.86, 401.17, and 404.85 eV, can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen involved in the triazine rings (C-NC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups, amino functional groups having a hydrogen atom (C-N-H), and excitations, respectively, in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.Importantly, the dominant peaks of C 1s and N 1s in sample CBB shifted to higher binding energies relative to the reference 272829303132333435.From the high-resolution XPS spectrum of V 2p in Fig. 3(e), the binding energies at 516.51 and 523.81 eV are assigned to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, respectively.For the high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s in Fig. 3(f), the peak with binding energy at 529.54 eV was attributed to crystal lattice oxygen of BiVO4 in the form of Bi2O2 2 , while the peak at 531.45 eV was ascribed to the hydroxyl groups on the surface 4950515253.It is worth noting that the shifts of the C 1s and N 1s peaks towards higher binding energies were accompanied with the shifts of the Bi 4f, V 2p and O 1s peaks towards lower binding energies in sample CBB.This result indicates the decrease in the electron density on the C and N moieties, the simultaneous increase in the electron density on the Bi, V, and O moieties, and that a built-in electric field formed at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface.In combination, it was manifested that a strong interaction existed between the g-C3N4 phase and the BiVO4 phase in the nanocomposite (sample CBB), rather than a simple physical mixture.Moreover, it was supposed that upon light irradiation, electron transfer from BiVO4 to g-C3N4 would be favored due to the electrostatic effects of the built-in electric field, suggesting an S-scheme junction across the interface in sample CBB. The morphology of the samples was firstly investigated by the SEM images (Fig. S1).A sheet-like uniform morphology was observed for pure g-C3N4 (sample C, Fig. S1(a)), whereas, concave cube-like larger microcrystals were observed for pure BiVO4 (sample B, Fig. S1(b)).The overall morphologies of the binary (sample CB, Fig. S1(c)) and the ternary (sample CBB, Fig. S1(d)) nanocomposites were quite similar, comparable to that of pure g-C3N4.Interestingly, in both samples CB and CBB, no bulk BiVO4 microcrystals were observed, while most evolved into nanoflakes, nanorods, or irregular nanoparticles, which were mainly attached to the g-C3N4 host.Such an observation was further confirmed by the corresponding TEM image for sample CBB (Fig. 4(a)).Many nanoparticles in the form of nanoflakes, nanorods, or of irregular shape were deposited on the surface of the transparent g-C3N4 nanosheets.The inset of Fig. 4(a) corresponds to the SAED patterns of sample CBB, indicating the polycrystalline features of the multicomponent nanocomposites.The corresponding HRTEM image (Fig. 4(b)) revealed that highly crystalline monoclinic BiVO4 (m-BiVO4), surrounded by some amorphous Bi nanoparticles, were deposited on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets.The clear lattice fringe spacing of 0.31 nm corresponded to the (121) crystal plane of monoclinic BiVO4 4950515253. Considering the abundant sheet-like morphology of monoclinic BiVO4 in the nanocomposites, it was supposed that these monoclinic BiVO4 nanosheets were largely attached to the g-C3N4 nanosheets via the m-BiVO4(001)/g-C3N4(001) interface.To further clearly demonstrate the elemental distribution in the nanocomposites (sample CBB), the EDS elemental mappings of C, N, Bi, V, and O (Figs. 4(d)-(i)) of sample CBB were obtained on the corresponding HAADF-STEM image, shown in Fig. 4(c), which was the same observation zone in Fig. 4(a).The C and N distribution profiles correspond to the transparent underlayer in Fig. 4(a), while the Bi, V, and O distribution profiles correspond well to the overall appearance of the surface-deposited nanoparticles in Figs.4(a) and(c).Combining the above XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, and EDS results, it was clear that binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 and ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites were successfully constructed with a well-contacted interface. The porous structures of samples B, C, CB, and CBB were investigated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. S2(a).All the samples had isotherms of type IV, according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller classification, indicating the presence of mesopores (2-50 nm).The sorption isotherms of samples C, CB, and CBB were very similar, suggesting their comparable porous structures.The introduction of BiVO4 and the Bi nanoparticles to couple with the g-C3N4 nanosheets had a tiny influence on the microstructures.The sorption isotherms of sample B were otherwise very different, having almost no adsorption in the wide relative pressure (P/P0) range, and only a minor hysteresis loop at high P/P0, suggesting there were much less mesopores in sample B, in good agreement with the corresponding pore size distribution.In fact, as shown in Table S1, the specific surface area of sample B was only 19 m 2 /g, much smaller than that of samples C, CB, and CBB (50 m 2 /g).The hysteresis loops for samples C, CB, and CBB covered a considerably wide range of relative pressures, suggesting their wide bimodal mesopore size distributions, as confirmed by the corresponding broad BJH pore-size distributions (Fig. S2(b)).Typically, they had two main mesopore peaks centered at around 4 and 45 nm.Moreover, the isotherms for samples C, CB, and CBB showed high adsorption at high P/P0 approaching 1.0, implying the existence of large mesopores and macropores.The formation of various mesopores and macropores is due to the intra-and inter-agglomeration 1011. It is well known that CO2 adsorption on the surface of a photocatalyst is key to initiating the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.Furthermore, the CO2 adsorption capacity is a significant factor influencing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency 1011.As shown in Fig. S3, all the samples showed an almost linear relationship between the CO2 adsorption capacity and the relative pressure (P/P0) in the higher P/P0 range of 0.3-1.0.Such a characteristic indicates a dominant physical interaction between CO2 and the various samples; thus, the specific surface area was found to be the most important influencing factor.In particular, with the increasing SBET from sample B to samples C and CB, the CO2 adsorption capacity steadily increased.Meanwhile, in the lower P/P0 range of 0-0.3, a relatively faster increase in CO2 uptake was recorded for all the samples, particularly for sample CBB, indicating the occurrence of the chemical adsorption of CO2.The chemical adsorption of CO2 on sample B is minor, suggesting that the chemical interaction between CO2 and BiVO4 is weak.However, samples C, CB, and CBB have much stronger chemical adsorption.This is probably due to the stronger interaction of the g-C3N4 moieties, which have abundant amino functional groups (XPS results), with the CO2 molecules.In particular, the in-situ reduction step to fabricate sample CBB might lead to further surface functionalization of g-C3N4 to enhance the chemical adsorption of CO2. The band structures of the photocatalysts could be revealed by combined optical and electrochemical analyses.Specifically, the bandgap energies can be estimated by analyzing the optical absorption spectrum.The UV-vis DRS spectra were measured to study the optical properties and electronic structures of the as-prepared samples (Fig. 5).All the four samples have good absorption in the visible light region.The optical absorption edges of samples C and B were approximately estimated to be 450 and 525 nm, respectively (Fig. 5(a)).The absorption curves for samples CB and CBB are located between those of samples B and C (Fig. 5(a)).In particular, because of the SPR effects of the in-situ generated Bi nanoparticles 61,70, sample CBB exhibited a slight promotion in visible light absorption above 500 nm, compared with sample CB.The bandgap energy (Eg) values of samples B and C can be evaluated using the following equation: h B (h -Eg) n/2 where is the absorption coefficient, is the frequency of the light, h is Planck's constant, B is the absorption constant, and n 1 or 4 depending on the nature of the semiconductor (direct or indirect bandgap, respectively) 60.Both g-C3N4 and BiVO4 are direct bandgap semiconductors, consequently, Eg can be estimated from a plot of ( h) 2 versus (h).The interception of the tangent to the x-axis would give a good approximation of Eg of the samples.As the absorbance (A) is proportional to the absorption coefficient (), the value of A was used as a substitute of in the present study, as in Fig. 5(b).Here, the Eg values of samples B and C were estimated to be 2.40 and 2.83 eV, respectively, which agree well with the reported values 49.Moreover, the conduction band energy (ECB) of a photocatalyst can be calculated according to the following equation (Mulliken electronegativity theory): ECB -E e -0.5Eg, where is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor photocatalyst, E e is the energy of the free electron in the hydrogen scale (approximately 4.5 eV), and Eg is the bandgap energy 60.The values for BiVO4 and g-C3N4 are 6.04 and 4.66 eV, respectively 60, so the calculated CB potentials for samples B and C were approximately 0.34 and -1.26 V, respectively.Combined with the value of Eg, the VB potentials of samples B and C were, thus, calculated to be 2.74 and 1.57V vs. NHE, respectively.The band structures of the BiVO4 (sample B) and g-C3N4 (sample C) photocatalysts are illustrated in Fig. S4. As the charge separation and transfer efficiency play a critical role in the final photocatalytic performance, we combined the transient photocurrent and EIS analyses to clarify the charge dynamic process in the different photocatalysts (Fig. 6).The transient photocurrent responses were recorded at a bias potential of 0.4 V for several on-off cycles under visible light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 6(a), for all the samples, the photocurrent reached a constant value when the light was on, and decreased to zero when the light was off.The photocurrents of both samples B and C were obviously lower than those of the other two composite samples.It was suggested that the interfacial hybridization of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 in sample CB was beneficial for the charge separation.Moreover, after introducing a certain amount of Bi nanoparticles in sample CBB, the photocurrent was further increased, relative to sample CB.It was supposed that a portion of Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acted as an electron bridge, promoting the interfacial charge transfer.EIS analysis is a powerful tool to study the electrochemical charge transfer behavior at high frequency 3,11.Fig. 6(b) shows the EIS spectra in the Nyquist mode in the frequency range of 100 kHz -1 kHz for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB.The Nyquist plot can be interpreted in terms of the equivalent circuit, as displayed in the inset.In the equivalent circuit, Rs is the solution resistance, CPE is the constant phase element for the electrolyte/electrode interface, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the interface of the electrode/electrolyte 3,11.The arcs in the Nyquist plot are related to the charge transfer at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.The fitted Rct values were 46.8, 42.0, 38.2, and 34.4 for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB, respectively.Sample CBB, with the lowest Rct, presented the best charge transfer efficiency.Over-all, it can be concluded that the charge transfer rate in sample CB can be improved because of the reduced charge recombination by forming a heterojunction, compared to those in samples B and C. By introducing a portion of Bi nanoparticles at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acting as an electron bridge, the charge transfer rate in sample CBB could be further enhanced. In this study, Rhodamine B (RhB) was chosen as the target pollutant to evaluate the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of the as-prepared samples under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).As presented in Fig. 7(a), sample CBB shows the best aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity in the degradation of the RhB molecules.The temporal changes in the absorption spectra of the RhB aqueous solution (10 mg/L) upon visible light irradiation over sample C are illustrated in Fig. 7(b).It is noted that the maximum absorption band (wavelength corresponding to the maximal absorbance, max) of the reaction solution gradually shifted from 554 to 495 nm during the photocatalytic degradation of RhB.This hypsochromic shift in max of the RhB solution corresponds to the step-by-step de-ethylation of RhB to give N,N,N'-triethyl rhodamine (TER, 539 nm), N,N'-diethyl rhodamine (DER, 522 nm), N-ethyl rhodamine (MER, 510 nm), and rhodamine at 495 nm 50.As shown in Fig. 7(c), the degree of de-ethylation can be represented by the blue shift in the wavelength of the maximum absorption: max 554 -max 50.Importantly, as for all the samples, de-ethylation occurred dominantly in the early stage; at the end of this stage, there was a leap in max, then, max was very limited (Fig. 7(c)), indicating that the de-ethylation process was almost terminated and the mineralization process of rhodamine (decomposition of the conjugated structure of rhodamine to small molecules) was initiated 50.In this regard, there are two distinctive stages of the aerobic photocatalytic RhB oxidation process: de-ethylation and mineralization.Generally, the rate of de-ethylation is higher than that of the following mineralization process, and very limited changes in the spectral intensity are recorded at the maximal absorption during miner- alization.The photocatalytic oxidation rate of RhB can be approximately calculated based on the de-ethylation process of RhB.The photocatalytic degradation kinetics of RhB during de-ethylation can be described using a pseudo first order reaction model, expressed by the following: -ln(C/C0) kt, where C0 and C are the initial and final RhB concentrations, respectively; k is the pseudo first order rate constant; and t represents the light irradiation time.The k values can be estimated from the ln (A0/A) vs. t plot, as shown in Fig. 7(d).Sample CBB had the highest k value of 0.067 min -1 , much higher than that of samples B (0.005 min -1 ), C (0.033 min -1 ), and CB (0.051 min -1 ).The aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of sample CBB is obviously better than that of some previously reported similar materials 525354555657585960. It is worth noting that, during the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation processes, RhB could be usually degraded completely into CO2, which is generally regarded as the ideal harmless product for organic pollution control.However, in terms of carbon cycling, CO2 is not an ideal product because it is a typical greenhouse gas; thus, it is highly desirable to reduce the above-generated CO2 into other value-added chemicals or fuels.In this study, the possibility of the anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals using the various as-prepared samples was also evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).The anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 involves a series of complicated processes, i.e., charge generation and transfer, C-O bond breaking, and C-H and O-H bond formation 12.The main reactions during photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O are as follows 12. CO2 2H 2e - CO H2O E 0 redox -0.24V The anaerobic photocatalytic gaseous reduction of CO2 in the presence of water vapor was performed under visible light irradiation for 1 h at atmospheric pressure.As shown in Fig. 8, the evolution of CO was recorded as the main product for all the samples, while some other reduction products such as H2, CH4, and CH3OH could also be detected for the binary and ternary composites.As CH3OH, CH4, and H2 are important industrial chemicals and fuels, their selective production over samples CB and CBB suggests the significance of the construction of a composite photocatalyst.More specifically, owing to the formation of the heterojunction between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, a trace amount of CH4 and a small amount of H2 were detected for sample CB, but the yield of CO considerably decreased.In contrast, for sample CBB, while much more multi-electron reduc- tion products (CH4 and CH3OH) were generated, the yields of the two-electron reduction products (CO and H2) also significantly increased.The efficient charge transfer and surface enrichment in composite photocatalysts would favor the generation of multi-electron reduction products.The above separated aerobic photocatalytic oxidation and anaerobic photocatalytic reduction experiments clearly demonstrate the dual functionality of the designed composite photocatalyst.As illustrated in Fig. 1, these results imply the possibility of achieving photocatalytic carbon cycling by the integration of the aerobic oxidation and anaerobic reduction processes.However, the two-pot reaction systems, involving RhB to CO2 followed by CO2 to solar fuels, will be complicated in operation.Under this consideration, the direct conversion of RhB to solar fuels under anaerobic conditions in one-pot was also studied over the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalysts.The anaerobic photocatalytic degradation of the aqueous RhB solution over sample CBB was also performed in the anaerobic reaction system under identical conditions, except that 50-mL aqueous RhB solution (10 mg/L) was introduced instead of CO2 and H2O vapor.The one-pot anaerobic photocatalytic result is shown in Fig. 8(b).The RhB degradation efficiency was approximately 30 in 1 h, which was much lower than that conducted under aerobic conditions.This result suggests that oxygen was important for enhancing the photocatalytic RhB removal process.Interestingly, CO, as the major gas product, was indeed detected.The yield (0.63 mol/(gh) was much lower than that obtained from the photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O vapor.More complex reaction processes are involved in the one-pot anaerobic reaction system, while the overall photocatalytic conversion efficiency can be further improved by promoting the anaerobic RhB oxidation efficiency, which would compete with the water splitting process that is crucial for CO hydrogenation. As shown above, the photocatalytic activities of samples CB and CBB were tremendously enhanced because of the formation of the heterojunction; thus, it is essential to understand the synergetic mechanism in the binary and ternary composite system.Combing the XPS analyses of sample CBB (Fig. 2) with the band structure analyses of the g-C3N4 and BiVO4 photocatalyst (Fig. 8), the formation of the S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst probably accounts for the promotion of the charge dynamics (Fig. S2) and photocatalytic efficiency.Such an assumption was further confirmed by the following results of the density functional theory (DFT) calculation and scavenger studies 30,65666768. The calculations were conducted using the CASTEP mode of Materials Studio according to DFT 74757677.The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof form exchange-correlation functional was used within the generalized gradient approximation.The geometry optimization and electrostatic potential calculations were completed with the cutoff energy of 380 eV and Monkhorst-Pack grids of 2 5 1 for the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane, and 3 3 1 for the monolayer g-C3N4.The convergence thresholds for the geometry optimization were set as: energy of 5.0 10 -6 eV/atom, maximum force of 0.01 eV/A, and maximum stress of 0.02 GPa.The optimized models and calculated average potential profiles of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane and monolayer g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 9. The Fermi energy of the semiconductor is one important parameter for estimating the charge transfer between the interfaces of two semiconductor materials, and can be calculated by: Evac -EF where Evac and EF are the electrostatic potential of the vacuum energy and Fermi energy, respectively 74757677.The calculated work functions of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4 were 6.92 and 4.23 eV, respectively.The Fermi energy of the g-C3N4 was higher than that of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet.Upon the interfacial contact between the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4, electrons will transfer from g-C3N4 to the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet until their Fermi energies reach the same level.As a consequence, this leads to the decrease of electron density of g-C3N4 and an increase in BiVO4, implying the formation of a built-in electric field at the BiVO4 and g-C3N4 interface (Fig. S5).It is worth noting that the direction of the abovementioned built-in electric field is from the g-C3N4 surface to the BiVO4 surface, which is beneficial to the vectorial interfacial transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers from the CB of BiVO4 to the VB of g-C3N4 during the photocatalytic reaction processes (Fig. S5).Overall, the DFT calculation suggests the formation of an S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst 74757677.By a simple comparison of the OH -/OH and O2/O2 -redox potentials versus the CB and VB potentials of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 (Fig. S4), it is clear that OH radicals cannot be generated over pure g-C3N4, but can be generated over pure BiVO4.On the contrary, O2 -radicals cannot be generated over pure BiVO4, but can be generated over pure g-C3N4.Such assumptions have been well confirmed by the scavenger studies.IPA as the OH scavenger and Tempol as the O2 -scavenger were introduced in the respective reaction system for the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation to determine the involved main ROSs over each photocatalyst (Fig. 10).Importantly, in the sample B-based photocatalytic system, the degradation efficiency was obviously inhibited after introduction of IPA as the scavenger of OH, suggesting the weak reductive ability of the photogenerated electrons in BiVO4, while the main ROS were h -derived oxidative species (OH).In contrast, the degradation efficiency of the sample C-based photocatalytic system was inhibited after introduction of Tempol as the scavenger of O2 -, suggesting the weak oxidative ability of the photogenerated holes in BiVO4, while the main ROS were e --derived oxidative species (O2 -).After the formation of the heterostructure between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, both O2 -and OH significantly contributed to the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation over samples CB and CBB.This result suggests that in the g-C3N4/BiVO4 binary nanocom-posites, both the photoexcited holes with strong oxidative ability from the VB of BiVO4 and the photoexcited electrons with strong reductive ability from the CB of g-C3N4 were retained, and an S-scheme hybrid photocatalyst system was established.Moreover, after introduction of the Bi nanoparticles, the synergetic photocatalytic mechanism did not vary, sustaining the S-scheme interfacial charge transfer in the g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 ternary nanocomposites.In fact, metallic Bi nanoparticles, as an important component of CBB ternary photocatalysts, may have three basic functions 67.First, the plasmonic effects of Bi nanoparticles enhance the visible light absorption ability (Fig. 5(a)).Second, the field effects of plasmonic Bi nanoparticles enhance the charge separation efficiency (Fig. 6).Third, a portion of metallic Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of the S-scheme of g-C3N4/BiVO4 may promote the interfacial charge transfer by acting as an S-scheme electron mediator (Fig. 6), similar to the roles of the Au nanoparticles in the Au/CdS/TiO2 hybrid system 66. The complex photocatalytic mechanism of the S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst is demonstrated in Fig. 11.First, for the light harvesting process, there are three active visible light absorption centers, being the g-C3N4 nanosheets, BiVO4, and surface-decorated metallic Bi nanoparticles.In particular, due to the SPR effects, the metallic Bi nanoparticles enhanced the visible light absorption capacity.Second, for the charge transfer processes, due to the formation of a built-in electric field at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface, S-scheme interfacial charge transfer, that is the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of BiVO4 toward the VB of g-C3N4, dominated upon light irradiation.Moreover, the metallic Bi nanoparticles acted as an S-scheme electron mediator to promote the interfacial charge transfer in the ternary S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid system.Incidentally, the photoexcited hot electrons from the metallic Bi nanoparticles transferred to the CB of the BiVO4 moiety, then toward the VB of g-C3N4, inhibiting the charge recombination.As a consequence, the holes in g-C3N4 and the electrons in BiVO4 with poor redox ability were sacrificed, and the electrons in g-C3N4 and the holes in BiVO4 with strong redox ability remained and were spatially separated, which together modulate the charge potentials and dynamics to suit the"}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "visible light source", "source": "Moreover, a 300-W Xenon lamp with a UV-cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was used as the visible light source, and 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte.", "context": "g-C3N4 nanosheets.All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and used without further purification.Typically, the bulk g-C3N4 was obtained by direct heating of 10 g melamine at 550 C for 4 h with a ramping rate of 5 C/min in a semi-closed alumina crucible with a cover.After cooling to room temperature, the bulk g-C3N4 was ground into yellow powder and reannealed at 550 C in air for a further 2 h to transform the bulk g-C3N4 into g-C3N4 nanosheets, involving thermal oxidation etching.The obtained g-C3N4 nanosheet products are denoted as C for simplicity. Binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 nanocomposites.The g-C3N4/BiVO4 composite photocatalysts with different loading amounts of BiVO4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple substrate-directed liquid phase deposition method.The preformed g-C3N4 nanosheets (sample C) were used as the substrate to direct the deposition of the BiVO4 nanoparticles.Firstly, 0.5 g of g-C3N4 nanosheets was suspended into 100 mL deionized water under sonication for 30 min.Subsequently, bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)35H2O) and ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3), with a mole ratio of 1:1, were added to the above suspension under violent stirring, and the optimized initial mass percentage of BiVO4 to g-C3N4 was 15.The mixed suspension was violently stirred for another 30 min.After this, the precipitate was centrifuged and washed with deionized water several times to remove impurities.The collected precipitate was dried overnight in a drying oven at 80 C.Finally, the dried powders were ground and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 C/min to enhance the interfacial interactions between the g-C3N4 nanosheets and BiVO4 nanoparticles.The as-obtained binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 nanocomposite photocatalysts are named CB.For comparison, a pure BiVO4 photocatalyst was also prepared under identical conditions and procedures but in the absence of the g-C3N4 nanosheets; the obtained sample is denoted as B. Ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites.The ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites were prepared by a simple sodium borohydride (NaBH4)-induced in-situ reduction method, using the above-prepared binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 nanocomposites with the best photocatalytic performances (that is, sample CB) as the substrate.For a typical synthesis, 0.2 g of sample CB was first dispersed into 50 mL deionized water under magnetic stirring for 10 min.Then, 50 mL of dilute NaBH4 solution was added dropwise into the above suspension; the optimized initial molar ratio of NaBH4 to BiVO4 was 0.4.After 10 min, the products were collected and washed with deionized water three times and dried at 50 C for 12 h in a vacuum drying oven.The obtained sample is denoted as CBB. The as-synthesized samples were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), the patterns of which were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu K radiation ( 1.54056A).Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning TEM (STEM) image, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings were obtained using a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at 200 kV.UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment, using BaSO4 as the background.An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a Physical Electronics PHI 1600 ESCA system operating with an Al K X-ray source (E 1486.6eV), and all the binding energies were calibrated using the C1s peak at 284.6 eV.Nitrogen sorption isotherms and CO2 adsorption curves were measured on a TriStar II 3020 gas adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics, USA).All the samples were degassed at 180 C for 12 h prior to measurements.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (SBET) was determined using adsorption data in a relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05-0.3by a multipoint BET method.Furthermore, the pore-size distribution was determined using the desorption data via the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.The volume of nitrogen desorbed at P/P0 0.99 was used to determine the pore volume (Vp) and the average pore size (dp).The photoelectrochemical measurements, including the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), of the samples were conducted on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument Corporation, Shanghai).All the photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell.The film electrode of each synthesized sample on FTO conductive glass served as the working electrode, while an Ag/AgCl electrode and platinum foil were employed as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.Moreover, a 300-W Xenon lamp with a UV-cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was used as the visible light source, and 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The bifunctional photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposite and other control samples were evaluated in terms of the aerobic photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2.For the former, a 350-W Xenon lamp (Changzhou Siyu, China) equipped with a 420-nm UV-cutoff filter was used as the visible light source.The distance between the lamp and reactor remained at a constant height of 15 cm.Before light illumination, 50 mg of each photocatalyst was suspended in a 50 mL 10 mg/L aqueous RhB solution under vigorous stirring.The suspensions were continuously stirred for another 30 min in the dark to reach an adsorption-desorption equilibrium between the photocatalysts and RhB molecules prior to light irradiation.During light irradiation, 3 mL of the suspensions were extracted at regular time intervals and centrifuged to remove the photocatalysts.The residual concentration of RhB was monitored by a UV-2550 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).To determine the dominant reactive oxidative species (ROSs), 2-propanol (IPA) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (Tempol) were introduced as scavengers for hydroxyl radicals (OH) and superoxide radicals (O2 -), respectively, during the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation reaction under otherwise identical conditions. For the anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2, all the measurements were carried out at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure in a 200-mL homemade two-neck Pyrex top-irradiation reactor.The two necks of the reactor were sealed with silicone rubber septums to form a closed system.A 300-W Xenon lamp (PerfectLight, PLS-SXE300, China) with a 420-nm UV-cutoff filter was used as the light source and was positioned ca. 15 cm above the reactor.As a typical photocatalytic experiment, 100 mg of the photocatalyst was uniformly deposited onto the bottom of the reactor.Prior to the light irradiation, the reactor was sealed and purged by blowing nitrogen for 45 min to ensure the anaerobic conditions of the reaction system.In each testing experiment, CO2 and H2O vapor were in-situ produced by the reaction of NaHCO3 powder and aqueous H2SO4 solution inside a specially designed groove in one neck of the reactor.The NaHCO3 powder (0.084 g) was put into the groove before sealing, while the aqueous H2SO4 solution (2 M, 0.3 mL) was injected into the groove by a syringe before light irradiation.After 1 h of light irradiation, the gas products extracted from the reactor were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with two flame-ionized detectors and a thermal conductivity detector.High-purity helium was used as the carrier gas in the gas chromatography.The retention time and yield of each detected gas product were determined and calibrated with a standard gas mixture. The anaerobic photocatalytic degradation of the aqueous RhB solution over sample CBB was conducted in the above anaerobic reaction system under identical conditions, except that the 50 mL aqueous RhB solution (10 mg/L) was introduced, instead of the NaHCO3 powder and aqueous H2SO4 solution to produce CO2 and H2O vapor.The gas products and concentration change of the aqueous RhB solution were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-7890B, Agilent) and UV-visible spectrophotometry (UV-2550, Shimadzu), respectively."}, {"llm generation": "visible light source", "source": "For the former, a 350-W Xenon lamp (Changzhou Siyu, China) equipped with a 420-nm UV-cutoff filter was used as the visible light source.", "context": "g-C3N4 nanosheets.All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and used without further purification.Typically, the bulk g-C3N4 was obtained by direct heating of 10 g melamine at 550 C for 4 h with a ramping rate of 5 C/min in a semi-closed alumina crucible with a cover.After cooling to room temperature, the bulk g-C3N4 was ground into yellow powder and reannealed at 550 C in air for a further 2 h to transform the bulk g-C3N4 into g-C3N4 nanosheets, involving thermal oxidation etching.The obtained g-C3N4 nanosheet products are denoted as C for simplicity.

Obviously, the phase structure of BiVO4 in sample B comprised both the monoclinic scheelite (m-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0688) and tetragonal zircon structure (t-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0133) 4950515253.The phase structure is usually of great importance for the photocatalytic activity, as it largely determines the band structures and surface properties.Moreover, it is well-documented that photocatalysts with mixed phase struc-tures could form phase junctions to enhance the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes 49.For sample C, two typical diffraction peaks at 12.9 and 27.6 were recorded, which can be indexed to the 100 and 002 planes of g-C3N4, corresponding to the in-plane structural packing motif and interlayer stacking of aromatic systems, respectively.The XRD patterns for samples CB and CBB were rather similar to that for sample B. Comparing with the XRD pattern for sample C, the typical peak at 12.9 for g-C3N4 phase in sample CB and CBB was almost invisible, while the typical peak at 27.6 for the g-C3N4 phase in samples CB and CBB was largely weakened.There may be several possible reasons for this decrease in peak in-tensity.For example, a decrease in the planar size of the g-C3N4 nanosheets may occur by etching during the liquid phase deposition process, followed by the thermally induced crystallization process of the BiVO4 nanoparticles.Additionally, the coverage of the g-C3N4 nanosheets with highly crystalline BiVO4 nanoparticles may shield, to some extent, the XRD signals for the g-C3N4 phase.It is worth noting that no obvious shift in the peak position was observed in the binary (CB) and ternary (CBB) nanocomposites, suggesting no lattice doping occurred during the synthesis processes.It is noted that because of the tiny amount of reduced metallic Bi nanoparticles, no characteristic XRD signal for metallic Bi was observed in sample CBB. XPS was conducted to further determine the detailed surface elemental compositions and their chemical states, and to unveil the strong interactions between distinct phases in sample CBB.The XPS survey spectrum for sample CBB is displayed in Fig. 3(a), in which the XPS peaks for the C, N, Bi, V, and O elements can be well resolved.The high-resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f before and after Ar etching are shown in Fig. 3(b).Because of the instability of metallic Bi upon oxidation in air, only the XPS peaks centered at 158.82 and 164.13 eV were recorded before Ar etching, which are typically ascribed to the Bi-O bonds of elemental Bi 70717273.Furthermore, it is common that a thin bismuth oxide layer will easily form on the surface of the metallic Bi upon exposure to air 70717273.After Ar etching of sample CBB, the characteristic XPS peaks corresponding to Bi-Bi bonding significantly appeared at around 156. 74 and the defect-containing sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in the graphitic domains, respectively.The latter is possibly assigned to the N-CN coordination in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.The fitted four peaks of the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3(d)), centered at around 398.67, 399.86, 401.17, and 404.85 eV, can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen involved in the triazine rings (C-NC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups, amino functional groups having a hydrogen atom (C-N-H), and excitations, respectively, in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.Importantly, the dominant peaks of C 1s and N 1s in sample CBB shifted to higher binding energies relative to the reference 272829303132333435.From the high-resolution XPS spectrum of V 2p in Fig. 3(e), the binding energies at 516.51 and 523.81 eV are assigned to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, respectively.For the high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s in Fig. 3(f), the peak with binding energy at 529.54 eV was attributed to crystal lattice oxygen of BiVO4 in the form of Bi2O2 2 , while the peak at 531.45 eV was ascribed to the hydroxyl groups on the surface 4950515253.It is worth noting that the shifts of the C 1s and N 1s peaks towards higher binding energies were accompanied with the shifts of the Bi 4f, V 2p and O 1s peaks towards lower binding energies in sample CBB.This result indicates the decrease in the electron density on the C and N moieties, the simultaneous increase in the electron density on the Bi, V, and O moieties, and that a built-in electric field formed at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface.In combination, it was manifested that a strong interaction existed between the g-C3N4 phase and the BiVO4 phase in the nanocomposite (sample CBB), rather than a simple physical mixture.Moreover, it was supposed that upon light irradiation, electron transfer from BiVO4 to g-C3N4 would be favored due to the electrostatic effects of the built-in electric field, suggesting an S-scheme junction across the interface in sample CBB. The morphology of the samples was firstly investigated by the SEM images (Fig. S1).A sheet-like uniform morphology was observed for pure g-C3N4 (sample C, Fig. S1(a)), whereas, concave cube-like larger microcrystals were observed for pure BiVO4 (sample B, Fig. S1(b)).The overall morphologies of the binary (sample CB, Fig. S1(c)) and the ternary (sample CBB, Fig. S1(d)) nanocomposites were quite similar, comparable to that of pure g-C3N4.Interestingly, in both samples CB and CBB, no bulk BiVO4 microcrystals were observed, while most evolved into nanoflakes, nanorods, or irregular nanoparticles, which were mainly attached to the g-C3N4 host.Such an observation was further confirmed by the corresponding TEM image for sample CBB (Fig. 4(a)).Many nanoparticles in the form of nanoflakes, nanorods, or of irregular shape were deposited on the surface of the transparent g-C3N4 nanosheets.The inset of Fig. 4(a) corresponds to the SAED patterns of sample CBB, indicating the polycrystalline features of the multicomponent nanocomposites.The corresponding HRTEM image (Fig. 4(b)) revealed that highly crystalline monoclinic BiVO4 (m-BiVO4), surrounded by some amorphous Bi nanoparticles, were deposited on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets.The clear lattice fringe spacing of 0.31 nm corresponded to the (121) crystal plane of monoclinic BiVO4 4950515253. Considering the abundant sheet-like morphology of monoclinic BiVO4 in the nanocomposites, it was supposed that these monoclinic BiVO4 nanosheets were largely attached to the g-C3N4 nanosheets via the m-BiVO4(001)/g-C3N4(001) interface.To further clearly demonstrate the elemental distribution in the nanocomposites (sample CBB), the EDS elemental mappings of C, N, Bi, V, and O (Figs. 4(d)-(i)) of sample CBB were obtained on the corresponding HAADF-STEM image, shown in Fig. 4(c), which was the same observation zone in Fig. 4(a).The C and N distribution profiles correspond to the transparent underlayer in Fig. 4(a), while the Bi, V, and O distribution profiles correspond well to the overall appearance of the surface-deposited nanoparticles in Figs.4(a) and(c).Combining the above XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, and EDS results, it was clear that binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 and ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites were successfully constructed with a well-contacted interface. The porous structures of samples B, C, CB, and CBB were investigated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. S2(a).All the samples had isotherms of type IV, according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller classification, indicating the presence of mesopores (2-50 nm).The sorption isotherms of samples C, CB, and CBB were very similar, suggesting their comparable porous structures.The introduction of BiVO4 and the Bi nanoparticles to couple with the g-C3N4 nanosheets had a tiny influence on the microstructures.The sorption isotherms of sample B were otherwise very different, having almost no adsorption in the wide relative pressure (P/P0) range, and only a minor hysteresis loop at high P/P0, suggesting there were much less mesopores in sample B, in good agreement with the corresponding pore size distribution.In fact, as shown in Table S1, the specific surface area of sample B was only 19 m 2 /g, much smaller than that of samples C, CB, and CBB (50 m 2 /g).The hysteresis loops for samples C, CB, and CBB covered a considerably wide range of relative pressures, suggesting their wide bimodal mesopore size distributions, as confirmed by the corresponding broad BJH pore-size distributions (Fig. S2(b)).Typically, they had two main mesopore peaks centered at around 4 and 45 nm.Moreover, the isotherms for samples C, CB, and CBB showed high adsorption at high P/P0 approaching 1.0, implying the existence of large mesopores and macropores.The formation of various mesopores and macropores is due to the intra-and inter-agglomeration 1011. It is well known that CO2 adsorption on the surface of a photocatalyst is key to initiating the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.Furthermore, the CO2 adsorption capacity is a significant factor influencing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency 1011.As shown in Fig. S3, all the samples showed an almost linear relationship between the CO2 adsorption capacity and the relative pressure (P/P0) in the higher P/P0 range of 0.3-1.0.Such a characteristic indicates a dominant physical interaction between CO2 and the various samples; thus, the specific surface area was found to be the most important influencing factor.In particular, with the increasing SBET from sample B to samples C and CB, the CO2 adsorption capacity steadily increased.Meanwhile, in the lower P/P0 range of 0-0.3, a relatively faster increase in CO2 uptake was recorded for all the samples, particularly for sample CBB, indicating the occurrence of the chemical adsorption of CO2.The chemical adsorption of CO2 on sample B is minor, suggesting that the chemical interaction between CO2 and BiVO4 is weak.However, samples C, CB, and CBB have much stronger chemical adsorption.This is probably due to the stronger interaction of the g-C3N4 moieties, which have abundant amino functional groups (XPS results), with the CO2 molecules.In particular, the in-situ reduction step to fabricate sample CBB might lead to further surface functionalization of g-C3N4 to enhance the chemical adsorption of CO2. The band structures of the photocatalysts could be revealed by combined optical and electrochemical analyses.Specifically, the bandgap energies can be estimated by analyzing the optical absorption spectrum.The UV-vis DRS spectra were measured to study the optical properties and electronic structures of the as-prepared samples (Fig. 5).All the four samples have good absorption in the visible light region.The optical absorption edges of samples C and B were approximately estimated to be 450 and 525 nm, respectively (Fig. 5(a)).The absorption curves for samples CB and CBB are located between those of samples B and C (Fig. 5(a)).In particular, because of the SPR effects of the in-situ generated Bi nanoparticles 61,70, sample CBB exhibited a slight promotion in visible light absorption above 500 nm, compared with sample CB.The bandgap energy (Eg) values of samples B and C can be evaluated using the following equation: h B (h -Eg) n/2 where is the absorption coefficient, is the frequency of the light, h is Planck's constant, B is the absorption constant, and n 1 or 4 depending on the nature of the semiconductor (direct or indirect bandgap, respectively) 60.Both g-C3N4 and BiVO4 are direct bandgap semiconductors, consequently, Eg can be estimated from a plot of ( h) 2 versus (h).The interception of the tangent to the x-axis would give a good approximation of Eg of the samples.As the absorbance (A) is proportional to the absorption coefficient (), the value of A was used as a substitute of in the present study, as in Fig. 5(b).Here, the Eg values of samples B and C were estimated to be 2.40 and 2.83 eV, respectively, which agree well with the reported values 49.Moreover, the conduction band energy (ECB) of a photocatalyst can be calculated according to the following equation (Mulliken electronegativity theory): ECB -E e -0.5Eg, where is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor photocatalyst, E e is the energy of the free electron in the hydrogen scale (approximately 4.5 eV), and Eg is the bandgap energy 60.The values for BiVO4 and g-C3N4 are 6.04 and 4.66 eV, respectively 60, so the calculated CB potentials for samples B and C were approximately 0.34 and -1.26 V, respectively.Combined with the value of Eg, the VB potentials of samples B and C were, thus, calculated to be 2.74 and 1.57V vs. NHE, respectively.The band structures of the BiVO4 (sample B) and g-C3N4 (sample C) photocatalysts are illustrated in Fig. S4. As the charge separation and transfer efficiency play a critical role in the final photocatalytic performance, we combined the transient photocurrent and EIS analyses to clarify the charge dynamic process in the different photocatalysts (Fig. 6).The transient photocurrent responses were recorded at a bias potential of 0.4 V for several on-off cycles under visible light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 6(a), for all the samples, the photocurrent reached a constant value when the light was on, and decreased to zero when the light was off.The photocurrents of both samples B and C were obviously lower than those of the other two composite samples.It was suggested that the interfacial hybridization of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 in sample CB was beneficial for the charge separation.Moreover, after introducing a certain amount of Bi nanoparticles in sample CBB, the photocurrent was further increased, relative to sample CB.It was supposed that a portion of Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acted as an electron bridge, promoting the interfacial charge transfer.EIS analysis is a powerful tool to study the electrochemical charge transfer behavior at high frequency 3,11.Fig. 6(b) shows the EIS spectra in the Nyquist mode in the frequency range of 100 kHz -1 kHz for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB.The Nyquist plot can be interpreted in terms of the equivalent circuit, as displayed in the inset.In the equivalent circuit, Rs is the solution resistance, CPE is the constant phase element for the electrolyte/electrode interface, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the interface of the electrode/electrolyte 3,11.The arcs in the Nyquist plot are related to the charge transfer at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.The fitted Rct values were 46.8, 42.0, 38.2, and 34.4 for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB, respectively.Sample CBB, with the lowest Rct, presented the best charge transfer efficiency.Over-all, it can be concluded that the charge transfer rate in sample CB can be improved because of the reduced charge recombination by forming a heterojunction, compared to those in samples B and C. By introducing a portion of Bi nanoparticles at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acting as an electron bridge, the charge transfer rate in sample CBB could be further enhanced. In this study, Rhodamine B (RhB) was chosen as the target pollutant to evaluate the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of the as-prepared samples under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).As presented in Fig. 7(a), sample CBB shows the best aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity in the degradation of the RhB molecules.The temporal changes in the absorption spectra of the RhB aqueous solution (10 mg/L) upon visible light irradiation over sample C are illustrated in Fig. 7(b).It is noted that the maximum absorption band (wavelength corresponding to the maximal absorbance, max) of the reaction solution gradually shifted from 554 to 495 nm during the photocatalytic degradation of RhB.This hypsochromic shift in max of the RhB solution corresponds to the step-by-step de-ethylation of RhB to give N,N,N'-triethyl rhodamine (TER, 539 nm), N,N'-diethyl rhodamine (DER, 522 nm), N-ethyl rhodamine (MER, 510 nm), and rhodamine at 495 nm 50.As shown in Fig. 7(c), the degree of de-ethylation can be represented by the blue shift in the wavelength of the maximum absorption: max 554 -max 50.Importantly, as for all the samples, de-ethylation occurred dominantly in the early stage; at the end of this stage, there was a leap in max, then, max was very limited (Fig. 7(c)), indicating that the de-ethylation process was almost terminated and the mineralization process of rhodamine (decomposition of the conjugated structure of rhodamine to small molecules) was initiated 50.In this regard, there are two distinctive stages of the aerobic photocatalytic RhB oxidation process: de-ethylation and mineralization.Generally, the rate of de-ethylation is higher than that of the following mineralization process, and very limited changes in the spectral intensity are recorded at the maximal absorption during miner- alization.The photocatalytic oxidation rate of RhB can be approximately calculated based on the de-ethylation process of RhB.The photocatalytic degradation kinetics of RhB during de-ethylation can be described using a pseudo first order reaction model, expressed by the following: -ln(C/C0) kt, where C0 and C are the initial and final RhB concentrations, respectively; k is the pseudo first order rate constant; and t represents the light irradiation time.The k values can be estimated from the ln (A0/A) vs. t plot, as shown in Fig. 7(d).Sample CBB had the highest k value of 0.067 min -1 , much higher than that of samples B (0.005 min -1 ), C (0.033 min -1 ), and CB (0.051 min -1 ).The aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of sample CBB is obviously better than that of some previously reported similar materials 525354555657585960. It is worth noting that, during the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation processes, RhB could be usually degraded completely into CO2, which is generally regarded as the ideal harmless product for organic pollution control.However, in terms of carbon cycling, CO2 is not an ideal product because it is a typical greenhouse gas; thus, it is highly desirable to reduce the above-generated CO2 into other value-added chemicals or fuels.In this study, the possibility of the anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals using the various as-prepared samples was also evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).The anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 involves a series of complicated processes, i.e., charge generation and transfer, C-O bond breaking, and C-H and O-H bond formation 12.The main reactions during photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O are as follows 12. CO2 2H 2e - CO H2O E 0 redox -0.24V The anaerobic photocatalytic gaseous reduction of CO2 in the presence of water vapor was performed under visible light irradiation for 1 h at atmospheric pressure.As shown in Fig. 8, the evolution of CO was recorded as the main product for all the samples, while some other reduction products such as H2, CH4, and CH3OH could also be detected for the binary and ternary composites.As CH3OH, CH4, and H2 are important industrial chemicals and fuels, their selective production over samples CB and CBB suggests the significance of the construction of a composite photocatalyst.More specifically, owing to the formation of the heterojunction between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, a trace amount of CH4 and a small amount of H2 were detected for sample CB, but the yield of CO considerably decreased.In contrast, for sample CBB, while much more multi-electron reduc- tion products (CH4 and CH3OH) were generated, the yields of the two-electron reduction products (CO and H2) also significantly increased.The efficient charge transfer and surface enrichment in composite photocatalysts would favor the generation of multi-electron reduction products.The above separated aerobic photocatalytic oxidation and anaerobic photocatalytic reduction experiments clearly demonstrate the dual functionality of the designed composite photocatalyst.As illustrated in Fig. 1, these results imply the possibility of achieving photocatalytic carbon cycling by the integration of the aerobic oxidation and anaerobic reduction processes.However, the two-pot reaction systems, involving RhB to CO2 followed by CO2 to solar fuels, will be complicated in operation.Under this consideration, the direct conversion of RhB to solar fuels under anaerobic conditions in one-pot was also studied over the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalysts.The anaerobic photocatalytic degradation of the aqueous RhB solution over sample CBB was also performed in the anaerobic reaction system under identical conditions, except that 50-mL aqueous RhB solution (10 mg/L) was introduced instead of CO2 and H2O vapor.The one-pot anaerobic photocatalytic result is shown in Fig. 8(b).The RhB degradation efficiency was approximately 30 in 1 h, which was much lower than that conducted under aerobic conditions.This result suggests that oxygen was important for enhancing the photocatalytic RhB removal process.Interestingly, CO, as the major gas product, was indeed detected.The yield (0.63 mol/(gh) was much lower than that obtained from the photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O vapor.More complex reaction processes are involved in the one-pot anaerobic reaction system, while the overall photocatalytic conversion efficiency can be further improved by promoting the anaerobic RhB oxidation efficiency, which would compete with the water splitting process that is crucial for CO hydrogenation. As shown above, the photocatalytic activities of samples CB and CBB were tremendously enhanced because of the formation of the heterojunction; thus, it is essential to understand the synergetic mechanism in the binary and ternary composite system.Combing the XPS analyses of sample CBB (Fig. 2) with the band structure analyses of the g-C3N4 and BiVO4 photocatalyst (Fig. 8), the formation of the S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst probably accounts for the promotion of the charge dynamics (Fig. S2) and photocatalytic efficiency.Such an assumption was further confirmed by the following results of the density functional theory (DFT) calculation and scavenger studies 30,65666768. The calculations were conducted using the CASTEP mode of Materials Studio according to DFT 74757677.The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof form exchange-correlation functional was used within the generalized gradient approximation.The geometry optimization and electrostatic potential calculations were completed with the cutoff energy of 380 eV and Monkhorst-Pack grids of 2 5 1 for the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane, and 3 3 1 for the monolayer g-C3N4.The convergence thresholds for the geometry optimization were set as: energy of 5.0 10 -6 eV/atom, maximum force of 0.01 eV/A, and maximum stress of 0.02 GPa.The optimized models and calculated average potential profiles of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane and monolayer g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 9. The Fermi energy of the semiconductor is one important parameter for estimating the charge transfer between the interfaces of two semiconductor materials, and can be calculated by: Evac -EF where Evac and EF are the electrostatic potential of the vacuum energy and Fermi energy, respectively 74757677.The calculated work functions of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4 were 6.92 and 4.23 eV, respectively.The Fermi energy of the g-C3N4 was higher than that of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet.Upon the interfacial contact between the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4, electrons will transfer from g-C3N4 to the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet until their Fermi energies reach the same level.As a consequence, this leads to the decrease of electron density of g-C3N4 and an increase in BiVO4, implying the formation of a built-in electric field at the BiVO4 and g-C3N4 interface (Fig. S5).It is worth noting that the direction of the abovementioned built-in electric field is from the g-C3N4 surface to the BiVO4 surface, which is beneficial to the vectorial interfacial transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers from the CB of BiVO4 to the VB of g-C3N4 during the photocatalytic reaction processes (Fig. S5).Overall, the DFT calculation suggests the formation of an S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst 74757677.By a simple comparison of the OH -/OH and O2/O2 -redox potentials versus the CB and VB potentials of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 (Fig. S4), it is clear that OH radicals cannot be generated over pure g-C3N4, but can be generated over pure BiVO4.On the contrary, O2 -radicals cannot be generated over pure BiVO4, but can be generated over pure g-C3N4.Such assumptions have been well confirmed by the scavenger studies.IPA as the OH scavenger and Tempol as the O2 -scavenger were introduced in the respective reaction system for the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation to determine the involved main ROSs over each photocatalyst (Fig. 10).Importantly, in the sample B-based photocatalytic system, the degradation efficiency was obviously inhibited after introduction of IPA as the scavenger of OH, suggesting the weak reductive ability of the photogenerated electrons in BiVO4, while the main ROS were h -derived oxidative species (OH).In contrast, the degradation efficiency of the sample C-based photocatalytic system was inhibited after introduction of Tempol as the scavenger of O2 -, suggesting the weak oxidative ability of the photogenerated holes in BiVO4, while the main ROS were e --derived oxidative species (O2 -).After the formation of the heterostructure between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, both O2 -and OH significantly contributed to the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation over samples CB and CBB.This result suggests that in the g-C3N4/BiVO4 binary nanocom-posites, both the photoexcited holes with strong oxidative ability from the VB of BiVO4 and the photoexcited electrons with strong reductive ability from the CB of g-C3N4 were retained, and an S-scheme hybrid photocatalyst system was established.Moreover, after introduction of the Bi nanoparticles, the synergetic photocatalytic mechanism did not vary, sustaining the S-scheme interfacial charge transfer in the g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 ternary nanocomposites.In fact, metallic Bi nanoparticles, as an important component of CBB ternary photocatalysts, may have three basic functions 67.First, the plasmonic effects of Bi nanoparticles enhance the visible light absorption ability (Fig. 5(a)).Second, the field effects of plasmonic Bi nanoparticles enhance the charge separation efficiency (Fig. 6).Third, a portion of metallic Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of the S-scheme of g-C3N4/BiVO4 may promote the interfacial charge transfer by acting as an S-scheme electron mediator (Fig. 6), similar to the roles of the Au nanoparticles in the Au/CdS/TiO2 hybrid system 66. The complex photocatalytic mechanism of the S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst is demonstrated in Fig. 11.First, for the light harvesting process, there are three active visible light absorption centers, being the g-C3N4 nanosheets, BiVO4, and surface-decorated metallic Bi nanoparticles.In particular, due to the SPR effects, the metallic Bi nanoparticles enhanced the visible light absorption capacity.Second, for the charge transfer processes, due to the formation of a built-in electric field at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface, S-scheme interfacial charge transfer, that is the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of BiVO4 toward the VB of g-C3N4, dominated upon light irradiation.Moreover, the metallic Bi nanoparticles acted as an S-scheme electron mediator to promote the interfacial charge transfer in the ternary S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid system.Incidentally, the photoexcited hot electrons from the metallic Bi nanoparticles transferred to the CB of the BiVO4 moiety, then toward the VB of g-C3N4, inhibiting the charge recombination.As a consequence, the holes in g-C3N4 and the electrons in BiVO4 with poor redox ability were sacrificed, and the electrons in g-C3N4 and the holes in BiVO4 with strong redox ability remained and were spatially separated, which together modulate the charge potentials and dynamics to suit the"}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The transient photocurrent responses were recorded at a bias potential of 0.4 V for several on-off cycles under visible light irradiation.", "context": "The XRD patterns were used to identify the phase structures of the various as-prepared samples, as shown in Fig. 2. Obviously, the phase structure of BiVO4 in sample B comprised both the monoclinic scheelite (m-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0688) and tetragonal zircon structure (t-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0133) 4950515253.The phase structure is usually of great importance for the photocatalytic activity, as it largely determines the band structures and surface properties.Moreover, it is well-documented that photocatalysts with mixed phase struc-tures could form phase junctions to enhance the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes 49.For sample C, two typical diffraction peaks at 12.9 and 27.6 were recorded, which can be indexed to the 100 and 002 planes of g-C3N4, corresponding to the in-plane structural packing motif and interlayer stacking of aromatic systems, respectively.The XRD patterns for samples CB and CBB were rather similar to that for sample B. Comparing with the XRD pattern for sample C, the typical peak at 12.9 for g-C3N4 phase in sample CB and CBB was almost invisible, while the typical peak at 27.6 for the g-C3N4 phase in samples CB and CBB was largely weakened.There may be several possible reasons for this decrease in peak in-tensity.For example, a decrease in the planar size of the g-C3N4 nanosheets may occur by etching during the liquid phase deposition process, followed by the thermally induced crystallization process of the BiVO4 nanoparticles.Additionally, the coverage of the g-C3N4 nanosheets with highly crystalline BiVO4 nanoparticles may shield, to some extent, the XRD signals for the g-C3N4 phase.It is worth noting that no obvious shift in the peak position was observed in the binary (CB) and ternary (CBB) nanocomposites, suggesting no lattice doping occurred during the synthesis processes.It is noted that because of the tiny amount of reduced metallic Bi nanoparticles, no characteristic XRD signal for metallic Bi was observed in sample CBB. XPS was conducted to further determine the detailed surface elemental compositions and their chemical states, and to unveil the strong interactions between distinct phases in sample CBB.The XPS survey spectrum for sample CBB is displayed in Fig. 3(a), in which the XPS peaks for the C, N, Bi, V, and O elements can be well resolved.The high-resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f before and after Ar etching are shown in Fig. 3(b).Because of the instability of metallic Bi upon oxidation in air, only the XPS peaks centered at 158.82 and 164.13 eV were recorded before Ar etching, which are typically ascribed to the Bi-O bonds of elemental Bi 70717273.Furthermore, it is common that a thin bismuth oxide layer will easily form on the surface of the metallic Bi upon exposure to air 70717273.After Ar etching of sample CBB, the characteristic XPS peaks corresponding to Bi-Bi bonding significantly appeared at around 156. 74 and the defect-containing sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in the graphitic domains, respectively.The latter is possibly assigned to the N-CN coordination in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.The fitted four peaks of the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3(d)), centered at around 398.67, 399.86, 401.17, and 404.85 eV, can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen involved in the triazine rings (C-NC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups, amino functional groups having a hydrogen atom (C-N-H), and excitations, respectively, in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.Importantly, the dominant peaks of C 1s and N 1s in sample CBB shifted to higher binding energies relative to the reference 272829303132333435.From the high-resolution XPS spectrum of V 2p in Fig. 3(e), the binding energies at 516.51 and 523.81 eV are assigned to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, respectively.For the high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s in Fig. 3(f), the peak with binding energy at 529.54 eV was attributed to crystal lattice oxygen of BiVO4 in the form of Bi2O2 2 , while the peak at 531.45 eV was ascribed to the hydroxyl groups on the surface 4950515253.It is worth noting that the shifts of the C 1s and N 1s peaks towards higher binding energies were accompanied with the shifts of the Bi 4f, V 2p and O 1s peaks towards lower binding energies in sample CBB.This result indicates the decrease in the electron density on the C and N moieties, the simultaneous increase in the electron density on the Bi, V, and O moieties, and that a built-in electric field formed at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface.In combination, it was manifested that a strong interaction existed between the g-C3N4 phase and the BiVO4 phase in the nanocomposite (sample CBB), rather than a simple physical mixture.Moreover, it was supposed that upon light irradiation, electron transfer from BiVO4 to g-C3N4 would be favored due to the electrostatic effects of the built-in electric field, suggesting an S-scheme junction across the interface in sample CBB. The morphology of the samples was firstly investigated by the SEM images (Fig. S1).A sheet-like uniform morphology was observed for pure g-C3N4 (sample C, Fig. S1(a)), whereas, concave cube-like larger microcrystals were observed for pure BiVO4 (sample B, Fig. S1(b)).The overall morphologies of the binary (sample CB, Fig. S1(c)) and the ternary (sample CBB, Fig. S1(d)) nanocomposites were quite similar, comparable to that of pure g-C3N4.Interestingly, in both samples CB and CBB, no bulk BiVO4 microcrystals were observed, while most evolved into nanoflakes, nanorods, or irregular nanoparticles, which were mainly attached to the g-C3N4 host.Such an observation was further confirmed by the corresponding TEM image for sample CBB (Fig. 4(a)).Many nanoparticles in the form of nanoflakes, nanorods, or of irregular shape were deposited on the surface of the transparent g-C3N4 nanosheets.The inset of Fig. 4(a) corresponds to the SAED patterns of sample CBB, indicating the polycrystalline features of the multicomponent nanocomposites.The corresponding HRTEM image (Fig. 4(b)) revealed that highly crystalline monoclinic BiVO4 (m-BiVO4), surrounded by some amorphous Bi nanoparticles, were deposited on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets.The clear lattice fringe spacing of 0.31 nm corresponded to the (121) crystal plane of monoclinic BiVO4 4950515253. Considering the abundant sheet-like morphology of monoclinic BiVO4 in the nanocomposites, it was supposed that these monoclinic BiVO4 nanosheets were largely attached to the g-C3N4 nanosheets via the m-BiVO4(001)/g-C3N4(001) interface.To further clearly demonstrate the elemental distribution in the nanocomposites (sample CBB), the EDS elemental mappings of C, N, Bi, V, and O (Figs. 4(d)-(i)) of sample CBB were obtained on the corresponding HAADF-STEM image, shown in Fig. 4(c), which was the same observation zone in Fig. 4(a).The C and N distribution profiles correspond to the transparent underlayer in Fig. 4(a), while the Bi, V, and O distribution profiles correspond well to the overall appearance of the surface-deposited nanoparticles in Figs.4(a) and(c).Combining the above XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, and EDS results, it was clear that binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 and ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites were successfully constructed with a well-contacted interface. The porous structures of samples B, C, CB, and CBB were investigated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. S2(a).All the samples had isotherms of type IV, according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller classification, indicating the presence of mesopores (2-50 nm).The sorption isotherms of samples C, CB, and CBB were very similar, suggesting their comparable porous structures.The introduction of BiVO4 and the Bi nanoparticles to couple with the g-C3N4 nanosheets had a tiny influence on the microstructures.The sorption isotherms of sample B were otherwise very different, having almost no adsorption in the wide relative pressure (P/P0) range, and only a minor hysteresis loop at high P/P0, suggesting there were much less mesopores in sample B, in good agreement with the corresponding pore size distribution.In fact, as shown in Table S1, the specific surface area of sample B was only 19 m 2 /g, much smaller than that of samples C, CB, and CBB (50 m 2 /g).The hysteresis loops for samples C, CB, and CBB covered a considerably wide range of relative pressures, suggesting their wide bimodal mesopore size distributions, as confirmed by the corresponding broad BJH pore-size distributions (Fig. S2(b)).Typically, they had two main mesopore peaks centered at around 4 and 45 nm.Moreover, the isotherms for samples C, CB, and CBB showed high adsorption at high P/P0 approaching 1.0, implying the existence of large mesopores and macropores.The formation of various mesopores and macropores is due to the intra-and inter-agglomeration 1011. It is well known that CO2 adsorption on the surface of a photocatalyst is key to initiating the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.Furthermore, the CO2 adsorption capacity is a significant factor influencing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency 1011.As shown in Fig. S3, all the samples showed an almost linear relationship between the CO2 adsorption capacity and the relative pressure (P/P0) in the higher P/P0 range of 0.3-1.0.Such a characteristic indicates a dominant physical interaction between CO2 and the various samples; thus, the specific surface area was found to be the most important influencing factor.In particular, with the increasing SBET from sample B to samples C and CB, the CO2 adsorption capacity steadily increased.Meanwhile, in the lower P/P0 range of 0-0.3, a relatively faster increase in CO2 uptake was recorded for all the samples, particularly for sample CBB, indicating the occurrence of the chemical adsorption of CO2.The chemical adsorption of CO2 on sample B is minor, suggesting that the chemical interaction between CO2 and BiVO4 is weak.However, samples C, CB, and CBB have much stronger chemical adsorption.This is probably due to the stronger interaction of the g-C3N4 moieties, which have abundant amino functional groups (XPS results), with the CO2 molecules.In particular, the in-situ reduction step to fabricate sample CBB might lead to further surface functionalization of g-C3N4 to enhance the chemical adsorption of CO2. The band structures of the photocatalysts could be revealed by combined optical and electrochemical analyses.Specifically, the bandgap energies can be estimated by analyzing the optical absorption spectrum.The UV-vis DRS spectra were measured to study the optical properties and electronic structures of the as-prepared samples (Fig. 5).All the four samples have good absorption in the visible light region.The optical absorption edges of samples C and B were approximately estimated to be 450 and 525 nm, respectively (Fig. 5(a)).The absorption curves for samples CB and CBB are located between those of samples B and C (Fig. 5(a)).In particular, because of the SPR effects of the in-situ generated Bi nanoparticles 61,70, sample CBB exhibited a slight promotion in visible light absorption above 500 nm, compared with sample CB.The bandgap energy (Eg) values of samples B and C can be evaluated using the following equation: h B (h -Eg) n/2 where is the absorption coefficient, is the frequency of the light, h is Planck's constant, B is the absorption constant, and n 1 or 4 depending on the nature of the semiconductor (direct or indirect bandgap, respectively) 60.Both g-C3N4 and BiVO4 are direct bandgap semiconductors, consequently, Eg can be estimated from a plot of ( h) 2 versus (h).The interception of the tangent to the x-axis would give a good approximation of Eg of the samples.As the absorbance (A) is proportional to the absorption coefficient (), the value of A was used as a substitute of in the present study, as in Fig. 5(b).Here, the Eg values of samples B and C were estimated to be 2.40 and 2.83 eV, respectively, which agree well with the reported values 49.Moreover, the conduction band energy (ECB) of a photocatalyst can be calculated according to the following equation (Mulliken electronegativity theory): ECB -E e -0.5Eg, where is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor photocatalyst, E e is the energy of the free electron in the hydrogen scale (approximately 4.5 eV), and Eg is the bandgap energy 60.The values for BiVO4 and g-C3N4 are 6.04 and 4.66 eV, respectively 60, so the calculated CB potentials for samples B and C were approximately 0.34 and -1.26 V, respectively.Combined with the value of Eg, the VB potentials of samples B and C were, thus, calculated to be 2.74 and 1.57V vs. NHE, respectively.The band structures of the BiVO4 (sample B) and g-C3N4 (sample C) photocatalysts are illustrated in Fig. S4. As the charge separation and transfer efficiency play a critical role in the final photocatalytic performance, we combined the transient photocurrent and EIS analyses to clarify the charge dynamic process in the different photocatalysts (Fig. 6).The transient photocurrent responses were recorded at a bias potential of 0.4 V for several on-off cycles under visible light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 6(a), for all the samples, the photocurrent reached a constant value when the light was on, and decreased to zero when the light was off.The photocurrents of both samples B and C were obviously lower than those of the other two composite samples.It was suggested that the interfacial hybridization of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 in sample CB was beneficial for the charge separation.Moreover, after introducing a certain amount of Bi nanoparticles in sample CBB, the photocurrent was further increased, relative to sample CB.It was supposed that a portion of Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acted as an electron bridge, promoting the interfacial charge transfer.EIS analysis is a powerful tool to study the electrochemical charge transfer behavior at high frequency 3,11.Fig. 6(b) shows the EIS spectra in the Nyquist mode in the frequency range of 100 kHz -1 kHz for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB.The Nyquist plot can be interpreted in terms of the equivalent circuit, as displayed in the inset.In the equivalent circuit, Rs is the solution resistance, CPE is the constant phase element for the electrolyte/electrode interface, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the interface of the electrode/electrolyte 3,11.The arcs in the Nyquist plot are related to the charge transfer at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.The fitted Rct values were 46.8, 42.0, 38.2, and 34.4 for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB, respectively.Sample CBB, with the lowest Rct, presented the best charge transfer efficiency.Over-all, it can be concluded that the charge transfer rate in sample CB can be improved because of the reduced charge recombination by forming a heterojunction, compared to those in samples B and C. By introducing a portion of Bi nanoparticles at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acting as an electron bridge, the charge transfer rate in sample CBB could be further enhanced. In this study, Rhodamine B (RhB) was chosen as the target pollutant to evaluate the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of the as-prepared samples under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).As presented in Fig. 7(a), sample CBB shows the best aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity in the degradation of the RhB molecules.The temporal changes in the absorption spectra of the RhB aqueous solution (10 mg/L) upon visible light irradiation over sample C are illustrated in Fig. 7(b).It is noted that the maximum absorption band (wavelength corresponding to the maximal absorbance, max) of the reaction solution gradually shifted from 554 to 495 nm during the photocatalytic degradation of RhB.This hypsochromic shift in max of the RhB solution corresponds to the step-by-step de-ethylation of RhB to give N,N,N'-triethyl rhodamine (TER, 539 nm), N,N'-diethyl rhodamine (DER, 522 nm), N-ethyl rhodamine (MER, 510 nm), and rhodamine at 495 nm 50.As shown in Fig. 7(c), the degree of de-ethylation can be represented by the blue shift in the wavelength of the maximum absorption: max 554 -max 50.Importantly, as for all the samples, de-ethylation occurred dominantly in the early stage; at the end of this stage, there was a leap in max, then, max was very limited (Fig. 7(c)), indicating that the de-ethylation process was almost terminated and the mineralization process of rhodamine (decomposition of the conjugated structure of rhodamine to small molecules) was initiated 50.In this regard, there are two distinctive stages of the aerobic photocatalytic RhB oxidation process: de-ethylation and mineralization.Generally, the rate of de-ethylation is higher than that of the following mineralization process, and very limited changes in the spectral intensity are recorded at the maximal absorption during miner- alization.The photocatalytic oxidation rate of RhB can be approximately calculated based on the de-ethylation process of RhB.The photocatalytic degradation kinetics of RhB during de-ethylation can be described using a pseudo first order reaction model, expressed by the following: -ln(C/C0) kt, where C0 and C are the initial and final RhB concentrations, respectively; k is the pseudo first order rate constant; and t represents the light irradiation time.The k values can be estimated from the ln (A0/A) vs. t plot, as shown in Fig. 7(d).Sample CBB had the highest k value of 0.067 min -1 , much higher than that of samples B (0.005 min -1 ), C (0.033 min -1 ), and CB (0.051 min -1 ).The aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of sample CBB is obviously better than that of some previously reported similar materials 525354555657585960. It is worth noting that, during the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation processes, RhB could be usually degraded completely into CO2, which is generally regarded as the ideal harmless product for organic pollution control.However, in terms of carbon cycling, CO2 is not an ideal product because it is a typical greenhouse gas; thus, it is highly desirable to reduce the above-generated CO2 into other value-added chemicals or fuels.In this study, the possibility of the anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals using the various as-prepared samples was also evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).The anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 involves a series of complicated processes, i.e., charge generation and transfer, C-O bond breaking, and C-H and O-H bond formation 12.The main reactions during photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O are as follows 12. CO2 2H 2e - CO H2O E 0 redox -0.24V The anaerobic photocatalytic gaseous reduction of CO2 in the presence of water vapor was performed under visible light irradiation for 1 h at atmospheric pressure.As shown in Fig. 8, the evolution of CO was recorded as the main product for all the samples, while some other reduction products such as H2, CH4, and CH3OH could also be detected for the binary and ternary composites.As CH3OH, CH4, and H2 are important industrial chemicals and fuels, their selective production over samples CB and CBB suggests the significance of the construction of a composite photocatalyst.More specifically, owing to the formation of the heterojunction between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, a trace amount of CH4 and a small amount of H2 were detected for sample CB, but the yield of CO considerably decreased.In contrast, for sample CBB, while much more multi-electron reduc- tion products (CH4 and CH3OH) were generated, the yields of the two-electron reduction products (CO and H2) also significantly increased.The efficient charge transfer and surface enrichment in composite photocatalysts would favor the generation of multi-electron reduction products.The above separated aerobic photocatalytic oxidation and anaerobic photocatalytic reduction experiments clearly demonstrate the dual functionality of the designed composite photocatalyst.As illustrated in Fig. 1, these results imply the possibility of achieving photocatalytic carbon cycling by the integration of the aerobic oxidation and anaerobic reduction processes.However, the two-pot reaction systems, involving RhB to CO2 followed by CO2 to solar fuels, will be complicated in operation.Under this consideration, the direct conversion of RhB to solar fuels under anaerobic conditions in one-pot was also studied over the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalysts.The anaerobic photocatalytic degradation of the aqueous RhB solution over sample CBB was also performed in the anaerobic reaction system under identical conditions, except that 50-mL aqueous RhB solution (10 mg/L) was introduced instead of CO2 and H2O vapor.The one-pot anaerobic photocatalytic result is shown in Fig. 8(b).The RhB degradation efficiency was approximately 30 in 1 h, which was much lower than that conducted under aerobic conditions.This result suggests that oxygen was important for enhancing the photocatalytic RhB removal process.Interestingly, CO, as the major gas product, was indeed detected.The yield (0.63 mol/(gh) was much lower than that obtained from the photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O vapor.More complex reaction processes are involved in the one-pot anaerobic reaction system, while the overall photocatalytic conversion efficiency can be further improved by promoting the anaerobic RhB oxidation efficiency, which would compete with the water splitting process that is crucial for CO hydrogenation. As shown above, the photocatalytic activities of samples CB and CBB were tremendously enhanced because of the formation of the heterojunction; thus, it is essential to understand the synergetic mechanism in the binary and ternary composite system.Combing the XPS analyses of sample CBB (Fig. 2) with the band structure analyses of the g-C3N4 and BiVO4 photocatalyst (Fig. 8), the formation of the S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst probably accounts for the promotion of the charge dynamics (Fig. S2) and photocatalytic efficiency.Such an assumption was further confirmed by the following results of the density functional theory (DFT) calculation and scavenger studies 30,65666768. The calculations were conducted using the CASTEP mode of Materials Studio according to DFT 74757677.The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof form exchange-correlation functional was used within the generalized gradient approximation.The geometry optimization and electrostatic potential calculations were completed with the cutoff energy of 380 eV and Monkhorst-Pack grids of 2 5 1 for the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane, and 3 3 1 for the monolayer g-C3N4.The convergence thresholds for the geometry optimization were set as: energy of 5.0 10 -6 eV/atom, maximum force of 0.01 eV/A, and maximum stress of 0.02 GPa.The optimized models and calculated average potential profiles of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane and monolayer g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 9. The Fermi energy of the semiconductor is one important parameter for estimating the charge transfer between the interfaces of two semiconductor materials, and can be calculated by: Evac -EF where Evac and EF are the electrostatic potential of the vacuum energy and Fermi energy, respectively 74757677.The calculated work functions of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4 were 6.92 and 4.23 eV, respectively.The Fermi energy of the g-C3N4 was higher than that of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet.Upon the interfacial contact between the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4, electrons will transfer from g-C3N4 to the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet until their Fermi energies reach the same level.As a consequence, this leads to the decrease of electron density of g-C3N4 and an increase in BiVO4, implying the formation of a built-in electric field at the BiVO4 and g-C3N4 interface (Fig. S5).It is worth noting that the direction of the abovementioned built-in electric field is from the g-C3N4 surface to the BiVO4 surface, which is beneficial to the vectorial interfacial transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers from the CB of BiVO4 to the VB of g-C3N4 during the photocatalytic reaction processes (Fig. S5).Overall, the DFT calculation suggests the formation of an S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst 74757677.By a simple comparison of the OH -/OH and O2/O2 -redox potentials versus the CB and VB potentials of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 (Fig. S4), it is clear that OH radicals cannot be generated over pure g-C3N4, but can be generated over pure BiVO4.On the contrary, O2 -radicals cannot be generated over pure BiVO4, but can be generated over pure g-C3N4.Such assumptions have been well confirmed by the scavenger studies.IPA as the OH scavenger and Tempol as the O2 -scavenger were introduced in the respective reaction system for the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation to determine the involved main ROSs over each photocatalyst (Fig. 10).Importantly, in the sample B-based photocatalytic system, the degradation efficiency was obviously inhibited after introduction of IPA as the scavenger of OH, suggesting the weak reductive ability of the photogenerated electrons in BiVO4, while the main ROS were h -derived oxidative species (OH).In contrast, the degradation efficiency of the sample C-based photocatalytic system was inhibited after introduction of Tempol as the scavenger of O2 -, suggesting the weak oxidative ability of the photogenerated holes in BiVO4, while the main ROS were e --derived oxidative species (O2 -).After the formation of the heterostructure between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, both O2 -and OH significantly contributed to the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation over samples CB and CBB.This result suggests that in the g-C3N4/BiVO4 binary nanocom-posites, both the photoexcited holes with strong oxidative ability from the VB of BiVO4 and the photoexcited electrons with strong reductive ability from the CB of g-C3N4 were retained, and an S-scheme hybrid photocatalyst system was established.Moreover, after introduction of the Bi nanoparticles, the synergetic photocatalytic mechanism did not vary, sustaining the S-scheme interfacial charge transfer in the g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 ternary nanocomposites.In fact, metallic Bi nanoparticles, as an important component of CBB ternary photocatalysts, may have three basic functions 67.First, the plasmonic effects of Bi nanoparticles enhance the visible light absorption ability (Fig. 5(a)).Second, the field effects of plasmonic Bi nanoparticles enhance the charge separation efficiency (Fig. 6).Third, a portion of metallic Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of the S-scheme of g-C3N4/BiVO4 may promote the interfacial charge transfer by acting as an S-scheme electron mediator (Fig. 6), similar to the roles of the Au nanoparticles in the Au/CdS/TiO2 hybrid system 66. The complex photocatalytic mechanism of the S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst is demonstrated in Fig. 11.First, for the light harvesting process, there are three active visible light absorption centers, being the g-C3N4 nanosheets, BiVO4, and surface-decorated metallic Bi nanoparticles.In particular, due to the SPR effects, the metallic Bi nanoparticles enhanced the visible light absorption capacity.Second, for the charge transfer processes, due to the formation of a built-in electric field at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface, S-scheme interfacial charge transfer, that is the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of BiVO4 toward the VB of g-C3N4, dominated upon light irradiation.Moreover, the metallic Bi nanoparticles acted as an S-scheme electron mediator to promote the interfacial charge transfer in the ternary S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid system.Incidentally, the photoexcited hot electrons from the metallic Bi nanoparticles transferred to the CB of the BiVO4 moiety, then toward the VB of g-C3N4, inhibiting the charge recombination.As a consequence, the holes in g-C3N4 and the electrons in BiVO4 with poor redox ability were sacrificed, and the electrons in g-C3N4 and the holes in BiVO4 with strong redox ability remained and were spatially separated, which together modulate the charge potentials and dynamics to suit the"}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "In this study, Rhodamine B (RhB) was chosen as the target pollutant to evaluate the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of the as-prepared samples under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).", "context": "The XRD patterns were used to identify the phase structures of the various as-prepared samples, as shown in Fig. 2. Obviously, the phase structure of BiVO4 in sample B comprised both the monoclinic scheelite (m-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0688) and tetragonal zircon structure (t-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0133) 4950515253.The phase structure is usually of great importance for the photocatalytic activity, as it largely determines the band structures and surface properties.Moreover, it is well-documented that photocatalysts with mixed phase struc-tures could form phase junctions to enhance the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes 49.For sample C, two typical diffraction peaks at 12.9 and 27.6 were recorded, which can be indexed to the 100 and 002 planes of g-C3N4, corresponding to the in-plane structural packing motif and interlayer stacking of aromatic systems, respectively.The XRD patterns for samples CB and CBB were rather similar to that for sample B. Comparing with the XRD pattern for sample C, the typical peak at 12.9 for g-C3N4 phase in sample CB and CBB was almost invisible, while the typical peak at 27.6 for the g-C3N4 phase in samples CB and CBB was largely weakened.There may be several possible reasons for this decrease in peak in-tensity.For example, a decrease in the planar size of the g-C3N4 nanosheets may occur by etching during the liquid phase deposition process, followed by the thermally induced crystallization process of the BiVO4 nanoparticles.Additionally, the coverage of the g-C3N4 nanosheets with highly crystalline BiVO4 nanoparticles may shield, to some extent, the XRD signals for the g-C3N4 phase.It is worth noting that no obvious shift in the peak position was observed in the binary (CB) and ternary (CBB) nanocomposites, suggesting no lattice doping occurred during the synthesis processes.It is noted that because of the tiny amount of reduced metallic Bi nanoparticles, no characteristic XRD signal for metallic Bi was observed in sample CBB. XPS was conducted to further determine the detailed surface elemental compositions and their chemical states, and to unveil the strong interactions between distinct phases in sample CBB.The XPS survey spectrum for sample CBB is displayed in Fig. 3(a), in which the XPS peaks for the C, N, Bi, V, and O elements can be well resolved.The high-resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f before and after Ar etching are shown in Fig. 3(b).Because of the instability of metallic Bi upon oxidation in air, only the XPS peaks centered at 158.82 and 164.13 eV were recorded before Ar etching, which are typically ascribed to the Bi-O bonds of elemental Bi 70717273.Furthermore, it is common that a thin bismuth oxide layer will easily form on the surface of the metallic Bi upon exposure to air 70717273.After Ar etching of sample CBB, the characteristic XPS peaks corresponding to Bi-Bi bonding significantly appeared at around 156. 74 and the defect-containing sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in the graphitic domains, respectively.The latter is possibly assigned to the N-CN coordination in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.The fitted four peaks of the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3(d)), centered at around 398.67, 399.86, 401.17, and 404.85 eV, can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen involved in the triazine rings (C-NC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups, amino functional groups having a hydrogen atom (C-N-H), and excitations, respectively, in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.Importantly, the dominant peaks of C 1s and N 1s in sample CBB shifted to higher binding energies relative to the reference 272829303132333435.From the high-resolution XPS spectrum of V 2p in Fig. 3(e), the binding energies at 516.51 and 523.81 eV are assigned to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, respectively.For the high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s in Fig. 3(f), the peak with binding energy at 529.54 eV was attributed to crystal lattice oxygen of BiVO4 in the form of Bi2O2 2 , while the peak at 531.45 eV was ascribed to the hydroxyl groups on the surface 4950515253.It is worth noting that the shifts of the C 1s and N 1s peaks towards higher binding energies were accompanied with the shifts of the Bi 4f, V 2p and O 1s peaks towards lower binding energies in sample CBB.This result indicates the decrease in the electron density on the C and N moieties, the simultaneous increase in the electron density on the Bi, V, and O moieties, and that a built-in electric field formed at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface.In combination, it was manifested that a strong interaction existed between the g-C3N4 phase and the BiVO4 phase in the nanocomposite (sample CBB), rather than a simple physical mixture.Moreover, it was supposed that upon light irradiation, electron transfer from BiVO4 to g-C3N4 would be favored due to the electrostatic effects of the built-in electric field, suggesting an S-scheme junction across the interface in sample CBB. The morphology of the samples was firstly investigated by the SEM images (Fig. S1).A sheet-like uniform morphology was observed for pure g-C3N4 (sample C, Fig. S1(a)), whereas, concave cube-like larger microcrystals were observed for pure BiVO4 (sample B, Fig. S1(b)).The overall morphologies of the binary (sample CB, Fig. S1(c)) and the ternary (sample CBB, Fig. S1(d)) nanocomposites were quite similar, comparable to that of pure g-C3N4.Interestingly, in both samples CB and CBB, no bulk BiVO4 microcrystals were observed, while most evolved into nanoflakes, nanorods, or irregular nanoparticles, which were mainly attached to the g-C3N4 host.Such an observation was further confirmed by the corresponding TEM image for sample CBB (Fig. 4(a)).Many nanoparticles in the form of nanoflakes, nanorods, or of irregular shape were deposited on the surface of the transparent g-C3N4 nanosheets.The inset of Fig. 4(a) corresponds to the SAED patterns of sample CBB, indicating the polycrystalline features of the multicomponent nanocomposites.The corresponding HRTEM image (Fig. 4(b)) revealed that highly crystalline monoclinic BiVO4 (m-BiVO4), surrounded by some amorphous Bi nanoparticles, were deposited on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets.The clear lattice fringe spacing of 0.31 nm corresponded to the (121) crystal plane of monoclinic BiVO4 4950515253. Considering the abundant sheet-like morphology of monoclinic BiVO4 in the nanocomposites, it was supposed that these monoclinic BiVO4 nanosheets were largely attached to the g-C3N4 nanosheets via the m-BiVO4(001)/g-C3N4(001) interface.To further clearly demonstrate the elemental distribution in the nanocomposites (sample CBB), the EDS elemental mappings of C, N, Bi, V, and O (Figs. 4(d)-(i)) of sample CBB were obtained on the corresponding HAADF-STEM image, shown in Fig. 4(c), which was the same observation zone in Fig. 4(a).The C and N distribution profiles correspond to the transparent underlayer in Fig. 4(a), while the Bi, V, and O distribution profiles correspond well to the overall appearance of the surface-deposited nanoparticles in Figs.4(a) and(c).Combining the above XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, and EDS results, it was clear that binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 and ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites were successfully constructed with a well-contacted interface. The porous structures of samples B, C, CB, and CBB were investigated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. S2(a).All the samples had isotherms of type IV, according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller classification, indicating the presence of mesopores (2-50 nm).The sorption isotherms of samples C, CB, and CBB were very similar, suggesting their comparable porous structures.The introduction of BiVO4 and the Bi nanoparticles to couple with the g-C3N4 nanosheets had a tiny influence on the microstructures.The sorption isotherms of sample B were otherwise very different, having almost no adsorption in the wide relative pressure (P/P0) range, and only a minor hysteresis loop at high P/P0, suggesting there were much less mesopores in sample B, in good agreement with the corresponding pore size distribution.In fact, as shown in Table S1, the specific surface area of sample B was only 19 m 2 /g, much smaller than that of samples C, CB, and CBB (50 m 2 /g).The hysteresis loops for samples C, CB, and CBB covered a considerably wide range of relative pressures, suggesting their wide bimodal mesopore size distributions, as confirmed by the corresponding broad BJH pore-size distributions (Fig. S2(b)).Typically, they had two main mesopore peaks centered at around 4 and 45 nm.Moreover, the isotherms for samples C, CB, and CBB showed high adsorption at high P/P0 approaching 1.0, implying the existence of large mesopores and macropores.The formation of various mesopores and macropores is due to the intra-and inter-agglomeration 1011. It is well known that CO2 adsorption on the surface of a photocatalyst is key to initiating the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.Furthermore, the CO2 adsorption capacity is a significant factor influencing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency 1011.As shown in Fig. S3, all the samples showed an almost linear relationship between the CO2 adsorption capacity and the relative pressure (P/P0) in the higher P/P0 range of 0.3-1.0.Such a characteristic indicates a dominant physical interaction between CO2 and the various samples; thus, the specific surface area was found to be the most important influencing factor.In particular, with the increasing SBET from sample B to samples C and CB, the CO2 adsorption capacity steadily increased.Meanwhile, in the lower P/P0 range of 0-0.3, a relatively faster increase in CO2 uptake was recorded for all the samples, particularly for sample CBB, indicating the occurrence of the chemical adsorption of CO2.The chemical adsorption of CO2 on sample B is minor, suggesting that the chemical interaction between CO2 and BiVO4 is weak.However, samples C, CB, and CBB have much stronger chemical adsorption.This is probably due to the stronger interaction of the g-C3N4 moieties, which have abundant amino functional groups (XPS results), with the CO2 molecules.In particular, the in-situ reduction step to fabricate sample CBB might lead to further surface functionalization of g-C3N4 to enhance the chemical adsorption of CO2. The band structures of the photocatalysts could be revealed by combined optical and electrochemical analyses.Specifically, the bandgap energies can be estimated by analyzing the optical absorption spectrum.The UV-vis DRS spectra were measured to study the optical properties and electronic structures of the as-prepared samples (Fig. 5).All the four samples have good absorption in the visible light region.The optical absorption edges of samples C and B were approximately estimated to be 450 and 525 nm, respectively (Fig. 5(a)).The absorption curves for samples CB and CBB are located between those of samples B and C (Fig. 5(a)).In particular, because of the SPR effects of the in-situ generated Bi nanoparticles 61,70, sample CBB exhibited a slight promotion in visible light absorption above 500 nm, compared with sample CB.The bandgap energy (Eg) values of samples B and C can be evaluated using the following equation: h B (h -Eg) n/2 where is the absorption coefficient, is the frequency of the light, h is Planck's constant, B is the absorption constant, and n 1 or 4 depending on the nature of the semiconductor (direct or indirect bandgap, respectively) 60.Both g-C3N4 and BiVO4 are direct bandgap semiconductors, consequently, Eg can be estimated from a plot of ( h) 2 versus (h).The interception of the tangent to the x-axis would give a good approximation of Eg of the samples.As the absorbance (A) is proportional to the absorption coefficient (), the value of A was used as a substitute of in the present study, as in Fig. 5(b).Here, the Eg values of samples B and C were estimated to be 2.40 and 2.83 eV, respectively, which agree well with the reported values 49.Moreover, the conduction band energy (ECB) of a photocatalyst can be calculated according to the following equation (Mulliken electronegativity theory): ECB -E e -0.5Eg, where is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor photocatalyst, E e is the energy of the free electron in the hydrogen scale (approximately 4.5 eV), and Eg is the bandgap energy 60.The values for BiVO4 and g-C3N4 are 6.04 and 4.66 eV, respectively 60, so the calculated CB potentials for samples B and C were approximately 0.34 and -1.26 V, respectively.Combined with the value of Eg, the VB potentials of samples B and C were, thus, calculated to be 2.74 and 1.57V vs. NHE, respectively.The band structures of the BiVO4 (sample B) and g-C3N4 (sample C) photocatalysts are illustrated in Fig. S4. As the charge separation and transfer efficiency play a critical role in the final photocatalytic performance, we combined the transient photocurrent and EIS analyses to clarify the charge dynamic process in the different photocatalysts (Fig. 6).The transient photocurrent responses were recorded at a bias potential of 0.4 V for several on-off cycles under visible light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 6(a), for all the samples, the photocurrent reached a constant value when the light was on, and decreased to zero when the light was off.The photocurrents of both samples B and C were obviously lower than those of the other two composite samples.It was suggested that the interfacial hybridization of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 in sample CB was beneficial for the charge separation.Moreover, after introducing a certain amount of Bi nanoparticles in sample CBB, the photocurrent was further increased, relative to sample CB.It was supposed that a portion of Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acted as an electron bridge, promoting the interfacial charge transfer.EIS analysis is a powerful tool to study the electrochemical charge transfer behavior at high frequency 3,11.Fig. 6(b) shows the EIS spectra in the Nyquist mode in the frequency range of 100 kHz -1 kHz for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB.The Nyquist plot can be interpreted in terms of the equivalent circuit, as displayed in the inset.In the equivalent circuit, Rs is the solution resistance, CPE is the constant phase element for the electrolyte/electrode interface, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the interface of the electrode/electrolyte 3,11.The arcs in the Nyquist plot are related to the charge transfer at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.The fitted Rct values were 46.8, 42.0, 38.2, and 34.4 for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB, respectively.Sample CBB, with the lowest Rct, presented the best charge transfer efficiency.Over-all, it can be concluded that the charge transfer rate in sample CB can be improved because of the reduced charge recombination by forming a heterojunction, compared to those in samples B and C. By introducing a portion of Bi nanoparticles at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acting as an electron bridge, the charge transfer rate in sample CBB could be further enhanced. In this study, Rhodamine B (RhB) was chosen as the target pollutant to evaluate the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of the as-prepared samples under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).As presented in Fig. 7(a), sample CBB shows the best aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity in the degradation of the RhB molecules.The temporal changes in the absorption spectra of the RhB aqueous solution (10 mg/L) upon visible light irradiation over sample C are illustrated in Fig. 7(b).It is noted that the maximum absorption band (wavelength corresponding to the maximal absorbance, max) of the reaction solution gradually shifted from 554 to 495 nm during the photocatalytic degradation of RhB.This hypsochromic shift in max of the RhB solution corresponds to the step-by-step de-ethylation of RhB to give N,N,N'-triethyl rhodamine (TER, 539 nm), N,N'-diethyl rhodamine (DER, 522 nm), N-ethyl rhodamine (MER, 510 nm), and rhodamine at 495 nm 50.As shown in Fig. 7(c), the degree of de-ethylation can be represented by the blue shift in the wavelength of the maximum absorption: max 554 -max 50.Importantly, as for all the samples, de-ethylation occurred dominantly in the early stage; at the end of this stage, there was a leap in max, then, max was very limited (Fig. 7(c)), indicating that the de-ethylation process was almost terminated and the mineralization process of rhodamine (decomposition of the conjugated structure of rhodamine to small molecules) was initiated 50.In this regard, there are two distinctive stages of the aerobic photocatalytic RhB oxidation process: de-ethylation and mineralization.Generally, the rate of de-ethylation is higher than that of the following mineralization process, and very limited changes in the spectral intensity are recorded at the maximal absorption during miner- alization.The photocatalytic oxidation rate of RhB can be approximately calculated based on the de-ethylation process of RhB.The photocatalytic degradation kinetics of RhB during de-ethylation can be described using a pseudo first order reaction model, expressed by the following: -ln(C/C0) kt, where C0 and C are the initial and final RhB concentrations, respectively; k is the pseudo first order rate constant; and t represents the light irradiation time.The k values can be estimated from the ln (A0/A) vs. t plot, as shown in Fig. 7(d).Sample CBB had the highest k value of 0.067 min -1 , much higher than that of samples B (0.005 min -1 ), C (0.033 min -1 ), and CB (0.051 min -1 ).The aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of sample CBB is obviously better than that of some previously reported similar materials 525354555657585960. It is worth noting that, during the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation processes, RhB could be usually degraded completely into CO2, which is generally regarded as the ideal harmless product for organic pollution control.However, in terms of carbon cycling, CO2 is not an ideal product because it is a typical greenhouse gas; thus, it is highly desirable to reduce the above-generated CO2 into other value-added chemicals or fuels.In this study, the possibility of the anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals using the various as-prepared samples was also evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).The anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 involves a series of complicated processes, i.e., charge generation and transfer, C-O bond breaking, and C-H and O-H bond formation 12.The main reactions during photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O are as follows 12. CO2 2H 2e - CO H2O E 0 redox -0.24V The anaerobic photocatalytic gaseous reduction of CO2 in the presence of water vapor was performed under visible light irradiation for 1 h at atmospheric pressure.As shown in Fig. 8, the evolution of CO was recorded as the main product for all the samples, while some other reduction products such as H2, CH4, and CH3OH could also be detected for the binary and ternary composites.As CH3OH, CH4, and H2 are important industrial chemicals and fuels, their selective production over samples CB and CBB suggests the significance of the construction of a composite photocatalyst.More specifically, owing to the formation of the heterojunction between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, a trace amount of CH4 and a small amount of H2 were detected for sample CB, but the yield of CO considerably decreased.In contrast, for sample CBB, while much more multi-electron reduc- tion products (CH4 and CH3OH) were generated, the yields of the two-electron reduction products (CO and H2) also significantly increased.The efficient charge transfer and surface enrichment in composite photocatalysts would favor the generation of multi-electron reduction products.The above separated aerobic photocatalytic oxidation and anaerobic photocatalytic reduction experiments clearly demonstrate the dual functionality of the designed composite photocatalyst.As illustrated in Fig. 1, these results imply the possibility of achieving photocatalytic carbon cycling by the integration of the aerobic oxidation and anaerobic reduction processes.However, the two-pot reaction systems, involving RhB to CO2 followed by CO2 to solar fuels, will be complicated in operation.Under this consideration, the direct conversion of RhB to solar fuels under anaerobic conditions in one-pot was also studied over the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalysts.The anaerobic photocatalytic degradation of the aqueous RhB solution over sample CBB was also performed in the anaerobic reaction system under identical conditions, except that 50-mL aqueous RhB solution (10 mg/L) was introduced instead of CO2 and H2O vapor.The one-pot anaerobic photocatalytic result is shown in Fig. 8(b).The RhB degradation efficiency was approximately 30 in 1 h, which was much lower than that conducted under aerobic conditions.This result suggests that oxygen was important for enhancing the photocatalytic RhB removal process.Interestingly, CO, as the major gas product, was indeed detected.The yield (0.63 mol/(gh) was much lower than that obtained from the photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O vapor.More complex reaction processes are involved in the one-pot anaerobic reaction system, while the overall photocatalytic conversion efficiency can be further improved by promoting the anaerobic RhB oxidation efficiency, which would compete with the water splitting process that is crucial for CO hydrogenation. As shown above, the photocatalytic activities of samples CB and CBB were tremendously enhanced because of the formation of the heterojunction; thus, it is essential to understand the synergetic mechanism in the binary and ternary composite system.Combing the XPS analyses of sample CBB (Fig. 2) with the band structure analyses of the g-C3N4 and BiVO4 photocatalyst (Fig. 8), the formation of the S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst probably accounts for the promotion of the charge dynamics (Fig. S2) and photocatalytic efficiency.Such an assumption was further confirmed by the following results of the density functional theory (DFT) calculation and scavenger studies 30,65666768. The calculations were conducted using the CASTEP mode of Materials Studio according to DFT 74757677.The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof form exchange-correlation functional was used within the generalized gradient approximation.The geometry optimization and electrostatic potential calculations were completed with the cutoff energy of 380 eV and Monkhorst-Pack grids of 2 5 1 for the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane, and 3 3 1 for the monolayer g-C3N4.The convergence thresholds for the geometry optimization were set as: energy of 5.0 10 -6 eV/atom, maximum force of 0.01 eV/A, and maximum stress of 0.02 GPa.The optimized models and calculated average potential profiles of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane and monolayer g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 9. The Fermi energy of the semiconductor is one important parameter for estimating the charge transfer between the interfaces of two semiconductor materials, and can be calculated by: Evac -EF where Evac and EF are the electrostatic potential of the vacuum energy and Fermi energy, respectively 74757677.The calculated work functions of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4 were 6.92 and 4.23 eV, respectively.The Fermi energy of the g-C3N4 was higher than that of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet.Upon the interfacial contact between the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4, electrons will transfer from g-C3N4 to the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet until their Fermi energies reach the same level.As a consequence, this leads to the decrease of electron density of g-C3N4 and an increase in BiVO4, implying the formation of a built-in electric field at the BiVO4 and g-C3N4 interface (Fig. S5).It is worth noting that the direction of the abovementioned built-in electric field is from the g-C3N4 surface to the BiVO4 surface, which is beneficial to the vectorial interfacial transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers from the CB of BiVO4 to the VB of g-C3N4 during the photocatalytic reaction processes (Fig. S5).Overall, the DFT calculation suggests the formation of an S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst 74757677.By a simple comparison of the OH -/OH and O2/O2 -redox potentials versus the CB and VB potentials of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 (Fig. S4), it is clear that OH radicals cannot be generated over pure g-C3N4, but can be generated over pure BiVO4.On the contrary, O2 -radicals cannot be generated over pure BiVO4, but can be generated over pure g-C3N4.Such assumptions have been well confirmed by the scavenger studies.IPA as the OH scavenger and Tempol as the O2 -scavenger were introduced in the respective reaction system for the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation to determine the involved main ROSs over each photocatalyst (Fig. 10).Importantly, in the sample B-based photocatalytic system, the degradation efficiency was obviously inhibited after introduction of IPA as the scavenger of OH, suggesting the weak reductive ability of the photogenerated electrons in BiVO4, while the main ROS were h -derived oxidative species (OH).In contrast, the degradation efficiency of the sample C-based photocatalytic system was inhibited after introduction of Tempol as the scavenger of O2 -, suggesting the weak oxidative ability of the photogenerated holes in BiVO4, while the main ROS were e --derived oxidative species (O2 -).After the formation of the heterostructure between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, both O2 -and OH significantly contributed to the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation over samples CB and CBB.This result suggests that in the g-C3N4/BiVO4 binary nanocom-posites, both the photoexcited holes with strong oxidative ability from the VB of BiVO4 and the photoexcited electrons with strong reductive ability from the CB of g-C3N4 were retained, and an S-scheme hybrid photocatalyst system was established.Moreover, after introduction of the Bi nanoparticles, the synergetic photocatalytic mechanism did not vary, sustaining the S-scheme interfacial charge transfer in the g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 ternary nanocomposites.In fact, metallic Bi nanoparticles, as an important component of CBB ternary photocatalysts, may have three basic functions 67.First, the plasmonic effects of Bi nanoparticles enhance the visible light absorption ability (Fig. 5(a)).Second, the field effects of plasmonic Bi nanoparticles enhance the charge separation efficiency (Fig. 6).Third, a portion of metallic Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of the S-scheme of g-C3N4/BiVO4 may promote the interfacial charge transfer by acting as an S-scheme electron mediator (Fig. 6), similar to the roles of the Au nanoparticles in the Au/CdS/TiO2 hybrid system 66. The complex photocatalytic mechanism of the S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst is demonstrated in Fig. 11.First, for the light harvesting process, there are three active visible light absorption centers, being the g-C3N4 nanosheets, BiVO4, and surface-decorated metallic Bi nanoparticles.In particular, due to the SPR effects, the metallic Bi nanoparticles enhanced the visible light absorption capacity.Second, for the charge transfer processes, due to the formation of a built-in electric field at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface, S-scheme interfacial charge transfer, that is the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of BiVO4 toward the VB of g-C3N4, dominated upon light irradiation.Moreover, the metallic Bi nanoparticles acted as an S-scheme electron mediator to promote the interfacial charge transfer in the ternary S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid system.Incidentally, the photoexcited hot electrons from the metallic Bi nanoparticles transferred to the CB of the BiVO4 moiety, then toward the VB of g-C3N4, inhibiting the charge recombination.As a consequence, the holes in g-C3N4 and the electrons in BiVO4 with poor redox ability were sacrificed, and the electrons in g-C3N4 and the holes in BiVO4 with strong redox ability remained and were spatially separated, which together modulate the charge potentials and dynamics to suit the"}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "Furthermore, the introduction of metallic Bi nanoparticles not only enhanced the visible light absorption by SPR effects, but also promoted the interfacial charge transfer by S-scheme bridging effects.", "context": "A ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst was fabricated and employed to establish artificial CO2 cycling.The as-prepared g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst was demonstrated to be an efficient bifunctional photocatalyst system, which not only showed enhanced aerobic photocatalytic oxidation performance in degrading organic pollutants, but also exhibited impressive anaerobic photocatalytic reduction performance in CO2 valorization.Such a bifunctional g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst system will pave the way for further development of integrated aerobic-anaerobic reaction systems for photocatalytic carbon cycling.Based on combined XPS analyses, scavenger studies, and DFT calculations, it is suggested that the excellent bifunctional photocatalytic performance of the g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst is associated with the formation of efficient S-scheme hybrid junctions, which not only largely promote suitable charge dynamics, but also sustain favorable charge potentials.Furthermore, the introduction of metallic Bi nanoparticles not only enhanced the visible light absorption by SPR effects, but also promoted the interfacial charge transfer by S-scheme bridging effects.Further studies would be devoted to the construction of an integrated aerobic-anaerobic reaction system and the application of the bifunctional S-scheme hybrid photocatalyst for simultaneous environmental protection and energy production based on artificial CO2 cycling processes.

Binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 nanocomposites.The g-C3N4/BiVO4 composite photocatalysts with different loading amounts of BiVO4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple substrate-directed liquid phase deposition method.The preformed g-C3N4 nanosheets (sample C) were used as the substrate to direct the deposition of the BiVO4 nanoparticles.Firstly, 0.5 g of g-C3N4 nanosheets was suspended into 100 mL deionized water under sonication for 30 min.Subsequently, bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)35H2O) and ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3), with a mole ratio of 1:1, were added to the above suspension under violent stirring, and the optimized initial mass percentage of BiVO4 to g-C3N4 was 15.The mixed suspension was violently stirred for another 30 min.After this, the precipitate was centrifuged and washed with deionized water several times to remove impurities.The collected precipitate was dried overnight in a drying oven at 80 C.Finally, the dried powders were ground and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 C/min to enhance the interfacial interactions between the g-C3N4 nanosheets and BiVO4 nanoparticles.The as-obtained binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 nanocomposite photocatalysts are named CB.For comparison, a pure BiVO4 photocatalyst was also prepared under identical conditions and procedures but in the absence of the g-C3N4 nanosheets; the obtained sample is denoted as B. Ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites.The ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites were prepared by a simple sodium borohydride (NaBH4)-induced in-situ reduction method, using the above-prepared binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 nanocomposites with the best photocatalytic performances (that is, sample CB) as the substrate.For a typical synthesis, 0.2 g of sample CB was first dispersed into 50 mL deionized water under magnetic stirring for 10 min.Then, 50 mL of dilute NaBH4 solution was added dropwise into the above suspension; the optimized initial molar ratio of NaBH4 to BiVO4 was 0.4.After 10 min, the products were collected and washed with deionized water three times and dried at 50 C for 12 h in a vacuum drying oven.The obtained sample is denoted as CBB. The as-synthesized samples were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), the patterns of which were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu K radiation ( 1.54056A).Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning TEM (STEM) image, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings were obtained using a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at 200 kV.UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment, using BaSO4 as the background.An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a Physical Electronics PHI 1600 ESCA system operating with an Al K X-ray source (E 1486.6eV), and all the binding energies were calibrated using the C1s peak at 284.6 eV.Nitrogen sorption isotherms and CO2 adsorption curves were measured on a TriStar II 3020 gas adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics, USA).All the samples were degassed at 180 C for 12 h prior to measurements.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (SBET) was determined using adsorption data in a relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05-0.3by a multipoint BET method.Furthermore, the pore-size distribution was determined using the desorption data via the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.The volume of nitrogen desorbed at P/P0 0.99 was used to determine the pore volume (Vp) and the average pore size (dp).The photoelectrochemical measurements, including the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), of the samples were conducted on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument Corporation, Shanghai).All the photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell.The film electrode of each synthesized sample on FTO conductive glass served as the working electrode, while an Ag/AgCl electrode and platinum foil were employed as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.Moreover, a 300-W Xenon lamp with a UV-cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was used as the visible light source, and 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The bifunctional photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposite and other control samples were evaluated in terms of the aerobic photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2.For the former, a 350-W Xenon lamp (Changzhou Siyu, China) equipped with a 420-nm UV-cutoff filter was used as the visible light source.The distance between the lamp and reactor remained at a constant height of 15 cm.Before light illumination, 50 mg of each photocatalyst was suspended in a 50 mL 10 mg/L aqueous RhB solution under vigorous stirring.The suspensions were continuously stirred for another 30 min in the dark to reach an adsorption-desorption equilibrium between the photocatalysts and RhB molecules prior to light irradiation.During light irradiation, 3 mL of the suspensions were extracted at regular time intervals and centrifuged to remove the photocatalysts.The residual concentration of RhB was monitored by a UV-2550 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).To determine the dominant reactive oxidative species (ROSs), 2-propanol (IPA) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (Tempol) were introduced as scavengers for hydroxyl radicals (OH) and superoxide radicals (O2 -), respectively, during the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation reaction under otherwise identical conditions.

The as-synthesized samples were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), the patterns of which were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu K radiation ( 1.54056A).Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning TEM (STEM) image, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings were obtained using a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at 200 kV.UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment, using BaSO4 as the background.An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a Physical Electronics PHI 1600 ESCA system operating with an Al K X-ray source (E 1486.6eV), and all the binding energies were calibrated using the C1s peak at 284.6 eV.Nitrogen sorption isotherms and CO2 adsorption curves were measured on a TriStar II 3020 gas adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics, USA).All the samples were degassed at 180 C for 12 h prior to measurements.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (SBET) was determined using adsorption data in a relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05-0.3by a multipoint BET method.Furthermore, the pore-size distribution was determined using the desorption data via the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.The volume of nitrogen desorbed at P/P0 0.99 was used to determine the pore volume (Vp) and the average pore size (dp).The photoelectrochemical measurements, including the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), of the samples were conducted on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument Corporation, Shanghai).All the photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell.The film electrode of each synthesized sample on FTO conductive glass served as the working electrode, while an Ag/AgCl electrode and platinum foil were employed as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.Moreover, a 300-W Xenon lamp with a UV-cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was used as the visible light source, and 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The bifunctional photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposite and other control samples were evaluated in terms of the aerobic photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2.For the former, a 350-W Xenon lamp (Changzhou Siyu, China) equipped with a 420-nm UV-cutoff filter was used as the visible light source.The distance between the lamp and reactor remained at a constant height of 15 cm.Before light illumination, 50 mg of each photocatalyst was suspended in a 50 mL 10 mg/L aqueous RhB solution under vigorous stirring.The suspensions were continuously stirred for another 30 min in the dark to reach an adsorption-desorption equilibrium between the photocatalysts and RhB molecules prior to light irradiation.During light irradiation, 3 mL of the suspensions were extracted at regular time intervals and centrifuged to remove the photocatalysts.The residual concentration of RhB was monitored by a UV-2550 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).To determine the dominant reactive oxidative species (ROSs), 2-propanol (IPA) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (Tempol) were introduced as scavengers for hydroxyl radicals (OH) and superoxide radicals (O2 -), respectively, during the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation reaction under otherwise identical conditions. For the anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2, all the measurements were carried out at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure in a 200-mL homemade two-neck Pyrex top-irradiation reactor.The two necks of the reactor were sealed with silicone rubber septums to form a closed system.A 300-W Xenon lamp (PerfectLight, PLS-SXE300, China) with a 420-nm UV-cutoff filter was used as the light source and was positioned ca. 15 cm above the reactor.As a typical photocatalytic experiment, 100 mg of the photocatalyst was uniformly deposited onto the bottom of the reactor.Prior to the light irradiation, the reactor was sealed and purged by blowing nitrogen for 45 min to ensure the anaerobic conditions of the reaction system.In each testing experiment, CO2 and H2O vapor were in-situ produced by the reaction of NaHCO3 powder and aqueous H2SO4 solution inside a specially designed groove in one neck of the reactor.The NaHCO3 powder (0.084 g) was put into the groove before sealing, while the aqueous H2SO4 solution (2 M, 0.3 mL) was injected into the groove by a syringe before light irradiation.After 1 h of light irradiation, the gas products extracted from the reactor were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with two flame-ionized detectors and a thermal conductivity detector.High-purity helium was used as the carrier gas in the gas chromatography.The retention time and yield of each detected gas product were determined and calibrated with a standard gas mixture. The anaerobic photocatalytic degradation of the aqueous RhB solution over sample CBB was conducted in the above anaerobic reaction system under identical conditions, except that the 50 mL aqueous RhB solution (10 mg/L) was introduced, instead of the NaHCO3 powder and aqueous H2SO4 solution to produce CO2 and H2O vapor.The gas products and concentration change of the aqueous RhB solution were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-7890B, Agilent) and UV-visible spectrophotometry (UV-2550, Shimadzu), respectively."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "In each testing experiment, CO2 and H2O vapor were in-situ produced by the reaction of NaHCO3 powder and aqueous H2SO4 solution inside a specially designed groove in one neck of the reactor.", "context": "g-C3N4 nanosheets.All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and used without further purification.Typically, the bulk g-C3N4 was obtained by direct heating of 10 g melamine at 550 C for 4 h with a ramping rate of 5 C/min in a semi-closed alumina crucible with a cover.After cooling to room temperature, the bulk g-C3N4 was ground into yellow powder and reannealed at 550 C in air for a further 2 h to transform the bulk g-C3N4 into g-C3N4 nanosheets, involving thermal oxidation etching.The obtained g-C3N4 nanosheet products are denoted as C for simplicity.

Obviously, the phase structure of BiVO4 in sample B comprised both the monoclinic scheelite (m-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0688) and tetragonal zircon structure (t-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0133) 4950515253.The phase structure is usually of great importance for the photocatalytic activity, as it largely determines the band structures and surface properties.Moreover, it is well-documented that photocatalysts with mixed phase struc-tures could form phase junctions to enhance the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes 49.For sample C, two typical diffraction peaks at 12.9 and 27.6 were recorded, which can be indexed to the 100 and 002 planes of g-C3N4, corresponding to the in-plane structural packing motif and interlayer stacking of aromatic systems, respectively.The XRD patterns for samples CB and CBB were rather similar to that for sample B. Comparing with the XRD pattern for sample C, the typical peak at 12.9 for g-C3N4 phase in sample CB and CBB was almost invisible, while the typical peak at 27.6 for the g-C3N4 phase in samples CB and CBB was largely weakened.There may be several possible reasons for this decrease in peak in-tensity.For example, a decrease in the planar size of the g-C3N4 nanosheets may occur by etching during the liquid phase deposition process, followed by the thermally induced crystallization process of the BiVO4 nanoparticles.Additionally, the coverage of the g-C3N4 nanosheets with highly crystalline BiVO4 nanoparticles may shield, to some extent, the XRD signals for the g-C3N4 phase.It is worth noting that no obvious shift in the peak position was observed in the binary (CB) and ternary (CBB) nanocomposites, suggesting no lattice doping occurred during the synthesis processes.It is noted that because of the tiny amount of reduced metallic Bi nanoparticles, no characteristic XRD signal for metallic Bi was observed in sample CBB. XPS was conducted to further determine the detailed surface elemental compositions and their chemical states, and to unveil the strong interactions between distinct phases in sample CBB.The XPS survey spectrum for sample CBB is displayed in Fig. 3(a), in which the XPS peaks for the C, N, Bi, V, and O elements can be well resolved.The high-resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f before and after Ar etching are shown in Fig. 3(b).Because of the instability of metallic Bi upon oxidation in air, only the XPS peaks centered at 158.82 and 164.13 eV were recorded before Ar etching, which are typically ascribed to the Bi-O bonds of elemental Bi 70717273.Furthermore, it is common that a thin bismuth oxide layer will easily form on the surface of the metallic Bi upon exposure to air 70717273.After Ar etching of sample CBB, the characteristic XPS peaks corresponding to Bi-Bi bonding significantly appeared at around 156. 74 and the defect-containing sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in the graphitic domains, respectively.The latter is possibly assigned to the N-CN coordination in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.The fitted four peaks of the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3(d)), centered at around 398.67, 399.86, 401.17, and 404.85 eV, can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen involved in the triazine rings (C-NC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups, amino functional groups having a hydrogen atom (C-N-H), and excitations, respectively, in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.Importantly, the dominant peaks of C 1s and N 1s in sample CBB shifted to higher binding energies relative to the reference 272829303132333435.From the high-resolution XPS spectrum of V 2p in Fig. 3(e), the binding energies at 516.51 and 523.81 eV are assigned to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, respectively.For the high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s in Fig. 3(f), the peak with binding energy at 529.54 eV was attributed to crystal lattice oxygen of BiVO4 in the form of Bi2O2 2 , while the peak at 531.45 eV was ascribed to the hydroxyl groups on the surface 4950515253.It is worth noting that the shifts of the C 1s and N 1s peaks towards higher binding energies were accompanied with the shifts of the Bi 4f, V 2p and O 1s peaks towards lower binding energies in sample CBB.This result indicates the decrease in the electron density on the C and N moieties, the simultaneous increase in the electron density on the Bi, V, and O moieties, and that a built-in electric field formed at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface.In combination, it was manifested that a strong interaction existed between the g-C3N4 phase and the BiVO4 phase in the nanocomposite (sample CBB), rather than a simple physical mixture.Moreover, it was supposed that upon light irradiation, electron transfer from BiVO4 to g-C3N4 would be favored due to the electrostatic effects of the built-in electric field, suggesting an S-scheme junction across the interface in sample CBB. The morphology of the samples was firstly investigated by the SEM images (Fig. S1).A sheet-like uniform morphology was observed for pure g-C3N4 (sample C, Fig. S1(a)), whereas, concave cube-like larger microcrystals were observed for pure BiVO4 (sample B, Fig. S1(b)).The overall morphologies of the binary (sample CB, Fig. S1(c)) and the ternary (sample CBB, Fig. S1(d)) nanocomposites were quite similar, comparable to that of pure g-C3N4.Interestingly, in both samples CB and CBB, no bulk BiVO4 microcrystals were observed, while most evolved into nanoflakes, nanorods, or irregular nanoparticles, which were mainly attached to the g-C3N4 host.Such an observation was further confirmed by the corresponding TEM image for sample CBB (Fig. 4(a)).Many nanoparticles in the form of nanoflakes, nanorods, or of irregular shape were deposited on the surface of the transparent g-C3N4 nanosheets.The inset of Fig. 4(a) corresponds to the SAED patterns of sample CBB, indicating the polycrystalline features of the multicomponent nanocomposites.The corresponding HRTEM image (Fig. 4(b)) revealed that highly crystalline monoclinic BiVO4 (m-BiVO4), surrounded by some amorphous Bi nanoparticles, were deposited on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets.The clear lattice fringe spacing of 0.31 nm corresponded to the (121) crystal plane of monoclinic BiVO4 4950515253. Considering the abundant sheet-like morphology of monoclinic BiVO4 in the nanocomposites, it was supposed that these monoclinic BiVO4 nanosheets were largely attached to the g-C3N4 nanosheets via the m-BiVO4(001)/g-C3N4(001) interface.To further clearly demonstrate the elemental distribution in the nanocomposites (sample CBB), the EDS elemental mappings of C, N, Bi, V, and O (Figs. 4(d)-(i)) of sample CBB were obtained on the corresponding HAADF-STEM image, shown in Fig. 4(c), which was the same observation zone in Fig. 4(a).The C and N distribution profiles correspond to the transparent underlayer in Fig. 4(a), while the Bi, V, and O distribution profiles correspond well to the overall appearance of the surface-deposited nanoparticles in Figs.4(a) and(c).Combining the above XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, and EDS results, it was clear that binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 and ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites were successfully constructed with a well-contacted interface. The porous structures of samples B, C, CB, and CBB were investigated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. S2(a).All the samples had isotherms of type IV, according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller classification, indicating the presence of mesopores (2-50 nm).The sorption isotherms of samples C, CB, and CBB were very similar, suggesting their comparable porous structures.The introduction of BiVO4 and the Bi nanoparticles to couple with the g-C3N4 nanosheets had a tiny influence on the microstructures.The sorption isotherms of sample B were otherwise very different, having almost no adsorption in the wide relative pressure (P/P0) range, and only a minor hysteresis loop at high P/P0, suggesting there were much less mesopores in sample B, in good agreement with the corresponding pore size distribution.In fact, as shown in Table S1, the specific surface area of sample B was only 19 m 2 /g, much smaller than that of samples C, CB, and CBB (50 m 2 /g).The hysteresis loops for samples C, CB, and CBB covered a considerably wide range of relative pressures, suggesting their wide bimodal mesopore size distributions, as confirmed by the corresponding broad BJH pore-size distributions (Fig. S2(b)).Typically, they had two main mesopore peaks centered at around 4 and 45 nm.Moreover, the isotherms for samples C, CB, and CBB showed high adsorption at high P/P0 approaching 1.0, implying the existence of large mesopores and macropores.The formation of various mesopores and macropores is due to the intra-and inter-agglomeration 1011. It is well known that CO2 adsorption on the surface of a photocatalyst is key to initiating the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.Furthermore, the CO2 adsorption capacity is a significant factor influencing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency 1011.As shown in Fig. S3, all the samples showed an almost linear relationship between the CO2 adsorption capacity and the relative pressure (P/P0) in the higher P/P0 range of 0.3-1.0.Such a characteristic indicates a dominant physical interaction between CO2 and the various samples; thus, the specific surface area was found to be the most important influencing factor.In particular, with the increasing SBET from sample B to samples C and CB, the CO2 adsorption capacity steadily increased.Meanwhile, in the lower P/P0 range of 0-0.3, a relatively faster increase in CO2 uptake was recorded for all the samples, particularly for sample CBB, indicating the occurrence of the chemical adsorption of CO2.The chemical adsorption of CO2 on sample B is minor, suggesting that the chemical interaction between CO2 and BiVO4 is weak.However, samples C, CB, and CBB have much stronger chemical adsorption.This is probably due to the stronger interaction of the g-C3N4 moieties, which have abundant amino functional groups (XPS results), with the CO2 molecules.In particular, the in-situ reduction step to fabricate sample CBB might lead to further surface functionalization of g-C3N4 to enhance the chemical adsorption of CO2. The band structures of the photocatalysts could be revealed by combined optical and electrochemical analyses.Specifically, the bandgap energies can be estimated by analyzing the optical absorption spectrum.The UV-vis DRS spectra were measured to study the optical properties and electronic structures of the as-prepared samples (Fig. 5).All the four samples have good absorption in the visible light region.The optical absorption edges of samples C and B were approximately estimated to be 450 and 525 nm, respectively (Fig. 5(a)).The absorption curves for samples CB and CBB are located between those of samples B and C (Fig. 5(a)).In particular, because of the SPR effects of the in-situ generated Bi nanoparticles 61,70, sample CBB exhibited a slight promotion in visible light absorption above 500 nm, compared with sample CB.The bandgap energy (Eg) values of samples B and C can be evaluated using the following equation: h B (h -Eg) n/2 where is the absorption coefficient, is the frequency of the light, h is Planck's constant, B is the absorption constant, and n 1 or 4 depending on the nature of the semiconductor (direct or indirect bandgap, respectively) 60.Both g-C3N4 and BiVO4 are direct bandgap semiconductors, consequently, Eg can be estimated from a plot of ( h) 2 versus (h).The interception of the tangent to the x-axis would give a good approximation of Eg of the samples.As the absorbance (A) is proportional to the absorption coefficient (), the value of A was used as a substitute of in the present study, as in Fig. 5(b).Here, the Eg values of samples B and C were estimated to be 2.40 and 2.83 eV, respectively, which agree well with the reported values 49.Moreover, the conduction band energy (ECB) of a photocatalyst can be calculated according to the following equation (Mulliken electronegativity theory): ECB -E e -0.5Eg, where is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor photocatalyst, E e is the energy of the free electron in the hydrogen scale (approximately 4.5 eV), and Eg is the bandgap energy 60.The values for BiVO4 and g-C3N4 are 6.04 and 4.66 eV, respectively 60, so the calculated CB potentials for samples B and C were approximately 0.34 and -1.26 V, respectively.Combined with the value of Eg, the VB potentials of samples B and C were, thus, calculated to be 2.74 and 1.57V vs. NHE, respectively.The band structures of the BiVO4 (sample B) and g-C3N4 (sample C) photocatalysts are illustrated in Fig. S4. As the charge separation and transfer efficiency play a critical role in the final photocatalytic performance, we combined the transient photocurrent and EIS analyses to clarify the charge dynamic process in the different photocatalysts (Fig. 6).The transient photocurrent responses were recorded at a bias potential of 0.4 V for several on-off cycles under visible light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 6(a), for all the samples, the photocurrent reached a constant value when the light was on, and decreased to zero when the light was off.The photocurrents of both samples B and C were obviously lower than those of the other two composite samples.It was suggested that the interfacial hybridization of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 in sample CB was beneficial for the charge separation.Moreover, after introducing a certain amount of Bi nanoparticles in sample CBB, the photocurrent was further increased, relative to sample CB.It was supposed that a portion of Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acted as an electron bridge, promoting the interfacial charge transfer.EIS analysis is a powerful tool to study the electrochemical charge transfer behavior at high frequency 3,11.Fig. 6(b) shows the EIS spectra in the Nyquist mode in the frequency range of 100 kHz -1 kHz for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB.The Nyquist plot can be interpreted in terms of the equivalent circuit, as displayed in the inset.In the equivalent circuit, Rs is the solution resistance, CPE is the constant phase element for the electrolyte/electrode interface, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the interface of the electrode/electrolyte 3,11.The arcs in the Nyquist plot are related to the charge transfer at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.The fitted Rct values were 46.8, 42.0, 38.2, and 34.4 for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB, respectively.Sample CBB, with the lowest Rct, presented the best charge transfer efficiency.Over-all, it can be concluded that the charge transfer rate in sample CB can be improved because of the reduced charge recombination by forming a heterojunction, compared to those in samples B and C. By introducing a portion of Bi nanoparticles at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acting as an electron bridge, the charge transfer rate in sample CBB could be further enhanced. In this study, Rhodamine B (RhB) was chosen as the target pollutant to evaluate the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of the as-prepared samples under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).As presented in Fig. 7(a), sample CBB shows the best aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity in the degradation of the RhB molecules.The temporal changes in the absorption spectra of the RhB aqueous solution (10 mg/L) upon visible light irradiation over sample C are illustrated in Fig. 7(b).It is noted that the maximum absorption band (wavelength corresponding to the maximal absorbance, max) of the reaction solution gradually shifted from 554 to 495 nm during the photocatalytic degradation of RhB.This hypsochromic shift in max of the RhB solution corresponds to the step-by-step de-ethylation of RhB to give N,N,N'-triethyl rhodamine (TER, 539 nm), N,N'-diethyl rhodamine (DER, 522 nm), N-ethyl rhodamine (MER, 510 nm), and rhodamine at 495 nm 50.As shown in Fig. 7(c), the degree of de-ethylation can be represented by the blue shift in the wavelength of the maximum absorption: max 554 -max 50.Importantly, as for all the samples, de-ethylation occurred dominantly in the early stage; at the end of this stage, there was a leap in max, then, max was very limited (Fig. 7(c)), indicating that the de-ethylation process was almost terminated and the mineralization process of rhodamine (decomposition of the conjugated structure of rhodamine to small molecules) was initiated 50.In this regard, there are two distinctive stages of the aerobic photocatalytic RhB oxidation process: de-ethylation and mineralization.Generally, the rate of de-ethylation is higher than that of the following mineralization process, and very limited changes in the spectral intensity are recorded at the maximal absorption during miner- alization.The photocatalytic oxidation rate of RhB can be approximately calculated based on the de-ethylation process of RhB.The photocatalytic degradation kinetics of RhB during de-ethylation can be described using a pseudo first order reaction model, expressed by the following: -ln(C/C0) kt, where C0 and C are the initial and final RhB concentrations, respectively; k is the pseudo first order rate constant; and t represents the light irradiation time.The k values can be estimated from the ln (A0/A) vs. t plot, as shown in Fig. 7(d).Sample CBB had the highest k value of 0.067 min -1 , much higher than that of samples B (0.005 min -1 ), C (0.033 min -1 ), and CB (0.051 min -1 ).The aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of sample CBB is obviously better than that of some previously reported similar materials 525354555657585960. It is worth noting that, during the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation processes, RhB could be usually degraded completely into CO2, which is generally regarded as the ideal harmless product for organic pollution control.However, in terms of carbon cycling, CO2 is not an ideal product because it is a typical greenhouse gas; thus, it is highly desirable to reduce the above-generated CO2 into other value-added chemicals or fuels.In this study, the possibility of the anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals using the various as-prepared samples was also evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).The anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 involves a series of complicated processes, i.e., charge generation and transfer, C-O bond breaking, and C-H and O-H bond formation 12.The main reactions during photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O are as follows 12. CO2 2H 2e - CO H2O E 0 redox -0.24V The anaerobic photocatalytic gaseous reduction of CO2 in the presence of water vapor was performed under visible light irradiation for 1 h at atmospheric pressure.As shown in Fig. 8, the evolution of CO was recorded as the main product for all the samples, while some other reduction products such as H2, CH4, and CH3OH could also be detected for the binary and ternary composites.As CH3OH, CH4, and H2 are important industrial chemicals and fuels, their selective production over samples CB and CBB suggests the significance of the construction of a composite photocatalyst.More specifically, owing to the formation of the heterojunction between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, a trace amount of CH4 and a small amount of H2 were detected for sample CB, but the yield of CO considerably decreased.In contrast, for sample CBB, while much more multi-electron reduc- tion products (CH4 and CH3OH) were generated, the yields of the two-electron reduction products (CO and H2) also significantly increased.The efficient charge transfer and surface enrichment in composite photocatalysts would favor the generation of multi-electron reduction products.The above separated aerobic photocatalytic oxidation and anaerobic photocatalytic reduction experiments clearly demonstrate the dual functionality of the designed composite photocatalyst.As illustrated in Fig. 1, these results imply the possibility of achieving photocatalytic carbon cycling by the integration of the aerobic oxidation and anaerobic reduction processes.However, the two-pot reaction systems, involving RhB to CO2 followed by CO2 to solar fuels, will be complicated in operation.Under this consideration, the direct conversion of RhB to solar fuels under anaerobic conditions in one-pot was also studied over the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalysts.The anaerobic photocatalytic degradation of the aqueous RhB solution over sample CBB was also performed in the anaerobic reaction system under identical conditions, except that 50-mL aqueous RhB solution (10 mg/L) was introduced instead of CO2 and H2O vapor.The one-pot anaerobic photocatalytic result is shown in Fig. 8(b).The RhB degradation efficiency was approximately 30 in 1 h, which was much lower than that conducted under aerobic conditions.This result suggests that oxygen was important for enhancing the photocatalytic RhB removal process.Interestingly, CO, as the major gas product, was indeed detected.The yield (0.63 mol/(gh) was much lower than that obtained from the photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O vapor.More complex reaction processes are involved in the one-pot anaerobic reaction system, while the overall photocatalytic conversion efficiency can be further improved by promoting the anaerobic RhB oxidation efficiency, which would compete with the water splitting process that is crucial for CO hydrogenation. As shown above, the photocatalytic activities of samples CB and CBB were tremendously enhanced because of the formation of the heterojunction; thus, it is essential to understand the synergetic mechanism in the binary and ternary composite system.Combing the XPS analyses of sample CBB (Fig. 2) with the band structure analyses of the g-C3N4 and BiVO4 photocatalyst (Fig. 8), the formation of the S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst probably accounts for the promotion of the charge dynamics (Fig. S2) and photocatalytic efficiency.Such an assumption was further confirmed by the following results of the density functional theory (DFT) calculation and scavenger studies 30,65666768. The calculations were conducted using the CASTEP mode of Materials Studio according to DFT 74757677.The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof form exchange-correlation functional was used within the generalized gradient approximation.The geometry optimization and electrostatic potential calculations were completed with the cutoff energy of 380 eV and Monkhorst-Pack grids of 2 5 1 for the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane, and 3 3 1 for the monolayer g-C3N4.The convergence thresholds for the geometry optimization were set as: energy of 5.0 10 -6 eV/atom, maximum force of 0.01 eV/A, and maximum stress of 0.02 GPa.The optimized models and calculated average potential profiles of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane and monolayer g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 9. The Fermi energy of the semiconductor is one important parameter for estimating the charge transfer between the interfaces of two semiconductor materials, and can be calculated by: Evac -EF where Evac and EF are the electrostatic potential of the vacuum energy and Fermi energy, respectively 74757677.The calculated work functions of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4 were 6.92 and 4.23 eV, respectively.The Fermi energy of the g-C3N4 was higher than that of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet.Upon the interfacial contact between the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4, electrons will transfer from g-C3N4 to the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet until their Fermi energies reach the same level.As a consequence, this leads to the decrease of electron density of g-C3N4 and an increase in BiVO4, implying the formation of a built-in electric field at the BiVO4 and g-C3N4 interface (Fig. S5).It is worth noting that the direction of the abovementioned built-in electric field is from the g-C3N4 surface to the BiVO4 surface, which is beneficial to the vectorial interfacial transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers from the CB of BiVO4 to the VB of g-C3N4 during the photocatalytic reaction processes (Fig. S5).Overall, the DFT calculation suggests the formation of an S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst 74757677.By a simple comparison of the OH -/OH and O2/O2 -redox potentials versus the CB and VB potentials of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 (Fig. S4), it is clear that OH radicals cannot be generated over pure g-C3N4, but can be generated over pure BiVO4.On the contrary, O2 -radicals cannot be generated over pure BiVO4, but can be generated over pure g-C3N4.Such assumptions have been well confirmed by the scavenger studies.IPA as the OH scavenger and Tempol as the O2 -scavenger were introduced in the respective reaction system for the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation to determine the involved main ROSs over each photocatalyst (Fig. 10).Importantly, in the sample B-based photocatalytic system, the degradation efficiency was obviously inhibited after introduction of IPA as the scavenger of OH, suggesting the weak reductive ability of the photogenerated electrons in BiVO4, while the main ROS were h -derived oxidative species (OH).In contrast, the degradation efficiency of the sample C-based photocatalytic system was inhibited after introduction of Tempol as the scavenger of O2 -, suggesting the weak oxidative ability of the photogenerated holes in BiVO4, while the main ROS were e --derived oxidative species (O2 -).After the formation of the heterostructure between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, both O2 -and OH significantly contributed to the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation over samples CB and CBB.This result suggests that in the g-C3N4/BiVO4 binary nanocom-posites, both the photoexcited holes with strong oxidative ability from the VB of BiVO4 and the photoexcited electrons with strong reductive ability from the CB of g-C3N4 were retained, and an S-scheme hybrid photocatalyst system was established.Moreover, after introduction of the Bi nanoparticles, the synergetic photocatalytic mechanism did not vary, sustaining the S-scheme interfacial charge transfer in the g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 ternary nanocomposites.In fact, metallic Bi nanoparticles, as an important component of CBB ternary photocatalysts, may have three basic functions 67.First, the plasmonic effects of Bi nanoparticles enhance the visible light absorption ability (Fig. 5(a)).Second, the field effects of plasmonic Bi nanoparticles enhance the charge separation efficiency (Fig. 6).Third, a portion of metallic Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of the S-scheme of g-C3N4/BiVO4 may promote the interfacial charge transfer by acting as an S-scheme electron mediator (Fig. 6), similar to the roles of the Au nanoparticles in the Au/CdS/TiO2 hybrid system 66. The complex photocatalytic mechanism of the S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst is demonstrated in Fig. 11.First, for the light harvesting process, there are three active visible light absorption centers, being the g-C3N4 nanosheets, BiVO4, and surface-decorated metallic Bi nanoparticles.In particular, due to the SPR effects, the metallic Bi nanoparticles enhanced the visible light absorption capacity.Second, for the charge transfer processes, due to the formation of a built-in electric field at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface, S-scheme interfacial charge transfer, that is the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of BiVO4 toward the VB of g-C3N4, dominated upon light irradiation.Moreover, the metallic Bi nanoparticles acted as an S-scheme electron mediator to promote the interfacial charge transfer in the ternary S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid system.Incidentally, the photoexcited hot electrons from the metallic Bi nanoparticles transferred to the CB of the BiVO4 moiety, then toward the VB of g-C3N4, inhibiting the charge recombination.As a consequence, the holes in g-C3N4 and the electrons in BiVO4 with poor redox ability were sacrificed, and the electrons in g-C3N4 and the holes in BiVO4 with strong redox ability remained and were spatially separated, which together modulate the charge potentials and dynamics to suit the"}, {"llm generation": "Liquid (aqueous RhB solution)", "source": "The anaerobic photocatalytic degradation of the aqueous RhB solution over sample CBB was also performed in the anaerobic reaction system under identical conditions, except that 50-mL aqueous RhB solution (10 mg/L) was introduced instead of CO2 and H2O vapor.", "context": "The XRD patterns were used to identify the phase structures of the various as-prepared samples, as shown in Fig. 2. Obviously, the phase structure of BiVO4 in sample B comprised both the monoclinic scheelite (m-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0688) and tetragonal zircon structure (t-BiVO4) (JCPDS No. 14-0133) 4950515253.The phase structure is usually of great importance for the photocatalytic activity, as it largely determines the band structures and surface properties.Moreover, it is well-documented that photocatalysts with mixed phase struc-tures could form phase junctions to enhance the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes 49.For sample C, two typical diffraction peaks at 12.9 and 27.6 were recorded, which can be indexed to the 100 and 002 planes of g-C3N4, corresponding to the in-plane structural packing motif and interlayer stacking of aromatic systems, respectively.The XRD patterns for samples CB and CBB were rather similar to that for sample B. Comparing with the XRD pattern for sample C, the typical peak at 12.9 for g-C3N4 phase in sample CB and CBB was almost invisible, while the typical peak at 27.6 for the g-C3N4 phase in samples CB and CBB was largely weakened.There may be several possible reasons for this decrease in peak in-tensity.For example, a decrease in the planar size of the g-C3N4 nanosheets may occur by etching during the liquid phase deposition process, followed by the thermally induced crystallization process of the BiVO4 nanoparticles.Additionally, the coverage of the g-C3N4 nanosheets with highly crystalline BiVO4 nanoparticles may shield, to some extent, the XRD signals for the g-C3N4 phase.It is worth noting that no obvious shift in the peak position was observed in the binary (CB) and ternary (CBB) nanocomposites, suggesting no lattice doping occurred during the synthesis processes.It is noted that because of the tiny amount of reduced metallic Bi nanoparticles, no characteristic XRD signal for metallic Bi was observed in sample CBB. XPS was conducted to further determine the detailed surface elemental compositions and their chemical states, and to unveil the strong interactions between distinct phases in sample CBB.The XPS survey spectrum for sample CBB is displayed in Fig. 3(a), in which the XPS peaks for the C, N, Bi, V, and O elements can be well resolved.The high-resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f before and after Ar etching are shown in Fig. 3(b).Because of the instability of metallic Bi upon oxidation in air, only the XPS peaks centered at 158.82 and 164.13 eV were recorded before Ar etching, which are typically ascribed to the Bi-O bonds of elemental Bi 70717273.Furthermore, it is common that a thin bismuth oxide layer will easily form on the surface of the metallic Bi upon exposure to air 70717273.After Ar etching of sample CBB, the characteristic XPS peaks corresponding to Bi-Bi bonding significantly appeared at around 156. 74 and the defect-containing sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in the graphitic domains, respectively.The latter is possibly assigned to the N-CN coordination in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.The fitted four peaks of the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3(d)), centered at around 398.67, 399.86, 401.17, and 404.85 eV, can be assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen involved in the triazine rings (C-NC), tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups, amino functional groups having a hydrogen atom (C-N-H), and excitations, respectively, in g-C3N4 272829303132333435.Importantly, the dominant peaks of C 1s and N 1s in sample CBB shifted to higher binding energies relative to the reference 272829303132333435.From the high-resolution XPS spectrum of V 2p in Fig. 3(e), the binding energies at 516.51 and 523.81 eV are assigned to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, respectively.For the high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s in Fig. 3(f), the peak with binding energy at 529.54 eV was attributed to crystal lattice oxygen of BiVO4 in the form of Bi2O2 2 , while the peak at 531.45 eV was ascribed to the hydroxyl groups on the surface 4950515253.It is worth noting that the shifts of the C 1s and N 1s peaks towards higher binding energies were accompanied with the shifts of the Bi 4f, V 2p and O 1s peaks towards lower binding energies in sample CBB.This result indicates the decrease in the electron density on the C and N moieties, the simultaneous increase in the electron density on the Bi, V, and O moieties, and that a built-in electric field formed at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface.In combination, it was manifested that a strong interaction existed between the g-C3N4 phase and the BiVO4 phase in the nanocomposite (sample CBB), rather than a simple physical mixture.Moreover, it was supposed that upon light irradiation, electron transfer from BiVO4 to g-C3N4 would be favored due to the electrostatic effects of the built-in electric field, suggesting an S-scheme junction across the interface in sample CBB. The morphology of the samples was firstly investigated by the SEM images (Fig. S1).A sheet-like uniform morphology was observed for pure g-C3N4 (sample C, Fig. S1(a)), whereas, concave cube-like larger microcrystals were observed for pure BiVO4 (sample B, Fig. S1(b)).The overall morphologies of the binary (sample CB, Fig. S1(c)) and the ternary (sample CBB, Fig. S1(d)) nanocomposites were quite similar, comparable to that of pure g-C3N4.Interestingly, in both samples CB and CBB, no bulk BiVO4 microcrystals were observed, while most evolved into nanoflakes, nanorods, or irregular nanoparticles, which were mainly attached to the g-C3N4 host.Such an observation was further confirmed by the corresponding TEM image for sample CBB (Fig. 4(a)).Many nanoparticles in the form of nanoflakes, nanorods, or of irregular shape were deposited on the surface of the transparent g-C3N4 nanosheets.The inset of Fig. 4(a) corresponds to the SAED patterns of sample CBB, indicating the polycrystalline features of the multicomponent nanocomposites.The corresponding HRTEM image (Fig. 4(b)) revealed that highly crystalline monoclinic BiVO4 (m-BiVO4), surrounded by some amorphous Bi nanoparticles, were deposited on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets.The clear lattice fringe spacing of 0.31 nm corresponded to the (121) crystal plane of monoclinic BiVO4 4950515253. Considering the abundant sheet-like morphology of monoclinic BiVO4 in the nanocomposites, it was supposed that these monoclinic BiVO4 nanosheets were largely attached to the g-C3N4 nanosheets via the m-BiVO4(001)/g-C3N4(001) interface.To further clearly demonstrate the elemental distribution in the nanocomposites (sample CBB), the EDS elemental mappings of C, N, Bi, V, and O (Figs. 4(d)-(i)) of sample CBB were obtained on the corresponding HAADF-STEM image, shown in Fig. 4(c), which was the same observation zone in Fig. 4(a).The C and N distribution profiles correspond to the transparent underlayer in Fig. 4(a), while the Bi, V, and O distribution profiles correspond well to the overall appearance of the surface-deposited nanoparticles in Figs.4(a) and(c).Combining the above XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, and EDS results, it was clear that binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 and ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites were successfully constructed with a well-contacted interface. The porous structures of samples B, C, CB, and CBB were investigated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. S2(a).All the samples had isotherms of type IV, according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller classification, indicating the presence of mesopores (2-50 nm).The sorption isotherms of samples C, CB, and CBB were very similar, suggesting their comparable porous structures.The introduction of BiVO4 and the Bi nanoparticles to couple with the g-C3N4 nanosheets had a tiny influence on the microstructures.The sorption isotherms of sample B were otherwise very different, having almost no adsorption in the wide relative pressure (P/P0) range, and only a minor hysteresis loop at high P/P0, suggesting there were much less mesopores in sample B, in good agreement with the corresponding pore size distribution.In fact, as shown in Table S1, the specific surface area of sample B was only 19 m 2 /g, much smaller than that of samples C, CB, and CBB (50 m 2 /g).The hysteresis loops for samples C, CB, and CBB covered a considerably wide range of relative pressures, suggesting their wide bimodal mesopore size distributions, as confirmed by the corresponding broad BJH pore-size distributions (Fig. S2(b)).Typically, they had two main mesopore peaks centered at around 4 and 45 nm.Moreover, the isotherms for samples C, CB, and CBB showed high adsorption at high P/P0 approaching 1.0, implying the existence of large mesopores and macropores.The formation of various mesopores and macropores is due to the intra-and inter-agglomeration 1011. It is well known that CO2 adsorption on the surface of a photocatalyst is key to initiating the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.Furthermore, the CO2 adsorption capacity is a significant factor influencing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency 1011.As shown in Fig. S3, all the samples showed an almost linear relationship between the CO2 adsorption capacity and the relative pressure (P/P0) in the higher P/P0 range of 0.3-1.0.Such a characteristic indicates a dominant physical interaction between CO2 and the various samples; thus, the specific surface area was found to be the most important influencing factor.In particular, with the increasing SBET from sample B to samples C and CB, the CO2 adsorption capacity steadily increased.Meanwhile, in the lower P/P0 range of 0-0.3, a relatively faster increase in CO2 uptake was recorded for all the samples, particularly for sample CBB, indicating the occurrence of the chemical adsorption of CO2.The chemical adsorption of CO2 on sample B is minor, suggesting that the chemical interaction between CO2 and BiVO4 is weak.However, samples C, CB, and CBB have much stronger chemical adsorption.This is probably due to the stronger interaction of the g-C3N4 moieties, which have abundant amino functional groups (XPS results), with the CO2 molecules.In particular, the in-situ reduction step to fabricate sample CBB might lead to further surface functionalization of g-C3N4 to enhance the chemical adsorption of CO2. The band structures of the photocatalysts could be revealed by combined optical and electrochemical analyses.Specifically, the bandgap energies can be estimated by analyzing the optical absorption spectrum.The UV-vis DRS spectra were measured to study the optical properties and electronic structures of the as-prepared samples (Fig. 5).All the four samples have good absorption in the visible light region.The optical absorption edges of samples C and B were approximately estimated to be 450 and 525 nm, respectively (Fig. 5(a)).The absorption curves for samples CB and CBB are located between those of samples B and C (Fig. 5(a)).In particular, because of the SPR effects of the in-situ generated Bi nanoparticles 61,70, sample CBB exhibited a slight promotion in visible light absorption above 500 nm, compared with sample CB.The bandgap energy (Eg) values of samples B and C can be evaluated using the following equation: h B (h -Eg) n/2 where is the absorption coefficient, is the frequency of the light, h is Planck's constant, B is the absorption constant, and n 1 or 4 depending on the nature of the semiconductor (direct or indirect bandgap, respectively) 60.Both g-C3N4 and BiVO4 are direct bandgap semiconductors, consequently, Eg can be estimated from a plot of ( h) 2 versus (h).The interception of the tangent to the x-axis would give a good approximation of Eg of the samples.As the absorbance (A) is proportional to the absorption coefficient (), the value of A was used as a substitute of in the present study, as in Fig. 5(b).Here, the Eg values of samples B and C were estimated to be 2.40 and 2.83 eV, respectively, which agree well with the reported values 49.Moreover, the conduction band energy (ECB) of a photocatalyst can be calculated according to the following equation (Mulliken electronegativity theory): ECB -E e -0.5Eg, where is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor photocatalyst, E e is the energy of the free electron in the hydrogen scale (approximately 4.5 eV), and Eg is the bandgap energy 60.The values for BiVO4 and g-C3N4 are 6.04 and 4.66 eV, respectively 60, so the calculated CB potentials for samples B and C were approximately 0.34 and -1.26 V, respectively.Combined with the value of Eg, the VB potentials of samples B and C were, thus, calculated to be 2.74 and 1.57V vs. NHE, respectively.The band structures of the BiVO4 (sample B) and g-C3N4 (sample C) photocatalysts are illustrated in Fig. S4. As the charge separation and transfer efficiency play a critical role in the final photocatalytic performance, we combined the transient photocurrent and EIS analyses to clarify the charge dynamic process in the different photocatalysts (Fig. 6).The transient photocurrent responses were recorded at a bias potential of 0.4 V for several on-off cycles under visible light irradiation.As shown in Fig. 6(a), for all the samples, the photocurrent reached a constant value when the light was on, and decreased to zero when the light was off.The photocurrents of both samples B and C were obviously lower than those of the other two composite samples.It was suggested that the interfacial hybridization of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 in sample CB was beneficial for the charge separation.Moreover, after introducing a certain amount of Bi nanoparticles in sample CBB, the photocurrent was further increased, relative to sample CB.It was supposed that a portion of Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acted as an electron bridge, promoting the interfacial charge transfer.EIS analysis is a powerful tool to study the electrochemical charge transfer behavior at high frequency 3,11.Fig. 6(b) shows the EIS spectra in the Nyquist mode in the frequency range of 100 kHz -1 kHz for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB.The Nyquist plot can be interpreted in terms of the equivalent circuit, as displayed in the inset.In the equivalent circuit, Rs is the solution resistance, CPE is the constant phase element for the electrolyte/electrode interface, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the interface of the electrode/electrolyte 3,11.The arcs in the Nyquist plot are related to the charge transfer at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.The fitted Rct values were 46.8, 42.0, 38.2, and 34.4 for the electrodes made from samples B, C, CB, and CBB, respectively.Sample CBB, with the lowest Rct, presented the best charge transfer efficiency.Over-all, it can be concluded that the charge transfer rate in sample CB can be improved because of the reduced charge recombination by forming a heterojunction, compared to those in samples B and C. By introducing a portion of Bi nanoparticles at the interface of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 acting as an electron bridge, the charge transfer rate in sample CBB could be further enhanced. In this study, Rhodamine B (RhB) was chosen as the target pollutant to evaluate the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of the as-prepared samples under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).As presented in Fig. 7(a), sample CBB shows the best aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity in the degradation of the RhB molecules.The temporal changes in the absorption spectra of the RhB aqueous solution (10 mg/L) upon visible light irradiation over sample C are illustrated in Fig. 7(b).It is noted that the maximum absorption band (wavelength corresponding to the maximal absorbance, max) of the reaction solution gradually shifted from 554 to 495 nm during the photocatalytic degradation of RhB.This hypsochromic shift in max of the RhB solution corresponds to the step-by-step de-ethylation of RhB to give N,N,N'-triethyl rhodamine (TER, 539 nm), N,N'-diethyl rhodamine (DER, 522 nm), N-ethyl rhodamine (MER, 510 nm), and rhodamine at 495 nm 50.As shown in Fig. 7(c), the degree of de-ethylation can be represented by the blue shift in the wavelength of the maximum absorption: max 554 -max 50.Importantly, as for all the samples, de-ethylation occurred dominantly in the early stage; at the end of this stage, there was a leap in max, then, max was very limited (Fig. 7(c)), indicating that the de-ethylation process was almost terminated and the mineralization process of rhodamine (decomposition of the conjugated structure of rhodamine to small molecules) was initiated 50.In this regard, there are two distinctive stages of the aerobic photocatalytic RhB oxidation process: de-ethylation and mineralization.Generally, the rate of de-ethylation is higher than that of the following mineralization process, and very limited changes in the spectral intensity are recorded at the maximal absorption during miner- alization.The photocatalytic oxidation rate of RhB can be approximately calculated based on the de-ethylation process of RhB.The photocatalytic degradation kinetics of RhB during de-ethylation can be described using a pseudo first order reaction model, expressed by the following: -ln(C/C0) kt, where C0 and C are the initial and final RhB concentrations, respectively; k is the pseudo first order rate constant; and t represents the light irradiation time.The k values can be estimated from the ln (A0/A) vs. t plot, as shown in Fig. 7(d).Sample CBB had the highest k value of 0.067 min -1 , much higher than that of samples B (0.005 min -1 ), C (0.033 min -1 ), and CB (0.051 min -1 ).The aerobic photocatalytic oxidation activity of sample CBB is obviously better than that of some previously reported similar materials 525354555657585960. It is worth noting that, during the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation processes, RhB could be usually degraded completely into CO2, which is generally regarded as the ideal harmless product for organic pollution control.However, in terms of carbon cycling, CO2 is not an ideal product because it is a typical greenhouse gas; thus, it is highly desirable to reduce the above-generated CO2 into other value-added chemicals or fuels.In this study, the possibility of the anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals using the various as-prepared samples was also evaluated in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm).The anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 involves a series of complicated processes, i.e., charge generation and transfer, C-O bond breaking, and C-H and O-H bond formation 12.The main reactions during photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O are as follows 12. CO2 2H 2e - CO H2O E 0 redox -0.24V The anaerobic photocatalytic gaseous reduction of CO2 in the presence of water vapor was performed under visible light irradiation for 1 h at atmospheric pressure.As shown in Fig. 8, the evolution of CO was recorded as the main product for all the samples, while some other reduction products such as H2, CH4, and CH3OH could also be detected for the binary and ternary composites.As CH3OH, CH4, and H2 are important industrial chemicals and fuels, their selective production over samples CB and CBB suggests the significance of the construction of a composite photocatalyst.More specifically, owing to the formation of the heterojunction between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, a trace amount of CH4 and a small amount of H2 were detected for sample CB, but the yield of CO considerably decreased.In contrast, for sample CBB, while much more multi-electron reduc- tion products (CH4 and CH3OH) were generated, the yields of the two-electron reduction products (CO and H2) also significantly increased.The efficient charge transfer and surface enrichment in composite photocatalysts would favor the generation of multi-electron reduction products.The above separated aerobic photocatalytic oxidation and anaerobic photocatalytic reduction experiments clearly demonstrate the dual functionality of the designed composite photocatalyst.As illustrated in Fig. 1, these results imply the possibility of achieving photocatalytic carbon cycling by the integration of the aerobic oxidation and anaerobic reduction processes.However, the two-pot reaction systems, involving RhB to CO2 followed by CO2 to solar fuels, will be complicated in operation.Under this consideration, the direct conversion of RhB to solar fuels under anaerobic conditions in one-pot was also studied over the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalysts.The anaerobic photocatalytic degradation of the aqueous RhB solution over sample CBB was also performed in the anaerobic reaction system under identical conditions, except that 50-mL aqueous RhB solution (10 mg/L) was introduced instead of CO2 and H2O vapor.The one-pot anaerobic photocatalytic result is shown in Fig. 8(b).The RhB degradation efficiency was approximately 30 in 1 h, which was much lower than that conducted under aerobic conditions.This result suggests that oxygen was important for enhancing the photocatalytic RhB removal process.Interestingly, CO, as the major gas product, was indeed detected.The yield (0.63 mol/(gh) was much lower than that obtained from the photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O vapor.More complex reaction processes are involved in the one-pot anaerobic reaction system, while the overall photocatalytic conversion efficiency can be further improved by promoting the anaerobic RhB oxidation efficiency, which would compete with the water splitting process that is crucial for CO hydrogenation. As shown above, the photocatalytic activities of samples CB and CBB were tremendously enhanced because of the formation of the heterojunction; thus, it is essential to understand the synergetic mechanism in the binary and ternary composite system.Combing the XPS analyses of sample CBB (Fig. 2) with the band structure analyses of the g-C3N4 and BiVO4 photocatalyst (Fig. 8), the formation of the S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst probably accounts for the promotion of the charge dynamics (Fig. S2) and photocatalytic efficiency.Such an assumption was further confirmed by the following results of the density functional theory (DFT) calculation and scavenger studies 30,65666768. The calculations were conducted using the CASTEP mode of Materials Studio according to DFT 74757677.The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof form exchange-correlation functional was used within the generalized gradient approximation.The geometry optimization and electrostatic potential calculations were completed with the cutoff energy of 380 eV and Monkhorst-Pack grids of 2 5 1 for the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane, and 3 3 1 for the monolayer g-C3N4.The convergence thresholds for the geometry optimization were set as: energy of 5.0 10 -6 eV/atom, maximum force of 0.01 eV/A, and maximum stress of 0.02 GPa.The optimized models and calculated average potential profiles of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) crystal plane and monolayer g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 9. The Fermi energy of the semiconductor is one important parameter for estimating the charge transfer between the interfaces of two semiconductor materials, and can be calculated by: Evac -EF where Evac and EF are the electrostatic potential of the vacuum energy and Fermi energy, respectively 74757677.The calculated work functions of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4 were 6.92 and 4.23 eV, respectively.The Fermi energy of the g-C3N4 was higher than that of the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet.Upon the interfacial contact between the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet and monolayer g-C3N4, electrons will transfer from g-C3N4 to the monoclinic BiVO4 (001) facet until their Fermi energies reach the same level.As a consequence, this leads to the decrease of electron density of g-C3N4 and an increase in BiVO4, implying the formation of a built-in electric field at the BiVO4 and g-C3N4 interface (Fig. S5).It is worth noting that the direction of the abovementioned built-in electric field is from the g-C3N4 surface to the BiVO4 surface, which is beneficial to the vectorial interfacial transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers from the CB of BiVO4 to the VB of g-C3N4 during the photocatalytic reaction processes (Fig. S5).Overall, the DFT calculation suggests the formation of an S-scheme junction at the interface of the BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst 74757677.By a simple comparison of the OH -/OH and O2/O2 -redox potentials versus the CB and VB potentials of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 (Fig. S4), it is clear that OH radicals cannot be generated over pure g-C3N4, but can be generated over pure BiVO4.On the contrary, O2 -radicals cannot be generated over pure BiVO4, but can be generated over pure g-C3N4.Such assumptions have been well confirmed by the scavenger studies.IPA as the OH scavenger and Tempol as the O2 -scavenger were introduced in the respective reaction system for the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation to determine the involved main ROSs over each photocatalyst (Fig. 10).Importantly, in the sample B-based photocatalytic system, the degradation efficiency was obviously inhibited after introduction of IPA as the scavenger of OH, suggesting the weak reductive ability of the photogenerated electrons in BiVO4, while the main ROS were h -derived oxidative species (OH).In contrast, the degradation efficiency of the sample C-based photocatalytic system was inhibited after introduction of Tempol as the scavenger of O2 -, suggesting the weak oxidative ability of the photogenerated holes in BiVO4, while the main ROS were e --derived oxidative species (O2 -).After the formation of the heterostructure between g-C3N4 and BiVO4, both O2 -and OH significantly contributed to the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation over samples CB and CBB.This result suggests that in the g-C3N4/BiVO4 binary nanocom-posites, both the photoexcited holes with strong oxidative ability from the VB of BiVO4 and the photoexcited electrons with strong reductive ability from the CB of g-C3N4 were retained, and an S-scheme hybrid photocatalyst system was established.Moreover, after introduction of the Bi nanoparticles, the synergetic photocatalytic mechanism did not vary, sustaining the S-scheme interfacial charge transfer in the g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 ternary nanocomposites.In fact, metallic Bi nanoparticles, as an important component of CBB ternary photocatalysts, may have three basic functions 67.First, the plasmonic effects of Bi nanoparticles enhance the visible light absorption ability (Fig. 5(a)).Second, the field effects of plasmonic Bi nanoparticles enhance the charge separation efficiency (Fig. 6).Third, a portion of metallic Bi nanoparticles located at the interface of the S-scheme of g-C3N4/BiVO4 may promote the interfacial charge transfer by acting as an S-scheme electron mediator (Fig. 6), similar to the roles of the Au nanoparticles in the Au/CdS/TiO2 hybrid system 66. The complex photocatalytic mechanism of the S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst is demonstrated in Fig. 11.First, for the light harvesting process, there are three active visible light absorption centers, being the g-C3N4 nanosheets, BiVO4, and surface-decorated metallic Bi nanoparticles.In particular, due to the SPR effects, the metallic Bi nanoparticles enhanced the visible light absorption capacity.Second, for the charge transfer processes, due to the formation of a built-in electric field at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface, S-scheme interfacial charge transfer, that is the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of BiVO4 toward the VB of g-C3N4, dominated upon light irradiation.Moreover, the metallic Bi nanoparticles acted as an S-scheme electron mediator to promote the interfacial charge transfer in the ternary S-scheme g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 hybrid system.Incidentally, the photoexcited hot electrons from the metallic Bi nanoparticles transferred to the CB of the BiVO4 moiety, then toward the VB of g-C3N4, inhibiting the charge recombination.As a consequence, the holes in g-C3N4 and the electrons in BiVO4 with poor redox ability were sacrificed, and the electrons in g-C3N4 and the holes in BiVO4 with strong redox ability remained and were spatially separated, which together modulate the charge potentials and dynamics to suit the"}, {"llm generation": "gaseous", "source": "Fig. 8.

Binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 nanocomposites.The g-C3N4/BiVO4 composite photocatalysts with different loading amounts of BiVO4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple substrate-directed liquid phase deposition method.The preformed g-C3N4 nanosheets (sample C) were used as the substrate to direct the deposition of the BiVO4 nanoparticles.Firstly, 0.5 g of g-C3N4 nanosheets was suspended into 100 mL deionized water under sonication for 30 min.Subsequently, bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)35H2O) and ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3), with a mole ratio of 1:1, were added to the above suspension under violent stirring, and the optimized initial mass percentage of BiVO4 to g-C3N4 was 15.The mixed suspension was violently stirred for another 30 min.After this, the precipitate was centrifuged and washed with deionized water several times to remove impurities.The collected precipitate was dried overnight in a drying oven at 80 C.Finally, the dried powders were ground and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 C/min to enhance the interfacial interactions between the g-C3N4 nanosheets and BiVO4 nanoparticles.The as-obtained binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 nanocomposite photocatalysts are named CB.For comparison, a pure BiVO4 photocatalyst was also prepared under identical conditions and procedures but in the absence of the g-C3N4 nanosheets; the obtained sample is denoted as B. Ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites.The ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposites were prepared by a simple sodium borohydride (NaBH4)-induced in-situ reduction method, using the above-prepared binary g-C3N4/BiVO4 nanocomposites with the best photocatalytic performances (that is, sample CB) as the substrate.For a typical synthesis, 0.2 g of sample CB was first dispersed into 50 mL deionized water under magnetic stirring for 10 min.Then, 50 mL of dilute NaBH4 solution was added dropwise into the above suspension; the optimized initial molar ratio of NaBH4 to BiVO4 was 0.4.After 10 min, the products were collected and washed with deionized water three times and dried at 50 C for 12 h in a vacuum drying oven.The obtained sample is denoted as CBB. The as-synthesized samples were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), the patterns of which were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu K radiation ( 1.54056A).Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning TEM (STEM) image, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings were obtained using a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at 200 kV.UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment, using BaSO4 as the background.An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a Physical Electronics PHI 1600 ESCA system operating with an Al K X-ray source (E 1486.6eV), and all the binding energies were calibrated using the C1s peak at 284.6 eV.Nitrogen sorption isotherms and CO2 adsorption curves were measured on a TriStar II 3020 gas adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics, USA).All the samples were degassed at 180 C for 12 h prior to measurements.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (SBET) was determined using adsorption data in a relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05-0.3by a multipoint BET method.Furthermore, the pore-size distribution was determined using the desorption data via the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.The volume of nitrogen desorbed at P/P0 0.99 was used to determine the pore volume (Vp) and the average pore size (dp).The photoelectrochemical measurements, including the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), of the samples were conducted on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument Corporation, Shanghai).All the photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell.The film electrode of each synthesized sample on FTO conductive glass served as the working electrode, while an Ag/AgCl electrode and platinum foil were employed as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.Moreover, a 300-W Xenon lamp with a UV-cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was used as the visible light source, and 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The bifunctional photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4/Bi/BiVO4 nanocomposite and other control samples were evaluated in terms of the aerobic photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2.For the former, a 350-W Xenon lamp (Changzhou Siyu, China) equipped with a 420-nm UV-cutoff filter was used as the visible light source.The distance between the lamp and reactor remained at a constant height of 15 cm.Before light illumination, 50 mg of each photocatalyst was suspended in a 50 mL 10 mg/L aqueous RhB solution under vigorous stirring.The suspensions were continuously stirred for another 30 min in the dark to reach an adsorption-desorption equilibrium between the photocatalysts and RhB molecules prior to light irradiation.During light irradiation, 3 mL of the suspensions were extracted at regular time intervals and centrifuged to remove the photocatalysts.The residual concentration of RhB was monitored by a UV-2550 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).To determine the dominant reactive oxidative species (ROSs), 2-propanol (IPA) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (Tempol) were introduced as scavengers for hydroxyl radicals (OH) and superoxide radicals (O2 -), respectively, during the aerobic photocatalytic RhB degradation reaction under otherwise identical conditions. For the anaerobic photocatalytic reduction of CO2, all the measurements were carried out at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure in a 200-mL homemade two-neck Pyrex top-irradiation reactor.The two necks of the reactor were sealed with silicone rubber septums to form a closed system.A 300-W Xenon lamp (PerfectLight, PLS-SXE300, China) with a 420-nm UV-cutoff filter was used as the light source and was positioned ca. 15 cm above the reactor.As a typical photocatalytic experiment, 100 mg of the photocatalyst was uniformly deposited onto the bottom of the reactor.Prior to the light irradiation, the reactor was sealed and purged by blowing nitrogen for 45 min to ensure the anaerobic conditions of the reaction system.In each testing experiment, CO2 and H2O vapor were in-situ produced by the reaction of NaHCO3 powder and aqueous H2SO4 solution inside a specially designed groove in one neck of the reactor.The NaHCO3 powder (0.084 g) was put into the groove before sealing, while the aqueous H2SO4 solution (2 M, 0.3 mL) was injected into the groove by a syringe before light irradiation.After 1 h of light irradiation, the gas products extracted from the reactor were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC-7890B, Agilent) equipped with two flame-ionized detectors and a thermal conductivity detector.High-purity helium was used as the carrier gas in the gas chromatography.The retention time and yield of each detected gas product were determined and calibrated with a standard gas mixture. The anaerobic photocatalytic degradation of the aqueous RhB solution over sample CBB was conducted in the above anaerobic reaction system under identical conditions, except that the 50 mL aqueous RhB solution (10 mg/L) was introduced, instead of the NaHCO3 powder and aqueous H2SO4 solution to produce CO2 and H2O vapor.The gas products and concentration change of the aqueous RhB solution were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-7890B, Agilent) and UV-visible spectrophotometry (UV-2550, Shimadzu), respectively."}]}}
