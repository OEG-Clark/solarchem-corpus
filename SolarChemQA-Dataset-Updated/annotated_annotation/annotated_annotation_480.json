Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the synthesized TiO 2 /PU, Cu-TiO 2 /PU, V-TiO 2 /PU, and CuV co-doped TiO 2 /PU.The obtained results indicate that all the TiO 2 in the TiO 2 /PU and V-TiO 2 /PU existed in the anatase phase 29.However, the XRD patterns of Cu-TiO 2 /PU and CuV-TiO 2 /PU shows additional peaks at 27.5a nd 36.1,corresponding to rutile peaks of TiO 2 (Fig. 3).Rutile peaks occurred due to the Cu dopants, which accelerated the anatase-rutile phase transformation or the formation of the rutile phase in the TiO 2 33,34.In addition, the (1 0 1) anatase peak of the TiO 2 in the XRD patterns of both single-and co-doped materials was more left-shifted and broader than that in the TiO 2 /PU.This was due to the metal dopants incorporated into the crystal struc-ture of TiO 2 , leading to distortions in the crystal lattice 35363738.The Cu and V dopants defected into and substituted for the Ti 4 ions in the TiO 2 lattice by forming CuAOATi and TiAOAV bonds, respectively 39,40.This substitution led to the formation of Ti 3 ions or oxygen vacancies in the metal-doped TiO 2 /PU materials 41,42.The obtained XPS results of the doped TiO 2 materials confirmed the existence of Ti 3 in the TiO 2 lattice (Fig. 4).The calculated Ti 3 /Ti 4 ratios, which are proportional to the ratios (area under the Ti 3 peak)/(area under the Ti 4 peak) in the obtained XPS spectra of the synthesized metal-doped TiO 2 , are also listed in Table 1.The obtained results show that the Ti 3 /Ti 4 ratio in the V single-doped photocatalyst (6V-TiO 2 /PU) was higher than that in the Cu single-doped photocatalyst (6Cu-TiO 2 /PU).This was because the ionic radius of V 4 (0.72 A) is closer to that of Ti 4 (0.74 A) than is that of Cu 2 (0.87 A), and hence the V 4 was more effectively doped into the TiO 2 lattice than the Cu 2 was, which increased the oxygen vacancy (or formation of Ti 3 ) in the V single-doped photocatalyst more than that in the Cu single-doped photocatalyst 31,32.The Ti 3 /Ti 4 ratio in the CuV-TiO 2 /PU co-doped photocatalyst was higher than that in either the Cu or V single-doped photocatalyst.This indicates that the Cu and V co-doping further enhanced the defects in the TiO 2 lattice, thus increasing the formation of oxygen vacancies or Ti 3 compared with the case of the single-doped with Cu and V.In the co-doped photocatalysts, when the V/TiO 2 ratio was increased to 4 wt.(2Cu4V-TiO 2 /PU), the Ti 3 /Ti 4 ratio increased to a maximum of 35.3, but then decreased slightly with further increase in the V/TiO 2 ratio.Therefore, the optimal combination weight ratio of 2 wt.Cu/TiO 2 and 4 wt.V/TiO 2 led to the most defects in the TiO 2 lattice. The optical absorption spectra of the synthesized TiO 2 /PU, Cu-TiO 2 /PU, V-TiO 2 /PU, and CuV-TiO 2 /PU materials indicate that the synthesized TiO 2 /PU inherited all the optical absorption properties of TiO 2 , which only absorbs UV light with the absorption edge at 370 nm (Fig. 5) 42,43.However, the optical absorption of the twin-metal-doped TiO 2 /PU materials was observed in both the UV and visible regions.The significant enhancement of the optical absorption in the visible region of the twin-metal-doped TiO 2 /PU was due to the synergistic contribution of Cu and V dopants.The dopants defected into the TiO 2 lattice led to oxygen vacancies and the formation of Ti 3 in the TiO 2 lattice.The formed Ti 3 in the doped TiO 2 lattice created an intermediate band between the valence band and the conduction band of TiO 2 , which increased the electron-hole pair separation efficiency of TiO 2 and the light absorption enhancement of the metal-doped TiO 2 /PU 44.The formed oxides (CuO, Cu 2 O, and V 2 O 5 ) distributed on the surface of the TiO 2 layer also combined with TiO 2 to create a suitable semiconductor-semiconductor system, which increased the electron transfer from the valence band to the conduction band of TiO 2 and thereby enhanced the light absorption of the metaldoped TiO 2 /PU 45.The Cu and V co-doped TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts inherited all the advantages of these individual single dopants to enhance their light absorption efficiency.The obtained results indicate that 2Cu4V-TiO 2 /PU, with Cu/TiO 2 and V/TiO 2 ratios of 2 and 4 wt.,respectively, showed the greatest optical absorption ability in the visible light region.A Tauc plot combined with the Kubelka-Munk method was used to estimate the band gap energies of the synthesized photocatalysts 46,47.In the Tauc plot, a linear fit was drawn from the transformed curves to the photon energy axis (hm).The energy value at the point of intersection of the line and the horizontal axis is the band gap energy of the material (Fig. 6).The obtained results indicate that the band gap energies of the synthesized CuV-TiO 2 /PU were positively related to the Ti 3 /Ti 4 ratios (Table 1).As mentioned, the formed Ti 3 acted as an intermediate band between the valence band and the conduction band of TiO 2 , thereby decreasing the band gap energy. The experiments with CO 2 reduction by the synthesized photocatalysts were conducted under two different conditions.Under condition A, 50 mL/min CO 2 containing water was passed through the synthesized photocatalysts under dark conditions for 180 min and then irradiated with visible light for an additional 360 min.Under condition B, the visible light was immediately provided from the beginning of the reduction experiments (in the same CO 2 feed environment).The obtained results show that the synthesized TiO 2 /PU and doped TiO 2 /PU could not reduce CO 2 under dark conditions.Under visible light, the TiO 2 /PU also did not exhibit any photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction; however, the doped TiO 2 photocatalysts reduced a certain amount of CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Fig. 7 shows the production rates for CO and CH 4 from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by 3Cu3V-TiO 2 /PU.Under both conditions A and B, the production rates for CO and CH 4 gradually increased to a stable value after a certain irradiation time.However, in the early irradiation period, condition A produced CO and CH 4 at higher rates than condition B did (Fig. 7), because the photocatalysts adsorbed a certain amount of CO 2 and H 2 O on their surfaces during the darkened period of condition A (preadsorption).As mentioned, the adsorption is the initial step for CO 2 conversion.Thus, the photocatalyst immediately reduced the adsorbed CO 2 to produce CO and CH 4 when it was irradiated with visible light after the darkened period.Under condition B, the photocatalysts were irradiated immediately with visible light when the CO 2 containing H 2 O reached their surfaces.Therefore, the photocatalysts needed a certain time to adsorb CO 2 and H 2 O, which slowed down the reduction.However, the adsorption of the CO 2 and H 2 O on the photocatalyst gradually reached a balanced state because the CO 2 conversion experiment was conducted in an online system, in which 50 mL/min CO 2 containing water was continuously admitted to the photocatalyst.The adsorbate (CO 2 and H 2 O) on the surface of each photocatalyst in the balanced state under the two experimented conditions was similar because in the balanced state the adsorption depends on the interactions between the photocatalyst and the adsorbate.Therefore, the CO 2 reduction rate and efficiency of the photocatalysts under the two provided conditions were similar after a certain irradiation time (when the ''preadsorption\" effects of condition A no longer existed).The Cu and V dopants defected into the TiO 2 lattice, leading to oxygen vacancies and the formation of Ti 3 in the lattice and thereby enhancing the separation of electron-hole pairs in the CuV-TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts.The formed CuO, Cu 2 O, and V 2 O 5 oxides distributed on the TiO 2 surface acted as an electron sink (or electron transfer) to prevent recombination of the generated electrons and holes, also enhancing the electron-hole separation efficiency.Therefore, the synthesized CuV-TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts generated a significant number of electron-hole pairs, even under visible light.The generated holes reacted with H 2 O vapor to produce protons (H ).The generated electrons reduced CO 2 to certain carbon radicals (reduced CO 2 ) such as A CO 2 and C 48,49.Finally, the reduced CO 2 reacted with the formed protons to produce CO and CH 4 (Fig. 8).The overall reactions to form CO and CH 4 are shown by the following equations: Eqs. (E3) and (E4) show that 2 mol protons and 2 mol electrons are needed to generate 1 mol CO, whereas the formation of 1 mol CH 4 requires 8 mol protons and 8 mol electrons.In addition, a certain time was required to produce protons (via reaction (E2)).More time was also spent in diffusion of the produced protons to the carbon radicals.Therefore, in the early irradiation period, there was a small number of protons participating in reactions with CO 2 .Thus, in this period, the CO was preferably produced rather than CH 4 due to lack of protons.However, after a certain irradiation time, the produced amount of CH 4 surpassed that of CO because the generation of CH 4 (E 0 redox A0.24V) is thermodynamically more feasible than that of CO (E 0 redox A0.48V) when there are sufficient protons and electrons.In the present study, the co-doping of Cu and V significantly enhanced the electron-hole separation of the TiO 2 .Therefore, the synthesized materials generated a significant number of electrons and holes, even under visible light.The generated electrons were easily transferred to the photocatalyst surface by the CuO, Cu 2 O, and V 2 O 5 oxides (distributed on the TiO 2 surface) to react with protons, which were abundantly produced from the reduction of H 2 O by the generated holes, leading to selective conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 rather than CO. The rates of production of CO and CH 4 on synthesized CuV-TiO 2 /PU with different doping ratios after approximately 5 h irradiation by visible light (when production rate was stable) are shown in Table 1.The obtained results indicate that the production rates of CO and CH 4 were positively related to the concentration of the formed Ti 3 (or oxygen vacancies) in the TiO 2 lattice.This is consistent with the possible roles of the Ti 3 and oxygen vacancies in the reduction of CO 2 .The oxygen vacancies existing on the surface of the photocatalyst introduced new adsorption sites to adsorb CO 2 .As mentioned in Section 3.2.1, the formation of Ti 3 enhanced the separation of electron-hole pairs of the photocatalysts and the generated electrons and holes participated in multiple reactions for the reduction of CO 2 by H 2 O vapor 23,50.Table 1 also shows that 2Cu4V-TiO 2 /PU exhibited the highest CO 2 reduction efficiency.The rates of CH 4 and CO production from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with 2Cu4V-TiO 2 /PU under visible light were 933 and 588 (lmol g A1 cat.h A1 ), respectively. Table 2 show the rates of production for products of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by our synthesized material and other recently reported materials 17,51525354555657585960.In a previous study, UV irradiation was mostly used as the energy source to initiate the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The reductants, such as H 2 gas, and the electron donors, such as NaOH and KHCO 3 , were also used to enhance the CO 2 reduction efficiency or selectivity.Therefore, the real application of the studies for industrial reduction of CO 2 is limited, because of high energy consumption and safety issues.In contrast, our synthesized CuV-TiO 2 /PU materials showed a novel photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO 2 to produce CO and CH 4 , because only water vapor was used as the reductant and visible light as the energy source.Thus, our obtained results are expected to open a new era in the applications of photocatalysts for the reduction of CO 2 to produce valuable fuels."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "In this study, Cu and V co-doped CuV-TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts were synthesized for CO 2 conversion using visible light as the energy source and H 2 O vapor as a reductant to produce valuable fuels.", "context": "In this study, Cu and V co-doped CuV-TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts were synthesized for CO 2 conversion using visible light as the energy source and H 2 O vapor as a reductant to produce valuable fuels.Both Cu and V defected into the TiO 2 lattice, leading to the formation of Ti 3 and oxygen vacancies in the lattice.However, as the ionic radius of V 4 is closer to that of Ti 4 than is that of Cu 2 , V 4 was doped into the TiO 2 lattice more effectively than Cu 2 .The Ti 3 formed in the doped TiO 2 lattice created an intermediate band between the valence band and the conduction band of TiO 2 , which increased the electron-hole pair separation efficiency of TiO 2 and enhanced the light absorption by the metal-doped TiO 2 /PU.The oxygen vacancies existing on the surface of the photocatalyst induced new adsorption sites to adsorb CO 2 , and the generated electrons and holes reduced the adsorbed CO 2 with H 2 O vapor to produce CO and CH 4 .The 2Cu4V-TiO 2 /PU photocatalyst, with Cu/TiO 2 and V/TiO 2 ratios of 2 and 4 wt.,respectively, exhibited the highest rate of defection into the TiO 2 lattice, leading to the maximum formation of Ti 3 and oxygen vacancies with the highest reduction efficiency of the doped photocatalyst.The rates of CH 4 and CO production from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor by 2Cu4V-TiO 2 /PU under visible light were 933 and 588 lmol g A1 cat.h A1 , respectively.The synthesized photocatalysts generated sufficient electrons and holes for the reduction of CO 2 .Therefore, CH 4 was selectively produced rather than CO.

The synthesized CuV-TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts were analyzed by a Thermo Fisher K-Alpha X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS) system.The obtained XPS spectra were fitted by Gaussian multipeak shapes to characterize the elemental states of copper, vanadium, and titanium in the synthesized photocatalysts.A Hitachi S4700 scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the surface morphology of the CuV-TiO 2 /PU, which was coated with Pt before SEM analysis to increase the conductivity of the photocatalyst surface.A JEOL TEM-2010F system was used to obtain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and highresolution TEM (HR-TEM) images of the synthesized CuV-TiO 2 /PU.The optical absorption ability of the shredded CuV-TiO 2 /PU photocatalyst was characterized by an Evolution 300 spectrophotometer (UV-1700 Shimadzu).X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the CuV-TiO 2 /PU were obtained using a Bruker AXN model equipped with a Cu Ka radiation (k 1.5418A) source and operated at a scan rate of 0.02s A1 over the 2h range 10-80. Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor was conducted by a continuous system comprising a gas generator, reaction chamber, and analyzer.The gas generator consisted of a cylinder of CO 2 gas (99.99), flow rate meters, and a humidifier.The reaction chamber was a dark cover cask (50 A 25 A 50 cm) containing two white light bulbs (EFTR 20EX-D, Kumho Co., Ltd.) and a reactor (15 A 4 A 2 cm), the top and bottom parts of which were made of quartz to allow easy passage of visible light (400 k 700 nm).The reactor was placed in the center of the reaction chamber.Two 20 W white bulbs were placed at the top and the bottom of the reaction chamber to generate visible light in the range 400-700 nm with a power density of 0.05 W/cm 2 for the photocatalysis.The dark and visible light conditions for photocatalysis were achieved by turning the bulbs off and on, respectively.Before the photocatalytic conversion experiments, the reactor containing 2 g (36 cm 3 ) of the synthesized porous CuV-TiO 2 /PU was purged three times with high-purity CO 2 gas.Then 50 mL/min CO 2 that had been passed through water (303 K) was admitted to the reactor.Thus, the residence time of CO 2 in the reactor was 144 s and the space velocity, calculated by dividing the volumetric flow by the reactor volume, was 25 h A1 .The reactor temperature was constant at 32 C during the conversion experiments.To determine gaseous products, a 100 lL sample was automatically injected into the GC system, which consisted of a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a methanizer and a flame ionization detector using a packed column (Porapak Q 80/100 2 A 2 mm) at intervals of 20 min.The reaction start time (t 0 0) was assumed to be the time when the CO 2 gas stream containing H 2 O was admitted to the reactor.The production rate was calculated based on the total weight of synthesized catalyst (2 g)."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Under condition A, 50 mL/min CO 2 containing water was passed through the synthesized photocatalysts under dark conditions for 180 min and then irradiated with visible light for an additional 360 min.", "context": "Fig. 1 shows the SEM and elemental mapping of Ti, Cu, and V in the selected areas in the SEM images of the synthesized materials.In the TiO 2 /PU, TiO 2 was smoothly immobilized on the PU surface as a thin layer (Fig. 1A).The surfaces of the Cu-TiO 2 /PU, V-TiO 2 /PU, and CuV-TiO 2 /PU materials were rougher than that of TiO 2 /PU due to the presence of both Cu and V on the metal-doped photocatalysts (Fig. 1B-D).High-resolution XPS spectra with Gaussian multipeak shapes of Cu2p 3/2 and V2p 3/2 peaks were obtained to indicate the elemental states of copper and vanadium in the synthesized CuV-TiO 2 /PU (Fig. 2).The XPS spectra show that the Cu2p 3/2 peaks consist of two different peaks at 932.18 and 933.48 eV, corresponding to the binding energies of Cu2p 3/2 in the Cu and Cu 2 states, respectively 25,26.The Cu and Cu 2 exist in the form of either dopants (incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice) or Cu 2 O and CuO oxides (distributed on the surface of the TiO 2 layer) 14,18,26,27.The XPS spectra also show that the V2p 3/2 peaks consisted of two different peaks, observed at 516.0 and 517.4 eV, which were attributed to the binding energies of V2p 3/2 in the V 4 and V 5 states, respectively 28,29.The V 5 state of vanadium corresponded to the state of V 2 O 5 oxide distributed on the TiO 2 surface 15,282930.The V 4 ions exist as dopants incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice by substitutional replacement of the Ti 4 ions to form a TiAOAV bond 15,31,32.The various formed particles, such as CuO and Cu 2 O oxides on the surface of the Cu-TiO 2 /PU, V 2 O 5 on the surface of the V-TiO 2 /PU, and CuO, Cu 2 O, and V 2 O 5 on the surface of the CuV-TiO 2 /PU, increased the roughness and hence the surface area of the metal-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts.Table 1 cates that the BET surface areas of the metal-doped photocatalysts were much higher than that of the TiO 2 /PU.Table 1 also shows that the surface areas of the co-doped photocatalysts were much higher than those of the single-doped photocatalysts.This was because the co-doping effect of Cu and V inhibited the aggregation of CuO, Cu 2 O, and V 2 O 5 particles formed on the surface of TiO 2 in the CuV-TiO 2 /PU.Due to this inhibition, the formed particles were more uniformly distributed and their fractions were smaller than those in the single-doped photocatalysts 29.Therefore, the surface areas of the CuV-TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts were much higher than those of the Cu-TiO 2 /PU and V-TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts.The incorporation of Cu and V in the TiO 2 lattice also distorted the formation of the TiO 2 layer, which increased the surface areas of the synthesized co-doped photocatalysts.The optimal combination weight ratios of 2 wt.Cu/TiO 2 and 4 wt.V/TiO 2 led to the largest BET surface area of 236.5 (m 2 /g) for 2Cu4V-TiO 2 /PU. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the synthesized TiO 2 /PU, Cu-TiO 2 /PU, V-TiO 2 /PU, and CuV co-doped TiO 2 /PU.The obtained results indicate that all the TiO 2 in the TiO 2 /PU and V-TiO 2 /PU existed in the anatase phase 29.However, the XRD patterns of Cu-TiO 2 /PU and CuV-TiO 2 /PU shows additional peaks at 27.5a nd 36.1,corresponding to rutile peaks of TiO 2 (Fig. 3).Rutile peaks occurred due to the Cu dopants, which accelerated the anatase-rutile phase transformation or the formation of the rutile phase in the TiO 2 33,34.In addition, the (1 0 1) anatase peak of the TiO 2 in the XRD patterns of both single-and co-doped materials was more left-shifted and broader than that in the TiO 2 /PU.This was due to the metal dopants incorporated into the crystal struc-ture of TiO 2 , leading to distortions in the crystal lattice 35363738.The Cu and V dopants defected into and substituted for the Ti 4 ions in the TiO 2 lattice by forming CuAOATi and TiAOAV bonds, respectively 39,40.This substitution led to the formation of Ti 3 ions or oxygen vacancies in the metal-doped TiO 2 /PU materials 41,42.The obtained XPS results of the doped TiO 2 materials confirmed the existence of Ti 3 in the TiO 2 lattice (Fig. 4).The calculated Ti 3 /Ti 4 ratios, which are proportional to the ratios (area under the Ti 3 peak)/(area under the Ti 4 peak) in the obtained XPS spectra of the synthesized metal-doped TiO 2 , are also listed in Table 1.The obtained results show that the Ti 3 /Ti 4 ratio in the V single-doped photocatalyst (6V-TiO 2 /PU) was higher than that in the Cu single-doped photocatalyst (6Cu-TiO 2 /PU).This was because the ionic radius of V 4 (0.72 A) is closer to that of Ti 4 (0.74 A) than is that of Cu 2 (0.87 A), and hence the V 4 was more effectively doped into the TiO 2 lattice than the Cu 2 was, which increased the oxygen vacancy (or formation of Ti 3 ) in the V single-doped photocatalyst more than that in the Cu single-doped photocatalyst 31,32.The Ti 3 /Ti 4 ratio in the CuV-TiO 2 /PU co-doped photocatalyst was higher than that in either the Cu or V single-doped photocatalyst.This indicates that the Cu and V co-doping further enhanced the defects in the TiO 2 lattice, thus increasing the formation of oxygen vacancies or Ti 3 compared with the case of the single-doped with Cu and V.In the co-doped photocatalysts, when the V/TiO 2 ratio was increased to 4 wt.(2Cu4V-TiO 2 /PU), the Ti 3 /Ti 4 ratio increased to a maximum of 35.3, but then decreased slightly with further increase in the V/TiO 2 ratio.Therefore, the optimal combination weight ratio of 2 wt.Cu/TiO 2 and 4 wt.V/TiO 2 led to the most defects in the TiO 2 lattice. The optical absorption spectra of the synthesized TiO 2 /PU, Cu-TiO 2 /PU, V-TiO 2 /PU, and CuV-TiO 2 /PU materials indicate that the synthesized TiO 2 /PU inherited all the optical absorption properties of TiO 2 , which only absorbs UV light with the absorption edge at 370 nm (Fig. 5) 42,43.However, the optical absorption of the twin-metal-doped TiO 2 /PU materials was observed in both the UV and visible regions.The significant enhancement of the optical absorption in the visible region of the twin-metal-doped TiO 2 /PU was due to the synergistic contribution of Cu and V dopants.The dopants defected into the TiO 2 lattice led to oxygen vacancies and the formation of Ti 3 in the TiO 2 lattice.The formed Ti 3 in the doped TiO 2 lattice created an intermediate band between the valence band and the conduction band of TiO 2 , which increased the electron-hole pair separation efficiency of TiO 2 and the light absorption enhancement of the metal-doped TiO 2 /PU 44.The formed oxides (CuO, Cu 2 O, and V 2 O 5 ) distributed on the surface of the TiO 2 layer also combined with TiO 2 to create a suitable semiconductor-semiconductor system, which increased the electron transfer from the valence band to the conduction band of TiO 2 and thereby enhanced the light absorption of the metaldoped TiO 2 /PU 45.The Cu and V co-doped TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts inherited all the advantages of these individual single dopants to enhance their light absorption efficiency.The obtained results indicate that 2Cu4V-TiO 2 /PU, with Cu/TiO 2 and V/TiO 2 ratios of 2 and 4 wt.,respectively, showed the greatest optical absorption ability in the visible light region.A Tauc plot combined with the Kubelka-Munk method was used to estimate the band gap energies of the synthesized photocatalysts 46,47.In the Tauc plot, a linear fit was drawn from the transformed curves to the photon energy axis (hm).The energy value at the point of intersection of the line and the horizontal axis is the band gap energy of the material (Fig. 6).The obtained results indicate that the band gap energies of the synthesized CuV-TiO 2 /PU were positively related to the Ti 3 /Ti 4 ratios (Table 1).As mentioned, the formed Ti 3 acted as an intermediate band between the valence band and the conduction band of TiO 2 , thereby decreasing the band gap energy. The experiments with CO 2 reduction by the synthesized photocatalysts were conducted under two different conditions.Under condition A, 50 mL/min CO 2 containing water was passed through the synthesized photocatalysts under dark conditions for 180 min and then irradiated with visible light for an additional 360 min.Under condition B, the visible light was immediately provided from the beginning of the reduction experiments (in the same CO 2 feed environment).The obtained results show that the synthesized TiO 2 /PU and doped TiO 2 /PU could not reduce CO 2 under dark conditions.Under visible light, the TiO 2 /PU also did not exhibit any photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction; however, the doped TiO 2 photocatalysts reduced a certain amount of CO 2 into CO and CH 4 .Fig. 7 shows the production rates for CO and CH 4 from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by 3Cu3V-TiO 2 /PU.Under both conditions A and B, the production rates for CO and CH 4 gradually increased to a stable value after a certain irradiation time.However, in the early irradiation period, condition A produced CO and CH 4 at higher rates than condition B did (Fig. 7), because the photocatalysts adsorbed a certain amount of CO 2 and H 2 O on their surfaces during the darkened period of condition A (preadsorption).As mentioned, the adsorption is the initial step for CO 2 conversion.Thus, the photocatalyst immediately reduced the adsorbed CO 2 to produce CO and CH 4 when it was irradiated with visible light after the darkened period.Under condition B, the photocatalysts were irradiated immediately with visible light when the CO 2 containing H 2 O reached their surfaces.Therefore, the photocatalysts needed a certain time to adsorb CO 2 and H 2 O, which slowed down the reduction.However, the adsorption of the CO 2 and H 2 O on the photocatalyst gradually reached a balanced state because the CO 2 conversion experiment was conducted in an online system, in which 50 mL/min CO 2 containing water was continuously admitted to the photocatalyst.The adsorbate (CO 2 and H 2 O) on the surface of each photocatalyst in the balanced state under the two experimented conditions was similar because in the balanced state the adsorption depends on the interactions between the photocatalyst and the adsorbate.Therefore, the CO 2 reduction rate and efficiency of the photocatalysts under the two provided conditions were similar after a certain irradiation time (when the ''preadsorption\" effects of condition A no longer existed).The Cu and V dopants defected into the TiO 2 lattice, leading to oxygen vacancies and the formation of Ti 3 in the lattice and thereby enhancing the separation of electron-hole pairs in the CuV-TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts.The formed CuO, Cu 2 O, and V 2 O 5 oxides distributed on the TiO 2 surface acted as an electron sink (or electron transfer) to prevent recombination of the generated electrons and holes, also enhancing the electron-hole separation efficiency.Therefore, the synthesized CuV-TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts generated a significant number of electron-hole pairs, even under visible light.The generated holes reacted with H 2 O vapor to produce protons (H ).The generated electrons reduced CO 2 to certain carbon radicals (reduced CO 2 ) such as A CO 2 and C 48,49.Finally, the reduced CO 2 reacted with the formed protons to produce CO and CH 4 (Fig. 8).The overall reactions to form CO and CH 4 are shown by the following equations: Eqs. (E3) and (E4) show that 2 mol protons and 2 mol electrons are needed to generate 1 mol CO, whereas the formation of 1 mol CH 4 requires 8 mol protons and 8 mol electrons.In addition, a certain time was required to produce protons (via reaction (E2)).More time was also spent in diffusion of the produced protons to the carbon radicals.Therefore, in the early irradiation period, there was a small number of protons participating in reactions with CO 2 .Thus, in this period, the CO was preferably produced rather than CH 4 due to lack of protons.However, after a certain irradiation time, the produced amount of CH 4 surpassed that of CO because the generation of CH 4 (E 0 redox A0.24V) is thermodynamically more feasible than that of CO (E 0 redox A0.48V) when there are sufficient protons and electrons.In the present study, the co-doping of Cu and V significantly enhanced the electron-hole separation of the TiO 2 .Therefore, the synthesized materials generated a significant number of electrons and holes, even under visible light.The generated electrons were easily transferred to the photocatalyst surface by the CuO, Cu 2 O, and V 2 O 5 oxides (distributed on the TiO 2 surface) to react with protons, which were abundantly produced from the reduction of H 2 O by the generated holes, leading to selective conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 rather than CO. The rates of production of CO and CH 4 on synthesized CuV-TiO 2 /PU with different doping ratios after approximately 5 h irradiation by visible light (when production rate was stable) are shown in Table 1.The obtained results indicate that the production rates of CO and CH 4 were positively related to the concentration of the formed Ti 3 (or oxygen vacancies) in the TiO 2 lattice.This is consistent with the possible roles of the Ti 3 and oxygen vacancies in the reduction of CO 2 .The oxygen vacancies existing on the surface of the photocatalyst introduced new adsorption sites to adsorb CO 2 .As mentioned in Section 3.2.1, the formation of Ti 3 enhanced the separation of electron-hole pairs of the photocatalysts and the generated electrons and holes participated in multiple reactions for the reduction of CO 2 by H 2 O vapor 23,50.Table 1 also shows that 2Cu4V-TiO 2 /PU exhibited the highest CO 2 reduction efficiency.The rates of CH 4 and CO production from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with 2Cu4V-TiO 2 /PU under visible light were 933 and 588 (lmol g A1 cat.h A1 ), respectively. Table 2 show the rates of production for products of the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by our synthesized material and other recently reported materials 17,51525354555657585960.In a previous study, UV irradiation was mostly used as the energy source to initiate the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The reductants, such as H 2 gas, and the electron donors, such as NaOH and KHCO 3 , were also used to enhance the CO 2 reduction efficiency or selectivity.Therefore, the real application of the studies for industrial reduction of CO 2 is limited, because of high energy consumption and safety issues.In contrast, our synthesized CuV-TiO 2 /PU materials showed a novel photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO 2 to produce CO and CH 4 , because only water vapor was used as the reductant and visible light as the energy source.Thus, our obtained results are expected to open a new era in the applications of photocatalysts for the reduction of CO 2 to produce valuable fuels."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "In this study, Cu and V co-doped CuV-TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts were synthesized for CO 2 conversion using visible light as the energy source and H 2 O vapor as a reductant to produce valuable fuels.", "context": "In this study, Cu and V co-doped CuV-TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts were synthesized for CO 2 conversion using visible light as the energy source and H 2 O vapor as a reductant to produce valuable fuels.Both Cu and V defected into the TiO 2 lattice, leading to the formation of Ti 3 and oxygen vacancies in the lattice.However, as the ionic radius of V 4 is closer to that of Ti 4 than is that of Cu 2 , V 4 was doped into the TiO 2 lattice more effectively than Cu 2 .The Ti 3 formed in the doped TiO 2 lattice created an intermediate band between the valence band and the conduction band of TiO 2 , which increased the electron-hole pair separation efficiency of TiO 2 and enhanced the light absorption by the metal-doped TiO 2 /PU.The oxygen vacancies existing on the surface of the photocatalyst induced new adsorption sites to adsorb CO 2 , and the generated electrons and holes reduced the adsorbed CO 2 with H 2 O vapor to produce CO and CH 4 .The 2Cu4V-TiO 2 /PU photocatalyst, with Cu/TiO 2 and V/TiO 2 ratios of 2 and 4 wt.,respectively, exhibited the highest rate of defection into the TiO 2 lattice, leading to the maximum formation of Ti 3 and oxygen vacancies with the highest reduction efficiency of the doped photocatalyst.The rates of CH 4 and CO production from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor by 2Cu4V-TiO 2 /PU under visible light were 933 and 588 lmol g A1 cat.h A1 , respectively.The synthesized photocatalysts generated sufficient electrons and holes for the reduction of CO 2 .Therefore, CH 4 was selectively produced rather than CO.

The synthesized CuV-TiO 2 /PU photocatalysts were analyzed by a Thermo Fisher K-Alpha X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS) system.The obtained XPS spectra were fitted by Gaussian multipeak shapes to characterize the elemental states of copper, vanadium, and titanium in the synthesized photocatalysts.A Hitachi S4700 scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the surface morphology of the CuV-TiO 2 /PU, which was coated with Pt before SEM analysis to increase the conductivity of the photocatalyst surface.A JEOL TEM-2010F system was used to obtain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and highresolution TEM (HR-TEM) images of the synthesized CuV-TiO 2 /PU.The optical absorption ability of the shredded CuV-TiO 2 /PU photocatalyst was characterized by an Evolution 300 spectrophotometer (UV-1700 Shimadzu).X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the CuV-TiO 2 /PU were obtained using a Bruker AXN model equipped with a Cu Ka radiation (k 1.5418A) source and operated at a scan rate of 0.02s A1 over the 2h range 10-80. Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor was conducted by a continuous system comprising a gas generator, reaction chamber, and analyzer.The gas generator consisted of a cylinder of CO 2 gas (99.99), flow rate meters, and a humidifier.The reaction chamber was a dark cover cask (50 A 25 A 50 cm) containing two white light bulbs (EFTR 20EX-D, Kumho Co., Ltd.) and a reactor (15 A 4 A 2 cm), the top and bottom parts of which were made of quartz to allow easy passage of visible light (400 k 700 nm).The reactor was placed in the center of the reaction chamber.Two 20 W white bulbs were placed at the top and the bottom of the reaction chamber to generate visible light in the range 400-700 nm with a power density of 0.05 W/cm 2 for the photocatalysis.The dark and visible light conditions for photocatalysis were achieved by turning the bulbs off and on, respectively.Before the photocatalytic conversion experiments, the reactor containing 2 g (36 cm 3 ) of the synthesized porous CuV-TiO 2 /PU was purged three times with high-purity CO 2 gas.Then 50 mL/min CO 2 that had been passed through water (303 K) was admitted to the reactor.Thus, the residence time of CO 2 in the reactor was 144 s and the space velocity, calculated by dividing the volumetric flow by the reactor volume, was 25 h A1 .The reactor temperature was constant at 32 C during the conversion experiments.To determine gaseous products, a 100 lL sample was automatically injected into the GC system, which consisted of a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a methanizer and a flame ionization detector using a packed column (Porapak Q 80/100 2 A 2 mm) at intervals of 20 min.The reaction start time (t 0 0) was assumed to be the time when the CO 2 gas stream containing H 2 O was admitted to the reactor.The production rate was calculated based on the total weight of synthesized catalyst (2 g)."}]}}
