CdSegraphene and CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 with different magnification.From the Fig. 3(a) to (b), CdSe particles and TiO 2 particles were roughly dispersed and these particles highly grow on the surface graphene.From Fig. 3(c-d), it depicted that spherical-shaped CdSe particles are anchored on the graphene surface.The plate-like structure of graphene shows the existence of oxygen functionalities on the surface of graphene.Owing to a Van der Waals interaction, graphene sheets turn to graphitic structure therefore the attachment of nanoparticles on the graphene sheets is helpful to overcome these interactions. 54)Fig. 3(e-f) displays the CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 nanocomposites which clearly exhibits the difference point of the binary and ternary materials.After combination of TiO 2 , the brighter spot arises in the ternary composite shown that the CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 particles were successful and of proper distribution pattern.TEM images were taken for furthermore analysis and pro- vide the clear morphology and shape of the CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 nanocomposites.Fig. 4(a) and (b) shows the different magnification of the CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 nanocomposites.From the Fig. 4(a-b), it clearly seen that the spherical CdSe were existed with dark in color and highly agglomerated structure is anchored onto the surface of the graphene sheets.On the other hand, graphene nanosheets covered with TiO 2 particles attached unevenly to the surface of graphene sheets and almost in the circular form.The average size of the TiO 2 particles approximately is 6 to 10 nm.During ultrasonic assisted synthesis of CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 , graphene sheet is prevented with partial agglomeration and TiO 2 nanoparticles are remain on the CdSe nanosheets and graphene. 55)he chemical states of the components elements of the CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 nanocomposites were analyzed by XPS.Fig. 5(a This consequence shows that some partial oxygen functional groups contain in studied nanocomposites. 56)Fig. 5(c) shows the O 1s peak located at 532.5 eV assigned to C-O and CO groups.After the heat treatment, the O 1s region may be overlapped by other chemical species peaks. 57,58)The present of C-OH group can be proven by a peak at 534.7 eV. 57) Further the Raman spectroscopy used for the study of structural properties of the CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 .Fig. 6 pro-vides detail about GO and nanocomposites.It has observed that the peak around the 220 cm -1 waves can be assigned CdSe phase. 61,62)The peaks around to 200 cm -1 to 300 cm -1 and 410 cm -1 show the presence of the Se 0 and anatase TiO 2 . 63,64)The characteristic D band appears at 1354 cm -1 and G bands appear at 1590 cm -1 , which are corresponding to the vibration of carbon atoms in disorder or defect sites and in plane vibration of sp 2 and sp 3 bonded carbon atoms, respectively. 65)The nature of the defects can be determined from the intensity ratio of the corresponding D to G band.Moreover, the calculated I D /I G was found to be 1.07 eV.The intensity ratio I D /I G ratio helps to evaluate the defects of CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 samples where a higher ratio Shown more defects. Figure 7(a-b) shows the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of CdSe, TiO 2 and CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 .As shown in Fig. 7, an increase of absorbance toward the visible region 550 nm was observed with the ternary compound.And, it clearly shows the homogenous distribution of the nanoparticles with increase of the absorbance.After the anchoring of CdSe on graphene, the absorption region shifts to the visible light region. 66)From Fig. 8(a-b), shown that after the synthesis of a composite (TiO 2 and CdSe-TiO 2 ) with graphene, a threshold wavelength was extended to 405 and 797 nm and band gap energies were 3.4 and 2.6 eV estimated by using the Kubelka-Munk theory, respectively. 67,68)The reason of the variation of band gap energies of as-prepared composites may possibly be introduction of CdSe and TiO 2 particles on the graphene sheet surface or partial agglomeration, which may affect the optical property of nanocomposites. 69,70)he decreasing Eg of the CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 nanocomposite can be attributed to both the inherent light absorption capacity of carbon materials and the electron transitions between carbon of graphene and metal oxide (CdSe and TiO 2 ) phase. 71,72)he photocatalytic capacity of the as-synthesized CdSegraphene-TiO 2 material was tested by surveying the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 under UV-visible and visible light Further for conformation chromic acid test result, CdSegraphene-TiO 2 were also evaluated by gas-chromatography (GC).Photocatalytic reaction time is up to 48 h and, after 12 h, liquid product is manually taken for GC analysis.A series of test were conducted for the confirmation of CH 3 OH, 1 st control experiment was conducted in dark with catalysts, and 2 nd experiment was conducted under light radiation but no catalysts, both results shown no CH 3 OH were detected.These control experiments show that both irradiation and light catalysts are important factors for the uptake of CO 2 for CH 3 OH formation.The photocatalytic efficiency of the CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 composites with different time interval was evaluated in term of photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH under visible and UV light irradiation.Fig. 10(a-b) shows the effect of methanol yield.The results show that the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 under UV light were found to be higher than that visible light.The methanol yield for CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 (12 h), CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 (24 h), CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 (36 h) and CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 (28 h) under visible light are 0.12, 0.44, 0.49 and 0.69 molg -1 h -1 , and methanol yield for CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 (12 h), CdSegraphene-TiO 2 (24 h), CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 (36 h) and CdSegraphene-TiO 2 (48 h) under UV light are 0.36, 0.54,0.71and 1.12 molg -1 h -1 , respectively.Graphene oxide plays the role of an electron acceptor, photosensitizer, and the adsorbent to efficiently enhance the photodegradation of organic dyes. The presence of the high density of oxygen-containing functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups, epoxy, and carboxyl at the edge or on the large surface area of graphene oxide provides the more space for ionic/electro interaction between dye molecules and the aromatic rings of graphene oxide sheets, and from that, the better absorptivity can be achieved. 73747576"}, {"llm generation": "UV-Vis", "source": "The samples were tested under UV-visible and visible light irradiation to convert CO 2 to CH 3 OH, the experimental results shown excellent light Fig. 1.XRD pattern of CdSe, graphene-TiO 2 and CdSegraphene-TiO 2 .", "context": "In conclusion, we profitably prepared CdSe-graphene-TiO 2 nanocomposites by facial ultrasonic method.SEM and TEM results indicated that the TiO 2 particles were uniformly dispersed on the surface graphene sheets supported by CdSe, TiO 2 and CdSe-TiO 2 are in anatase structure with size approximately 6 to 10 nm.The samples were tested under UV-visible and visible light irradiation to convert CO 2 to CH 3 OH, the experimental results shown excellent light Fig. 1.XRD pattern of CdSe, graphene-TiO 2 and CdSegraphene-TiO 2 .
