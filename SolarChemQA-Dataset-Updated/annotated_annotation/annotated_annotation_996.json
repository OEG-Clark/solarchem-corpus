Where L is the particle size, is the wavelength of X-ray radiation (1.5406 A), is the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the peak (in radians) and 2 is the Bragg angle.The shape and structure of the nanomaterial surface were examined at high-resolution using SEM (JSM-5600 JEOL, Japan).The chemical composition was analyzed using an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis incorporated into the SEM.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi HT7700, operated at 100 kV) was used to evaluate the morphologies of the samples.The high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images of the samples were obtained using a (Hitachi H9500) operated at 300 kV.The surface composition was studied based on the X-ray photoelectron spectra (KRATOS AXIS SUPRA) with a monochromatized Al Ka X-ray source (10 kV, 1500 W, pass energy 40 eV). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) analysis was conducted using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-2600) ranging from 200 to 800 nm.The band-gap energies of the photocatalysts were calculated through the application of a modified Kubelka-Munk function obtained from UV-vis DRS data.A Raman spectroscopy was performed using a Confocal-Raman imaging system with a 633 nm excitation laser (Renishaw in Via Reflex).Additionally, the photoelectrochemical analysis was executed using a self-made photo-electrochemical system installed a 250-W halogen lamp as the irradiation-source.The chemical bonds vibration and functional group of the product was confirmed by FTIR spectrometer (FTIR iS5, Thermoscience).The photo-current measurement was conducted by a computer-controlled Versa-STAT-3 electro-chemical analyzer.The photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) was carried out at RT in a conventional PL system.The ND 10 filter united 514 nm laser was utilized as the excitation source and measurement range was noted at the 530-1000 nm region. In terms of the main research field, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction was performed in a reactor (composed of three part). To take a precise amount (100 mg) of asprepared photocatalysts (CuCaAg2Se-Graphene-TiO2) and different amount of sodium sulfite (as a sacrificial scavenger) was dissolved in 50 ml DI water (0.04 M, containing sodium bicarbonate) and agitated continuously for 1 h.Then, a high purity carbon dioxide (CO2) gas was purged to the reactor for 30 min, after the solution was agitated and the visible light turned on via a metal halide lamp (500 W, SOLAREDGE700, Perfect Light, China).The distance between the light source and the photocatalyst was constantly at 10 cm, and a heat sink was stocked on the left-side of chamber to dismiss the lamp-heat.And the reaction time carried on continuously for up to 48 h whereby the reactor was cool down congenitally for methanol (CH3OH) desorption from the catalyst after every 12 h.The different amounts (10, 20, and 30 ml) of the samples were withdrawn from the suspension at intervals of 12 h during the light irradiation using a syringe and a membrane filter.Subsequently, the reaction product was analyzed through the \"Quantitative analysis of alcohol\" method.In the \"Quantitative analysis of alcohol,\" 0.1 M CrO3 was added to the 10 ml sample and agitated for 15 min. The sample was then centrifuged (10.000 ppm/15 min) and its concentration peak was found using a UV spectrophotometer (Optizen POP, Korea).The chemical bonds vibration and functional group of the product was confirmed by FTIR spectrometer (FTIR iS5, Thermoscience).All samples were measured by the ATR (Attenuated total-reflection) method and a diamond crystal was used.The data of transmittance was obtained at the 3800 cm -1 to 400 cm -1 wavenumber range. Figure 1 shows the XRD result of as-synthesized CCAS-G-TiO2, G-TiO2 and pure CCAS (after). Published on 14 August 2020.Downloaded on 8/25/2020 1:54:51 AM.The XRD result basically shows the characteristic of CCAS-G-TiO2, G-TiO2 and pure CCAS. After calcination, the XRD peaks intensity of CCAS nanocomposites was increased and the diffraction peaks had become sharp, and it was shown that the temperature intensified atomic-mobility and grain growth after that which was observed as a decent crystallinity.The full-width half maximum amount of the X-ray diffraction pattern decreased, while the average crystallite-size became bigger, that is the reason that the CCAS nanocomposite exhibited a decent crystallinity and large crystallite size (as shown in Figure S1a).The entire diffraction peak confirmed the orthorhombic crystal phase with lattice parameters a4.1050A, b4.0700A, c6.3100A of CCAS nanocomposite (Card No 96-9008070).In addition, the peaks were located at 2 of 23.040, 26.840, 31.060,36.180,40.160, 45.200 and 57.980, which were assigned to the (002), ( 110), ( 102), ( 112), ( 013), ( 031) and ( 230) crystal plane and corresponded to the crystal phase with lattice parameter of a 4.3359 A, b 7.0700 A, c 7.7740 A of Ag2Se (JCPDS No.24-1041).With the conclusion of G-TiO2 nanocomposite, it is noted that the XRD pattern showed the similar peaks of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No.21-1272), and the characteristic peak of graphene (002) was not shown due to less quantity and peak intensity was low (as shown in Figure S1b).And the index facet of (101) was exhibited in XRD pattern of G-TiO2.In the case of anatase TiO2, the index facet of (101), ( 010) and (001) exhibit a different catalytic activity 18. After this, it was noted that the CCAS combined with G-TiO2, whereby the most characteristic peak of two nanocomposites were overlapped.Herein, this might be due to the consolidation between CCAS and G-TiO2.The crystallite sizes of CCAS (before and after calcination) and TiO2 were calculated using the Debye-Scherrer equation and were found to be 46.16nm, 54.38 nm, and 43.33 nm, individually.The crystallites size of pure Ag2Se was noted as 35 nm 19.After being unified with copper and calcium and treated with a heat treatment process, the crystallites size of the CCAS nanocomposite was increased. The surface morphology structure was shown to have appeared via SEM and TEM, in The before and after muffle-calcination of pure (CuCaAg2Se) quaternary nanocomposite result shown in Figure S2 (a)-(d).Before calcination, the pure quaternary nanoparticles showed various structures, such as resembling the shapes of a sphere and a wrinkle.After calcination, the particle structure showed it was most resembled to a plate structure, which meant that, in high temperature nanoparticles grow to slightly larger size and were characteristic in formulating the aggregation.nanocomposite morphology analysis.The TiO2 particle regularly dispersed on the graphene-surface, whereby it is plainly exhibited with the polygonal plates and small spherical shape structure.After, the G-TiO2 combining with quaternary nanocomposite, both of nanocomposites deposited on the graphene exterior, in addition to that, the graphene is shown to act as a bridge and acceptor, which is helpful an increasing the path of photogenerated electrons, and is another way towards improving the photocatalytic efficiency.The graphene was shown as a sheet-like structure that was divided in various directions.This structure indicates the being on a graphene surface has oxygen functionalities.In this result, we can realize the disparity of the binary and ternary-composite material.The pure quaternary nanocomposite showed various sphere-structure, as shown in Figure 2 (d).The round and pentagonalshaped TiO2 was occurred as dark-colored and it was successfully dispersed onto the graphene exterior, which was confirmed by a dark-grey colored graphene surrounded the TiO2 as shown in Figure 2 (e). The TiO2 was slightly agglomerated due to an oxygen-containing functional group of graphene that can prevent the metal-oxide agglomeration.The quaternary CuCaAg2Se and TiO2 were scattered onto the graphene, as shown in Figure 2 (f).The round-shaped quaternary nanocomposite was obtained at the black-dot, and the CCAS was slightly agglomerated compared with TiO2 and spread onto the surface of graphene which obtained as a dark-grey colored.Furthermore, the graphene obtained like double-layer-structure and all nanoparticle were shown to be uniformly spread and strongly attached onto the exterior during the muffle-assisted hydrothermal method. The atomic structure and information of crystallographic structure of nanocomposite was analyzed via HRTEM.Figure 3 (a) and (c) indicated the lattice space of TiO2.The spacing values can be 0.350 and 0.357 nm which corresponds to the (101) crystal planes in unary and ternary nanocomposites.The lattice fringes with di-spacing of CuCaAg2Se was 0.235 nm which corresponding to the (102) crystal planes, as shown in Figure 3 (b).Figure 3 (d-f) shows the inter-active 3D surface-plot of TiO2, Graphene and CCAS.From this result, the roughness state of each nanoparticle can be analyzed.The roughness states of the quaternary nanoparticle were normal, and another two nanoparticles states were shown to be uneven, which was the same as the sunken and convex result.The particle size histograms of TiO2 and CCAS nanoparticles at different filtered sizes are shown in Figure 3 (g-h).To get the relation of the energy (E g ) and optical absorption, according to the, the absorption spectra can be analyzed by using (Eq.( 2)) equation 27: where hv hc/ is the energy of the incident photon, (UVA, 315-400 nm, UVB, 280-315 nm, and UVC, 180-280 nm) 28.After the quaternary chalcogenide (CuCaAg2Se) united with Graphene-TiO2, the light absorption range was changed to 441.48 nm.The reason is: the conglomeration can act on the light-absorption performance resulting to modify the bandgap.Figure 6 (a) shows the bandgap of CCAS, G-TiO2 and CCAS-G-TiO2, which was expected to be 2.76, 2.97 and 2.79 eV, respectively.The pure CuCaAg2Se quaternary nanocomposite, G-TiO2 binary and CuCaAg2Se-G-TiO2 ternary nanocomposite showed the lower bandgap condition existed rather than a pure anatase TiO2, which can show a high catalytic activity and can be able to practice application.Furthermore, the ternary CuCaAg2Se-G-TiO2 nanocomposite can be able to generate more electron-hole pairs under the UV/Vis-light which can exhibit high catalytic efficiency.CuCaAg2Se was slightly decreased after two on-off cycle (Fig. S5a).The current state of G-TiO2 was stable during a four-on-off cycles which can confirm the binary nanocomposite showed fluent current capability.In the case of ternary CuCaAg2Se-Graphene-TiO2 composite, the photo-current state was obviously amplified after four on-off cycle tests (Fig. S5b).The photocurrent state of G-TiO2 was 3.9010 -6 A. The photocurrent-time (I-t) curves of quaternary nanocomposite expose the high-separation capacity for charge-carrier under the light illumination and photocurrent state was 5.4510 -6 .In the case of ternary nanocomposite, the photo-current state was almost reached to the quaternary nanocomposite state.It is shown that it can improve the catalytic activity, after being combined with Graphene-TiO2 to make a ternary composite.This hypothesis approved in characterization of UV-vis DRS analysis; the band-gap energy of CCAS was 2.76 eV, G-TiO2 was and 607.41 cm -1 shift region, as shown in Figure 7 (b).All occurred peaks are assigned to the TiO2. In the case of binary composite, there is no peak (D and G-peak) of graphene due to the low concentration of graphene.The TiO2 had three different phases: anatase, rutile and brookite.The asprepared TiO2 was corresponded to the anatase phase.The anatase TiO2 had four Raman band at 100-700 cm -1 shift region 30,31, such as Eg mode at 144, 183 cm -1 region and 639, 629 cm -1 , B1g mode at 399, 382 cm -1 , the last one is A1g mode at the 520 cm -1 region.The first intense and sharp peak assigned to the (left side) Eg mode which obtained at the 149.92 cm -1 shift region.The other (right side) Eg mode was obtained at 607.41 cm -1 and the peak intensity was shown to be low and broad.The Eg mode is an asymmetric bend of O-Ti-O bond on the (001) crystal plane, and this peak was commonly obtained in the Raman spectra of TiO2. In the center of Figure 7b, other Raman modes were observed.The asymmetric bend of O-Ti-O bond on the (001), ( 110) and ( 101) crystal planes of TiO2 was corresponded to the B1g mode and this peak was obtained at 408.75 cm -1 .Furthermore, the weak and broad peak was observed at 254.51 cm -1 shift region which renamed by SEO mode and the peak is shown to belong to the motion of atoms.Figure 7 (c) shows the Raman spectra of ternary composite (CCAS-G-TiO2) which included four peaks.In 142.99 and 591.34 cm -1 shift regions, these two weak and broad peaks were obtained, and those peaks are belonging to the Eg mode peak of TiO2.The peak position was shifted to the left side due to the structural characteristic and asymmetric bend of O-Ti-O bond of TiO2 was changed which graphene-TiO2 joined with quaternary nanocomposite.There were another two peaks which were assigned to the Raman band of quaternary nanocomposite at 100-700 cm -1 shift region.The characteristic peak position of quaternary composite was overlapped with the peak of TiO2 at 200-600 cm -1 .The pure silver selenide had four characteristic peaks at 200-840 cm -1 shift region 32. Copper and copper oxide had three Raman peaks at 295 cm -1 , 342 cm -1 , 628 cm -1 shift regions 33. The combination of Ag2Se with Cu and Ca, the structural property of each part was changed, and the Raman peaks were indicated at 274.55, 388.35 and 591.34 cm -1 .All peak position was shifted to the (left side) red shift, which means that the peak belongs at the low Raman shift side.In Raman spectra, the shifting of peaks towards lower or higher-wavenumber is related to the chemical bond and symmetry of molecules were changed in quaternary nanocomposite and Graphene-TiO2. Metal oxygen and functional group in the composites were confirmed by FTIR spectra.The FTIR spectra of the synthesized nanocomposites are show in Figure 8.The result is attributed to the vibrational modes of citric acid molecule 34.Moreover, the other appearance bands confirmed the evidence of successful chemical bonding state of CuCaAg2Se.More specifically, 710.07 cm -1 corresponding to Se-O, Se-Se vibration 35.Additionally, the Graphene exhibited the C-H stretching at 2989.15 cm -1 , C-OH stretching at and 1213.63 cm -1 , and C-O stretching at and 1074.41 cm -1 , implying the vibration of hydroxyl group and carboxyl group of Graphene 36.The strong absorption band at 1575.49cm -1 is corresponding to the Ti-O-Ti bond in TiO2.All functional groups confirmed the strong chemical formation of Graphene and TiO2.After quaternary nanocomposite (CuCaAg2Se) combined with G-TiO2 via muffle-assisted hydrothermal method.The peak intensity and position were changed, indicating the formation of due to formation of CuCaAg2Se-G-TiO2 bonding. Recently, some of research papers with Ag2Se-based nanocomposites for the CO2 reduction have not been published.There are several silver doped or silver-based photocatalyst for the CO2 reduction such as Ag-Cu2O core-shell nanoparticles 37, Ag3PO4 38, novel Ag/Ag2WO4/ZnWO4 39 heterojunctions.Generally, Ag2Se and Ag2Se-graphene nanocomposite were used in solar cells, sensor, and conductor due to high chemical and optical properties.Some of techniques were applied to the fabrication of silver selenide nanostructures include combination of the precursors at high temperatures 40, hydrothermal method, microwave 41, and molecular precursor methods 42.In our research study, the nanocomposite was synthesized by muffle-assisted hydrothermal method which is afforded to obtaining a decent crystallinity and the polymer precursor solution was prepared by Pechini method based on metallic citrate polymerization using ethylene glycol C2H6O2 (Merck) and citric acid C6H8O7 (Merck) as chelate cation.The surface and morphology structure of pure Ag2Se is spherical type and diameter of particles were around 5-10 nm.The Ag2Se-rGO possesses good conductivity and considerably low charge transfer resistance (Rct) due to the high synergistic effect, which can confirm that silver chalcogenide with graphene nanocomposite exhibit a high catalytic activity.The Ag2Se-rGO possesses good conductivity and considerably low charge transfer resistance (Rct) due to the high synergistic effect, which can confirm that silver chalcogenide with graphene nanocomposite exhibit a high catalytic activity. Figure 9 shows the result of the \"Quantitative analysis of alcohol\" which used an as-synthesized ternary composite for using a different amount of scavenger.Besides, to investigate the role of ternary nanocomposite, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process was carried out for a unary and binary nanocomposites, such as TiO2, CuCaAg2Se, G-TiO2. Published on 14 August 2020.Downloaded on 8/25/2020 1:54:51 AM. to 48 hours. To analyze the consequence of \"Quantitative Analysis of Alcohol,\" the ternary composite showed a good catalytic activity and reduction performance for CO2 into methanol (CH3OH) with using various amount of scavenger.Sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) was applied as the scavenger since it is a great efficient electron provider and cycling electron donor, to combine the Carbon dioxide (CO2) compound to photo-reduction with water to enhance all potency.In addition, the scavenger boosts the photo-catalytic activity of graphene-based ternary composite in CO2 reduction.Under the UVlight irradiation, the final product quota was high with using a high amount of scavenger.Moreover, with using a 0.3g and 0.6g scavenger affects was not high. In the practical application of a reusable state, the reproducibility and sturdiness of a photocatalyst never be dismissed.In the cycling test, the photocatalyst (CCAS-G-TiO2) was recycled for 9 times (432 h) under UV/Vis-light irradiation with scavenger (0.3 g) in CO2 reduction.As can be seen in Figure 10, The first intermediate product (formic acid) and final product consisted of hydroxyl group (O-H), carbonyl group (CO), alcohol group (C-O-H), methyl group (CH3-deformation) and the peak appeared at the exact wavenumber region which can confirm the state of each product.Table 1 summarized the results of each obtained peak position with the theoretical key data.The position of hydroxyl and carbonyl group was noted as the same.The intensity and position of C-H in (CH3)deformation was different in methanol as compared with Formic acid.In addition, the FTIR result of the final product was compared with the result of commercial methanol.Each peak position was overlapped, and it can prove that photocatalyst material can convert the CO2 into a methanol. Figure 12 shows the morphology and crystal structure of photocatalyst after UV/Vis-light irradiation which analyzed via SEM and XRD.After the experiment, it was possible to collect the photocatalyst, and it was rinsed with DI-water and dried at 100 C.The morphology structure of the photocatalyst was clear and each peak position is noted as the same as a fresh photocatalyst in SEM and XRD.The total result showed no apparent retrogression as compared to the pure-photocatalyst which can prove the high stability and reusability of this material. For the suggested photocatalytic reduction mechanism, the light (photon) interacts onto the exterior of TiO2 absorbing the energy.When the light energy (Ev) is equal or greater than the bandgap energy (Eg) of semiconductor, then the electron can be excited from the VB to CB creating an electron-hole pair.During a reaction, an excited electron and hole move to the semiconductorexterior.Nevertheless, the absence of a co-catalyst, or an insufficient active site determines that the electron-hole recombines very quickly on the semiconductor-surface and shows that the catalyticefficiency was modified.During a photocatalytic reaction, the role of graphene is an electron acceptor/transporter, whereby this presents the most important part of the partition of electron-hole transport.The oxygen-function of graphene were bonded by un-paired -electrons with Ti-atoms on the exterior of TiO2, which affecting the band-gap of graphene-TiO2 nanocomposites.The photocatalytic activity can be further enhanced through the contributions of a junction/interaction between the co-catalyst and the semiconductor to increase the electron-hole partition or charge transport.In the heterogeneous system, the performance of the co-catalyst acts as an electron-trap to Equations ( 1) to (4) describe the reaction mechanism of CuCaAg2Se, TiO2, and graphene and define the production of the photoexcited electron-hole pair.The subsequent reactions (equations 6 to 9) shows the oxidation and reduction processes, where holes are used for oxidation, while the electrons are used for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.In the reduction mechanism, the generated electron reacts with the dissolved oxygen to produce the oxygen peroxide radicals.The positive holes are assimilated in water, resulting in the production of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and hydrogen ions (h ), which then react with the excited electrons, managing the configuration of H, while CO2 concurrently reacts with the excited electron and 2 -forms 2 - , which is finally commuted to CH3OH. In summary, the graphene-based ternary composite containing quaternary nanocomposite (CuCaAg2Se) was successfully synthesized via the use of a muffle-consisted hydrothermal technique, and the photo-catalytic activity was analyzed for CO2 reduction using a various amount of scavenger. The average crystallite size of CuCaAg2Se (before and after calcination) and TiO2 were 46.16, 54.38 and 43.33 nm, respectively.The TEM image suggested that quaternary nanocomposite and TiO2 spread onto the exterior of graphene surface and the Raman and XPS characterization showed the strong chemical interaction among all particles.The photo-catalytic performance of ternary composite was analyzed for CO2 reduction under the UV/Vis-light irradiation.The final product quota was 12.68 and 16.84 under the Vis and UV-light after 48 h when using a 0.6 g scavenger. Besides, the reusability of a photocatalyst was checked and it was reported the photocatalyst could support activity.The role of the scavenger was to have provided the electron and cycling electron Published on 14 August 2020.Downloaded on 8/25/2020 1:54:51 AM.

The main functional group was obtained in the exact wavelength region.Furthermore, we compared the FTIR result of the final methanol with commercial methanol.Each peak position was overlapped, and it can prove that the photocatalyst material can convert the CO2 into a methanol.In this work, the quaternary composite loaded graphene-based photo-catalyst was used to support the benefits of heterogeneous system and developed the production rate of final product (CH3OH).

Where L is the particle size, is the wavelength of X-ray radiation (1.5406 A), is the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the peak (in radians) and 2 is the Bragg angle.The shape and structure of the nanomaterial surface were examined at high-resolution using SEM (JSM-5600 JEOL, Japan).The chemical composition was analyzed using an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis incorporated into the SEM.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi HT7700, operated at 100 kV) was used to evaluate the morphologies of the samples.The high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images of the samples were obtained using a (Hitachi H9500) operated at 300 kV.The surface composition was studied based on the X-ray photoelectron spectra (KRATOS AXIS SUPRA) with a monochromatized Al Ka X-ray source (10 kV, 1500 W, pass energy 40 eV). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) analysis was conducted using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-2600) ranging from 200 to 800 nm.The band-gap energies of the photocatalysts were calculated through the application of a modified Kubelka-Munk function obtained from UV-vis DRS data.A Raman spectroscopy was performed using a Confocal-Raman imaging system with a 633 nm excitation laser (Renishaw in Via Reflex).Additionally, the photoelectrochemical analysis was executed using a self-made photo-electrochemical system installed a 250-W halogen lamp as the irradiation-source.The chemical bonds vibration and functional group of the product was confirmed by FTIR spectrometer (FTIR iS5, Thermoscience).The photo-current measurement was conducted by a computer-controlled Versa-STAT-3 electro-chemical analyzer.The photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) was carried out at RT in a conventional PL system.The ND 10 filter united 514 nm laser was utilized as the excitation source and measurement range was noted at the 530-1000 nm region. In terms of the main research field, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction was performed in a reactor (composed of three part). To take a precise amount (100 mg) of asprepared photocatalysts (CuCaAg2Se-Graphene-TiO2) and different amount of sodium sulfite (as a sacrificial scavenger) was dissolved in 50 ml DI water (0.04 M, containing sodium bicarbonate) and agitated continuously for 1 h.Then, a high purity carbon dioxide (CO2) gas was purged to the reactor for 30 min, after the solution was agitated and the visible light turned on via a metal halide lamp (500 W, SOLAREDGE700, Perfect Light, China).The distance between the light source and the photocatalyst was constantly at 10 cm, and a heat sink was stocked on the left-side of chamber to dismiss the lamp-heat.And the reaction time carried on continuously for up to 48 h whereby the reactor was cool down congenitally for methanol (CH3OH) desorption from the catalyst after every 12 h.The different amounts (10, 20, and 30 ml) of the samples were withdrawn from the suspension at intervals of 12 h during the light irradiation using a syringe and a membrane filter.Subsequently, the reaction product was analyzed through the \"Quantitative analysis of alcohol\" method.In the \"Quantitative analysis of alcohol,\" 0.1 M CrO3 was added to the 10 ml sample and agitated for 15 min. The sample was then centrifuged (10.000 ppm/15 min) and its concentration peak was found using a UV spectrophotometer (Optizen POP, Korea).The chemical bonds vibration and functional group of the product was confirmed by FTIR spectrometer (FTIR iS5, Thermoscience).All samples were measured by the ATR (Attenuated total-reflection) method and a diamond crystal was used.The data of transmittance was obtained at the 3800 cm -1 to 400 cm -1 wavenumber range. Figure 1 shows the XRD result of as-synthesized CCAS-G-TiO2, G-TiO2 and pure CCAS (after). Published on 14 August 2020.Downloaded on 8/25/2020 1:54:51 AM.The XRD result basically shows the characteristic of CCAS-G-TiO2, G-TiO2 and pure CCAS. After calcination, the XRD peaks intensity of CCAS nanocomposites was increased and the diffraction peaks had become sharp, and it was shown that the temperature intensified atomic-mobility and grain growth after that which was observed as a decent crystallinity.The full-width half maximum amount of the X-ray diffraction pattern decreased, while the average crystallite-size became bigger, that is the reason that the CCAS nanocomposite exhibited a decent crystallinity and large crystallite size (as shown in Figure S1a).The entire diffraction peak confirmed the orthorhombic crystal phase with lattice parameters a4.1050A, b4.0700A, c6.3100A of CCAS nanocomposite (Card No 96-9008070).In addition, the peaks were located at 2 of 23.040, 26.840, 31.060,36.180,40.160, 45.200 and 57.980, which were assigned to the (002), ( 110), ( 102), ( 112), ( 013), ( 031) and ( 230) crystal plane and corresponded to the crystal phase with lattice parameter of a 4.3359 A, b 7.0700 A, c 7.7740 A of Ag2Se (JCPDS No.24-1041).With the conclusion of G-TiO2 nanocomposite, it is noted that the XRD pattern showed the similar peaks of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No.21-1272), and the characteristic peak of graphene (002) was not shown due to less quantity and peak intensity was low (as shown in Figure S1b).And the index facet of (101) was exhibited in XRD pattern of G-TiO2.In the case of anatase TiO2, the index facet of (101), ( 010) and (001) exhibit a different catalytic activity 18. After this, it was noted that the CCAS combined with G-TiO2, whereby the most characteristic peak of two nanocomposites were overlapped.Herein, this might be due to the consolidation between CCAS and G-TiO2.The crystallite sizes of CCAS (before and after calcination) and TiO2 were calculated using the Debye-Scherrer equation and were found to be 46.16nm, 54.38 nm, and 43.33 nm, individually.The crystallites size of pure Ag2Se was noted as 35 nm 19.After being unified with copper and calcium and treated with a heat treatment process, the crystallites size of the CCAS nanocomposite was increased. The surface morphology structure was shown to have appeared via SEM and TEM, in The before and after muffle-calcination of pure (CuCaAg2Se) quaternary nanocomposite result shown in Figure S2 (a)-(d).Before calcination, the pure quaternary nanoparticles showed various structures, such as resembling the shapes of a sphere and a wrinkle.After calcination, the particle structure showed it was most resembled to a plate structure, which meant that, in high temperature nanoparticles grow to slightly larger size and were characteristic in formulating the aggregation.nanocomposite morphology analysis.The TiO2 particle regularly dispersed on the graphene-surface, whereby it is plainly exhibited with the polygonal plates and small spherical shape structure.After, the G-TiO2 combining with quaternary nanocomposite, both of nanocomposites deposited on the graphene exterior, in addition to that, the graphene is shown to act as a bridge and acceptor, which is helpful an increasing the path of photogenerated electrons, and is another way towards improving the photocatalytic efficiency.The graphene was shown as a sheet-like structure that was divided in various directions.This structure indicates the being on a graphene surface has oxygen functionalities.In this result, we can realize the disparity of the binary and ternary-composite material.The pure quaternary nanocomposite showed various sphere-structure, as shown in Figure 2 (d).The round and pentagonalshaped TiO2 was occurred as dark-colored and it was successfully dispersed onto the graphene exterior, which was confirmed by a dark-grey colored graphene surrounded the TiO2 as shown in Figure 2 (e). The TiO2 was slightly agglomerated due to an oxygen-containing functional group of graphene that can prevent the metal-oxide agglomeration.The quaternary CuCaAg2Se and TiO2 were scattered onto the graphene, as shown in Figure 2 (f).The round-shaped quaternary nanocomposite was obtained at the black-dot, and the CCAS was slightly agglomerated compared with TiO2 and spread onto the surface of graphene which obtained as a dark-grey colored.Furthermore, the graphene obtained like double-layer-structure and all nanoparticle were shown to be uniformly spread and strongly attached onto the exterior during the muffle-assisted hydrothermal method. The atomic structure and information of crystallographic structure of nanocomposite was analyzed via HRTEM.Figure 3 (a) and (c) indicated the lattice space of TiO2.The spacing values can be 0.350 and 0.357 nm which corresponds to the (101) crystal planes in unary and ternary nanocomposites.The lattice fringes with di-spacing of CuCaAg2Se was 0.235 nm which corresponding to the (102) crystal planes, as shown in Figure 3 (b).Figure 3 (d-f) shows the inter-active 3D surface-plot of TiO2, Graphene and CCAS.From this result, the roughness state of each nanoparticle can be analyzed.The roughness states of the quaternary nanoparticle were normal, and another two nanoparticles states were shown to be uneven, which was the same as the sunken and convex result.The particle size histograms of TiO2 and CCAS nanoparticles at different filtered sizes are shown in Figure 3 (g-h).To get the relation of the energy (E g ) and optical absorption, according to the, the absorption spectra can be analyzed by using (Eq.( 2)) equation 27: where hv hc/ is the energy of the incident photon, (UVA, 315-400 nm, UVB, 280-315 nm, and UVC, 180-280 nm) 28.After the quaternary chalcogenide (CuCaAg2Se) united with Graphene-TiO2, the light absorption range was changed to 441.48 nm.The reason is: the conglomeration can act on the light-absorption performance resulting to modify the bandgap.Figure 6 (a) shows the bandgap of CCAS, G-TiO2 and CCAS-G-TiO2, which was expected to be 2.76, 2.97 and 2.79 eV, respectively.The pure CuCaAg2Se quaternary nanocomposite, G-TiO2 binary and CuCaAg2Se-G-TiO2 ternary nanocomposite showed the lower bandgap condition existed rather than a pure anatase TiO2, which can show a high catalytic activity and can be able to practice application.Furthermore, the ternary CuCaAg2Se-G-TiO2 nanocomposite can be able to generate more electron-hole pairs under the UV/Vis-light which can exhibit high catalytic efficiency.CuCaAg2Se was slightly decreased after two on-off cycle (Fig. S5a).The current state of G-TiO2 was stable during a four-on-off cycles which can confirm the binary nanocomposite showed fluent current capability.In the case of ternary CuCaAg2Se-Graphene-TiO2 composite, the photo-current state was obviously amplified after four on-off cycle tests (Fig. S5b).The photocurrent state of G-TiO2 was 3.9010 -6 A. The photocurrent-time (I-t) curves of quaternary nanocomposite expose the high-separation capacity for charge-carrier under the light illumination and photocurrent state was 5.4510 -6 .In the case of ternary nanocomposite, the photo-current state was almost reached to the quaternary nanocomposite state.It is shown that it can improve the catalytic activity, after being combined with Graphene-TiO2 to make a ternary composite.This hypothesis approved in characterization of UV-vis DRS analysis; the band-gap energy of CCAS was 2.76 eV, G-TiO2 was and 607.41 cm -1 shift region, as shown in Figure 7 (b).All occurred peaks are assigned to the TiO2. In the case of binary composite, there is no peak (D and G-peak) of graphene due to the low concentration of graphene.The TiO2 had three different phases: anatase, rutile and brookite.The asprepared TiO2 was corresponded to the anatase phase.The anatase TiO2 had four Raman band at 100-700 cm -1 shift region 30,31, such as Eg mode at 144, 183 cm -1 region and 639, 629 cm -1 , B1g mode at 399, 382 cm -1 , the last one is A1g mode at the 520 cm -1 region.The first intense and sharp peak assigned to the (left side) Eg mode which obtained at the 149.92 cm -1 shift region.The other (right side) Eg mode was obtained at 607.41 cm -1 and the peak intensity was shown to be low and broad.The Eg mode is an asymmetric bend of O-Ti-O bond on the (001) crystal plane, and this peak was commonly obtained in the Raman spectra of TiO2. In the center of Figure 7b, other Raman modes were observed.The asymmetric bend of O-Ti-O bond on the (001), ( 110) and ( 101) crystal planes of TiO2 was corresponded to the B1g mode and this peak was obtained at 408.75 cm -1 .Furthermore, the weak and broad peak was observed at 254.51 cm -1 shift region which renamed by SEO mode and the peak is shown to belong to the motion of atoms.Figure 7 (c) shows the Raman spectra of ternary composite (CCAS-G-TiO2) which included four peaks.In 142.99 and 591.34 cm -1 shift regions, these two weak and broad peaks were obtained, and those peaks are belonging to the Eg mode peak of TiO2.The peak position was shifted to the left side due to the structural characteristic and asymmetric bend of O-Ti-O bond of TiO2 was changed which graphene-TiO2 joined with quaternary nanocomposite.There were another two peaks which were assigned to the Raman band of quaternary nanocomposite at 100-700 cm -1 shift region.The characteristic peak position of quaternary composite was overlapped with the peak of TiO2 at 200-600 cm -1 .The pure silver selenide had four characteristic peaks at 200-840 cm -1 shift region 32. Copper and copper oxide had three Raman peaks at 295 cm -1 , 342 cm -1 , 628 cm -1 shift regions 33. The combination of Ag2Se with Cu and Ca, the structural property of each part was changed, and the Raman peaks were indicated at 274.55, 388.35 and 591.34 cm -1 .All peak position was shifted to the (left side) red shift, which means that the peak belongs at the low Raman shift side.In Raman spectra, the shifting of peaks towards lower or higher-wavenumber is related to the chemical bond and symmetry of molecules were changed in quaternary nanocomposite and Graphene-TiO2. Metal oxygen and functional group in the composites were confirmed by FTIR spectra.The FTIR spectra of the synthesized nanocomposites are show in Figure 8.The result is attributed to the vibrational modes of citric acid molecule 34.Moreover, the other appearance bands confirmed the evidence of successful chemical bonding state of CuCaAg2Se.More specifically, 710.07 cm -1 corresponding to Se-O, Se-Se vibration 35.Additionally, the Graphene exhibited the C-H stretching at 2989.15 cm -1 , C-OH stretching at and 1213.63 cm -1 , and C-O stretching at and 1074.41 cm -1 , implying the vibration of hydroxyl group and carboxyl group of Graphene 36.The strong absorption band at 1575.49cm -1 is corresponding to the Ti-O-Ti bond in TiO2.All functional groups confirmed the strong chemical formation of Graphene and TiO2.After quaternary nanocomposite (CuCaAg2Se) combined with G-TiO2 via muffle-assisted hydrothermal method.The peak intensity and position were changed, indicating the formation of due to formation of CuCaAg2Se-G-TiO2 bonding. Recently, some of research papers with Ag2Se-based nanocomposites for the CO2 reduction have not been published.There are several silver doped or silver-based photocatalyst for the CO2 reduction such as Ag-Cu2O core-shell nanoparticles 37, Ag3PO4 38, novel Ag/Ag2WO4/ZnWO4 39 heterojunctions.Generally, Ag2Se and Ag2Se-graphene nanocomposite were used in solar cells, sensor, and conductor due to high chemical and optical properties.Some of techniques were applied to the fabrication of silver selenide nanostructures include combination of the precursors at high temperatures 40, hydrothermal method, microwave 41, and molecular precursor methods 42.In our research study, the nanocomposite was synthesized by muffle-assisted hydrothermal method which is afforded to obtaining a decent crystallinity and the polymer precursor solution was prepared by Pechini method based on metallic citrate polymerization using ethylene glycol C2H6O2 (Merck) and citric acid C6H8O7 (Merck) as chelate cation.The surface and morphology structure of pure Ag2Se is spherical type and diameter of particles were around 5-10 nm.The Ag2Se-rGO possesses good conductivity and considerably low charge transfer resistance (Rct) due to the high synergistic effect, which can confirm that silver chalcogenide with graphene nanocomposite exhibit a high catalytic activity.The Ag2Se-rGO possesses good conductivity and considerably low charge transfer resistance (Rct) due to the high synergistic effect, which can confirm that silver chalcogenide with graphene nanocomposite exhibit a high catalytic activity. Figure 9 shows the result of the \"Quantitative analysis of alcohol\" which used an as-synthesized ternary composite for using a different amount of scavenger.Besides, to investigate the role of ternary nanocomposite, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process was carried out for a unary and binary nanocomposites, such as TiO2, CuCaAg2Se, G-TiO2. Published on 14 August 2020.Downloaded on 8/25/2020 1:54:51 AM. to 48 hours. To analyze the consequence of \"Quantitative Analysis of Alcohol,\" the ternary composite showed a good catalytic activity and reduction performance for CO2 into methanol (CH3OH) with using various amount of scavenger.Sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) was applied as the scavenger since it is a great efficient electron provider and cycling electron donor, to combine the Carbon dioxide (CO2) compound to photo-reduction with water to enhance all potency.In addition, the scavenger boosts the photo-catalytic activity of graphene-based ternary composite in CO2 reduction.Under the UVlight irradiation, the final product quota was high with using a high amount of scavenger.Moreover, with using a 0.3g and 0.6g scavenger affects was not high. In the practical application of a reusable state, the reproducibility and sturdiness of a photocatalyst never be dismissed.In the cycling test, the photocatalyst (CCAS-G-TiO2) was recycled for 9 times (432 h) under UV/Vis-light irradiation with scavenger (0.3 g) in CO2 reduction.As can be seen in Figure 10, The first intermediate product (formic acid) and final product consisted of hydroxyl group (O-H), carbonyl group (CO), alcohol group (C-O-H), methyl group (CH3-deformation) and the peak appeared at the exact wavenumber region which can confirm the state of each product.Table 1 summarized the results of each obtained peak position with the theoretical key data.The position of hydroxyl and carbonyl group was noted as the same.The intensity and position of C-H in (CH3)deformation was different in methanol as compared with Formic acid.In addition, the FTIR result of the final product was compared with the result of commercial methanol.Each peak position was overlapped, and it can prove that photocatalyst material can convert the CO2 into a methanol. Figure 12 shows the morphology and crystal structure of photocatalyst after UV/Vis-light irradiation which analyzed via SEM and XRD.After the experiment, it was possible to collect the photocatalyst, and it was rinsed with DI-water and dried at 100 C.The morphology structure of the photocatalyst was clear and each peak position is noted as the same as a fresh photocatalyst in SEM and XRD.The total result showed no apparent retrogression as compared to the pure-photocatalyst which can prove the high stability and reusability of this material. For the suggested photocatalytic reduction mechanism, the light (photon) interacts onto the exterior of TiO2 absorbing the energy.When the light energy (Ev) is equal or greater than the bandgap energy (Eg) of semiconductor, then the electron can be excited from the VB to CB creating an electron-hole pair.During a reaction, an excited electron and hole move to the semiconductorexterior.Nevertheless, the absence of a co-catalyst, or an insufficient active site determines that the electron-hole recombines very quickly on the semiconductor-surface and shows that the catalyticefficiency was modified.During a photocatalytic reaction, the role of graphene is an electron acceptor/transporter, whereby this presents the most important part of the partition of electron-hole transport.The oxygen-function of graphene were bonded by un-paired -electrons with Ti-atoms on the exterior of TiO2, which affecting the band-gap of graphene-TiO2 nanocomposites.The photocatalytic activity can be further enhanced through the contributions of a junction/interaction between the co-catalyst and the semiconductor to increase the electron-hole partition or charge transport.In the heterogeneous system, the performance of the co-catalyst acts as an electron-trap to Equations ( 1) to (4) describe the reaction mechanism of CuCaAg2Se, TiO2, and graphene and define the production of the photoexcited electron-hole pair.The subsequent reactions (equations 6 to 9) shows the oxidation and reduction processes, where holes are used for oxidation, while the electrons are used for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.In the reduction mechanism, the generated electron reacts with the dissolved oxygen to produce the oxygen peroxide radicals.The positive holes are assimilated in water, resulting in the production of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and hydrogen ions (h ), which then react with the excited electrons, managing the configuration of H, while CO2 concurrently reacts with the excited electron and 2 -forms 2 - , which is finally commuted to CH3OH. In summary, the graphene-based ternary composite containing quaternary nanocomposite (CuCaAg2Se) was successfully synthesized via the use of a muffle-consisted hydrothermal technique, and the photo-catalytic activity was analyzed for CO2 reduction using a various amount of scavenger. The average crystallite size of CuCaAg2Se (before and after calcination) and TiO2 were 46.16, 54.38 and 43.33 nm, respectively.The TEM image suggested that quaternary nanocomposite and TiO2 spread onto the exterior of graphene surface and the Raman and XPS characterization showed the strong chemical interaction among all particles.The photo-catalytic performance of ternary composite was analyzed for CO2 reduction under the UV/Vis-light irradiation.The final product quota was 12.68 and 16.84 under the Vis and UV-light after 48 h when using a 0.6 g scavenger. Besides, the reusability of a photocatalyst was checked and it was reported the photocatalyst could support activity.The role of the scavenger was to have provided the electron and cycling electron Published on 14 August 2020.Downloaded on 8/25/2020 1:54:51 AM.
