The CO 2 photoreduction reactions was carried out in a solid-gas system (CEL-SPH2N-D9, CeAulight, China) with circulating water filter to avert photothermal effect.2 mg sample was dispersed on a glass fiber film (25 mm, 0.22 m pore diameter).The light source was a W xenon arc lamp (Sirius-300P, Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd., China) using a 400 nm cutoff filter. 2 mL TEOA was used as sacrificial agent and the gas product was monitored by a gas chromatography (GC-9860, Luchuang Instrument, China), with the CO retention time at 1.3 min.

Besides, the Zr atomic percentage in UiO-66-NH 2 -MC derived from the XPS spectra is 4.31 , which is lower than that in pristine UiO-66-NH 2 (5.89 ), certifying the missing-cluster defect in the structure. For the sake of studying the thermal stability and verifying the defects of these five samples, TGA-DTG analysis was performed and the results are shown in Fig. S9.Throughout the analytical range of temperature, there are three main weight losses, which were detailed interpreted in supporting information.The results of the degree of these defective samples obtained by TGA-DTG curves are in accordance with the results of 1 H NMR data (Table S1). In addition, missing-cluster defects, in which a couple of metal clusters were removed from the perfect crystallographic structure, will create more pore volume than missing-linker defects, and the defect content increases with the acid strength of the modulator 31323334.As shown in the pore size distribution (PSD) plots (Fig. S10b), the missingcluster sample UiO-66-NH 2 -MC exhibits the largest micro-and mesopores, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume of UiO-66-NH 2 -MC reach to 1202.12 m 2 g -1 and 0.68 cm 3 g -1 , whereas the surface area and pore volume of the pristine UiO-66-NH 2 are only 517.53 m 2 g -1 and 0.44 cm 3 g -1 .On the other hand, along with the increasing acidity of AA to FA in missing-linker samples, more defects are generated for UiO-66-NH 2 -FA together with smaller volume of FA than AA, resulting in increasing the porosity and the changing PSD peaks from 1.11 to 1.21 nm.Therefore, UiO-66-NH 2 -FA 34 possesses the largest surface area (972.66 m 2 g -1 ) in the missing-linker samples.Simultaneously, UiO-66-NH 2 -LV has the biggest pore volume (0.61 cm 3 g -1 ) among the missing-linker samples, which is about 1.1 times that of UiO-66-NH 2 -FA, namely about 10 enhancement upon removal of FA.Since UiO-66-NH 2 -LV removes the terminal ligands from defective parts, forming ligand vacancies in the structure, which will build more mesopore volume than UiO-66-NH 2 -FA (Fig. S10a, Table S2).The existence of mesopores will reduce the surface area, but adds the pore volume 30.Thus, the degree of defects in these defective structures displays a sequence of UiO-66-NH 2 -MC UiO-66-NH 2 -LV UiO-66-NH 2 -FA UiO-66-NH 2 -AA.Interestingly, in the series of these samples, UiO-66-NH 2 -LV displays the highest adsorption capacity (63.46 cm 3 g -1 at 298 K) for CO 2 (Fig. S11), implying UiO-66-NH 2 -LV has kinetic advantages for CO 2 photoreduction. In the photocatalytic process, the linkers in the studied MOFs are responsible for light absorption and excitation, under such circumstance, E abs is controlled by the energy gap between the highest occupied crystal orbital (HOCO) and lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) 20.For the series of UiO-66-NH 2 , both the HOCO and LUCO are mainly on the linkers, indicating E abs almost equals to the HOCO-LUCO gap in this series (vide post, Fig. 5a, b and Fig. S20).To evaluate the light absorption of these samples, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) was employed, and the results show that the samples have optical adsorption in the UV-visible region.Furthermore, the defects in MOFs influence the visible light absorption in the range of 400-800 nm.UiO-66-NH 2 -LV and UiO-66-NH 2 -MC show the strongest and weakest absorption in the visible region, respectively (Fig. 2b).Tauc plots were used to calculate the HOCO-LUCO gaps of these samples, as depicted in Fig. S12, the HOCO-LUCO gaps are determined to be 2.78, 2.85, 2.70, 2.81 and 2.83 eV vs. normalized hydrogen electron (NHE) for UiO-66-NH 2 , UiO-66-NH 2 -MC, UiO-66-NH 2 -LV, UiO-66-NH 2 -FA and UiO-66-NH 2 -AA, respectively.Mott-Schottky measurements indicate that the intrinsic characteristics of n-type semiconductors, and the conduction band minimum is approximately close to the flat-band potential (Fig. S13) 353637.Thus, the HOCO and LUCO positions are 2.14, 2.25, 1.80, 1.93, 1.98 and -0.64, -0.60, -0.90, -0.88 and -0.85 V with respect to NHE for UiO-66-NH 2 , UiO-66-NH 2 -MC, UiO-66-NH 2 -LV, UiO-66-NH 2 -FA and UiO-66-NH 2 -AA, respectively (Fig. 2c).The LUCO positions of these samples are all more negative than the redox potential of CO 2 to CO (-0.53 V vs. NHE), implying the possible CO 2 photoreduction capability of these MOFs 38,39.In addition, the lower HOCO-LUCO gap (E abs ) requires lower light energy to excite ligand, accordingly, the missing-linker defects, particularly UiO-66-NH 2 -LV with ligand vacancies will possess better photoresponse than missing-cluster defects under visible light irradiation In order to assess the efficiency of charge carrier separation and transfer, photoelectrochemical measurements including photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved PL decay, transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted.As shown in Fig. 3a andb, PL emission spectra and time-resolved PL decay spectra afford the information that both emission peak intensities and average PL lifetimes reduce with the order of UiO-66-NH 2 -MC UiO-66-NH 2 UiO-66-NH 2 -AA UiO-66-NH 2 -FA UiO-66-NH 2 -LV, suggesting UiO-66-NH 2 -LV is the best at suppressing the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, then enhancing the electron transfer efficiency 40,41.Besides, UiO-66-NH 2 -LV exhibits the highest photocurrent response under visible light irradiation (Fig. 3c).Upon the light absorption in samples, the electrons in the valence band (VB) will be excited to the conduction band (CB), which move directionally to form a photocurrent under the strong electric filed 39.In general, the highest photocurrent response manifests the best performance of charge separation 42434445.The arc radius of UiO-66-NH 2 -LV is the smallest among all the samples in the EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 3d), indicating the best electrical conductivity and the highest efficiency of carrier transfer 46,47.All the photoelectrochemical data verify the fact that defects in MOFs will alter the efficiency of charge separation and transfer, particularly UiO-66-NH 2 -LV has the highest efficiency among the studied MOFs, which can be considered as a desirable photocatalyst for CO 2 conversion. According to the above mentioned results, we explored the catalytic performance for CO 2 photoreduction to confirm the influence of the structure defects on the photocatalytic activity of these samples.The photocatalytic reaction was carried in a solvent-free reaction route of overall as-synthesized MOFs samples under visible light irradiation with triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial agent, and the setup was described in Fig. S14.Five samples display distinct yields of photoreduction CO 2 to CO in 5 h under visible light, as shown in Fig. 4a, characterized peak of CO monitored by flame ionization detector (FID) (Fig. S15).CO was the only product in the gas phase, to affirm the liquid products, 1 H NMR spectral measurement was performed and no liquid product was detected in the catalytic process (Fig. S16).In the samples with different defects, UiO-66-NH 2 -MC exhibits the weakest catalytic performance as the yield of CO is even lower than that of defect-free structure-UiO-66-NH 2 .Missing-linker structures are superior to missing-cluster defects in the photocatalytic reactions, the worst performing UiO-66-NH 2 -AA in missing-linker structures does better than UiO-66-NH 2 -MC in photocatalytic CO 2 to CO, and UiO-66-NH 2 -LV exhibits the best photocatalytic activity over all the samples with the CO yield of 30.5 mol g -1 h -1 , which is 9.2 times higher than that of UiO-66-NH 2 -MC, also higher than other reported photocatalysts (Table S3).Meanwhile, UiO-66-NH 2 -LV displays the highest quantum yields (QYs) of 0.90 for CO.The highest photocatalytic activity of UiO-66-NH 2 -LV is consistent with the results of PL (Fig. 3a) and PL lifetime (Fig. 3b) indicating the most efficient electron transfer as well as the largest photocurrent response (Fig. 3c) and the smallest EIS (Fig. 3d) showing the best charge separation and electrical conductivity as mentioned above.Furthermore, recycling experiments were used to evaluate the photostability of UiO-66-NH 2 -LV, as shown in Fig. 4b, after six times uninterrupted cycles, UiO-66-NH 2 -LV still maintains catalytic activity.The PXRD patterns and SEM images suggest that the crystallinestructure and morphology of the samples have no noticeable alteration after the photocatalytic reactions (Figs.S17 andS18).TEOA undertakes as electron and proton donor, offering 2e -for photoreduction product of CO and the degradation product of TEOA was determined to be 2-(bis(2hydroxyethyl)amino)acetaldehyde (Fig. S19) 48,49.The 13 C isotopic experiment is employed to confirm the carbon source of this reaction, and mass spectrum (MS) with the signal peak at m/z 29 ( 13 CO) can be observed, originated from the used 13 CO 2 , unambiguously revealing CO is indeed the carbon source of CO (Fig. 4c).In short, the sequence of photocatalytic activity of five structures is UiO-66-NH 2 -LV UiO-66-NH 2 -FA UiO-66-NH 2 -AA UiO-66-NH 2 UiO-66-NH 2 -MC, that is in conformity with the trend of the efficiency of charge carrier separation and transfer, but is not the same trend of E abs mentioned above, implying E abs is not the only relevant quantity for photocatalyst.Taking solidstate electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, we can observe obviously enhanced peaks with g factors of 2.032, 2.009 and 2.003 upon irradiation for 10 min of UiO-66-NH 2 -LV, which is due to the existence of Zr III species, indicating the conversion of Zr IV to Zr III in the photocatalysis 50.But these peaks of irradiant pristine UiO-66-NH Fig. 4.

The LMCT effect of defect and defect-free structures on photocatalysis was addressed on basis of the calculated DOS results in Fig. 5a and b and Fig. S20.Focusing on the impact of intrinsic defects on the electronic properties, we find that the missing linker in UiO-66-NH 2 -LV generates a new defect state which is mainly contributed by Zr's d orbitals (Figs.S21 andS22), the excited linker electrons can be easily transferred to the unoccupied node's d orbitals 18.Such efficient charge transfer will reduce E LMCT , forming charge-separated states, preventing the recombination of photogenerated charges, potentially improving the photocatalytic efficiency.Remarkably, the calculated values and diagram of E abs and E LMCT of five samples are all listed in Table S4 and Fig. 5c, indeed, the decreasing trend of the sum of E abs and E LMCT matches well with the increasing trend of the photocatalytic yields of pristine, missing-cluster, ligand-vacancy and carboxylate compensated structures, verifying both of light absorption and charge transfer abilities will influence the activity of photocatalyst.DFT calculations were also employed to shed insight on the specific effect of structure defects on photoreduction CO 2 .Free energy pathways of reduction CO 2 to CO on the metal sites of MOFs and the intermediate structures are shown in Fig. 5d and Fig. S23.The formation of COOH serves as the rate-limiting reaction step among these elementary reaction steps, in agreement with other works 535455.The missing-linker defects with open metal node act as Lewis active sites in MOFs, distinctly decreasing the limiting potential of GCOOH, which is 0.37 eV lower than the pristine UiO-66-NH 2 .These DFT calculation results are in good agreement with the aforementioned experiments.It can be hence concluded that UiO-66-NH 2 -LV is more beneficial for CO 2 reduction."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The light source was a W xenon arc lamp (Sirius-300P, Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd., China) using a 400 nm cutoff filter.", "context": "Zirconium tetrachloride (ZrCl 4 , 99.5) and triethanolamine (TEOA, 99.5) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation, 2-aminoterephthalic acid (NH 2 -H 2 BDC, ATA, 98) was achieved from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.5), formic acid (FA, 99.5) and acetic acid (AA, 99.5) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.All chemicals are of analytical grade and were used without further purification.

The quantum yield of CO 2 photocatalytic reaction in 5 h can be calculated by the following formula.Two electrons are needed to convert CO 2 to CO 28. 2 mole of CO formation mole of photons absorbed by photocatalyst (MPAP)"}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "In summary, we designed and created a series of UiO-66-NH 2 with four different kinds of defect structures, exploring the influence of defected MOFs in CO 2 photoreduction reactions through a solvent-free reaction route.", "context": "In summary, we designed and created a series of UiO-66-NH 2 with four different kinds of defect structures, exploring the influence of defected MOFs in CO 2 photoreduction reactions through a solvent-free reaction route.It was experimentally found that missing-linker structures performed better than missing-cluster and defect-free structures in photocatalytic reactions, and the degree of defects in missing-linker structures also influences the efficiency of photocatalytic activity.DFT calculations further demonstrated that the different photocatalytic activities are ascribed to the fact that defects in MOFs will tune the values of E abs and E LMCT in the photocatalytic process.Specifically, the linker removal structure leads to the lowest sum of E abs and E LMCT among all the studied samples.DFT calculations also displayed the reaction pathways of CO 2 to CO, indicating the ligand-vacant defects will lower the photocatalytic reaction energy barrier, further enhancing the photocatalytic performance.Thus, this work will provide alternative way to tune MOFs structural defects for regulating CO 2 photocatalytic performance.
