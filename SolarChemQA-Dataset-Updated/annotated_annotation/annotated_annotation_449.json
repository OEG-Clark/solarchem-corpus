1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0) mol Bi-TiO 2 powders were prepared using a sol-gel treatment.To prepare a sol-mixture, titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, 99.95, Junsei Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) and bismuth chloride (BiCl 3 , 99.97, Junsei Chemical) were used as the Ti and Bi precursors, respectively, with DI water used as the solvent.Acetic acid was added to fix the pH 143.0 after 1.0 mol TTIP and 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 mol Bi precursor added stepwise, and then homogeneously stirred.The Ti and Bi precursors in the final colloidal solution were hydrolyzed via the OH group during evaporation at 80 C, and then the colloidal was changed to a powdered gelatin.In the final step, the powders were calcined at 400 C for 3 h to obtain the anatase structure.The synthesized Bi-TiO 2 powders were examined using an X-ray diffraction (XRD), a transmission electron microscope (TEM), an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), a reflectance UV-visible spectra, and photocurrent densities.The adsorption of CO 2 on the Bi-TiO 2 powders was measured from CO 2 -temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments.A batch-type photoreactor was designed in the laboratory 6.Two 6.0 A W/cm 2 mercury lamps with a 365 nm wavelength were used and the CO 2 :H 2 O ratio was fixed to 1:2.During the photocatalysis process, the product mixtures were analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame-ionized detector."}, {"llm generation": "Bi-TiO2", "source": "Therefore, the CO 2 adsorption capacities of the Bi-TiO 2 s, on which the photocatalytic performance depends, were determined as shown in Fig. 2A.", "context": "From XRD analysis, it was confirmed that all the peaks for the Bi-TiO 2 s were assigned to the anatase TiO 2 tetragonal structure 7, and there are no peaks for the added Bi oxide forms, indicating that the Bi ions had been well-inserted into the TiO 2 framework.Fig. 1A, B, andC show the TEM images for pure TiO 2 and 5.0 mol Bi-TiO 2 samples, the UV-visible absorption spectra, and their Tauc's plots of the Bi-TiO 2 powders.The TEM images showed that the Bi-TiO 2 particles were smaller than those of pure TiO 2 , although the morphologies were a round shape in all of the samples.An absorption band for the anatase structured TiO 2 was observed in the UV-region around 380 nm when extrapolated, which is similar to the absorption wavelength reported elsewhere 8.The band can be converted to the following adsorption terms using the Tanabe-Sugano's energy absorption: T 2g -E g for the d 1 electron configuration TiO 2 .As a reference, the absorption band for pure Bi 2 O 3 was largely shifted to the visible range, compared to the other samples, and means that the Bi ingredient increases the photo-response in visible region.According to the addition of Bi species, there are different absorption band shifts, which were shifted to higher wavelengths compared to the absorption band of TiO 2 .The Bi-TiO 2 s showed broad curves for the metal oxides in the visible region: the maximum absorption was observed at 339, 343, 328, 344, and 344 nm for 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 mol Bi-TiO 2 , respectively.Generally, the band gap in a semiconductor is closely related to the wave range absorbed: the higher the absorption wavelength, the shorter the band gap.Using Tauc's equation 9, in the UV-region, the band-gaps for the absorption of TiO 2 and 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 mol Bi-TiO 2 were estimated to be 3.12 and 3.05, 2.94, 2.82, 2.63, and 2.57 eV, respectively.The inserted Bi ions significantly altered the band gap of the TiO 2 , leading to easy absorption, and eventually efficient photocatalysis.During the CO 2 photoreduction, CO 2 is adsorbed onto the surface of the photocatalysts in the first step, and then the photoreduction reaction progresses.Therefore, the CO 2 adsorption capacities of the Bi-TiO 2 s, on which the photocatalytic performance depends, were determined as shown in Fig. 2A.The curve intensity for CO 2 desorption was higher in Bi-TiO 2 than in pure TiO 2 , indicating that considerably more CO 2 molecules were adsorbed on the surfaces of the Bi-TiO 2 s.In particular, the desorption peaks above 350 C in the Bi-TiO 2 s show that the CO 2 molecules were strongly linked with Bi ions.TiO 2 is generally hydrophilic, which suggests that during the CO 2 photoreduction reaction, CO 2 and H 2 O are adsorbed preferentially on the Bi ions and TiO 2 , respectively.The adsorption abilities decreased in the following order: 5.0 mol Bi-TiO 2 4 10.0 mol Bi-TiO 2 4 2.5 mol Bi-TiO 2 47.5 mol Bi-TiO 2 4 1.0 mol Bi-TiO 2 4 TiO 2 .In general, a rapid catalytic reaction occurs when many reactants are well-adsorbed over the catalyst.The presence of Bi in the Bi-TiO 2 s probably increased the number of CO 2 and H 2 O molecules adsorbed compared to that of pure TiO 2 .Consequently, this synergy contributed significantly to improving the catalytic performance of the Bi-TiO 2 s.The efficiencies of the photogenerated electron-hole production in the TiO 2 and Bi-TiO 2 s were measured from the photocurrent response under solar light irradiation at an applied potential of 0.7 V vs. SCE.Fig. 2B shows the typical real time photocurrent response of the samples when the light source was switched on and off.In semiconductor systems, when irradiation provides energy higher than the band gap of a semiconductor, the energy excites the electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving a hole in the valence band.This electron-hole is responsible for the photocurrent.When the light was turned on, the photoreduction current was rapidly increased, and the photocurrent then turned to a steady state after a few seconds.When the light was turned off, the photocurrent decreased instantaneously to almost zero.When the light was turned on, the 5.0 mol Bi-TiO 2 exhibited the maximum photocurrent of 270.23 mA cm A 2 , which was 15-fold more than that achieved on pure TiO 2 (17.61 mA cm A 2 ).This shows the beneficial effect of the Bi doping on the photocurrent.The Bi ions act as an intermediate for the efficient separation of photogenerated hole-electron pairs.Fig. 3A presents the abilities The 5.0 mol Bi-TiO 2 samples showed 23-fold higher CH 4 production (34000.0mol g cat A 1 L A 1 ) from CO 2 photoreduction than the pure TiO 2 (150.0 mol g cat A 1 L A 1 ).Furthermore, some of the ethane was identified with methane from the GC signal, as shown above the picture.These differences in yields were attributed to the band gaps, electron-hole recombination tendencies and gas adsorption abilities of the Bi-TiO 2 s.In particular, these results confirmed the synergistic performance between Bi and Ti of the 5.0 mol Bi-TiO 2 s.Fig. 3B suggests a model for CO 2 photoreduction over the Bi-TiO 2 s based on the relationships between the optical properties of the photocatalysts and the catalytic activities.Photon excitation over the Bi-TiO 2 begins rapidly because Bi-TiO 2 has a shorter band-gap than does pure TiO 2 , and the excited electrons can be transferred efficiently to CO 2 molecules.In addition, CO 2 molecules are adsorbed preferentially and easily on the Bi ingredients.The positive holes on the valance band of Bi-TiO 2 can be trapped by H 2 O species and be transferred to OH radicals and protons.The protons obtained are transformed by electrons to H radicals, which then react with C and the CO radicals formed from the reduction of CO 2 A over Bi-TiO 2 , particularly over 5.0 mol Bi-TiO 2 , to produce methane.The Bi-TiO 2 can also promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs (e A /h ) on basis of the photocurrent result.Therefore, the synergetic effects of the Bi and Ti in the Bi-TiO 2 increased the CO 2 reduction efficiency."}, {"llm generation": "Bi-incorporated TiO2s", "source": "Bi-incorporated TiO 2 s were obtained by a conventional sol-gel method, and
