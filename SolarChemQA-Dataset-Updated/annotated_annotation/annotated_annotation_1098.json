The surface areas are acquired by BET measurement as shown in Fig. 2. The surface area of the pristine CNU is 81 m 2 /g, and after the introduction of DAP monomer, its surface area increases progressively, and the maximum surface area is achieved by CNU-DAP 4.5 , namely 102 m 2 /g.By further increasing the quantity of the DAP, the surface area decreases probably due to the fact that the excess amount of DAP will not undergo the nucleophilic attack on the amino groups of urea and decompose the unit.In addition, from this result, it can evaluate that -deficient aromatic system containing DAP monomers plays a vital role in process co-polymerization of CNU. Figure 2b presents BJH pore-size distribution of the corresponding samples, and the pore size is the same for the series of the samples, revealing the structure of the polymer maintains after the co-polymerization.The optical properties of CNU-DAP x and pure CNU samples are examined by ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) in Fig. 3. Figure 3a demonstrates that the optical absorption of the samples is red-shifting towards longer wavelength with incorporation of DAP. Figure 3b shows the PL measurement, and it can be observed that the co-polymerized CNU-DAP presents a shift towards longer wavelength from 470 nm towards 490 nm, indicating the band gap energy of the sample moves from ca. 2.7 eV to 2.5 eV.The surface analyses were performed on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as shown in Fig. S1, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is also acquired to study the morphology as shown in Fig. S2.Both samples CNU and co-polymerized CNU-DAP 4.5 are presented as nanosheets.The introduction of DAP into the framework of CNU presents an insignificant difference in the texture with respect to the pristine CNU polymer.The increase in the BET surface area is probably due to the formation of thinner morphology after co-polymerizing with DAP. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to study the chemical status and composition of as-prepared CNU and CNU-DAP 4.5 .Figure 4a Solid-state 13 C NMR spectra are acquired to detect the extra contents of carbon and sulphur for CNU-DAP 4.5 sample over pristine CNU. Figure 5a demonstrates the solid-state 13 C NMR spectra.An extra peak at 100.9 ppm can be observed from CNU-DAP 4.5 with respect to the pure CNU.This observation revealed the -deficient pyridine ring-incorporated carbon nitride... successful integration of DAP into the heptazine-based conjugated structure of CNU.The electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of CNU and DAP-polymerized CNU was examined to demonstrate the electronic band structures.The intensity of EPR is related to unpaired electrons, and the extension of EPR spectra peak is attributed to the delocalization of -conjugated system 51.The peak becomes broadness and its intensity increases when the concentration of DAP increases, and its strongest single Lorentzian line appears by CNU-DAP 4.5 as shown in Fig. 5b.All samples show one single Lorentzian line at 3514G that has a g-value of 2.0034.Under light illumination, CNU-DAP 4.5 exhibits a larger increase than pristine CNU.This phenomenon can be attributed to the increase in numbers of photochemical radical pairs on the surface of the CNU-DAP 4.5 33,51. The CNU and CNU-DAP samples perform photocatalytic H 2 evolution by using Pt as co-catalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as sacrificing agent under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm) as displayed in Fig. 6.The activity of the pristine was 15.9 mol h -1 for H 2 evolution.Enhancements of the photocatalytic H 2 evolution can be observed for the CNU-DAP samples.The optimal photocatalytic activity for H 2 evolution is achieved by CNU-DAP 4.5 and leads to an activity of 158.4 mol/h as shown in Fig. 6a.This result can be attributed to the synergetic effects of the improved visible light absorption and the increased charge separation.The result is about 10 times with respect to that of pristine CNU.In addition, DAP can be used as a monomer to co-polymerize with different precursors, including dicyandiamide, thiourea and melamine, to improve the photocatalytic performance for H 2 evolution (Fig. S3).This further confirms the control of physiochemical property by the co-polymerization.Stability of the typical co-polymerized CNU (CNU-DAP 4.5 ) was acquired as shown in Fig. 6d, which leads to a preserved performance in 16 h, indicating that the CNU-DAP is photochemical stable for H 2 evolution.Photocatalytic H 2 evolution is further acquired with different wavelengths of the incident light as shown in Fig. 7. Obviously, the photoactivity of H 2 evolution by CNU-DAP 4.5 is higher than pristine CNU with extended activity in the visible range up to 550 nm.The highest performance is achieved by the incident wavelength of 360 nm, and it leads to a H 2 evolution rate -deficient pyridine ring-incorporated carbon nitride... of ca.350 mol/h, which is three times higher than that of pristine CNU.In addition, it can observed that the reflection spectrum makes well agreement with the performances by different incident wavelengths. Photocatalytic CO 2 conversion is also attempted as shown in Fig. 8. 2, 2-(bpy) 3 was used as an electron mediator, and TEOA was used as an electron donor.Initially, we have tested different solvents for the reaction, since the solubility of CO 2 in the solvent is significant to lead the overall efficiency for CO 2 reduction, as shown in Fig. S4 and MeCN are chosen for achieving best performance.Figure 8a presents the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 conversion as a function of the DAP weight, and the result agrees with H 2 evolution rate.The highest conversion efficiency is achieved by CNU-DAP 4.5 , which leads to the CO evolution of ca.21.6 mol/h -1 , and this result is ca. 5 times the pristine CNU.H 2 acted as side-product in the reaction.The evolution result of CNU-DAP 4.5 is shown in Fig. 8b, and the major product is CO.CO production is also acquired by different wavelengths of the incident light.The highest CO production is obtained with the incident wavelength of 400 nm, with a CO production rate of ca.48 mol/h -1 .Furthermore, the stability of the photocatalyst is also tested as shown in Fig. 8d.After five cycles, the performance can be maintained.XRD (Fig. S5) and FTIR (Fig. S6) were used to probe the samples after the long-term photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests.As a result, we cannot observe any obvious difference before and after the experiment, revealing its good stability for this reaction.Photoelectrocatalytic studies of the CNU and CNU-DAP 4.5 were conducted to understand the improved photoactivity as shown in Fig. 9.

Photocatalytic CO 2 conversion is also attempted as shown in Fig. 8. 2, 2-(bpy) 3 was used as an electron mediator, and TEOA was used as an electron donor.Initially, we have tested different solvents for the reaction, since the solubility of CO 2 in the solvent is significant to lead the overall efficiency for CO 2 reduction, as shown in Fig. S4 and MeCN are chosen for achieving best performance.Figure 8a presents the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 conversion as a function of the DAP weight, and the result agrees with H 2 evolution rate.The highest conversion efficiency is achieved by CNU-DAP 4.5 , which leads to the CO evolution of ca.21.6 mol/h -1 , and this result is ca. 5 times the pristine CNU.H 2 acted as side-product in the reaction.The evolution result of CNU-DAP 4.5 is shown in Fig. 8b, and the major product is CO.CO production is also acquired by different wavelengths of the incident light.The highest CO production is obtained with the incident wavelength of 400 nm, with a CO production rate of ca.48 mol/h -1 .Furthermore, the stability of the photocatalyst is also tested as shown in Fig. 8d.After five cycles, the performance can be maintained.XRD (Fig. S5) and FTIR (Fig. S6) were used to probe the samples after the long-term photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests.As a result, we cannot observe any obvious difference before and after the experiment, revealing its good stability for this reaction.Photoelectrocatalytic studies of the CNU and CNU-DAP 4.5 were conducted to understand the improved photoactivity as shown in Fig. 9. Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are shown in Fig. 9a with light on and off.The semicircle radius indicates the photoactivity of the samples.In a comparison, the smaller radius of circle is achieved by CNU-DAP 4.5 under irradiation, indicating better photoactivity than the pristine CNU.Chronoamperometry curve is shown in Fig. 9b, and it is achieved by CNU-DAP 4.5 and CNU under light on and off at -0.2 V (vs.AgCl) in 0.2 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution.It is obvious that the efficiency of CNU-DAP 4.5 is higher than that of pristine CNU, also indicating the improved photoactivity due to the improved visible absorption."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
