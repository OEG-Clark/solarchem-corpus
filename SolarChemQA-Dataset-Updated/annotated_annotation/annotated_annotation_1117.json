The surface chemical status and elemental composition of pure MIS, BBOC and 6 BBOC/MIS were elucidated by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) spectra and the results are given in Fig. 2. As exhibited in Fig. 2a,6 BBOC/MIS are mainly composed of Bi, O, Cl, Mg, In and S, revealing the coexistence of BBOC and MIS in the composites.Furthermore, the core-level spectra of Mg 1s, In 3d, S 2p, Bi 4f, O 1s and Cl 2p were also investigated.As shown in Fig. 2b, the presence of a single peak at 1305.6 eV could be assigned to the typical Mg 2 oxidation state in MgIn 2 S 4 39,41,50.In the MIS XPS spectrum, two peaks at 452.9 and 445.3 eV (Fig. 2c) could be attributed to In 3d 3/2 and In 3d 5/2 peaks respectively 51,52, In S 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 2d), the two peaks at 161.9 eV and 163.1 eV are corresponded to S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 of S 2- 53,54.Fig. 2d indicates four characteristic peaks of Bi, the two peaks at 158.6 and 163.7 eV could be related to the spin-orbit coupling effect of Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 55,56, which indicates the presence of Bi 3 in BBOC and 6 BBOC/MIS, and the other two peaks at 156.2 and 161.1 eV belong to metallic Bi 55,57.The O 1s XPS region (Fig. 2e) of 6 BBOC/MIS could be split to two peaks at 530.2 eV and 531.4 eV, which represent the lattice oxygen of crystalline BiOCl and the chemisorbed oxygen, respectively 58.According to Cl 2p region of 6 BBOC/MIS (Fig. 2f), two peaks at 198.2 and 200.1 eV could be ascribed to Cl 2p 3/2 and Cl 2p 1/2 , which are the characteristic peak of Cl-in BiOCl 59.Obviously, the binding energies of Mg 1s, In 3d and S 2p peaks in 6 BBOC/MIS show slight shifts to lower binding energies compared to pristine BiOCl and MIS, while the binding energies of Bi 4f, O 1s and Cl 2p are higher than that of pure BBOC.The slight binding energy shift may be attributed to the change of electron density at the interface caused by the interaction between BBOC and MIS 606162.Based on above analysis, it can be deduced that the migration direction of electrons are from the surface of BBOC to that of MIS in 6 BBOC/MIS composites, which is propitious to separate electron-hole pairs during the CO 2 photoreduction reaction 63. The detailed morphology structure of as-prepared BOC, BBOC, MIS, 6 BBOC/MIS were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).Figs.3a andS1 show that the BOC microspheres are consisted of numerous self-assembled nanoflakes with average diameters about m.In contrast, BBOC are also hierarchical microspheres, which exhibit rough surfaces and loose internal structures caused by the reducibility of NaBH 4 (Fig. 3b).It is obvious that pure MIS presents relatively typical marigold ball-flower structure (Fig. 3c) 64.For BBOC/MIS (Fig. 3d), it is noted that the ultrasonication exfoliation process causes the formation of many BBOC ultrathin nanosheets, which are dispersed on the MIS surface in the face-to-face way. The morphology structure of final synthesized 6 BBOC/MIS was further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM).As shown in Fig. 4a-d, the magnification red region further certifies that the BBOC nanosheets grow on the surface of MIS marigold microflower.As displayed in Fig. 4d, the spacing of three lattice fringes about 0.324 nm, 0.331 nm and 0.346 nm are in good agreement with (311) plane of MIS 39, (012) plane of Bi 55,65 and (101) plane of BOC 66,67, respectively.As shown in the yellow zone of Fig. 4e, a part of 6 BBOC/MIS exhibit that MIS shell grows on BBOC core.The element mapping images (Fig. 4f) further prove the existence and distribution of Bi, O, Cl, Mg, In and S elements in the as-obtained BBOC/MIS composite. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were applied to explore textural properties of as-prepared catalysts.According to Fig. 5, adsorptiondesorption isotherms of BOC and BBOC present type IV curves with H3 type hysteresis loop according to BDDT classification 68,69, indicating the existence of mesoporous structure in photocatalysts.The pure MIS and its composites show a type IV pattern with an H4-type adsorption hysteresis loop without an obvious saturated adsorption platform, indicating that the internal pore structure of the material is irregular.Detailed information of the textural parameters is summarized in Table 1.The BET specific surface areas of 4 BBOC/MIS, 6 BBOC/MIS, 8 BBOC/MIS and 6 BOC/MIS are 76.55, 90.42, 77.89 and 73.01 m 2 /g -1 , respectively.As we all know, higher surface area could supply more active sites for CO 2 adsorption and photoreduction, which should be one of the pivotal preconditions for the enhanced the activity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. In order to explore the optical absorption behaviors of bare BOC, BBOC, MIS, BOC/MIS and BBOC/MIS composites, the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) was performed at the range of 200-800 nm, which is demonstrated in Fig. 6a.The pristine BOC has excellent absorption capacity for ultraviolet light, and its adsorption edge is about 392 nm.Compared with BOC, the adsorption edge of BBOC locates at approximately 459 nm, which might be caused by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of metallic Bi 65,70.The adsorption edges of 4 BBOC/MIS (689 nm), 6 BBOC/MIS (697 nm), 8 BBOC/MIS (713 nm) and 6 BOC/MIS (614 nm) all show gradually red shift toward the longer wavelength region, corresponding to the tendency that orange MIS turns into brown BBOC/MIS (Fig. S2).According to the Kubelka-Munk formula 5, the band gap energies of (Eg) of BOC, BBOC and MIS are 3.15 eV, 2.69 eV and 2.00 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6b.The band gap of BBOC is narrower than BOC, which may be due to the narrowed band gap caused by metallic Bi with zero band gap 717273. The photocatalytic measurements of all catalysts for CO 2 reduction were performed in aqueous solution under simulated sunlight irradiation.No hydrocarbon compounds were detected with N 2 flow instead of high-purity CO 2 without photocatalyst or illumination, which suggests that CO 2 , light irradiation and photocatalyst are essential and indispensable for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.In the evaluation of photocatalytic activity, gas chromatograph detects a total of three products, CH 4 , CO, and O 2 , among which CH 4 is the main reduction product and the yields of CO and O 2 are shown in Fig. S3.Fig. 7a shows the CH 4 evolution over BOC, BBOC, BBOC/MIS, BOC/MIS and MIS.Clearly, pure BOC, BBOC and MIS exhibit poor photoreduction activities.For the BBOC/MIS composite photocatalyst, CH 4 generation increases with the increase of BBOC content, which may be due to the efficient carriers transfer between BBOC and MIS.Nevertheless, the photocatalytic activity decreases when BBOC content reaches 8 , which may be due to the decrease of CO 2 adsorption sites that are linked to its relatively small specific surface area, as listed Table 1.After 6 h of simulated sunlight irradiation, the yields of CH 4 for 4 BBOC/MIS, 6 BBOC/MIS, 8 BBOC/MIS and 6 BOC/MIS are 17.39, 25.73, 19.84 and 15.83 mol g -1 , respectively.The maximum CH 4 evolution rate of 4.29 mol g -1 h -1 is achieved on 6 BBOC/MIS sample during 6 h illumination, which is about 7.56-fold as high as pristine MIS (0.57 mol g -1 h -1 ), as shown in Fig. 7b.Noticeably, the yield of CH 4 for 6 BBOC/MIS photocatalyst is higher than that of 6 BOC/MIS (2.64 mol g -1 h -1 ), indicating that Bi as an electron mediator is beneficial for improving the performance of photocatalyst reduction of CO 2 74.The stability and recyclability of the prepared 6 BBOC/MIS photocatalyst was evaluated for three times under the above experimental conditions and the reactor was vacuumed before each cycle.As shown in Fig. 7c, the yield of CH 4 exhibits no significant change during three repeated experiments, demonstrating that the performance of synthesized BBOC/MIS catalysts are stable.Moreover, the XRD patterns of the 6 BBOC/MIS photocatalyst before and after the photocatalytic CO 2 reaction for 18 h shows that no significant crystal phase changes appear (Fig. S4).Moreover, the total rate of CH 4 products is 1.7-39 times higher than in the previously reported literature (Table 2).The aforementioned test data verify that the prepared 6 BBOC/MIS photocatalyst possesses applaudable performance and durability for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The high-efficient charge carrier separation across the interface of heterojunction plays a vital role in photocatalytic reaction.To further investigate the recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers on the photocatalyst samples, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded, as illustrated in Fig. 8a.It can be observed that all samples exhibits a emission peak at about 430 nm, and the intensities follow a sequence of BOC BBOC MIS 6 BOC/MIS 4 BBOC/MIS 8 BBOC/MIS 6 BBOC/MIS.Obviously, 6 BBOC/MIS owns the weakest photoluminescence intensity, which due to the formation of hetero-structures and lower recombination rate of photoexcited charge carriers, matching well with the results of the photocatalytic activity evaluation.Moreover, compared with BOC, the relative lower PL intensity of BBOC sample should be originated from the promoted separation of photogenerated carriers owing to the SPR effect of metallic Bi 74.In order to further prove that the excitation and transfer of electron-hole pairs in BBOC, MIS and BBOC/MIS samples, photocurrent response was tested and the rtesults are illustrated in Fig. 8b.It is obvious that the photocurrent intensity of 6 BBOC/MIS composite is higher compared with that of bare BBOC and pure MIS, which indicates that the construction of heterostructure between BBOC and MIS can accelerate the photogenerated electron-hole separation.Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) experiment was also carried out to detect the transfer efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs.From Fig. 8c, the radius of 6 BBOC/MIS is much smaller than that of pure BBOC and MIS, suggesting that 6 BBOC/MIS possess the best interfacial electron transfer efficiency.Furthermore, the time-resolved PL decay spectra were also tested to investigate the lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers quantitatively (Fig. 8d).The decay profiles of pure BOC, MIS, BBOC and 6 BBOC/MIS composite are fitted with a double exponential decay function, and the lifetime () could be determined using the presented equation 82: Where B1, B2, 1, 2 are listed in the inset.Clearly, the average lifetime of BOC, MIS, BBOC and 6 BBOC/MIS are 10.27 ns, 9.84 ns, 9.66 ns and 8.54 ns, respectively, which reveals that the charge transfer rate of 6 BBOC/MIS composite is faster than that of other samples 83.The results of above analysis disclose the expeditious transport and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and provide direct and quantified support for the superior photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of 6 BBOC/MIS. For the purpose of further confirming the precise band-edge positions of BOC and MIS, Mott-Schottky approach was applied (Fig. 9).Obviously, BOC and MIS show a positive slope in Mott-Schottky curves, suggesting that they are all n-type semiconductors.The flat potentials of BOC and MIS are determined to be 0.78 V and -0.55 V versus the Ag/ AgCl electrode, respectively, which are equal to 0.98 V and -0.35 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode 84.Generally, the bottom of the conduction band (CB) edges of n-type semiconductor can be estimated via negatively shifting its flat band potential (about 0.2 V) 85,86 It is generally accepted that the value of the flat potentials is approximately equal to that of the Fermi level 87,88.Combined with Fig. 6b, the CB and VB edges of BOC are calculated to be 0.78 V and 3.92 V (vs.NHE), and the CB and VB edges of MIS are -0.55V and 1.45 V (vs.NHE), respectively. The transfer pathways of the photogenerated electrons or holes may be regarded as the type-II heterostructure mechanism (Fig. 10a) or Sscheme transfer mode (Fig. 10b).Supposing that the type-II heterostructure mechanism is applied, the E CB of MIS (-0.55 V) is more negative than that of BBOC (0.78 V), thus the excited electrons in MIS would directly migrate to the E CB of BBOC.Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes in BBOC could easily be transferred to the E VB of MIS.It is logical that the photoreduction reaction of CO 2 and the oxidation reaction of water will be carried out on the CB of BBOC and the VB of MIS, respectively.However, the standard reduction potential required for CO 2 to be translated into CO and CH 4 are -0.53V and -0.24 V, respectively, vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).Combined with the above analysis results of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performances, it clearly infers that type-II heterostructure mechanism is wholly unsuited to the BBOC/MIS photocatalyst for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.In Fig. 10c, intense DMPO- and Cl 2p increased after light irradiation, demonstrating that the transfer pathway of electrons is from BBOC to MIS at the interfaces.The results of in situ XPS offer distinct proof that the reaction mechanism is Sscheme heterojunction rather than type-II heteronjunction. Based on above characterization results and discussion, the charge transfer mechanism of photoreduction CO 2 over BBOC/MIS is presented in Figs.10b, 11 and Scheme 2. In general, BBOC with lower Fermi level are used as an oxidized photocatalyst, while MIS act as a reduced photocatalyst due to its higher Fermi level.It is universally acknowledged that when two semiconductors with different Fermi level contact each other, a new internal electric field will form.Thence, after contact, the electrons will migrate from the MIS to BBOC to accomplish a new Fermi level balance, which takes shape a an internal electric field with orientation from MIS to BBOC.It is worth mentioning that the band edge of MIS bends upward due to the loss of electrons, while the band edge of BBOC bends downward due to the cumulation of electrons.Under light irradiation, the photo-induced electrons are motivated from VB to CB of both BBOC and MIS.The recombination of some electrons (from CB of BBOC) and holes (from VB of MIS) would be facilitated by the synergistic reaction of internal electric field, band edge bending, and Coulomb interaction.When exposed to the simulated solar light irradiation, the photoexcited electrons in BBOC will migrate to the VB of MIS to recombine with the holes of MIS, thereby resulting in excess electrons in the CB of MIS to react with CO 2 to generate CO and CH 4 .In addition, the oxidation reaction happens on the VB of BBOC and the holes on the VB are captured by H 2 O to form H and O 2 .It should be noted that BBOC/ MIS tends to generate a large amount of CH 4 rather than CO during the product generation process, which may be attributed to the following reasons: (1) From the perspective of thermodynamic factors, it is easier for photocatalytis to generate CH 4 during photocatalytic reduction than CO, which may be due to CO 2 /CH 4 (-0.24V) requires a lower standard reduction potential than CO 2 /CO (-0.53 V). ( 2) It can be well known from reaction Eqs. ( 6) and ( 7) that the generated CO may be further reduced by photo-generated electrons to C radicals and then form CH 4 .What's more, it is believed that the presence of metallic Bi on semiconductors can act as a bridge to facilitate interfacial electron transfer, and the electrons on the CB of BBOC can easily combine with the holes on the VB of MIS 89,90.Simultaneously, the metal Bi can greatly broaden the visible light absorption range of BOC and the SPR effect of partial reduced Bi inhibits the recombination of photogenerated carriers 65.The possible reaction pathways during the CO 2 photoreduction progress over the 6 BBOC/MIS could be written by the following equations 62,919293: The corresponding charge balance details are listed in Table 3."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "Then the mixed solution was transferred into a 150 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 160 C for 10 h.", "context": "Exhaustive introduction including the characterization methods, photoelectrochemical measurements and photocatalytic activity evaluation related to this article can be found in supporting information.
