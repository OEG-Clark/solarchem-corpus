The Raman spectra of h-MoO 3 MoS 2 , In 2 S 3 /MoO 3 MoS 2 , NiS/MoO 3 MoS 2 , and 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 presented in Fig. 2. For h-MoO 3 MoS 2 , the bands at 112, 123, 147, and 194 cm A1 were indexed as the lattice modes of h-MoO 3 , the bands at 214 and 236 cm A1 were ascribed to the E 1g modes of h-MoO 3 , and the band at 989 cm A1 belonged to the E 2g symmetrical stretching mode of MoO bond 47.The bands at 280, 334, 662, and 816 cm A1 were assigned to the O-defected a-MoO 3 , of which the peaks at 280 and 816 cm A1 were indexed to the bending mode of M 14 O vibration and the doubly coordinated oxygen stretching mode of Mo 2 -O, respectively 23.In addition, the band at 372 cm A1 was assigned to the E comparison to h-MoO 3 MoS 2 .Typically, the appearing band of In 2 S 3 /MoO 3 MoS 2 and 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 at 403 cm A1 was ascribed to the A 1g mode of out-plane vibration mode of MoS 2 12.In addition, the appearing peak of NiS/MoO 3 -MoS 2 and 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 at 118 cm A1 could be ascribed to the lattice modes of NiS.It's suggested that In2S3 and NiS existed in the obtained MoO 3 MoS 2 composites.The microstructure and morphology of h-MoO 3 , h-MoO 3 MoS 2 , and INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 samples were detected by SEM and TEM (Figs. 3 and4).h-MoO 3 prepared via chemical precipitation route (Fig. 3AeC) was the uniform hexagonal nanorods with the diameter of around 100 nm and the length of about 400 nm MoO 3 nanoparticles were in-situ sulfurized into MoS 2 nanoparticles on the surface of MoO 3 , and the hexagonal structure of h-MoO 3 was destroyed, especially at the edge sites (Fig. 3DeF).For 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 (Fig. 3GeI), In 3 and Ni 2 ions as well as h-MoO 3 nanoparticles were also converted into In 2 S 3 and NiS nanoparticles, which could further form the tight interface between In 2 S 3 , NiS, MoS 2 , and MoO 3 in the sulfurized process.This was also confirmed by TEM (Fig. 4A andB) and HRTEM images (Fig. 4C andD).Part of MoS 2 nanoparticles were coated on the surface of MoO 3 to form core-shell structure, and there were many small nanoparticles detected in 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 .With an increase in the total In 2 S 3 -NiS content, much more nanoparticles were loaded on the bulks surface and even isolated from MoO 3 -MoS 2 bulks (Fig. S2).The elemental mapping images (Fig. 4EeI andS3) confirmed that Mo, Ni, In, S, and O elements existed in 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 , meaning the formation of In 2 S 3 -NiS codecorated MoO 3 MoS 2 .As listed in Table S1, the specific surface area of h-MoO 3 (28.73m 2 g A1 ) was higher than MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites, and the corresponding value of INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 decreased with an increase in the In 2 S 3 -NiS co-loading content. Fig. 5 presented the light-harvesting and photoelectrochemical behaviors of h-MoO 3 and MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites.In contrast with h-MoO 3 , the narrow band gap and deep color of h-MoO 3 MoS 2 induced to the extending photo-response in visible light region (Fig. 5A).Although the addition of single In 2 S 3 and NiS were not suitable for the enhanced light absorption, the dual effect of In 2 S 3 -NiS could enhance the light-capturing capacity of INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 .The light harvesting intensity of INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 increased with the increasing total content of In 2 S 3 -NiS (Fig. S4).According to the plots of KubelkaeMunk equation (Fig. S5), the estimated band-gap energies (E g ) of obtained INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 (Table S1) were narrower than that of h-MoO 3 (2.81eV), of which E g value of 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 was 2.35 eV.When intermittently irradiated in visible light region with the on-off cycles, the distinct on-off ration in photocurrent (Fig. 5B andS6) reflected the efficient separation of charge carriers of these samples.The in-situ sulfurization of DBD plasma was favorable for enhancing photocurrent intensity of h-MoO 3 .The single NiS and In 2 S 3 hampered the photocurrent intensity, while the dual In 2 S 3 -NiS greatly enhanced the photocurrent capacity of h-MoO 3 MoS 2 .3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 with a nominal NiS-In 2 S 3 content of 5.0 wt presented the strongest photocurrent intensity among these composites.Under visible light irradiation, the photocurrent of 3-INS/ MoO 3 MoS 2 increased with the increasing turn-on time, while decreased with the increasing turn-off time.It's indicated that the obtained 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 could efficiently capture photons and achieve the transfer and separation of photo-induced carriers 49,50.For the electrochemical impedance spectra, the arc radius of h-MoO 3 MoS 2 was smaller than h-MoO 3 , which was further shrank by the presence of In 2 S 3 and NiS, especially dual In 2 S 3 -NiS (Fig. 5C andS7).It's indicated that the addition of In 2 S 3 , NiS, and dual In 2 S 3 -NiS efficiently restrained the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs. The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) potential of obtained samples greatly affected their redox ability during the photo-induced reaction process.The bottom of conduction band (LUMO) was approximately equal to the flat band (E FB ) potential of n-type semiconductors estimated by Mott-Schottky plots in previous works 51,52.The positive slopes of Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 5D andS8) indicated that MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites as well as h-MoO 3 were the ntype semiconductors.The work function of NiS and In 2 S 3 resulted in the different flat band potentials of these samples 50,53.The E FB and E CB of optimal 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 (Table S1) were A0.72 V and A0.52 eV, respectively.The E VB potential of 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 estimated from E g and E CB was 1.83 eV.It's indicated that 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 was suitable for the solar light driven CO 2 photoreduction.PL spectra (Fig. 6) suggested that PL intensity of 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 was weaker than that of h-MoO 3 , h-MoO 3 MoS 2 , In 2 S 3 /MoO 3 MoS 2 , and NiS/MoO 3 MoS 2 , meaning the excellent separation of electron-holes pairs. The photocatalytic activities of h-MoO 3 and MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites were performed for the solar light driven conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 and CO (Fig. 7).Although the large BET surface area could provide sufficient active sites for photons capture and reactants adsorption, the efficient separation and migration of charge carriers at junction interface were vital for the photocatalytic capacity of obtained compositions.In contrast with h-MO 3 , h-MoO 3 MoS 2 (Fig. 7A) presented the higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 photoreduction, and CH 4 and CO yields respectively increased to 15.75 and 22.26 mmol g A1 h A1 .It's ascribed to the efficient transfer and separation of charge carriers at the tight interface between MoO 3 and MoS 2 39,41.Due to the combined effect of cocatalysts such as In 2 S 3 and NiS, the photocatalytic activity of MoO 3 MoS 2 for CO 2 photoreduction was further enhanced, especially the dual In 2 S 3 -NiS co-decorating.NiS and In 2 S 3 were the efficient mediators for the band-gap structure and energy position of band edges, enhancing the transfer and migration of photo-generated electron-hole pairs 39,53,54.The addition of In 2 S 3 into MoO 3 MoS 2 enhanced the conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 (21.70 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and CO (25.14 mmol g A1 h A1 ).However, NiS/MoO 3 MoS 2 exhibited the increased CH 4 yield (24.73 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and the decreased CO yield (10.16 mmol g A1 h A1 ).A similar result was observed by the dual In 2 S 3 -NiS co-decorated MoO 3 MoS 2 for solar-light driven reduction of CO 2 .The highest CH 4 yield (49.11 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and the lowest CO yield (6.19 mmol g A1 h A1 ) were obtained by the optimal 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 for solar light driven reduction of CO 2 .The photocatalytic activity of 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 for CO 2 photoreduction (Table S2) was better than those results of previous works.Hence, the in-situ sulfurization of nonthermal plasma was a useful route to prepare MoO 3 MoS 2 based junctions with excellent photocatalytic activity. The effect of total In 2 S 3 -NiS content on the photocatalytic activity of INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 with a In/Ni molar ratio of 2:1 was also carried out for CO 2 photoreduction in solar light region.CH 4 yield (Fig. 6B) increased and then decreased with an increase in the total In 2 S 3 -NiS content.A reverse result was observed by CO yield (Fig. 7C).Given the proper content of dual In 2 S 3 -NiS cocatalysts, the photo-excited electron-hole pairs were effectively separated for CO 2 reduction into CH 4 and CO.The excessive In 2 S 3 -NiS were randomly covered on the surface of MoO 3 MoS 2 serving as the recombination centers, hindering the transfer and separation of charge carriers at the junction interface.Hence, the effective heterojunction was vital for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of optimal 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 .For these INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 composites, the 7D).The declined durability of 3-INS/ MoO 3 MoS 2 for solar light driven CO 2 photoreduction was ascribed to the photo-corrosion 60,68. Although there was no change in the SEM images of used 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 (Fig. S9), the surface compositions and elemental states were different from fresh sample (Fig. 8).The XPS signals of Ni, O, In, Mo, and S elements (Fig. 8A) existed in fresh and used 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 , meaning that there was no loss of compositions after three cycle times.As depicted in Fig. 8B, the splitting Mo 3d peaks of fresh sample centered at 231.2 and 228.1 eV could be assigned to Mo 4 3d 3/2 and Mo 4 3d 5/2 of metallic 1T-phase MoS 2 , and the peaks at 234.2 and 233.0 eV were indexed to Mo 6 and Mo 5 ions, respectively 45,59.However, these Mo 3d peaks of used hybrid shifted to the higher values, and corresponding area ratio was also different from fresh sample.It's indicated that Mo 6 ions of MoO 3 can be reduced into Mo 4 ions of MoS 2 and Mo 5 states in the BDB discharge field due to the penetration effect.It's probable for an electron to appear in any position of an atom. When attacked by high-energy electrons in DBD reactor, the outer electron could pass through the inner electron shell and get close to the nucleus.Based on the penetration effect of quantum mechanics, the inner part of outer electrons exerted shielding effect on the inner electrons, and an increase in electron concentration of outer electrons favors the screening effect, leading to the declined binding energy of inner electron.Thus, the pristine h-MoO 3 was reduced to Mo 5 singles in DBD discharge field, which was seriously deteriorated by photo-corrosion. Two major peaks of In 3d in XPS spectrum of fresh 3-INS/ MoO 3 MoS 2 (Fig. 8C) located at 451.2 and 443.7 eV, which were assigned to In 3d 3/2 and In 3d 5/2 , respectively 57.These In 3d peaks of used sample changed to the higher values (451.6 eV, 444.0 eV).Ni 2p peaks of fresh hybrid at 869.8 and 852.5 eV (Fig. 8D) were respectively indexed to Ni 2p 1/2 and Ni 2p 3/2 , and the peak at 873.7 eV was the satellite peak of Ni 2p 1/2 58.However, these Ni 2p peaks of used composite shifted to 869.9, 852.6, and 873.9 eV, respectively.Previous works 45,49,54,59e61 Fig. 1 e XRD patterns of h-MoO 3 and MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites.Fig. 2 e Raman spectra of MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites.

For h-MoO 3 MoS 2 , the bands at 112, 123, 147, and 194 cm A1 were indexed as the lattice modes of h-MoO 3 , the bands at 214 and 236 cm A1 were ascribed to the E 1g modes of h-MoO 3 , and the band at 989 cm A1 belonged to the E 2g symmetrical stretching mode of MoO bond 47.The bands at 280, 334, 662, and 816 cm A1 were assigned to the O-defected a-MoO 3 , of which the peaks at 280 and 816 cm A1 were indexed to the bending mode of M 14 O vibration and the doubly coordinated oxygen stretching mode of Mo 2 -O, respectively 23.In addition, the band at 372 cm A1 was assigned to the E comparison to h-MoO 3 MoS 2 .Typically, the appearing band of In 2 S 3 /MoO 3 MoS 2 and 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 at 403 cm A1 was ascribed to the A 1g mode of out-plane vibration mode of MoS 2 12.In addition, the appearing peak of NiS/MoO 3 -MoS 2 and 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 at 118 cm A1 could be ascribed to the lattice modes of NiS.It's suggested that In2S3 and NiS existed in the obtained MoO 3 MoS 2 composites.The microstructure and morphology of h-MoO 3 , h-MoO 3 MoS 2 , and INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 samples were detected by SEM and TEM (Figs. 3 and4).h-MoO 3 prepared via chemical precipitation route (Fig. 3AeC) was the uniform hexagonal nanorods with the diameter of around 100 nm and the length of about 400 nm MoO 3 nanoparticles were in-situ sulfurized into MoS 2 nanoparticles on the surface of MoO 3 , and the hexagonal structure of h-MoO 3 was destroyed, especially at the edge sites (Fig. 3DeF).For 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 (Fig. 3GeI), In 3 and Ni 2 ions as well as h-MoO 3 nanoparticles were also converted into In 2 S 3 and NiS nanoparticles, which could further form the tight interface between In 2 S 3 , NiS, MoS 2 , and MoO 3 in the sulfurized process.This was also confirmed by TEM (Fig. 4A andB) and HRTEM images (Fig. 4C andD).Part of MoS 2 nanoparticles were coated on the surface of MoO 3 to form core-shell structure, and there were many small nanoparticles detected in 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 .With an increase in the total In 2 S 3 -NiS content, much more nanoparticles were loaded on the bulks surface and even isolated from MoO 3 -MoS 2 bulks (Fig. S2).The elemental mapping images (Fig. 4EeI andS3) confirmed that Mo, Ni, In, S, and O elements existed in 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 , meaning the formation of In 2 S 3 -NiS codecorated MoO 3 MoS 2 .As listed in Table S1, the specific surface area of h-MoO 3 (28.73m 2 g A1 ) was higher than MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites, and the corresponding value of INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 decreased with an increase in the In 2 S 3 -NiS co-loading content. Fig. 5 presented the light-harvesting and photoelectrochemical behaviors of h-MoO 3 and MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites.In contrast with h-MoO 3 , the narrow band gap and deep color of h-MoO 3 MoS 2 induced to the extending photo-response in visible light region (Fig. 5A).Although the addition of single In 2 S 3 and NiS were not suitable for the enhanced light absorption, the dual effect of In 2 S 3 -NiS could enhance the light-capturing capacity of INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 .The light harvesting intensity of INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 increased with the increasing total content of In 2 S 3 -NiS (Fig. S4).According to the plots of KubelkaeMunk equation (Fig. S5), the estimated band-gap energies (E g ) of obtained INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 (Table S1) were narrower than that of h-MoO 3 (2.81eV), of which E g value of 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 was 2.35 eV.When intermittently irradiated in visible light region with the on-off cycles, the distinct on-off ration in photocurrent (Fig. 5B andS6) reflected the efficient separation of charge carriers of these samples.The in-situ sulfurization of DBD plasma was favorable for enhancing photocurrent intensity of h-MoO 3 .The single NiS and In 2 S 3 hampered the photocurrent intensity, while the dual In 2 S 3 -NiS greatly enhanced the photocurrent capacity of h-MoO 3 MoS 2 .3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 with a nominal NiS-In 2 S 3 content of 5.0 wt presented the strongest photocurrent intensity among these composites.Under visible light irradiation, the photocurrent of 3-INS/ MoO 3 MoS 2 increased with the increasing turn-on time, while decreased with the increasing turn-off time.It's indicated that the obtained 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 could efficiently capture photons and achieve the transfer and separation of photo-induced carriers 49,50.For the electrochemical impedance spectra, the arc radius of h-MoO 3 MoS 2 was smaller than h-MoO 3 , which was further shrank by the presence of In 2 S 3 and NiS, especially dual In 2 S 3 -NiS (Fig. 5C andS7).It's indicated that the addition of In 2 S 3 , NiS, and dual In 2 S 3 -NiS efficiently restrained the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs. The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) potential of obtained samples greatly affected their redox ability during the photo-induced reaction process.The bottom of conduction band (LUMO) was approximately equal to the flat band (E FB ) potential of n-type semiconductors estimated by Mott-Schottky plots in previous works 51,52.The positive slopes of Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 5D andS8) indicated that MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites as well as h-MoO 3 were the ntype semiconductors.The work function of NiS and In 2 S 3 resulted in the different flat band potentials of these samples 50,53.The E FB and E CB of optimal 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 (Table S1) were A0.72 V and A0.52 eV, respectively.The E VB potential of 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 estimated from E g and E CB was 1.83 eV.It's indicated that 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 was suitable for the solar light driven CO 2 photoreduction.PL spectra (Fig. 6) suggested that PL intensity of 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 was weaker than that of h-MoO 3 , h-MoO 3 MoS 2 , In 2 S 3 /MoO 3 MoS 2 , and NiS/MoO 3 MoS 2 , meaning the excellent separation of electron-holes pairs. The photocatalytic activities of h-MoO 3 and MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites were performed for the solar light driven conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 and CO (Fig. 7).Although the large BET surface area could provide sufficient active sites for photons capture and reactants adsorption, the efficient separation and migration of charge carriers at junction interface were vital for the photocatalytic capacity of obtained compositions.In contrast with h-MO 3 , h-MoO 3 MoS 2 (Fig. 7A) presented the higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 photoreduction, and CH 4 and CO yields respectively increased to 15.75 and 22.26 mmol g A1 h A1 .It's ascribed to the efficient transfer and separation of charge carriers at the tight interface between MoO 3 and MoS 2 39,41.Due to the combined effect of cocatalysts such as In 2 S 3 and NiS, the photocatalytic activity of MoO 3 MoS 2 for CO 2 photoreduction was further enhanced, especially the dual In 2 S 3 -NiS co-decorating.NiS and In 2 S 3 were the efficient mediators for the band-gap structure and energy position of band edges, enhancing the transfer and migration of photo-generated electron-hole pairs 39,53,54.The addition of In 2 S 3 into MoO 3 MoS 2 enhanced the conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 (21.70 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and CO (25.14 mmol g A1 h A1 ).However, NiS/MoO 3 MoS 2 exhibited the increased CH 4 yield (24.73 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and the decreased CO yield (10.16 mmol g A1 h A1 ).A similar result was observed by the dual In 2 S 3 -NiS co-decorated MoO 3 MoS 2 for solar-light driven reduction of CO 2 .The highest CH 4 yield (49.11 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and the lowest CO yield (6.19 mmol g A1 h A1 ) were obtained by the optimal 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 for solar light driven reduction of CO 2 .The photocatalytic activity of 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 for CO 2 photoreduction (Table S2) was better than those results of previous works.Hence, the in-situ sulfurization of nonthermal plasma was a useful route to prepare MoO 3 MoS 2 based junctions with excellent photocatalytic activity. The effect of total In 2 S 3 -NiS content on the photocatalytic activity of INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 with a In/Ni molar ratio of 2:1 was also carried out for CO 2 photoreduction in solar light region.CH 4 yield (Fig. 6B) increased and then decreased with an increase in the total In 2 S 3 -NiS content.A reverse result was observed by CO yield (Fig. 7C).Given the proper content of dual In 2 S 3 -NiS cocatalysts, the photo-excited electron-hole pairs were effectively separated for CO 2 reduction into CH 4 and CO.The excessive In 2 S 3 -NiS were randomly covered on the surface of MoO 3 MoS 2 serving as the recombination centers, hindering the transfer and separation of charge carriers at the junction interface.Hence, the effective heterojunction was vital for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of optimal 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 .For these INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 composites, the 7D).The declined durability of 3-INS/ MoO 3 MoS 2 for solar light driven CO 2 photoreduction was ascribed to the photo-corrosion 60,68. Although there was no change in the SEM images of used 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 (Fig. S9), the surface compositions and elemental states were different from fresh sample (Fig. 8).The XPS signals of Ni, O, In, Mo, and S elements (Fig. 8A) existed in fresh and used 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 , meaning that there was no loss of compositions after three cycle times.As depicted in Fig. 8B, the splitting Mo 3d peaks of fresh sample centered at 231.2 and 228.1 eV could be assigned to Mo 4 3d 3/2 and Mo 4 3d 5/2 of metallic 1T-phase MoS 2 , and the peaks at 234.2 and 233.0 eV were indexed to Mo 6 and Mo 5 ions, respectively 45,59.However, these Mo 3d peaks of used hybrid shifted to the higher values, and corresponding area ratio was also different from fresh sample.It's indicated that Mo 6 ions of MoO 3 can be reduced into Mo 4 ions of MoS 2 and Mo 5 states in the BDB discharge field due to the penetration effect.It's probable for an electron to appear in any position of an atom. When attacked by high-energy electrons in DBD reactor, the outer electron could pass through the inner electron shell and get close to the nucleus.Based on the penetration effect of quantum mechanics, the inner part of outer electrons exerted shielding effect on the inner electrons, and an increase in electron concentration of outer electrons favors the screening effect, leading to the declined binding energy of inner electron.Thus, the pristine h-MoO 3 was reduced to Mo 5 singles in DBD discharge field, which was seriously deteriorated by photo-corrosion. Two major peaks of In 3d in XPS spectrum of fresh 3-INS/ MoO 3 MoS 2 (Fig. 8C) located at 451.2 and 443.7 eV, which were assigned to In 3d 3/2 and In 3d 5/2 , respectively 57.These In 3d peaks of used sample changed to the higher values (451.6 eV, 444.0 eV).Ni 2p peaks of fresh hybrid at 869.8 and 852.5 eV (Fig. 8D) were respectively indexed to Ni 2p 1/2 and Ni 2p 3/2 , and the peak at 873.7 eV was the satellite peak of Ni 2p 1/2 58.However, these Ni 2p peaks of used composite shifted to 869.9, 852.6, and 873.9 eV, respectively.Previous works 45,49,54,59e61 Fig. 1 e XRD patterns of h-MoO 3 and MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites.Fig. 2 e Raman spectra of MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites.

For h-MoO 3 MoS 2 , the bands at 112, 123, 147, and 194 cm A1 were indexed as the lattice modes of h-MoO 3 , the bands at 214 and 236 cm A1 were ascribed to the E 1g modes of h-MoO 3 , and the band at 989 cm A1 belonged to the E 2g symmetrical stretching mode of MoO bond 47.The bands at 280, 334, 662, and 816 cm A1 were assigned to the O-defected a-MoO 3 , of which the peaks at 280 and 816 cm A1 were indexed to the bending mode of M 14 O vibration and the doubly coordinated oxygen stretching mode of Mo 2 -O, respectively 23.In addition, the band at 372 cm A1 was assigned to the E comparison to h-MoO 3 MoS 2 .Typically, the appearing band of In 2 S 3 /MoO 3 MoS 2 and 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 at 403 cm A1 was ascribed to the A 1g mode of out-plane vibration mode of MoS 2 12.In addition, the appearing peak of NiS/MoO 3 -MoS 2 and 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 at 118 cm A1 could be ascribed to the lattice modes of NiS.It's suggested that In2S3 and NiS existed in the obtained MoO 3 MoS 2 composites.The microstructure and morphology of h-MoO 3 , h-MoO 3 MoS 2 , and INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 samples were detected by SEM and TEM (Figs. 3 and4).h-MoO 3 prepared via chemical precipitation route (Fig. 3AeC) was the uniform hexagonal nanorods with the diameter of around 100 nm and the length of about 400 nm MoO 3 nanoparticles were in-situ sulfurized into MoS 2 nanoparticles on the surface of MoO 3 , and the hexagonal structure of h-MoO 3 was destroyed, especially at the edge sites (Fig. 3DeF).For 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 (Fig. 3GeI), In 3 and Ni 2 ions as well as h-MoO 3 nanoparticles were also converted into In 2 S 3 and NiS nanoparticles, which could further form the tight interface between In 2 S 3 , NiS, MoS 2 , and MoO 3 in the sulfurized process.This was also confirmed by TEM (Fig. 4A andB) and HRTEM images (Fig. 4C andD).Part of MoS 2 nanoparticles were coated on the surface of MoO 3 to form core-shell structure, and there were many small nanoparticles detected in 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 .With an increase in the total In 2 S 3 -NiS content, much more nanoparticles were loaded on the bulks surface and even isolated from MoO 3 -MoS 2 bulks (Fig. S2).The elemental mapping images (Fig. 4EeI andS3) confirmed that Mo, Ni, In, S, and O elements existed in 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 , meaning the formation of In 2 S 3 -NiS codecorated MoO 3 MoS 2 .As listed in Table S1, the specific surface area of h-MoO 3 (28.73m 2 g A1 ) was higher than MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites, and the corresponding value of INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 decreased with an increase in the In 2 S 3 -NiS co-loading content. Fig. 5 presented the light-harvesting and photoelectrochemical behaviors of h-MoO 3 and MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites.In contrast with h-MoO 3 , the narrow band gap and deep color of h-MoO 3 MoS 2 induced to the extending photo-response in visible light region (Fig. 5A).Although the addition of single In 2 S 3 and NiS were not suitable for the enhanced light absorption, the dual effect of In 2 S 3 -NiS could enhance the light-capturing capacity of INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 .The light harvesting intensity of INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 increased with the increasing total content of In 2 S 3 -NiS (Fig. S4).According to the plots of KubelkaeMunk equation (Fig. S5), the estimated band-gap energies (E g ) of obtained INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 (Table S1) were narrower than that of h-MoO 3 (2.81eV), of which E g value of 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 was 2.35 eV.When intermittently irradiated in visible light region with the on-off cycles, the distinct on-off ration in photocurrent (Fig. 5B andS6) reflected the efficient separation of charge carriers of these samples.The in-situ sulfurization of DBD plasma was favorable for enhancing photocurrent intensity of h-MoO 3 .The single NiS and In 2 S 3 hampered the photocurrent intensity, while the dual In 2 S 3 -NiS greatly enhanced the photocurrent capacity of h-MoO 3 MoS 2 .3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 with a nominal NiS-In 2 S 3 content of 5.0 wt presented the strongest photocurrent intensity among these composites.Under visible light irradiation, the photocurrent of 3-INS/ MoO 3 MoS 2 increased with the increasing turn-on time, while decreased with the increasing turn-off time.It's indicated that the obtained 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 could efficiently capture photons and achieve the transfer and separation of photo-induced carriers 49,50.For the electrochemical impedance spectra, the arc radius of h-MoO 3 MoS 2 was smaller than h-MoO 3 , which was further shrank by the presence of In 2 S 3 and NiS, especially dual In 2 S 3 -NiS (Fig. 5C andS7).It's indicated that the addition of In 2 S 3 , NiS, and dual In 2 S 3 -NiS efficiently restrained the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs. The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) potential of obtained samples greatly affected their redox ability during the photo-induced reaction process.The bottom of conduction band (LUMO) was approximately equal to the flat band (E FB ) potential of n-type semiconductors estimated by Mott-Schottky plots in previous works 51,52.The positive slopes of Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 5D andS8) indicated that MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites as well as h-MoO 3 were the ntype semiconductors.The work function of NiS and In 2 S 3 resulted in the different flat band potentials of these samples 50,53.The E FB and E CB of optimal 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 (Table S1) were A0.72 V and A0.52 eV, respectively.The E VB potential of 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 estimated from E g and E CB was 1.83 eV.It's indicated that 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 was suitable for the solar light driven CO 2 photoreduction.PL spectra (Fig. 6) suggested that PL intensity of 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 was weaker than that of h-MoO 3 , h-MoO 3 MoS 2 , In 2 S 3 /MoO 3 MoS 2 , and NiS/MoO 3 MoS 2 , meaning the excellent separation of electron-holes pairs. The photocatalytic activities of h-MoO 3 and MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites were performed for the solar light driven conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 and CO (Fig. 7).Although the large BET surface area could provide sufficient active sites for photons capture and reactants adsorption, the efficient separation and migration of charge carriers at junction interface were vital for the photocatalytic capacity of obtained compositions.In contrast with h-MO 3 , h-MoO 3 MoS 2 (Fig. 7A) presented the higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 photoreduction, and CH 4 and CO yields respectively increased to 15.75 and 22.26 mmol g A1 h A1 .It's ascribed to the efficient transfer and separation of charge carriers at the tight interface between MoO 3 and MoS 2 39,41.Due to the combined effect of cocatalysts such as In 2 S 3 and NiS, the photocatalytic activity of MoO 3 MoS 2 for CO 2 photoreduction was further enhanced, especially the dual In 2 S 3 -NiS co-decorating.NiS and In 2 S 3 were the efficient mediators for the band-gap structure and energy position of band edges, enhancing the transfer and migration of photo-generated electron-hole pairs 39,53,54.The addition of In 2 S 3 into MoO 3 MoS 2 enhanced the conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 (21.70 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and CO (25.14 mmol g A1 h A1 ).However, NiS/MoO 3 MoS 2 exhibited the increased CH 4 yield (24.73 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and the decreased CO yield (10.16 mmol g A1 h A1 ).A similar result was observed by the dual In 2 S 3 -NiS co-decorated MoO 3 MoS 2 for solar-light driven reduction of CO 2 .The highest CH 4 yield (49.11 mmol g A1 h A1 ) and the lowest CO yield (6.19 mmol g A1 h A1 ) were obtained by the optimal 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 for solar light driven reduction of CO 2 .The photocatalytic activity of 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 for CO 2 photoreduction (Table S2) was better than those results of previous works.Hence, the in-situ sulfurization of nonthermal plasma was a useful route to prepare MoO 3 MoS 2 based junctions with excellent photocatalytic activity. The effect of total In 2 S 3 -NiS content on the photocatalytic activity of INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 with a In/Ni molar ratio of 2:1 was also carried out for CO 2 photoreduction in solar light region.CH 4 yield (Fig. 6B) increased and then decreased with an increase in the total In 2 S 3 -NiS content.A reverse result was observed by CO yield (Fig. 7C).Given the proper content of dual In 2 S 3 -NiS cocatalysts, the photo-excited electron-hole pairs were effectively separated for CO 2 reduction into CH 4 and CO.The excessive In 2 S 3 -NiS were randomly covered on the surface of MoO 3 MoS 2 serving as the recombination centers, hindering the transfer and separation of charge carriers at the junction interface.Hence, the effective heterojunction was vital for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of optimal 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 .For these INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 composites, the 7D).The declined durability of 3-INS/ MoO 3 MoS 2 for solar light driven CO 2 photoreduction was ascribed to the photo-corrosion 60,68. Although there was no change in the SEM images of used 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 (Fig. S9), the surface compositions and elemental states were different from fresh sample (Fig. 8).The XPS signals of Ni, O, In, Mo, and S elements (Fig. 8A) existed in fresh and used 3-INS/MoO 3 MoS 2 , meaning that there was no loss of compositions after three cycle times.As depicted in Fig. 8B, the splitting Mo 3d peaks of fresh sample centered at 231.2 and 228.1 eV could be assigned to Mo 4 3d 3/2 and Mo 4 3d 5/2 of metallic 1T-phase MoS 2 , and the peaks at 234.2 and 233.0 eV were indexed to Mo 6 and Mo 5 ions, respectively 45,59.However, these Mo 3d peaks of used hybrid shifted to the higher values, and corresponding area ratio was also different from fresh sample.It's indicated that Mo 6 ions of MoO 3 can be reduced into Mo 4 ions of MoS 2 and Mo 5 states in the BDB discharge field due to the penetration effect.It's probable for an electron to appear in any position of an atom. When attacked by high-energy electrons in DBD reactor, the outer electron could pass through the inner electron shell and get close to the nucleus.Based on the penetration effect of quantum mechanics, the inner part of outer electrons exerted shielding effect on the inner electrons, and an increase in electron concentration of outer electrons favors the screening effect, leading to the declined binding energy of inner electron.Thus, the pristine h-MoO 3 was reduced to Mo 5 singles in DBD discharge field, which was seriously deteriorated by photo-corrosion. Two major peaks of In 3d in XPS spectrum of fresh 3-INS/ MoO 3 MoS 2 (Fig. 8C) located at 451.2 and 443.7 eV, which were assigned to In 3d 3/2 and In 3d 5/2 , respectively 57.These In 3d peaks of used sample changed to the higher values (451.6 eV, 444.0 eV).Ni 2p peaks of fresh hybrid at 869.8 and 852.5 eV (Fig. 8D) were respectively indexed to Ni 2p 1/2 and Ni 2p 3/2 , and the peak at 873.7 eV was the satellite peak of Ni 2p 1/2 58.However, these Ni 2p peaks of used composite shifted to 869.9, 852.6, and 873.9 eV, respectively.Previous works 45,49,54,59e61 Fig. 1 e XRD patterns of h-MoO 3 and MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites.Fig. 2 e Raman spectra of MoO 3 MoS 2 based composites.
