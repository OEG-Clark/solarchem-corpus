positioned at 2-thetea of 13.10 o and 27.44 o , relating to polymeric structure graphitic carbon nitride.Similarly, WO3 peaks in WO3/g-C3N4 composite were appeared at 2- of 23.01o, 23.52o, 24.25o,

importantly, all the peaks relating to g-C3N4 were appeared in the composite of WO3/g-C3N4, confirming, successful fabrication of composite through ultrasonic approach.Figure 1b presents photoluminescence (PL) plots of pristine g-C3N4 and WO3/g-C3N4 composite.Obviously, highest PL intensity was obtained in pristine g-C3N4 due to fast charges recombination rate.However, a gradual declined in PL intensity was observed when g-C3N4 was coupled with WO3.This declined in PL intensity was due to faster charge carrier separation with hindered recombination rate over the WO3/g-C3N4 composite sample.This further confirms successful fabrication of WO3/g-C3N4 heterojunction.The morphology of g-C3N4 and WO3/g-C3N4 composite were further investigated using FESEM and TEM characterization techniques and results are demonstrated in Figure 2. Figure 2a show morphology of g-C3N4, in which, obvious two-dimensional folded sheets of graphitic carbon nitrides could be observed.FESEM image in Figure 2b shows morphology of WO3/g-C3N4 composite.It could be seen a good dispersion of WO3 with g-C3N4 nanosheets.A further interaction of WO3 with 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets could be observed in TEM image as demonstrated in Figure 2c.Obviously, WO3 microspheres were distributed over g-C3N4 nanosheets, producing a heterojunction between both the semiconductors.The UV-visible analysis was further conducted to determine band gap energy and light absorption trends of g-C3N4 and WO3/g-C3N4 samples.Obviously, both g-C3N4 and WO3/g-C3N4 has response of light absorption under visible light.The light absorption wavelengths of 461.35, 443.58 and 432.96 nm were obtained for WO3, g-C3N4 and WO3/g-C3N4 samples.This confirms higher visible light absorption of the samples and would be beneficial for photocatalytic CO2 reduction applications (Tahir et al., 2020).The band gap energies of 2.70, 2.81 and 2.88 eV were obtained for WO3, g-C3N4 and WO3/g-C3N4 samples. The photoactivity test of g-C3N4, WO3 and WO3/g-C3N4 for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with CH4 in the presence of water through bi-reforming of methane (BRM) under visible light irradiations in a fixed bed photoreactor.The amount of photocatalyst loaded was 0.15 g, dispersed uniformly inside the reactor.The feed ratio of CO2/CH4 of 1.0 was employed for all the experiments.All the reactions were conducted at normal temperature and atmospheric pressure. Figure 3a shows photocatalytic CO2 reduction for the production CO evolution over g-C3N4, WO3 and WO3/g-C3N4 photocatalysts during photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O/CH4 photocatalysts.Using pure WO3, 35 mol g-cat -1 h -1 for CO was detected.Comparatively, 105 mol g-cat -1 h -1 of CO was obtained over g-C3N4 photocatalyst.Obviously, lower photoactivity was attained over WO3 due to its reduction potential (0.76 eV) (Ye and Web, 2019), which is more positive than is required for CO2 reduction (-0.48 eV).Besides, g-C3N4 has 2D layered structure, and efficient charges separation efficiency for photocatalytic reaction in addition of higher reduction potential (CB -1.20 eV).When, WO3/g-C3N4 were coupled highest photoactivity of 310 mol g-cat -1 h -1 of CO was attained.This significantly enhanced photoactivity of WO3/g-C3N4 composite was evidently due to faster charges separation with good oxidation and reduction potentials for DRM reaction under visible light irradiations (Guo et al., 2020).This confirms significantly enhanced performance of WO3/g-C3N4 composite and it can be further employed for investigating different reforming reactions.reactions were further investigated.Using BRM and RWGS reactions, highest amount of CO was evolved under the same reaction conditions.It could be concluded that WO3/g-C3N4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation and can be employed in other solar energy assisted applications.due to efficient charges separation and higher visible light absorption.

J130000.7851.4L900). The performance of WO3/g-C3N4 composite catalyst was further tested in different reforming reactions such as DRM, BRM and RWGS reaction.The production of CO in Figure 3b shows 8.2 folds-higher production of CO using BRM process compared to DRM process under the same reaction conditions.The higher photocatalytic activity for CO evolution through BRM process was due to adding water (H2O) in CO2/CH4 feed system.The water provides higher number of protons (H ) with the involvement of lower light energy.This confirms BRM process is more efficient for maximizing the photoactivity of WO3/g-C3N4 composite due to the presence of both methane/waters reducing agents with CO2 during photocatalysis process.The performance of WO3/g-C3N4 composite catalyst was further tested in different photocatalytic systems such as reduction of CO2 with H2O, photocatalytic reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGSR), DRM and BRM reactions as shown in Figure 3c.It could be seen that highest CO evolution rate was attained during CO2 reduction in the presence of hydrogen through RWGS reaction.Using DRM process lowest CO production was obtained due to high stability of CO2 and CH4 molecules.Using water and CO2, higher amount of CO was evolved compared to DRM reaction, but lower than RWGS and BRM reactions.All these findings confirm that not only photocatalyst, but reforming reactions are also important to maximize photocatalysis process.The selection of both photocatalyst and reducing agents are crucial for selective production of fuels during CO2 conversion under visible light irradiation.Previously, photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O over Pd-Au/TiO2-WO3 for CO and CH4 production (Zhu et al., 2018), higher CO/CH4 production over WO3-TiO2/Cu2ZnSnS4 (Raza et al., 2020) and WO3/g-C3N4 with CO and CH4 production (Li et al., 2020) have been investigated.Comparatively, efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction with CO and H2 production through DRM and BRM was observed over WO3/g-C3N4 composite through the involvement of Eq(1) and Eq(2). The photocatalytic CO2 reduction using water/methane reducing agnets over WO3/g-C3N4 composite under visible light involves oxidation and reduction reaction through the involvement of electrons and holes has been illustarted in Figure 3d.When visible light strike over the composite catalyst WO3 is activated first due to its lower bandgap energy (Eg 2.70 ) as illustarted in Eq(3), produicng electrons and holes.As the CB of WO3 is more positive (CB 0.74) (Ye and Wen., 2019) than g-C3N4 conduction band (CB -1.20).The photogenerated electrons have potential to transfer from CB of WO3 towards VB of g-C3N4, enabling their efficient separation (Eq4).The photogenerated electrons are consued during CO2 reduction process with CO production and holes were consumed for water and methane oxidation through the reactions in Eqs( 5) to (7). - 3 4 3 ( -) - 3 4 ( -) 3 (4) Accoridng to experimental results, CO2 was efficiently converted to CO through different reforming reactions such as DRM, BRM and RWGS reactions.The significantly enhanced phototacivity for CO2 reduction over WO3/g-C3N4 composite was due to Z-scheme heterojunction formation with efficient charges separation."}, {"llm generation": "WO3/g-C3N4", "source": "The WO3/g-C3N4 composite catalyst was successfully synthesized and tested for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light irradiations.", "context": "The WO3/g-C3N4 composite catalyst was successfully synthesized and tested for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light irradiations.In Z-scheme WO3/g-C3N4 composite, efficient charge separation was observed enabling more production of CO during photocatalytic dry and bireforming reactions.The highest CO production of 310 mol g-cat -1 h -1 over WO3/g-C3N4 composite was achieved.The performance of different reforming reactions such as dry reforming of methane, bireforming of methane and reverse water gas shift"}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [{"llm generation": "Monochromatic", "source": "A HID Xenon lamp with power 35 W with wavelength 420 nm and intensity 20 mW cm -2 was used as a source of visible light.", "context": "The bulk g-C3N4 was prepared by heating melamine (Sigma Aldrich) at 550 oC for 2 h in a muffle furnace under air atmosphere.The product obtained was grinded to get bulk g-C3N4, which was further treated with acetic acid and dried overnight to get g-C3N4 (Tahir et al., 2020).For the synthesis of WO3/g-C3N4 composite, ultrasonic assisted physical mixing approach was employed.Typically, 1 g of g-C3N4 was dispersed in a methanol and stirred for 6 12 h to get uniform dispersion.Afterwards, specific amount of WO3 (50 wt g-C3N4) dispersed in a methanol was added to above solution under stirring for another 12 h.Finally, samples were dried at 100 o C overnight to get WO3/g-C3N4 composite samples.All the samples were characterized using XRD, PL SEM, TEM and UV visible techniques.X-ray diffraction (XRD, RIGAKU), operated with Cu-K radiation at 0.154178 nm, 40 kV and 30 mA.The morphologies were obtained by FESEM, ZEISS Crossbeam 340 and TEM, HITACHI HT7700.The PL analysis was conducted using Lab RAM HR Evolution, HORIBA and UV-visible analysis was conducted using Cary 100 Agilent, Model G9821 A.

g-C3N4 presents two peaks positioned at 2-thetea of 13.10 o and 27.44 o , relating to polymeric structure graphitic carbon nitride.Similarly, WO3 peaks in WO3/g-C3N4 composite were appeared at 2- of 23.01o, 23.52o, 24.25o, 26.49o 28.55o, 28.83o, 33.17o, 33.47 o , 34.07o, 35.52o, 41.39o,41.83o,47.15o,48.21o, and 49.81o, confirming the presence of WO3 in the composite sample (Card no 01-083-0950) (Tahir et al., 2020).More importantly, all the peaks relating to g-C3N4 were appeared in the composite of WO3/g-C3N4, confirming, successful fabrication of composite through ultrasonic approach.Figure 1b presents photoluminescence (PL) plots of pristine g-C3N4 and WO3/g-C3N4 composite.Obviously, highest PL intensity was obtained in pristine g-C3N4 due to fast charges recombination rate.However, a gradual declined in PL intensity was observed when g-C3N4 was coupled with WO3.This declined in PL intensity was due to faster charge carrier separation with hindered recombination rate over the WO3/g-C3N4 composite sample.This further confirms successful fabrication of WO3/g-C3N4 heterojunction.The morphology of g-C3N4 and WO3/g-C3N4 composite were further investigated using FESEM and TEM characterization techniques and results are demonstrated in Figure 2. Figure 2a show morphology of g-C3N4, in which, obvious two-dimensional folded sheets of graphitic carbon nitrides could be observed.FESEM image in Figure 2b shows morphology of WO3/g-C3N4 composite.It could be seen a good dispersion of WO3 with g-C3N4 nanosheets.A further interaction of WO3 with 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets could be observed in TEM image as demonstrated in Figure 2c.Obviously, WO3 microspheres were distributed over g-C3N4 nanosheets, producing a heterojunction between both the semiconductors.The UV-visible analysis was further conducted to determine band gap energy and light absorption trends of g-C3N4 and WO3/g-C3N4 samples.Obviously, both g-C3N4 and WO3/g-C3N4 has response of light absorption under visible light.The light absorption wavelengths of 461.35, 443.58 and 432.96 nm were obtained for WO3, g-C3N4 and WO3/g-C3N4 samples.This confirms higher visible light absorption of the samples and would be beneficial for photocatalytic CO2 reduction applications (Tahir et al., 2020).The band gap energies of 2.70, 2.81 and 2.88 eV were obtained for WO3, g-C3N4 and WO3/g-C3N4 samples. The photoactivity test of g-C3N4, WO3 and WO3/g-C3N4 for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with CH4 in the presence of water through bi-reforming of methane (BRM) under visible light irradiations in a fixed bed photoreactor.The amount of photocatalyst loaded was 0.15 g, dispersed uniformly inside the reactor.The feed ratio of CO2/CH4 of 1.0 was employed for all the experiments.All the reactions were conducted at normal temperature and atmospheric pressure. Figure 3a shows photocatalytic CO2 reduction for the production CO evolution over g-C3N4, WO3 and WO3/g-C3N4 photocatalysts during photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O/CH4 photocatalysts.Using pure WO3, 35 mol g-cat -1 h -1 for CO was detected.Comparatively, 105 mol g-cat -1 h -1 of CO was obtained over g-C3N4 photocatalyst.Obviously, lower photoactivity was attained over WO3 due to its reduction potential (0.76 eV) (Ye and Web, 2019), which is more positive than is required for CO2 reduction (-0.48 eV).Besides, g-C3N4 has 2D layered structure, and efficient charges separation efficiency for photocatalytic reaction in addition of higher reduction potential (CB -1.20 eV).When, WO3/g-C3N4 were coupled highest photoactivity of 310 mol g-cat -1 h -1 of CO was attained.This significantly enhanced photoactivity of WO3/g-C3N4 composite was evidently due to faster charges separation with good oxidation and reduction potentials for DRM reaction under visible light irradiations (Guo et al., 2020).This confirms significantly enhanced performance of WO3/g-C3N4 composite and it can be further employed for investigating different reforming reactions.reactions were further investigated.Using BRM and RWGS reactions, highest amount of CO was evolved under the same reaction conditions.It could be concluded that WO3/g-C3N4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation and can be employed in other solar energy assisted applications.due to efficient charges separation and higher visible light absorption.

J130000.7851.4L900). The performance of WO3/g-C3N4 composite catalyst was further tested in different reforming reactions such as DRM, BRM and RWGS reaction.The production of CO in Figure 3b shows 8.2 folds-higher production of CO using BRM process compared to DRM process under the same reaction conditions.The higher photocatalytic activity for CO evolution through BRM process was due to adding water (H2O) in CO2/CH4 feed system.The water provides higher number of protons (H ) with the involvement of lower light energy.This confirms BRM process is more efficient for maximizing the photoactivity of WO3/g-C3N4 composite due to the presence of both methane/waters reducing agents with CO2 during photocatalysis process.The performance of WO3/g-C3N4 composite catalyst was further tested in different photocatalytic systems such as reduction of CO2 with H2O, photocatalytic reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGSR), DRM and BRM reactions as shown in Figure 3c.It could be seen that highest CO evolution rate was attained during CO2 reduction in the presence of hydrogen through RWGS reaction.Using DRM process lowest CO production was obtained due to high stability of CO2 and CH4 molecules.Using water and CO2, higher amount of CO was evolved compared to DRM reaction, but lower than RWGS and BRM reactions.All these findings confirm that not only photocatalyst, but reforming reactions are also important to maximize photocatalysis process.The selection of both photocatalyst and reducing agents are crucial for selective production of fuels during CO2 conversion under visible light irradiation.Previously, photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O over Pd-Au/TiO2-WO3 for CO and CH4 production (Zhu et al., 2018), higher CO/CH4 production over WO3-TiO2/Cu2ZnSnS4 (Raza et al., 2020) and WO3/g-C3N4 with CO and CH4 production (Li et al., 2020) have been investigated.Comparatively, efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction with CO and H2 production through DRM and BRM was observed over WO3/g-C3N4 composite through the involvement of Eq(1) and Eq(2). The photocatalytic CO2 reduction using water/methane reducing agnets over WO3/g-C3N4 composite under visible light involves oxidation and reduction reaction through the involvement of electrons and holes has been illustarted in Figure 3d.When visible light strike over the composite catalyst WO3 is activated first due to its lower bandgap energy (Eg 2.70 ) as illustarted in Eq(3), produicng electrons and holes.As the CB of WO3 is more positive (CB 0.74) (Ye and Wen., 2019) than g-C3N4 conduction band (CB -1.20).The photogenerated electrons have potential to transfer from CB of WO3 towards VB of g-C3N4, enabling their efficient separation (Eq4).The photogenerated electrons are consued during CO2 reduction process with CO production and holes were consumed for water and methane oxidation through the reactions in Eqs( 5) to (7). - 3 4 3 ( -) - 3 4 ( -) 3 (4) Accoridng to experimental results, CO2 was efficiently converted to CO through different reforming reactions such as DRM, BRM and RWGS reactions.The significantly enhanced phototacivity for CO2 reduction over WO3/g-C3N4 composite was due to Z-scheme heterojunction formation with efficient charges separation."}], "operation mode": []}}
