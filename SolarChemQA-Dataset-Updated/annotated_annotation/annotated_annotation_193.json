Meanwhile, TiO 2 cuboids with less 100 facets exposed were also prepared in comparison to the 95 of 100 facets exposed TiO 2 nanosheets.The TiO 2 cuboids were synthesized following the method reported by Pan et al. via reacting 32 mg of TiOSO 4 in 40 mL of HF solution (40 mM) at 180 C for 2 h, then calcining at 600 C for 2 h to remove the surface fluorine. 7The obtained TiO 2 cuboids with clean surfaces are denoted as T Cuboids . Characterizations.X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Multiflex diffractometer (RINT 2000; Rigaku Corp. Japan) with monochromatized Cu Ka radiation ( 1.54178A).The size and morphology of the samples were observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6701F, JEOL Co., Japan) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-200 CX, JEOL) operating at 200 kV.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were deducted by a surface area analyser (BEL Sorp-II mini, BEL Japan Co., Japan) with nitrogen absorption at 77 K. Raman measurement was carried out using Raman spectroscopy (NRS-1000; Jasco Corp. Japan).UV-visible absorption spectra were measured on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2500 PC, Shimadzu Co., Japan).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on Thermo ESCALAB250 using monochromatized Al Ka at h 1486.6eV.The binding energies were calibrated to the C1s peak by 284.6 eV.The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were measured to confirm the presence of oxygen vacancy on JEOL JES-FA200 Electron Spin Resonance Spectrometer at ambient temperature.The CO 2 pulse chemisorption tests were carried out on Micromeritics Autochem II Chemisorption Analyzer at 35 C with a fixed volume loop of 0.05 mL. Photocatalytic H 2 Evolution.The photocatalytic reactions of H 2 evolution were carried out in a closed gas circulation system with an external-irradiation type of a glass reactor.The light source was a 300 W Xenon arc lamp.The intensity of the light at 300-800 nm was measured to be 240 mW/cm 2 by using a spectroradiometer (USR-40; Ushio Inc., Japan).The co-catalyst Pt was loaded by an in-situ photodeposition method.The 1 wt of Pt-loaded catalyst (60 mg) was dispersed with a magnetic stirrer in a methanol aqueous solution (50 mL of CH 3 OH and 220 mL of H 2 O).The evolved gas including H 2 was analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (GC-8A; Shimadzu) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). CO 2 Photoreduction.In the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , 40 mg of the sample without any cocatalyst was uniformly dispersed on a glass reactor with a base area of 8.1 cm 2 .A 300 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the light source for the photocatalytic reaction.The volume of the reaction system was around 390 mL.The reaction setup was vacuum treated several times, and then high-purity CO 2 gas was introduced into the reaction system to achieve a pressure of 80 kPa.Deionized water (3 mL) was injected into the reaction system.During the irradiation, about 0.5 mL of gas was taken from the reaction cell at given intervals for subsequent CH 4 concentration analysis using a gas chromatograph (GC-14B, Shimadzu) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and methanizer."}, {"llm generation": "anatase TiO2", "source": "As a photocatalyst, anatase TiO 2 has a conduction band edge that is more negative vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) than the H /H 2 reduction potential; thus, the TiO 2 can efficiently split water into hydrogen, which is a promising candidate as a future energy carrier.", "context": "The powder XRD patterns of the prepared TiO The morphology of the TiO 2 nanosheets was observed by SEM.As shown in Figure 2a, the TiO 2 sample consists of large amounts of paperlike nanosheets.These nanosheets assemble together to form the hierarchical architectures.In order to observe the nanosheets clearly, the TEM image is shown in Figure 2b.Those sheets are around 70 nm 70 nm in size with a thickness around 2 nm.The high-resolution TEM image (Figure 2c) shows that the distance of the visible lattice fringes over a large area was measured to be 0.378 nm, which is in agreement with the lattice spacing of (010) atomic plane of anatase TiO 2 . 16Furthermore, the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Figure 2c) can be indexed to the diffraction spots of the 100 zone for the TiO 2 single crystalline, indicating that our prepared T Sheets are exposed with the 100 facet.This result is in agreement with the analysis of the XRD pattern, which implies that the T Sheets preferential crystallographic growth is along the 100 direction.In addition, the low-magnification SEM image (Supporting Information Figure S4) proved that our prepared TiO 2 sample is composed of almost all the nanosheets.Hence, based on the above information, we can calculate that the percentage of the exposed 100 facet in T Sheets is about 95.(The calculation method is shown in the Supporting Information.)The morphology of the TiO 2 cuboids can be observed as shown in Figure 2d.The cuboids are 0.6 m 1.5 m with a thickness of about 300 nm.The percentage of the exposed 100 facet in T Cuboids was reported to be 53. 7In addition, with the decrease of the thickness from 300 nm (cuboids) to 2 nm (nanosheets), the surface areas are largely increased from 3.9 m 2 /g for T Cuboids to 57.1 m 2 /g for T Sheets (Supporting Information Figure S5).Both the higher percentage of 100 facets and larger surface area of our developed T Sheets can offer more active sites in the photocatalytic reaction, which are beneficial for photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, the crystal structures of the two TiO 2 samples were also investigated by Raman spectroscopy.As shown in Figure 3, the peaks appearing at 396, 515, and 638 cm -1 of the two TiO 2 samples correspond to the B 1g , A 1g , and E g peaks of anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 17However, the relative intensities of the three peaks in the two TiO 2 samples are obviously different, in which the intensities of the A 1g and B 1g peaks of T Sheets are obviously much higher than that of T Cuboids .For anatase TiO 2 , the E g , B 1g , and A 1g peaks are mainly related to the symmetric stretching vibration, symmetric bending vibration, and antisymmetric bending vibration of the O-Ti-O, respectively. 17The slab models of the 100 and 101 surfaces are shown in Figure 4.It can be observed that the 101 surface is flatter than the 100 surface and 100 Ti atoms on the top layer of the 100 surface are 5-coordinated, thus it can be deduced that more O-Ti-O bonding on the 100 surface is bending vibration because of its unique atomic arrangement. 17or T Cuboids , it was composed of 53 100, 33 101, and 14 001 facets. 7In comparison to T Sheets with up to 95 100 facet, the bending vibration of the O-Ti-O will be much stronger on the T Sheets .Therefore, the relative peaks in 396 and 515 cm -1 for T Sheets are much higher than that of T Cuboids . The UV-visible absorption spectra of the TiO 2 nanosheets and cuboids are shown in Figure 5a.Compared with the T Cuboids exposed with 53 100 facet, the intrinsic absorption edge of our prepared T Sheets with 95 100 facets has an obvious blue-shift by 5 nm.On the basis of the formula a B i (hv -E g ) 2 /hv (a is the absorption coefficient, hv is the incident photon energy, and B i is the absorption constant for indirect transitions), 18 the band gaps are deduced to be 3.12 and 3.17 eV for the T Cuboids and T Sheets , respectively (Figure 5b).The valence band maximum of the two TiO 2 samples are measured to be similar (Figure 5c), thus the larger band gap of the T Sheets is indicated to a higher conduction band minimum of the T Sheets in contrast to the T Cuboids (Figure 5d).Our experimental phenomenon is in agreement with the previous report.It is well-accepted that the 100 facet owns superior electronic structure in comparison with other facets (e.g.001 facet and 101 facet), and TiO 2 single crystals exposed with more 100 facets will exhibit higher conduction band minimum. 789919 In this work, when the percentage of the 100 facet is increased from 53 to 95, the conduction band minimum of the T Sheets obviously increases.The higher conduction band minimum, on which more reductive electrons can be generated and then transferred to the TiO 2 surface to take part in the photocatalytic reaction, is beneficial for the photocatalytic reaction. 8,20s a photocatalyst, anatase TiO 2 has a conduction band edge that is more negative vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) than the H /H 2 reduction potential; thus, the TiO 2 can efficiently split water into hydrogen, which is a promising candidate as a future energy carrier. 21So, herein, the H 2 evolution tests in the presence of methanol as hole scavenger were carried out to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the prepared T Sheets and T Cuboids .As shown in Scheme 2a, when the TiO 2 is excited by the light, the photogenerated electrons will move to the conduction band, leaving a positive hole in the valence band.In the H 2 evolution, the electrons will then transfer to the TiO 2 surface on the Pt sites to reduce H into H 2 ; the holes will be exhausted via oxidizing the sacrifice reagent (methanol) to prevent the hole-electron recombination. 1 As shown in Figure 6a, the H 2 evolution rates over 6 h are measured to be 362 and 79 molh -1 for the T Sheets and T Cuboids , respectively; the photocatalytic activity of T Sheets is 4.6 times higher than that of T Cuboids . In general, the photocatalytic activity is affected by various factors, such as optical absorption properties, crystallinity, surface area, facet reactivity, and defect contents, and so on. 1,22,23Herein, the effect of several factors on the photocatalytic activity are discussed as following.First, considering the optical absorption properties, the more photons that are absorbed by the TiO 2 photocatalyst, the more photoexcited charge carriers can be produced to take part in the photocatalytic reaction. 24As shown in Figure 5a, T Cuboids exhibits red-shifted optical absorption edge in comparison to T Sheets , while the intensity of the absorption of T Sheets is higher than T Cuboids in the region of 300-350 nm.Hence, their photocatalytic performance under monochromatic light centered at a wavelength of 361 nm was studied.In this case, T Cuboids obviously absorbs more light than T Sheets (Supporting Information Figure S6a); however, the activity of T Sheets is 3.3 times higher than that of T Cuboids as shown in Supporting Information Figure S6b.Next, let us discuss the effect of crystallinity; obviously, T Cuboids has better crystallinity than T Sheets (Figure 1), which is beneficial for the inhibition of charge recombination in the photocatalytic reaction, 25 but T Sheets still exhibits significantly higher photocatalytic activity than T Cuboids .Thus, the effect of both optical absorption properties and crystallinity will not be the reason for the higher activity of T Sheets . Then, taking the surface area into account, TiO 2 with a larger surface area can not only offer more active reaction sites on the surface but also is beneficial for the reactant adsorption. 26,27In comparison to T Cuboids (3.9 m 2 /g), T Sheets exhibits a relatively large surface area of 57.1 m 2 /g.With a larger surface area of the T Sheets , the surface area of the exposed 100 facet will be also increased, thus more 5-coordinated Ti atoms (Ti 5c ) will exist on the surface.Experimentally, we compared the photocatalytic activity of the two TiO 2 samples in the same total surface area as shown in Figure 6b.In this case, the activity of T Sheets (362 mol h -1 ) is about 3.5 times that of T Cuboids (104 mol h -1 ); in contrast to the 4.6 times higher activity of T Sheets than T Cuboids with the same mass but different surface area, the above control experiments indicate that the surface area indeed makes contributions to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity; however, some other factors (including facet reactivity, surface defects, and electronic band structures) might be also contributing to the higher photocatalytic activity. Surface chemistry (such as facet reactivity and surface defects) always plays important roles in the photocatalysis. 23,28he 100 facet is reported to be the active facet in H 2 evolution because of its superior surface properties. 7With more 100 facets exposed on T Sheets , more 5-coordinated Ti atoms can be offered on the surface to act as active sites for the photocatalytic reaction.Meanwhile, because of the largely 4), our previous theoretical-calculation results revealed that the oxygen vacancy is more easily produced on the 100 surface than it is on the 101 surface. 29Herein, more 100 facet is exposed on T Sheets than on T Cuboids based on the analysis of Raman spectra, thus greater oxygen vacancy might be formed on the surface of T Sheets .To check the existence of the oxygen vacancies on the TiO 2 surface, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were adopted as shown in Supporting Information Figure S7.The signal observed at g 2.002 for T Sheets is characteristic of a paramagnetic Ti 3 existing on the surface of TiO 2 . 30T Sheets shows an EPR signal at g 2.002, but T Cuboids does not, indicating that some oxygen vacancy exists on the T Sheets surface.Those oxygen vacancies are known to act as active reaction sites in the photocatalytic reaction. 3,29In addition, the CO 2 pulse chemisorption results showed that T Sheets can adsorb 0.15 mL/g CO 2 but the CO 2 adsorption property of T Cuboids is very weak (Supporting Information Figure S8 and Table S1).The CO 2 chemisorption over T Sheets results from its surface oxygen vacancy, 31,32 which is further confirmation that oxygen vacancies are produced on the surface of T Sheets .Finally, besides its superior surface atomic structure, the 100 facet also exhibits excellent surface electronic structure.Herein, with more 100 facet exposed in our developed T Sheets , the electronic band gap of T Sheets is increased.As shown in Figure 5d, the conduction band minimum of T Sheets is much higher than that of T Cuboids , the superior electronic band structure of the T Sheets will make a great contribution to the enhanced photocatalytic activity, in which more strongly reductive electrons can be produced then transferred to the surface to reduce H into H 2 . 7,8,19n the basis of the above analysis, we can conclude that the higher percentage of the exposed 100 facet (up to 95) and the larger surface area (57.1 m 2 /g) make more 100 facets exposed on the T Sheets surface; accordingly, oxygen vacancies together with more Ti 5c atoms exist on the surface to act as active reaction sites, and the superior electronic band structure is also beneficial for the photocatalytic reaction, followed with a higher photocatalytic activity of T Sheets . Furthermore, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into hydrocarbon fuels is another promising application for TiO 2 photocatalyst. 20The direct reduction of CO 2 into hydrocarbon fuels (e.g.CH 4 ) using solar energy is one of the best strategies to manage both global warming and the energy shortage. 33343536 In the CO 2 photoreduction process, as shown in Scheme 2b, the photogenerated holes in the valence band oxidize water into hydrogen ions (H ) via the half-reaction H 2 O 2h 1/2O 2 2H , and the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band reduce CO 2 to CH 4 via the reaction of CO 2 8H 8e - CH 4 2H 2 O. 37 Here, the photocatalytic activity of the TiO 2 nanosheets and cuboids in CO 2 photoreduction were evaluated over 40 mg of photocatalyst without any cocatalyst in a gassolid system as shown in Figure 7a.Besides CH 4 as the main product, trace amounts of CO can also be detected.The CH 4 evolution rates over T Sheets and T Cuboids are determined to be 5.8 and 1.2 ppmg -1 h -1 , respectively; in which T Sheets is 4.8 times higher than T Cuboids .The photoreactivity order is the same as that of the H 2 evolution test, T Sheets T Cuboids .When comparing the photocatalytic activity of the two TiO 2 samples in the same total surface area, as shown in Figure 7b, T Sheets still exhibits higher photocatalytic activity, about 2.8 times that of T Cuboids .Herein, the reason for the higher activity of T Sheets in CO 2 photoreduction is similar to that in H 2 evolution.Firstly, both the oxygen vacancy existing on the TiO 2 surface and the larger surface area of TiO 2 nanosheets are beneficial for the CO 2 adsorption.Then, the photoexcited electrons on the conduction band of TiO 2 transfer to the TiO 2 surface to reduce CO 2 into CH 4 .During this reaction process, since more 100 facet is exposed on the surface of T Sheets , more surface active sites (such as Ti 5c atoms) will be offered.On the other hand, T Sheets exhibits a higher conduction band minimum (Figure 5d), on which more reductive electrons can be generated; the more the reductive potential of the electrons, the higher the CH 4 output efficiency.Thus, the higher photocatalytic activity of T Sheets is ascribed to its larger surface area, more active sites (e.g.oxygen vacancy and Ti 5c atoms) existing on the surface, and the superior electronic band structure.Moreover, controlled experiments show that no CH 4 was evolved when the photocatalytic reaction was carried out in the dark or irradiated in the absence of photocatalyst, revealing that the reduction of CO 2 is driven by light irradiation over the photocatalyst."}, {"llm generation": "Ultrathin anatase TiO 2 nanosheets", "source": "Ultrathin anatase TiO 2 nanosheets exposed with 95 of 100 facets are prepared.", "context": "Ultrathin anatase TiO 2 nanosheets exposed with 95 of 100 facets are prepared.In contrast to the reference sample, TiO 2 cuboids exposed with 53 of 100 facets, our developed TiO 2 nanosheets have a relatively higher percentage of exposed 100 facet, larger surface area, and superior electronic band structure, which means that the TiO 2 nanosheets exhibit significantly higher photocatalytic activity in terms of both H 2 evolution and CO 2 photoreduction processes.This study is related to the fine-tuning of the TiO 2 photocatalyst exposed with a high percentage of active facets for excellent photocatalytic performance in the potential application of renewable energy.Furthermore, the present work also motivates us to process the facet engineering of other functional materials to achieve advanced and excellent properties over photocatalysts.

Meanwhile, the crystal structures of the two TiO 2 samples were also investigated by Raman spectroscopy.As shown in Figure 3, the peaks appearing at 396, 515, and 638 cm -1 of the two TiO 2 samples correspond to the B 1g , A 1g , and E g peaks of anatase TiO 2 , respectively. 17However, the relative intensities of the three peaks in the two TiO 2 samples are obviously different, in which the intensities of the A 1g and B 1g peaks of T Sheets are obviously much higher than that of T Cuboids .For anatase TiO 2 , the E g , B 1g , and A 1g peaks are mainly related to the symmetric stretching vibration, symmetric bending vibration, and antisymmetric bending vibration of the O-Ti-O, respectively. 17The slab models of the 100 and 101 surfaces are shown in Figure 4.It can be observed that the 101 surface is flatter than the 100 surface and 100 Ti atoms on the top layer of the 100 surface are 5-coordinated, thus it can be deduced that more O-Ti-O bonding on the 100 surface is bending vibration because of its unique atomic arrangement. 17or T Cuboids , it was composed of 53 100, 33 101, and 14 001 facets. 7In comparison to T Sheets with up to 95 100 facet, the bending vibration of the O-Ti-O will be much stronger on the T Sheets .Therefore, the relative peaks in 396 and 515 cm -1 for T Sheets are much higher than that of T Cuboids . The UV-visible absorption spectra of the TiO 2 nanosheets and cuboids are shown in Figure 5a.Compared with the T Cuboids exposed with 53 100 facet, the intrinsic absorption edge of our prepared T Sheets with 95 100 facets has an obvious blue-shift by 5 nm.On the basis of the formula a B i (hv -E g ) 2 /hv (a is the absorption coefficient, hv is the incident photon energy, and B i is the absorption constant for indirect transitions), 18 the band gaps are deduced to be 3.12 and 3.17 eV for the T Cuboids and T Sheets , respectively (Figure 5b).The valence band maximum of the two TiO 2 samples are measured to be similar (Figure 5c), thus the larger band gap of the T Sheets is indicated to a higher conduction band minimum of the T Sheets in contrast to the T Cuboids (Figure 5d).Our experimental phenomenon is in agreement with the previous report.It is well-accepted that the 100 facet owns superior electronic structure in comparison with other facets (e.g.001 facet and 101 facet), and TiO 2 single crystals exposed with more 100 facets will exhibit higher conduction band minimum. 789919 In this work, when the percentage of the 100 facet is increased from 53 to 95, the conduction band minimum of the T Sheets obviously increases.The higher conduction band minimum, on which more reductive electrons can be generated and then transferred to the TiO 2 surface to take part in the photocatalytic reaction, is beneficial for the photocatalytic reaction. 8,20s a photocatalyst, anatase TiO 2 has a conduction band edge that is more negative vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) than the H /H 2 reduction potential; thus, the TiO 2 can efficiently split water into hydrogen, which is a promising candidate as a future energy carrier. 21So, herein, the H 2 evolution tests in the presence of methanol as hole scavenger were carried out to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the prepared T Sheets and T Cuboids .As shown in Scheme 2a, when the TiO 2 is excited by the light, the photogenerated electrons will move to the conduction band, leaving a positive hole in the valence band.In the H 2 evolution, the electrons will then transfer to the TiO 2 surface on the Pt sites to reduce H into H 2 ; the holes will be exhausted via oxidizing the sacrifice reagent (methanol) to prevent the hole-electron recombination. 1 As shown in Figure 6a, the H 2 evolution rates over 6 h are measured to be 362 and 79 molh -1 for the T Sheets and T Cuboids , respectively; the photocatalytic activity of T Sheets is 4.6 times higher than that of T Cuboids . In general, the photocatalytic activity is affected by various factors, such as optical absorption properties, crystallinity, surface area, facet reactivity, and defect contents, and so on. 1,22,23Herein, the effect of several factors on the photocatalytic activity are discussed as following.First, considering the optical absorption properties, the more photons that are absorbed by the TiO 2 photocatalyst, the more photoexcited charge carriers can be produced to take part in the photocatalytic reaction. 24As shown in Figure 5a, T Cuboids exhibits red-shifted optical absorption edge in comparison to T Sheets , while the intensity of the absorption of T Sheets is higher than T Cuboids in the region of 300-350 nm.Hence, their photocatalytic performance under monochromatic light centered at a wavelength of 361 nm was studied.In this case, T Cuboids obviously absorbs more light than T Sheets (Supporting Information Figure S6a); however, the activity of T Sheets is 3.3 times higher than that of T Cuboids as shown in Supporting Information Figure S6b.Next, let us discuss the effect of crystallinity; obviously, T Cuboids has better crystallinity than T Sheets (Figure 1), which is beneficial for the inhibition of charge recombination in the photocatalytic reaction, 25 but T Sheets still exhibits significantly higher photocatalytic activity than T Cuboids .Thus, the effect of both optical absorption properties and crystallinity will not be the reason for the higher activity of T Sheets . Then, taking the surface area into account, TiO 2 with a larger surface area can not only offer more active reaction sites on the surface but also is beneficial for the reactant adsorption. 26,27In comparison to T Cuboids (3.9 m 2 /g), T Sheets exhibits a relatively large surface area of 57.1 m 2 /g.With a larger surface area of the T Sheets , the surface area of the exposed 100 facet will be also increased, thus more 5-coordinated Ti atoms (Ti 5c ) will exist on the surface.Experimentally, we compared the photocatalytic activity of the two TiO 2 samples in the same total surface area as shown in Figure 6b.In this case, the activity of T Sheets (362 mol h -1 ) is about 3.5 times that of T Cuboids (104 mol h -1 ); in contrast to the 4.6 times higher activity of T Sheets than T Cuboids with the same mass but different surface area, the above control experiments indicate that the surface area indeed makes contributions to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity; however, some other factors (including facet reactivity, surface defects, and electronic band structures) might be also contributing to the higher photocatalytic activity. Surface chemistry (such as facet reactivity and surface defects) always plays important roles in the photocatalysis. 23,28he 100 facet is reported to be the active facet in H 2 evolution because of its superior surface properties. 7With more 100 facets exposed on T Sheets , more 5-coordinated Ti atoms can be offered on the surface to act as active sites for the photocatalytic reaction.Meanwhile, because of the largely 4), our previous theoretical-calculation results revealed that the oxygen vacancy is more easily produced on the 100 surface than it is on the 101 surface. 29Herein, more 100 facet is exposed on T Sheets than on T Cuboids based on the analysis of Raman spectra, thus greater oxygen vacancy might be formed on the surface of T Sheets .To check the existence of the oxygen vacancies on the TiO 2 surface, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were adopted as shown in Supporting Information Figure S7.The signal observed at g 2.002 for T Sheets is characteristic of a paramagnetic Ti 3 existing on the surface of TiO 2 . 30T Sheets shows an EPR signal at g 2.002, but T Cuboids does not, indicating that some oxygen vacancy exists on the T Sheets surface.Those oxygen vacancies are known to act as active reaction sites in the photocatalytic reaction. 3,29In addition, the CO 2 pulse chemisorption results showed that T Sheets can adsorb 0.15 mL/g CO 2 but the CO 2 adsorption property of T Cuboids is very weak (Supporting Information Figure S8 and Table S1).The CO 2 chemisorption over T Sheets results from its surface oxygen vacancy, 31,32 which is further confirmation that oxygen vacancies are produced on the surface of T Sheets .Finally, besides its superior surface atomic structure, the 100 facet also exhibits excellent surface electronic structure.Herein, with more 100 facet exposed in our developed T Sheets , the electronic band gap of T Sheets is increased.As shown in Figure 5d, the conduction band minimum of T Sheets is much higher than that of T Cuboids , the superior electronic band structure of the T Sheets will make a great contribution to the enhanced photocatalytic activity, in which more strongly reductive electrons can be produced then transferred to the surface to reduce H into H 2 . 7,8,19n the basis of the above analysis, we can conclude that the higher percentage of the exposed 100 facet (up to 95) and the larger surface area (57.1 m 2 /g) make more 100 facets exposed on the T Sheets surface; accordingly, oxygen vacancies together with more Ti 5c atoms exist on the surface to act as active reaction sites, and the superior electronic band structure is also beneficial for the photocatalytic reaction, followed with a higher photocatalytic activity of T Sheets . Furthermore, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into hydrocarbon fuels is another promising application for TiO 2 photocatalyst. 20The direct reduction of CO 2 into hydrocarbon fuels (e.g.CH 4 ) using solar energy is one of the best strategies to manage both global warming and the energy shortage. 33343536 In the CO 2 photoreduction process, as shown in Scheme 2b, the photogenerated holes in the valence band oxidize water into hydrogen ions (H ) via the half-reaction H 2 O 2h 1/2O 2 2H , and the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band reduce CO 2 to CH 4 via the reaction of CO 2 8H 8e - CH 4 2H 2 O. 37 Here, the photocatalytic activity of the TiO 2 nanosheets and cuboids in CO 2 photoreduction were evaluated over 40 mg of photocatalyst without any cocatalyst in a gassolid system as shown in Figure 7a.Besides CH 4 as the main product, trace amounts of CO can also be detected.The CH 4 evolution rates over T Sheets and T Cuboids are determined to be 5.8 and 1.2 ppmg -1 h -1 , respectively; in which T Sheets is 4.8 times higher than T Cuboids .The photoreactivity order is the same as that of the H 2 evolution test, T Sheets T Cuboids .When comparing the photocatalytic activity of the two TiO 2 samples in the same total surface area, as shown in Figure 7b, T Sheets still exhibits higher photocatalytic activity, about 2.8 times that of T Cuboids .Herein, the reason for the higher activity of T Sheets in CO 2 photoreduction is similar to that in H 2 evolution.Firstly, both the oxygen vacancy existing on the TiO 2 surface and the larger surface area of TiO 2 nanosheets are beneficial for the CO 2 adsorption.Then, the photoexcited electrons on the conduction band of TiO 2 transfer to the TiO 2 surface to reduce CO 2 into CH 4 .During this reaction process, since more 100 facet is exposed on the surface of T Sheets , more surface active sites (such as Ti 5c atoms) will be offered.On the other hand, T Sheets exhibits a higher conduction band minimum (Figure 5d), on which more reductive electrons can be generated; the more the reductive potential of the electrons, the higher the CH 4 output efficiency.Thus, the higher photocatalytic activity of T Sheets is ascribed to its larger surface area, more active sites (e.g.oxygen vacancy and Ti 5c atoms) existing on the surface, and the superior electronic band structure.Moreover, controlled experiments show that no CH 4 was evolved when the photocatalytic reaction was carried out in the dark or irradiated in the absence of photocatalyst, revealing that the reduction of CO 2 is driven by light irradiation over the photocatalyst."}, {"llm generation": "UV-visible", "source": "Photocatalytic H 2 evolution tests of the 1 wt Pt-loaded TiO 2 samples with the same mass of 60 mg under UV-visible light irradiation ( 300 nm).", "context": "Ultrathin anatase TiO 2 nanosheets exposed with 95 of 100 facets are prepared.In contrast to the reference sample, TiO 2 cuboids exposed with 53 of 100 facets, our developed TiO 2 nanosheets have a relatively higher percentage of exposed 100 facet, larger surface area, and superior electronic band structure, which means that the TiO 2 nanosheets exhibit significantly higher photocatalytic activity in terms of both H 2 evolution and CO 2 photoreduction processes.This study is related to the fine-tuning of the TiO 2 photocatalyst exposed with a high percentage of active facets for excellent photocatalytic performance in the potential application of renewable energy.Furthermore, the present work also motivates us to process the facet engineering of other functional materials to achieve advanced and excellent properties over photocatalysts.
