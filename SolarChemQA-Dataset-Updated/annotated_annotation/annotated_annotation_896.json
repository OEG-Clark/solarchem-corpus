Interestingly, an obvious positive shift in N 1s binding energy of Co The low-temperature EPR analysis, which has been proved to be a credible method to detect the unpaired electrons of materials 49, was furthermore employed to investigate the existence of interfacial V O in Co 3 O 4 /CNS (Figure 3d).The Co 3 O 4 showed a symmetrical EPR signal at g2.009 was assigned to the unpaired electron of Co 2 ions 50,51, and the stronger resonance for Co 3 O 4 /CNS indicates there were more Co 2 ions present, indirectly inferring more V O in Co 3 O 4 /CNS.The FT-IR spectra also proved the interfacial electron migration (Figure 3e).Contrasted with pure Co 3 O 4 , the vibrational peaks at 1200-1600 cm -1 and 812 cm -1 assigned to CN heterocycle and tri-s-triazine ring in composite showed a positive migration, which can be ascribed to the decrease of CNS electron density 2).Note that the oxygen vacancy in bulk exhibits larger oxygen vacancy formation energy, which means the migration of oxygen vacancy from the surface to the bulk is thermodynamically inaccessible.This blocking effect takes great effect in retaining high concentration of oxygen vacancies around the heterostructured interfaces 55. In addition, the nitrogen adsorption tests were conducted to investigate the porous features of these as-synthesized samples.The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of all products showed a typical type IV isotherm with apparent hysteresis loop (Figure 4a), indicating there were rich mesopores in these materials.However, some distinctive texture properties for different samples can also be observed in Figure 4b and Table 3. Aforementioned fascinating properties indicated the great potential in photoelectronic field for Co 3 O 4 /CNS.As evidenced by UV/Vis adsorption spectra (Figure S2a), the pure CNS with optical band gap of 2.74 eV showed an unsatisfactory visible-light region utilizing efficiency while heterojunction Applying potential above CBM or below VBM can form accumulation layer or inversion layers, appearing as abrupt emergence of current 56.The CBM and VBM values were estimated by extrapolation of plot to X abscissa intersection.As a result, approximate CBM/VBM values were measured as -1.12 V/1.61 V and 0.26 V/2.53 V vs NHE for CNS and Co 3 O 4 , respectively.The band positions determined from these linear potential scans were consistent with the optical estimation method (Figure S3).The detailed band alignment was illustrated at Figure S4 , which endows the suitable redox potential position for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction reaction. To gain insight into the catalytic mechanism, multiple spectra and photoelectrochemical (PEC) tests were employed (Figure 6).The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CNS at different excitation wavelength (500-720 nm) presented the same maximum emission wavelength centered at 437 nm (Figure 6a), meaning the up-conversion feature of CNS.Furthermore, the enhanced interfacial charge transfer was verified in Figure 6b.Compared to pure CNS, the significantly weakened emission peak of composite Co 3 O 4 /CNS suggested the great charge separation for CNS, ascribed to interfacial V O as the interface charge recombination center. Moreover, the PEC characterization (Figure S5) was performed to evaluate the photogenerated charge carriers transfer property through measuring the current-voltage (J-V) curves (Figure 6c). Impressively, an onset potential at 0.94 V vs. RHE of composite Co Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to further prove the enhanced charge separation and transfer property for Co 3 O 4 /CNS (Figure 6d).The Nyquist plots was composed of a semicircle and an inclined line, which can be fitted to with the Randles equivalent circuit model and Warburg impedance respectively.The fitted parameter was listed in Table S3 and the physical meanings was discussed in Section 2 (Supporting Information).In general, element R s in equivalent circuit ascribed to semicircle reflect the charge transfer in semiconductor itself.Therefore, the composite Co 3 O 4 /CNS exhibited smallest semidiameter or R s indicating the best charge separation/transfer property, in agreement with abovementioned results. To elucidate the catalytic activity of as-synthesized Co 3 O 4 /CNS, CO 2 reduction experiments were conducted in acetonitrile solvent with H 2 O as electron donor, wherein acetonitrile can promote the CO 2 dissolved quantity.For all the evaluated photocatalysts, the two-electron-product CO was primary product accompanying with a little detectable eight-electron-product CH 4 , whereas H 2 was not detected (Figure 7).7d).We found the any products cannot be detected in conditions without catalyst and light, indicating the CO and CH 4 were indeed reaction products.When the test was modulated in the same reaction condition except for Ar gaseous surrounding, no detected products can also be detected, which indicated the CO and CH 4 was root in CO 2 conduction. Furthermore, we have benchmark this work with different state-of-art photocatalysts, listed in Table S3.The considerable CO and CH 4 yields based on Co 3 O 4 /CNS-10 showed an appreciable efficiency against other g-C 3 N 4 -based photocatalysts, indicating that the interface oxygen defect The first-principle calculation was carried out to better understand the interfacial charge transfer (Figure S6).The more obvious geometric structure deformation in V O -CCN was contributed by the delocalized electron of oxygen vacancy (Figure S6 and Table S3).To investigate the effect of oxygen vacancy on electronic structures of heterojunction, the partial density of states of PCCN and V O -CCN were plotted in Figure 9.For pure g-C 3 N 4 (001) slab (Figure 9a In particular, the suitable adsorption sites were the one of the most pivotal factors in catalytic reaction.We first carried on the CO 2 adsorption tests to investigate the possible adsorption sites in hybrids (Figure 10a).The Co 3 O 4 /CNS hybrids modified with a few CNS adsorbs a larger number of CO 2 molecules than Co 3 O 4 , indicating the CO 2 molecules were more easily adsorbed in CNS parts where possess separated photoinduced electrons, which was beneficial to shorten the diffusion distance of photogenerated electrons to CO 2 molecules.Although the CNS displayed an excellent CO 2 capture capacity, the poor photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance was owing to the restrained separation of Additionally, CO 2 molecules activation was indispensable in CO 2 reduction.The CO 2 -TPD tests were conducted to investigate the CO 2 activation route.For pristine CNS, the obvious desorption peaks centered at 96.4 and 146.4 o C was owing to the high amounts of residual -NH 2 during incomplete condensation of melamine, which could act as Lewis basic sites and form a weak covalent bonds with CO 2 molecules 61.For pure Co 3 O 4 , the desorption peaks above of 200 o C were assigned to the alkaline nature of cobalt, while the lower desorption temperature at 132.9 o C could be contributed to the unsaturated cobalt sites surrounding oxygen vacancy which acted as surface Lewis acid centers. Interestingly, the higher desorption temperature can be obviously observed below of 200 o C for Co 3 O 4 /CNS heterojunction, implying much stronger CO 2 adsorption strength.Particularly, the bonding and antibonding orbitals of CO 2 molecules, respectively, interact with unoccupied orbitals of unsaturated cobalt sites and nonbonding orbitals of -NH 2, and induce the mutual electron transfer, producing a synergetic CO 2 activation effect 62.Lastly, considering that CO was the primary products in CO 2 reduction, the CO-TPD measurements were also carried out to explore the product desorption process.The lower desorption temperature for hybrids indicate the CO was easily released from catalysts surface, rather than deposition and poison photocatalysts. Based on the above experimental results and DFT calculation, the detailed CO 2 photoreduction mechanism was illustrated in Figure 11.Firstly, two photocatalysts were assembled by electrostatic interaction accompanying with electron density redistribution in interface of composite.In fact, the formed oxygen vacancies in heterojunction interface caused an obvious electron migration from CNS to Co 3 O 4 .Then, when exposed with visible-light irradiation, the electronic transition will occur in the band gap.Due to the intrinsic property of photoinduced electron-hole pairs recombination in semiconductor, there were obvious surface charge recombination in PCCN (Figure 9a), meaning a type-II heterojunction (Figure 11a).However, the detectable OH and O 2 -were contradictory thermodynamically to this charge transfer.Interestingly, the existing interfacial V O would suppress"}, {"llm generation": "Co 3 O 4 /CNS", "source": "Thus, a series of Co 3 O 4 /CNS with different mass fraction of CNS was obtained and named Co 3 O 4 /CNS-x, where x represents the mass contents of CNS.", "context": "In summary, a Co-based spinel/carbon nitride direct Z-scheme heterojunction with in-situ formation of interfacial oxygen vacancy was successfully constructed through a facile electrostatic assembly between g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and hollow spherical Co respctively compared to pure CNS.These outcomes revealed that the importance of specific interfacial defect on targeted control of interface charge transfer, providing a significant guide towards the design of potential CO 2 photocatalytic Z-scheme system through defect modulation. Co 3 O 4 /CNS was obtained by electrostatic self-assembly process.A stoichiometric weight ratio of as prepared Co 3 O 4 was added into 20 mL CNS colloid with ultrasonication for 15 min and stirred for 24 h.The product was collected by centrifugation and dried at 70 o C. Thus, a series of Co 3 O 4 /CNS with different mass fraction of CNS was obtained and named Co 3 O 4 /CNS-x, where x represents the mass contents of CNS. We first constructed Co 3 O 4 crystals through atmospheric calcination of the metal polysaccharides (Co-GP).Next, a presupposed mass ratio of the as-synthesized Co 3 O 4 was ultrasonically dispersed into CNS colloids, which was obtained by liquid exfoliation of bulk CN.During this process, a facile electrostatic assembly was spontaneously proceeded.The positive charged Co 3 O 4 (average -potential is 10.06 mV) can be spontaneously integrated onto negative charged CNS (average -potential is -20.31 mV), resulting in the formation of composite Co 3 O 4 /CNS.As revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure S1d) patterns, the typical characteristic peaks of Co 3 O 4 and CNS were well retained in composite Co 3 O 4 /CNS, confirming the hybrid was successfully organized by two moieties. Figure 1.Formation Process of Co 3 O 4 /CNS composite 4 was integrated onto CNS automatically when dispersed into CNS colloid through electrostatic interaction (Figure 2a).The low-magnification TEM image of Co 3 O 4 /CNS implied the successful assembly of Co 3 O 4 and CNS (Figure2b).To analyze the interfacial nature of Co 3 O 4 /CNS, high-resolution TEM (Figure 2c) was carried out.An obvious interface of two components was identified with a clear crystal boundary.The distinct lattice spacings of 0.294 nm and 0.471 nm on the side of HR-TEM image corresponded with the (220) and (111) planes of Co 3 O 4 , respectively.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 2d) of Co 3 O 4 /CNS with several well-defined Figure 2. a) SEM image, b) TEM image, c) HR-TEM image and d) SAED pattern of as-synthesized Figure 3. XPS spectra of (a) N 1s (b) Co 2p (c) O 1s of single samples and composite Co 3 O 4 /CNS; (d) Compared with Co 3 O 4 and CNS, the obvious difference of pore diameter for Co 3 O 4 /CNS demonstrated the strong interaction in composite.Specifically, both CNS and Co 3 O 4 existed a larger pore at 20 nm while it disappeared in Co 3 O 4 /CNS (Figure 4b), and the pores at 4 nm assigned to CNS shift to smaller size (inset of Figure 4b).In other words, the pore distribution of Co 3 O 4 /CNS displayed more uniform.Nonetheless, the distinctness among Co 3 O 4 /CNS can also be observed in inset of Figure 4b, that was the pore size at about 3.7 nm shifts with the content of CNS. Figure 4. (a)The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and (b) pore size distribution curves of all CNS presented a much stronger visible-light adsorption.And the detailed band alignment was systematically investigated by the linear potential scans which can determine valance band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. (a, c) Catholic scan for determining the CBM at 10 mV/s for CNS and Co 3 O 4 respectively; Figure 6.(a) PL spectra of CNS at different excitation wavelength and (b) CNS and Co 3 O 4 /CNS at Compared to pure CNS, heterojunction Co 3 O 4 /CNS presented considerable improvement.Particularly, Co 3 O 4 /CNS-10 showed the highest CO and CH 4 evolution of 2.66 mol and 0.63 mol, which was 11.5 and 7.4 times more than pure CNS (0.21 mol for CO and 0.08 mol for CH 4 ) over 4 h reaction and 50 mg photocatalysts.However, the more contents of CNS in Co 3 O 4 /CNS heterojunction (20 or 25) showed weak CO 2 reduction activity, which might to be attributed to the excessive CNS would hinder Co 3 O 4 photoexcitation and the backward charge transfer was predominant.The stability of photocatalyst was tested in three consecutive runs.The catalytic activity of Co 3 O 4 /CNS-10 showed only little decrease for all runs in Figure 7c, indicating the high stability of photocatalyst in acctonitrile/water system.A series of control experiments were carried out to exclude possible interference factors in different reaction condition including without catalyst, without CO 2 and without light (Figure Figure 7.The (a) CO evolution and (b) CH 4 evolution of all as-synthesized samples; (c) the CO and Figure 8. EPR spectra of Co 3 O 4 , CNS and Co 3 O 4 /CNS under visible-light irradiation for (a) OH, and and b), the N 2p state dominates the VBM region, while the CBM was mainly composed of hybridization of the C 2p and N 2p states.For the pure Co 3 O 4 (110) surface (Figure 9e and f), the VBM was dominated by O 2p state and the CBM was mainly composed of Co 3 .In interface region, a slight Co 2 in V O -CCN (Figure 9d) can be observed compared to PCCN.For the PCCN and V O -CCN, the VBM in interface are both O 2p and N 2p.However, the CBM of Vo-CCN consist of N 2p and C 2p state and CBM of PCCN was contributed by N 2p, C 2p, Co 3 3d and O 2p states.Under visible-light irradiation, almost all photo-generated electron in Co 3 O 4 O 2p states transfer to N 2p and C 2p states in V O -CCN that was the Z-scheme charge transfer.In contrast, a large part of photo-induced electron in Co 3 O 4 O 2p states of PCCN transfer to Co 3 that is backward electron transfer leading to slow dynamics reaction.Therefore, the interfacial oxygen vacancies play a great role in suppressing backward electron transfer and forming Z-scheme charge transfer.Combined with the calculated electron density difference plotted in Figure 8c and d, the interface charge transfer was observed more directly.The different color in electron density difference indicated the electron density, particularly, the red and blue region indicated electron accumulation and depletion respectively 57-60.Notably, red region surrounding O atoms in PCCN indicated the electron density moved away from Co atoms to adjacent O atoms.While the electron density of oxygen vacancy was dispersed into surrounding Co atom in Vo-CNN, which can be proved by XPS and FTIR spectra.In addition, due to the existence of the transition layer, the covalent bond future of V O -CCN was more distinct than PCCN.

Partial density of states plots for PCCN (left) and V O -CCN (right).Here, the top (a and b) photoelectrochemical performance and EPR results indicated the suppressive of backward 464748and Co 3 O 4 /CNS were profiled in Figure3b, where two major peaks located at around 779.5 eV and 794.4 eV were corresponding to Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 (detailed at Table 1), respectively, demonstrating the concomitant Co 3 and Co 2 species.Impressively, Co 2p binding energy in composite shifts negatively in comparison to pristine Co 3 O 4 , meaning an increase in the electron density of Co 3 O 4 .Likewise, The O 1s core levels displayed the same phenomena.As shown in Figure3c, there were four fitted curves in Co 3 O 4 located at530.0,530.7,531.7 and 533.0 eV, assigned to metal oxygen (O1), oxygen in -OH (O2), defective oxygen (O3) and adsorbed water (O4), respectively44, wherein the O1 in composite shifts to lower binding energy indicating the electron density accumulation in O atom of Co 3 O 4 .This electron migration may further induce the formation of surface V O confirmed by the increase of calculated ratio of Co 3 /Co 245.The atomic ratio of Co 3 /Co 2 and V O density could be estimated through calculating the shaded areas464748.And the calculated peak areas and full width at half maximum (FWHM) were listed in TableS1.After electrostatic assembly, the atomic ratio of Co 3 /Co 2 (1.37) of the heterojunction is lower than that of pure Co 3 O 4 (approximate 1.68), indicating that Co 3 was partly reduced to Co 2 due to the extraneous electron, meaning more surface V O generated.Furthermore, the ratio of O3/O1 was calculated to be 0.2 and 0.23 for Co 3 O 4 and Co 3 O 4 /CNS, respectively, implying more oxygen defective site in composites. 3 O 4 /CNS can be observed comparing to pure CNS, implying a decrease in its electron density.Meanwhile, the fine-scanned Co 2p spectra The summarized data for Co 2p and O 1s from XPS spectra for Co 3 O 4 and Co 3 O 4 /CNS The calculated formation energy of oxygen defect on different layers in Co 3 O 4 /CNS a the possible formation site of oxygen defect in Co 3 O 4 /CNS as shown in FigureS6. The calculated texture properties of all as-synthesized sample The Co 3 O 4 /CNS affords photocurrent density of 0.06 mA/cm 2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was 2 times and 9 times larger than Co 3 O 4 (0.02 mA/cm 2 ) and CNS (0.006 mA/cm 2 ), respectively.The low onset potential and high photocurrent density of Co 3 O 4 /CNS suggested the surface charge recombination was suppressed and it had higher ability to transfer rapidly charge to reactant. 3 O 4 /CNS under visible-light irradiation was lower than that of Co 3 O 4 (1.07 V vs. RHE) and CNS (1.38 V vs. RHE) under same conditions.

Co 3 O 4 -V O would transfer to VB of CNS through interfacial V O , preserving the strong redox ability in corresponding to the improving CO 2 reduction.When CO 2 was adsorbed onto hybrids, the frustrated Lewis acid-base pairs, consisting of the unsaturated cobalt sites surrounding interfacial oxygen vacancy and residual -NH 2 spreading over CNS surface, activated CO 2 molecules, then accumulated electrons in CNS surface reacted with CO 2 to produce CO 2 -initially 63, subsequently, two-electron-products CO were formed by fast deoxygenation route.While the eight-electron-products CH 4 were transformed through fast hydrogenation path 64, where protons were provided from H 2 O.

The calculated texture properties of all as-synthesized sample The Co 3 O 4 /CNS affords photocurrent density of 0.06 mA/cm 2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was 2 times and 9 times larger than Co 3 O 4 (0.02 mA/cm 2 ) and CNS (0.006 mA/cm 2 ), respectively.The low onset potential and high photocurrent density of Co 3 O 4 /CNS suggested the surface charge recombination was suppressed and it had higher ability to transfer rapidly charge to reactant. 3 O 4 /CNS under visible-light irradiation was lower than that of Co 3 O 4 (1.07 V vs. RHE) and CNS (1.38 V vs. RHE) under same conditions.

Co 3 O 4 -V O would transfer to VB of CNS through interfacial V O , preserving the strong redox ability in corresponding to the improving CO 2 reduction.When CO 2 was adsorbed onto hybrids, the frustrated Lewis acid-base pairs, consisting of the unsaturated cobalt sites surrounding interfacial oxygen vacancy and residual -NH 2 spreading over CNS surface, activated CO 2 molecules, then accumulated electrons in CNS surface reacted with CO 2 to produce CO 2 -initially 63, subsequently, two-electron-products CO were formed by fast deoxygenation route.While the eight-electron-products CH 4 were transformed through fast hydrogenation path 64, where protons were provided from H 2 O.

Interestingly, an obvious positive shift in N 1s binding energy of Co The low-temperature EPR analysis, which has been proved to be a credible method to detect the unpaired electrons of materials 49, was furthermore employed to investigate the existence of interfacial V O in Co 3 O 4 /CNS (Figure 3d).The Co 3 O 4 showed a symmetrical EPR signal at g2.009 was assigned to the unpaired electron of Co 2 ions 50,51, and the stronger resonance for Co 3 O 4 /CNS indicates there were more Co 2 ions present, indirectly inferring more V O in Co 3 O 4 /CNS.The FT-IR spectra also proved the interfacial electron migration (Figure 3e).Contrasted with pure Co 3 O 4 , the vibrational peaks at 1200-1600 cm -1 and 812 cm -1 assigned to CN heterocycle and tri-s-triazine ring in composite showed a positive migration, which can be ascribed to the decrease of CNS electron density 2).Note that the oxygen vacancy in bulk exhibits larger oxygen vacancy formation energy, which means the migration of oxygen vacancy from the surface to the bulk is thermodynamically inaccessible.This blocking effect takes great effect in retaining high concentration of oxygen vacancies around the heterostructured interfaces 55. In addition, the nitrogen adsorption tests were conducted to investigate the porous features of these as-synthesized samples.The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of all products showed a typical type IV isotherm with apparent hysteresis loop (Figure 4a), indicating there were rich mesopores in these materials.However, some distinctive texture properties for different samples can also be observed in Figure 4b and Table 3. Aforementioned fascinating properties indicated the great potential in photoelectronic field for Co 3 O 4 /CNS.As evidenced by UV/Vis adsorption spectra (Figure S2a), the pure CNS with optical band gap of 2.74 eV showed an unsatisfactory visible-light region utilizing efficiency while heterojunction Applying potential above CBM or below VBM can form accumulation layer or inversion layers, appearing as abrupt emergence of current 56.The CBM and VBM values were estimated by extrapolation of plot to X abscissa intersection.As a result, approximate CBM/VBM values were measured as -1.12 V/1.61 V and 0.26 V/2.53 V vs NHE for CNS and Co 3 O 4 , respectively.The band positions determined from these linear potential scans were consistent with the optical estimation method (Figure S3).The detailed band alignment was illustrated at Figure S4 , which endows the suitable redox potential position for visible-light-driven CO 2 reduction reaction. To gain insight into the catalytic mechanism, multiple spectra and photoelectrochemical (PEC) tests were employed (Figure 6).The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CNS at different excitation wavelength (500-720 nm) presented the same maximum emission wavelength centered at 437 nm (Figure 6a), meaning the up-conversion feature of CNS.Furthermore, the enhanced interfacial charge transfer was verified in Figure 6b.Compared to pure CNS, the significantly weakened emission peak of composite Co 3 O 4 /CNS suggested the great charge separation for CNS, ascribed to interfacial V O as the interface charge recombination center. Moreover, the PEC characterization (Figure S5) was performed to evaluate the photogenerated charge carriers transfer property through measuring the current-voltage (J-V) curves (Figure 6c). Impressively, an onset potential at 0.94 V vs. RHE of composite Co Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to further prove the enhanced charge separation and transfer property for Co 3 O 4 /CNS (Figure 6d).The Nyquist plots was composed of a semicircle and an inclined line, which can be fitted to with the Randles equivalent circuit model and Warburg impedance respectively.The fitted parameter was listed in Table S3 and the physical meanings was discussed in Section 2 (Supporting Information).In general, element R s in equivalent circuit ascribed to semicircle reflect the charge transfer in semiconductor itself.Therefore, the composite Co 3 O 4 /CNS exhibited smallest semidiameter or R s indicating the best charge separation/transfer property, in agreement with abovementioned results. To elucidate the catalytic activity of as-synthesized Co 3 O 4 /CNS, CO 2 reduction experiments were conducted in acetonitrile solvent with H 2 O as electron donor, wherein acetonitrile can promote the CO 2 dissolved quantity.For all the evaluated photocatalysts, the two-electron-product CO was primary product accompanying with a little detectable eight-electron-product CH 4 , whereas H 2 was not detected (Figure 7).7d).We found the any products cannot be detected in conditions without catalyst and light, indicating the CO and CH 4 were indeed reaction products.When the test was modulated in the same reaction condition except for Ar gaseous surrounding, no detected products can also be detected, which indicated the CO and CH 4 was root in CO 2 conduction. Furthermore, we have benchmark this work with different state-of-art photocatalysts, listed in Table S3.The considerable CO and CH 4 yields based on Co 3 O 4 /CNS-10 showed an appreciable efficiency against other g-C 3 N 4 -based photocatalysts, indicating that the interface oxygen defect The first-principle calculation was carried out to better understand the interfacial charge transfer (Figure S6).The more obvious geometric structure deformation in V O -CCN was contributed by the delocalized electron of oxygen vacancy (Figure S6 and Table S3).To investigate the effect of oxygen vacancy on electronic structures of heterojunction, the partial density of states of PCCN and V O -CCN were plotted in Figure 9.For pure g-C 3 N 4 (001) slab (Figure 9a In particular, the suitable adsorption sites were the one of the most pivotal factors in catalytic reaction.We first carried on the CO 2 adsorption tests to investigate the possible adsorption sites in hybrids (Figure 10a).The Co 3 O 4 /CNS hybrids modified with a few CNS adsorbs a larger number of CO 2 molecules than Co 3 O 4 , indicating the CO 2 molecules were more easily adsorbed in CNS parts where possess separated photoinduced electrons, which was beneficial to shorten the diffusion distance of photogenerated electrons to CO 2 molecules.Although the CNS displayed an excellent CO 2 capture capacity, the poor photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance was owing to the restrained separation of Additionally, CO 2 molecules activation was indispensable in CO 2 reduction.The CO 2 -TPD tests were conducted to investigate the CO 2 activation route.For pristine CNS, the obvious desorption peaks centered at 96.4 and 146.4 o C was owing to the high amounts of residual -NH 2 during incomplete condensation of melamine, which could act as Lewis basic sites and form a weak covalent bonds with CO 2 molecules 61.For pure Co 3 O 4 , the desorption peaks above of 200 o C were assigned to the alkaline nature of cobalt, while the lower desorption temperature at 132.9 o C could be contributed to the unsaturated cobalt sites surrounding oxygen vacancy which acted as surface Lewis acid centers. Interestingly, the higher desorption temperature can be obviously observed below of 200 o C for Co 3 O 4 /CNS heterojunction, implying much stronger CO 2 adsorption strength.Particularly, the bonding and antibonding orbitals of CO 2 molecules, respectively, interact with unoccupied orbitals of unsaturated cobalt sites and nonbonding orbitals of -NH 2, and induce the mutual electron transfer, producing a synergetic CO 2 activation effect 62.Lastly, considering that CO was the primary products in CO 2 reduction, the CO-TPD measurements were also carried out to explore the product desorption process.The lower desorption temperature for hybrids indicate the CO was easily released from catalysts surface, rather than deposition and poison photocatalysts. Based on the above experimental results and DFT calculation, the detailed CO 2 photoreduction mechanism was illustrated in Figure 11.Firstly, two photocatalysts were assembled by electrostatic interaction accompanying with electron density redistribution in interface of composite.In fact, the formed oxygen vacancies in heterojunction interface caused an obvious electron migration from CNS to Co 3 O 4 .Then, when exposed with visible-light irradiation, the electronic transition will occur in the band gap.Due to the intrinsic property of photoinduced electron-hole pairs recombination in semiconductor, there were obvious surface charge recombination in PCCN (Figure 9a), meaning a type-II heterojunction (Figure 11a).However, the detectable OH and O 2 -were contradictory thermodynamically to this charge transfer.Interestingly, the existing interfacial V O would suppress"}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was conducted in an airtight quartz reactor system and a 300 W Xe-lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter was placed on top as the visible-light source.
