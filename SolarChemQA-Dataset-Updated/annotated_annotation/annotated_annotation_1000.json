work, we successfully fabricated a two-dimensional step-scheme heterostructured PGCN/BOC nanocomposite with a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance compared to pure BOC and PGCN.The porous structure of PGCN endows a large specific surface area and abundant reactive sites.Unlike the traditional PCGN and BOC, the BOC exfoliated through calcination displays a nanosheet structure and thus shorten the diffusion distance of the charge carriers 43,45,76.Furthermore, the different Fermi level positions between PGCN and BOC can result in electron density difference, leading to the formation of a built-in electric field and a step-scheme charge-transfer route.This step-scheme heterojunction can not only overcome the shortcomings of the traditional type-II and Z-scheme heterojunctions, but also effectively suppress the recombination of useful electrons and holes and accelerate the recombination of useless electrons and holes 52.In addition, the step-scheme heterojunction leaves more electrons in the CB of PGCN and retains holes in the VB of BOC, which is thermodynamically favored to photo catalytic reactions because of the large driving force provided by its strong redox abilities 77,78.This work will provide new insight into the design and fabrication of novel heterojunction photocatalysts and facilitate potential applications in photocatalysis toward solar energy conversion.
