The XRD spectrum (Fig. 3a) of TOH shows apparent peaks at 2 of 25.29, 37.91, 48.21, 54.62, and 62.96, which are attributed to the (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), and (2 0 4) planes, respectively.This pattern conforms with that of standard anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS: 21-1272).The TOH catalyst did not show any peaks aside from the anatase phase, indicating high sample purity.Meanwhile, the CD sample illustrates a broad peak corresponding to the (0 0 2) plane of a graphitic framework at 2 of 25.56 (Fig. S1) 23.The XRD spectra of CD/TOH hybrids display peaks corresponding to TOH, and the typical peak of CD was not observed within the spectra.This may be attributed to the amorphous nature of CD and its low quantity in hybrid samples.However, as the amount of CD increases, the typical peaks of CD/TOH hybrids steadily move toward higher 2 values (Fig. 3b) and the diffraction intensities weaken, likely due to the interactions between TOH and CD. The UV-vis DRS profiles of TOH and CD/TOH samples are presented in Fig. 4a, from which the light-harvesting characteristics were investigated.The TOH sample reveals a sharp absorption edge at a wavelength of approximately 400 nm, referring to the inherent UV-light response of TiO 2 .Meanwhile, the optical property of CD was verified by its UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 4b), which shows two main peaks at 335 and 235 nm attributed to the n transitions of C -O groups and transitions of aromatic sp 2 C--C groups, respectively 28.Additionally, a transparent aqueous solution of CD exhibits vivid blue florescence when irradiated with UV light (365 nm), as shown in the inset of Fig. 4b.Importantly, compared to the TOH counterpart, all CD/TOH samples demonstrated a significantly improved light response throughout the visible range and a slight shift in the absorption edge toward higher wavelengths; this means that the addition of CD greatly improves the optical response of TOH.This analysis also serves as strong evidence of the existence of CD in the CD/TOH hybrids.Therefore, the remarkable light-harvesting ability of CD/TOH hybrids in the UV and visible range enables the production of a greater number of photoexcited charges, which promote photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions. Figure S2a shows the FTIR spectra of CD/TOH-2 hybrid and CD and TOH components.For the TOH catalyst, the typical bands representing Ti-O stretching vibrations were observed at wavenumbers less than 900 cm -1 , whereas the band corresponding to surface-adsorbed water molecules was observed at 3000-3400 cm -1 19.The CD sample shows the bands related to the functional groups of N-H/O-H (3000-3400 cm -1 ), C--O (1768 cm -1 ), -COOH (1352 cm -1 ), C -H (2850 cm -1 ), C-N (1452 cm -1 ), C--C (1545 cm -1 ), and C--N (1662 cm -1 ), which clearly show the incorporation of N into the CD structure 23,29.The CD sample demonstrates good stability and dispersibility in water by virtue of the above-mentioned plentiful functional groups.Importantly, the typical bands related to both CD and TOH were observed in the FTIR spectrum of the CD/TOH-2 hybrid, but with a slight change in their wavenumbers, suggesting the effective integration of CD and TOH components in the CD/TOH-2 hybrid. To further validate the interactions between the components of CD/ TOH-2 catalyst, Raman spectroscopy analysis was performed on CD, TOH, and CD/TOH-2 catalysts.As shown in Fig. S2b, TOH displays peaks at 143, 396, 517, and 638 cm -1 , representing the typical anatase phase of TiO 2 30.The Raman spectrum of CD illustrates two peaks at 1360 and 1598 cm -1 , which correspond to the typical D and G bands of graphitic carbon units, respectively 31,32.Interestingly, the CD/TOH-2 catalyst exhibits the similar Raman pattern as that of TOH, but with a shift in wavenumber, confirming the intimate interactions between TOH and CD in the CD/TOH-2 catalyst. The XPS spectra of TOH, CD, and CD/TOH-2 are provided in Fig. 5 to investigate the surface elemental states and bonding nature.The CD/ TOH-2 catalyst was composed of Ti, O, C, and N, whereas the TOH and CD components were composed of their respective elements, as confirmed by the XPS survey profiles provided in Fig. S3.The Ti 2p XPS spectrum in Fig. 5a reveals that the Ti ions in TOH are tetravalent with binding energies of 464.4 eV (Ti 2p 1/2 ) and 458.6 eV (Ti 2p 3/2 ) 33,34.Similar Ti components were also observed for the CD/TOH-2 catalyst, but with slight shifts in their binding energies.The intense peak at 529.6 eV appearing in the O 1s profile of TOH (Fig. 5b) reflects the characteristic lattice oxygen (Ti -O) species, whereas the low-intensity shoulder peak at 531.2 eV represents C--O groups 35.The O 1s spectrum of CD shows peaks corresponding to C -OH/C -O -C and C--O at 532.7 and 531.2 eV, respectively 36.However, the CD/TOH-2 catalyst demonstrated peaks related to lattice oxygen (Ti -O) and C--O at 529.6 and 531.2 eV, respectively.In addition, the C 1s profiles of both CD and CD/TOH-2 (Fig. 5c) display identical peaks at 288.1, 286.3, and 284.6 eV, attributed to C--N, C -OH, and C -C/C--C, respectively 37.Furthermore, two peaks at 399.2 and 397.5 eV, corresponding to N-(C) 3 and C -N -C groups, respectively 22,38, were found in the N 1s spectrum of CD (Fig. 5d).The presence of these functional groups implies that N species were successfully doped into the carbon dots during the synthesis process.Similar N components with slightly shifted binding energies were observed for CD/TOH-2, as shown in Fig. 5d.The shifts in the binding energies of Ti 2p and N 1s components demonstrate the interactions between the TOH and CD components in the CD/TOH hybrid 39,40, and are consistent with the results of the TEM, UV-vis DRS, and FTIR studies discussed above. The photocatalytic efficiency of the CD/TOH hybrids was evaluated for CO 2 reduction under simulated sunlight and compared with that of reference materials TOH, TON, and CD/TON.CH 4 was found to be the only carbonaceous solar fuel, and H 2 was generated as a minor product for TOH and all of the CD/TOH hybrid catalysts.Meanwhile, both the TON and CD/TON reference samples generated CH 4 and CO along with H 2 as the reduction products under similar test conditions.The base catalyst, TOH, shows a moderate CH 4 yield with a rate of 5.92 mol h - g -1 and a H 2 production rate of 5.24 mol h -1 g -1 , corresponding to a CH 4 selectivity of 82 against competitive H 2 production.Importantly, all CD/TOH hybrids display substantially improved CH 4 yields, and their efficiency is far superior to not only their TOH counterpart, but also the TON and CD/TON reference samples.As displayed in Fig. 6a, with increased CD content in the hybrids, the formation rate of CH increased, and the highest CH 4 formation rate of 26.8 mol h -1 g -1 was reached for the CD/TOH-2 sample containing 2 wt of CD.This accounts for a remarkable 4.5-fold improvement over the base material TOH.The inferior CO 2 reduction activities of CD/TOH-1 and CD/TOH-3 hybrids compared to CD/TOH-2 demonstrate the significance of the CD content in the hybrids to achieve optimum efficiency.Further, the formation rate of H 2 over this optimized CD/TOH-2 sample is extremely low, resulting in CH 4 selectivity of nearly 98.The improved activity and selectivity of the CD/TON catalyst relative to TON further demonstrates the significance of CD in achieving high CO 2 reduction activity and selectivity.Moreover, the superior and selective CO 2 reduction efficiency of TOH compared to TON reflects the importance of the hollow sphere structure of TOH.In addition, the CO 2 reduction efficiency of CD/TOH-2 hybrid for CH 4 production is comparable to or better than that of previously reported TiO 2 -based photocatalysts (Table S1).Notably, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the CD/TOH-2 hybrid for CH 4 production under 365-nm monochromatic light was 0.87, which was significantly higher than that of the previously reported state-of-theart photocatalysts 4142434445. In addition to high activity, the CD/TOH-2 catalyst is also expected to be stable for consecutive test runs.In this study, the CD/TOH-2 catalyst was subjected to fresh reaction medium for repeated CO 2 photoreduction reactions to elucidate its stability.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, there is no sign of decline in the CH 4 yield and less than 9 of its initial activity was observed after four repeated test runs, suggesting the extraordinary stability and reusability of the present catalyst.In addition, we also conducted some characterizations for the CD/TOH-2 catalyst after photocatalytic test reactions to identify structural changes.There is no evident change in the XRD pattern of the used CD/ TOH-2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. S4, indicating that its phase structure is stable against CO 2 photoreduction.The TEM micrographs of the CD/ TOH-2 before and after CO 2 reduction experiments (Fig. S5a andb) further highlight its morphological stability during photocatalysis.Furthermore, the FTIR profiles of the fresh and reused CD/TOH-2 catalysts are nearly identical (Fig. S6), implying that the target catalyst is structurally stable.The lack of apparent change in the XPS spectra of Ti 2p and C 1s before and after the CO 2 reduction reactions (Fig. S7(a) and (b)) further confirms that the chemical structure of the CD/TOH-2 catalyst was not altered during the photocatalytic process. The reliability of solar fuel generation from CO 2 photoreduction in the presence of catalysts was investigated by conducting different control experiments.First, isotope-labeling tests using 13 CO 2 were performed on the target CD/TOH-2 catalyst to realize the feedstock for solar fuel production.When, under the same test conditions, CO 2 was replaced with 13 CO 2 , two main signals with m/z values of 17 and 45 were observed, which are attributed to 13 CH 4 and 13 CO 2 , respectively, as shown in Fig. S8.This study confirmed that CO 2 is the feedstock for solar fuel generation.No hydrocarbon production was observed under the same test conditions with argon in place of CO 2 , further confirming that the feedstock for the production of hydrocarbon is merely CO 2 and excluding the possibility of contamination by organic residues.Furthermore, the control test, without light irradiation or catalyst, did not contribute to the generation of solar fuel, proving that the reduction of CO 2 was exclusively induced by solar illumination and catalyst. To understand the impact of surface properties, such as the BET surface area (S BET ), average pore diameter (d avg ), and total pore volume (V tot ) on CO 2 reduction performance, N 2 sorption analysis was performed over TOH, CD/TOH-2, TON, and CD/TON catalysts (Fig. 7a and Fig. S9).According to the IUPAC classification 46, the TOH and CD/ TOH-2 catalysts display type-IV isotherms with H4 hysteresis loops representing narrow slit-shaped pores, whereas TON and CD/TON samples display type-IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops reflecting slit-shaped porosity.The surface properties of all catalysts are summarized in Table 1.It can be seen that the porous features of TOH are in good agreement with the results of TEM analysis.Moreover, the developed TOH affords extraordinary surface properties compared to the reference TON, consistent with its CO 2 reduction activities, which demonstrate that the surface properties play a significant role in improving the CO 2 reduction efficiency.In contrast to their CO 2 reduction activities, CD/TOH-2 and CD/TON hybrids exhibit slightly inferior surface properties than their respective TOH and TON counterparts.As such, the surface area factor could explain TOH's better performance compared to TON, but it could not explain why the CD/ TOH-2 and CD/TON hybrids show greater activities than their TOH and TON counterparts, even though they possess inferior surface properties. Given that CO 2 adsorption is another crucial factor that significantly influences the CO 2 reduction efficiency of a catalyst 47,48, we further studied the CO 2 adsorption capacities of the prepared catalysts, and results are presented in Fig. 7b.The CO 2 adsorption isotherm of the base material, TOH, demonstrates a rapid rise in CO 2 adsorption with increasing CO 2 relative pressure.As a consequence, TOH displayed exceptional CO 2 adsorption capacity (0.42 mmol/g) compared to TON (0.21 mmol/g), which was certainly due to TOH's larger surface area and better porous structure.Interestingly, the CD/TOH-2 hybrid affords further improved CO 2 adsorption capacity (0.57 mmol/g) relative to TOH.This further improved CO 2 adsorption capacity of the CD/TOH-2 hybrid cannot be explained by the surface area effect, as the hybrid showed less surface area than TOH, but it can be associated with CD.It is reasonable to assume that the delocalized -conjugated bonds present in CD are conducive to the adsorption of CO 2 through - conjugation interaction, as CO 2 molecules also contain delocalized -conjugated bonds 49.This phenomenon is further supported by the improved CO 2 adsorption of CD/TON (0.31 mmol/g) relative to that of TON.These results indicate that the addition of CD to TOH plays a critical role in enhancing the CO 2 uptake besides the surface area.Such excellent CO 2 adsorption ability of the present hybrid system is advantageous to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. It is widely known that photocatalytic CO 2 redox reactions over photocatalysts entail three intertwined fundamental processes described in this section 50.The first is light absorption and excitation to generate electrons and holes; the second is charge separation and transfer to the catalyst surface; and the third is the subsequent CO 2 adsorption, activation, and surface redox reactions.The UV-vis DRS/ absorption studies discussed above clearly demonstrate that the addition of CD significantly improves the light response of TOH; as a result, the target CD/TOH hybrids display remarkable light absorption in the UV and visible range, which leads to the production of a greater number of photoexcited electrons and holes.In addition, the extraordinary upconverted PL characteristics of CD enable the absorption of longer wavelengths of visible light and emit shorter wavelengths (Fig. S10), which could induce TOH to generate more electrons and holes 51. PL spectroscopy is considered as a potential tool for exploring photoexcited charge transfer and separation within the catalyst 52,53.PL emission intensity commonly represents the recombination of photoexcited charges, where a higher intensity indicates a greater possibility of electron-hole recombination.It can be seen in Fig. 8a that the reference sample TON exhibited the highest peak emission intensity among the samples, indicating the highest possibility of charge recombination.Notably, the peak intensity of TOH significantly decreased relative to that of TON, which signifies that the hollow sphere structure considerably hampers charge recombination in TOH.After introducing CD to TOH, the obtained CD/TOH-2 hybrid exhibited a substantially reduced PL emission intensity, which could be attributed to the transfer of electrons from TOH to CD, where CD serves as an electron reservoir to capture the photoinduced electrons and prevent their recombination with holes 54.The decreased PL emission intensity of CD/TON compared to TON further supports this assertion.In addition to PL, photocurrent studies were conducted to gain a better understanding of the charge transfer and migration of the fabricated samples.As expected, the target CD/TOH-2 hybrid displayed the highest photocurrent response, followed by the CD/TON, TOH, and TON samples (Fig. 8b).This means that the CD/TOH-2 hybrid affords accelerated the interfacial charge transfer, which restricts the probability of charge recombination and promotes charge separation.The trends of these PL and photocurrent findings are in accordance with the CO 2 reduction activities discussed above.These results indicate that the synergy between TOH and CD components, which promotes interfacial charge separation, plays a prominent role in the notable CO 2 reduction efficiency of the CD/TOH-2 hybrid system.In addition, the findings of the aforementioned BET studies revealed that TOH affords a large surface area and a good porous structure, which helps to enhance the adsorption of CO 2 molecules on its surface.The addition of CD further boosted the CO 2 adsorption ability of TOH, despite its negative impact on surface properties.Further, the fate of the CO 2 molecules adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst was examined using in-situ DRIFT experiments in the presence of humid CO 2 .Several distinct bands can be seen over the range of 1200-1800 cm -1 in the DRIFT spectrum of the CD/TOH-2 catalyst (Fig. 9).The clear peaks at 1285, 1322, 1343, 1369, and 1392 cm -1 are assigned to the formate intermediates, whereas those at 1446, 1512, 1616, and 1622 cm -1 are attributed to the carbonate groups 49,55.It is worth noting that the peak intensities of formate gradually increased, whereas those of carbonate did not significantly change.These intermediates on the catalyst surface can be further converted to CH 4 as a final solar fuel under irradiation, as in previous works 49,55. To explore the photocatalytic mechanism underlying the marked CO 2 conversion efficiency of the present photocatalytic system, the band-edge potentials of TOH must be realized.Thus, UPS studies were performed in conjunction with Tauc plots on the TOH catalyst, and the results are presented in Fig. S11a-c.The bandgap energy of TOH determined from the Tauc plots was 3.12 eV, as shown in Fig. S11a.The UPS spectrum of TOH is presented in Figures S11b andc, from which the valence band (VB) potential was calculated to be 2.70 eV 56,57.By applying the VB potential and bandgap energy values, the conduction band (CB) potential can be measured simply as -0.42 eV.Based on these band-edge potentials and the experimental results discussed above, a possible photocatalytic mechanism of the present catalyst system was proposed and schematically outlined in Fig. 10.Upon light illumination, the catalyst is excited to create electrons and holes at the CB and VB, respectively.Due to the strong synergy between the CD and TOH components and the excellent electron storage capacity of CD, the photoexcited electrons at the CB of TOH can be transported quickly to CD, resulting in spatial separation of the photoexcited charges.The accumulated electrons on CD can react with CO 2 molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface to produce CH 4 with the aid of protons, whereas holes in the VB of TOH are transferred to water molecules to produce O 2 via photooxidation 19,58,59.Some previous studies 606162 reported that CH 4 and CO are the main possible hydrocarbons from CO 2 reduction on TiO 2 photocatalyst.Nonetheless, under our experimental conditions, we observed CH 4 as the only CO 2 reduction product from TOH and its composites.One potential reason why the present catalyst produces only CH 4 is its unsuitable band-edge potential to produce another possible solar fuel, CO (CO/CO 2 -0.53eV vs. NHE at pH 7) 63.The other possible reason is the effective adsorption of the reaction intermediates on CD, as CD contains heavily graphitized and N-holding functional groups.Driven by the advantages of its own hollow sphere structure and multiple benefits from CD, the present CD/TOH hybrid system displays remarkable and selective CH 4 generation from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "In this study, the CD/TOH-2 catalyst was subjected to fresh reaction medium for repeated CO 2 photoreduction reactions to elucidate its stability.", "context": "In this study, highly-configured TiO 2 hollow spheres were fabricated by a wrap-bake-peel method based on previous reports 26,27 and then decorated with N-doped carbon dots on their surfaces.The formation process of the target CD/TOH catalyst is clearly explained based on TEM micrographs and presented schematically in Scheme 1.The silica templates used in this study possess a clearly spherical shape and their surfaces are fairly smooth, as shown in Fig. 1a.The mean diameters of the templates were measured to be 200 nm (Fig. 1a).The TEM micrograph (Fig. 1b) of the TiO 2 /SiO 2 intermediate shows that the titania precursor was evenly deposited across the surfaces of the silica spheres, rendering the surfaces of the TiO 2 /SiO 2 spheres coarse.Moreover, the silica wrappings throughout the surfaces of the TiO 2 /SiO spheres led to the formation of another intermediate, SiO 2 /TiO 2 /SiO 2 , whose surface was quite smooth (Fig. 1c).This silica coating on the TiO 2 /SiO 2 spheres was engineered to resist surface diffusion and for further thermal treatment at high temperatures.Furthermore, the formation of tiny TiO 2 nanoparticles surrounded by silica templates was clearly visualized in the TEM image of the heat-treated SiO 2 /TiO 2 /SiO sample at 900C (Fig. 1d).After treating with aqueous sodium hydroxide, the whole silica templates were dissolved to obtain highlyconfigured TiO 2 hollow spheres, which is clearly visible in the TEM micrograph of the TOH sample (Fig. 1e).This TEM micrograph further reveals the porous nature of TiO 2 hollow spheres with wall thicknesses of approximately 25 nm.Further, the TEM micrograph of CD (Fig. 1f) shows the well isolated quasispherical particles with a mean diameter of 2.2 nm.In addition, the FETEM images of CD/TOH-2 hybrid demonstrate that the morphology of the TiO 2 hollow spheres remained unaltered after CD decoration (Fig. 2a andb).The distinct lattice fringes with d-spacings of 0.35 nm and 0.21 nm indexed to the (1 0 1) plane of TOH and the (1 0 0) plane of CD, respectively (Fig. 2c) 19,23.The HAADF maps of CD/TOH-2 (Fig. 2d-i and N elements across the hollow spheres further confirmed the successful integration of TOH and CD components in the CD/TOH-2 catalyst. The XRD spectrum (Fig. 3a) of TOH shows apparent peaks at 2 of 25.29, 37.91, 48.21, 54.62, and 62.96, which are attributed to the (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), and (2 0 4) planes, respectively.This pattern conforms with that of standard anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS: 21-1272).The TOH catalyst did not show any peaks aside from the anatase phase, indicating high sample purity.Meanwhile, the CD sample illustrates a broad peak corresponding to the (0 0 2) plane of a graphitic framework at 2 of 25.56 (Fig. S1) 23.The XRD spectra of CD/TOH hybrids display peaks corresponding to TOH, and the typical peak of CD was not observed within the spectra.This may be attributed to the amorphous nature of CD and its low quantity in hybrid samples.However, as the amount of CD increases, the typical peaks of CD/TOH hybrids steadily move toward higher 2 values (Fig. 3b) and the diffraction intensities weaken, likely due to the interactions between TOH and CD. The UV-vis DRS profiles of TOH and CD/TOH samples are presented in Fig. 4a, from which the light-harvesting characteristics were investigated.The TOH sample reveals a sharp absorption edge at a wavelength of approximately 400 nm, referring to the inherent UV-light response of TiO 2 .Meanwhile, the optical property of CD was verified by its UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 4b), which shows two main peaks at 335 and 235 nm attributed to the n transitions of C -O groups and transitions of aromatic sp 2 C--C groups, respectively 28.Additionally, a transparent aqueous solution of CD exhibits vivid blue florescence when irradiated with UV light (365 nm), as shown in the inset of Fig. 4b.Importantly, compared to the TOH counterpart, all CD/TOH samples demonstrated a significantly improved light response throughout the visible range and a slight shift in the absorption edge toward higher wavelengths; this means that the addition of CD greatly improves the optical response of TOH.This analysis also serves as strong evidence of the existence of CD in the CD/TOH hybrids.Therefore, the remarkable light-harvesting ability of CD/TOH hybrids in the UV and visible range enables the production of a greater number of photoexcited charges, which promote photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions. Figure S2a shows the FTIR spectra of CD/TOH-2 hybrid and CD and TOH components.For the TOH catalyst, the typical bands representing Ti-O stretching vibrations were observed at wavenumbers less than 900 cm -1 , whereas the band corresponding to surface-adsorbed water molecules was observed at 3000-3400 cm -1 19.The CD sample shows the bands related to the functional groups of N-H/O-H (3000-3400 cm -1 ), C--O (1768 cm -1 ), -COOH (1352 cm -1 ), C -H (2850 cm -1 ), C-N (1452 cm -1 ), C--C (1545 cm -1 ), and C--N (1662 cm -1 ), which clearly show the incorporation of N into the CD structure 23,29.The CD sample demonstrates good stability and dispersibility in water by virtue of the above-mentioned plentiful functional groups.Importantly, the typical bands related to both CD and TOH were observed in the FTIR spectrum of the CD/TOH-2 hybrid, but with a slight change in their wavenumbers, suggesting the effective integration of CD and TOH components in the CD/TOH-2 hybrid. To further validate the interactions between the components of CD/ TOH-2 catalyst, Raman spectroscopy analysis was performed on CD, TOH, and CD/TOH-2 catalysts.As shown in Fig. S2b, TOH displays peaks at 143, 396, 517, and 638 cm -1 , representing the typical anatase phase of TiO 2 30.The Raman spectrum of CD illustrates two peaks at 1360 and 1598 cm -1 , which correspond to the typical D and G bands of graphitic carbon units, respectively 31,32.Interestingly, the CD/TOH-2 catalyst exhibits the similar Raman pattern as that of TOH, but with a shift in wavenumber, confirming the intimate interactions between TOH and CD in the CD/TOH-2 catalyst. The XPS spectra of TOH, CD, and CD/TOH-2 are provided in Fig. 5 to investigate the surface elemental states and bonding nature.The CD/ TOH-2 catalyst was composed of Ti, O, C, and N, whereas the TOH and CD components were composed of their respective elements, as confirmed by the XPS survey profiles provided in Fig. S3.The Ti 2p XPS spectrum in Fig. 5a reveals that the Ti ions in TOH are tetravalent with binding energies of 464.4 eV (Ti 2p 1/2 ) and 458.6 eV (Ti 2p 3/2 ) 33,34.Similar Ti components were also observed for the CD/TOH-2 catalyst, but with slight shifts in their binding energies.The intense peak at 529.6 eV appearing in the O 1s profile of TOH (Fig. 5b) reflects the characteristic lattice oxygen (Ti -O) species, whereas the low-intensity shoulder peak at 531.2 eV represents C--O groups 35.The O 1s spectrum of CD shows peaks corresponding to C -OH/C -O -C and C--O at 532.7 and 531.2 eV, respectively 36.However, the CD/TOH-2 catalyst demonstrated peaks related to lattice oxygen (Ti -O) and C--O at 529.6 and 531.2 eV, respectively.In addition, the C 1s profiles of both CD and CD/TOH-2 (Fig. 5c) display identical peaks at 288.1, 286.3, and 284.6 eV, attributed to C--N, C -OH, and C -C/C--C, respectively 37.Furthermore, two peaks at 399.2 and 397.5 eV, corresponding to N-(C) 3 and C -N -C groups, respectively 22,38, were found in the N 1s spectrum of CD (Fig. 5d).The presence of these functional groups implies that N species were successfully doped into the carbon dots during the synthesis process.Similar N components with slightly shifted binding energies were observed for CD/TOH-2, as shown in Fig. 5d.The shifts in the binding energies of Ti 2p and N 1s components demonstrate the interactions between the TOH and CD components in the CD/TOH hybrid 39,40, and are consistent with the results of the TEM, UV-vis DRS, and FTIR studies discussed above. The photocatalytic efficiency of the CD/TOH hybrids was evaluated for CO 2 reduction under simulated sunlight and compared with that of reference materials TOH, TON, and CD/TON.CH 4 was found to be the only carbonaceous solar fuel, and H 2 was generated as a minor product for TOH and all of the CD/TOH hybrid catalysts.Meanwhile, both the TON and CD/TON reference samples generated CH 4 and CO along with H 2 as the reduction products under similar test conditions.The base catalyst, TOH, shows a moderate CH 4 yield with a rate of 5.92 mol h - g -1 and a H 2 production rate of 5.24 mol h -1 g -1 , corresponding to a CH 4 selectivity of 82 against competitive H 2 production.Importantly, all CD/TOH hybrids display substantially improved CH 4 yields, and their efficiency is far superior to not only their TOH counterpart, but also the TON and CD/TON reference samples.As displayed in Fig. 6a, with increased CD content in the hybrids, the formation rate of CH increased, and the highest CH 4 formation rate of 26.8 mol h -1 g -1 was reached for the CD/TOH-2 sample containing 2 wt of CD.This accounts for a remarkable 4.5-fold improvement over the base material TOH.The inferior CO 2 reduction activities of CD/TOH-1 and CD/TOH-3 hybrids compared to CD/TOH-2 demonstrate the significance of the CD content in the hybrids to achieve optimum efficiency.Further, the formation rate of H 2 over this optimized CD/TOH-2 sample is extremely low, resulting in CH 4 selectivity of nearly 98.The improved activity and selectivity of the CD/TON catalyst relative to TON further demonstrates the significance of CD in achieving high CO 2 reduction activity and selectivity.Moreover, the superior and selective CO 2 reduction efficiency of TOH compared to TON reflects the importance of the hollow sphere structure of TOH.In addition, the CO 2 reduction efficiency of CD/TOH-2 hybrid for CH 4 production is comparable to or better than that of previously reported TiO 2 -based photocatalysts (Table S1).Notably, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the CD/TOH-2 hybrid for CH 4 production under 365-nm monochromatic light was 0.87, which was significantly higher than that of the previously reported state-of-theart photocatalysts 4142434445. In addition to high activity, the CD/TOH-2 catalyst is also expected to be stable for consecutive test runs.In this study, the CD/TOH-2 catalyst was subjected to fresh reaction medium for repeated CO 2 photoreduction reactions to elucidate its stability.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, there is no sign of decline in the CH 4 yield and less than 9 of its initial activity was observed after four repeated test runs, suggesting the extraordinary stability and reusability of the present catalyst.In addition, we also conducted some characterizations for the CD/TOH-2 catalyst after photocatalytic test reactions to identify structural changes.There is no evident change in the XRD pattern of the used CD/ TOH-2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. S4, indicating that its phase structure is stable against CO 2 photoreduction.The TEM micrographs of the CD/ TOH-2 before and after CO 2 reduction experiments (Fig. S5a andb) further highlight its morphological stability during photocatalysis.Furthermore, the FTIR profiles of the fresh and reused CD/TOH-2 catalysts are nearly identical (Fig. S6), implying that the target catalyst is structurally stable.The lack of apparent change in the XPS spectra of Ti 2p and C 1s before and after the CO 2 reduction reactions (Fig. S7(a) and (b)) further confirms that the chemical structure of the CD/TOH-2 catalyst was not altered during the photocatalytic process. The reliability of solar fuel generation from CO 2 photoreduction in the presence of catalysts was investigated by conducting different control experiments.First, isotope-labeling tests using 13 CO 2 were performed on the target CD/TOH-2 catalyst to realize the feedstock for solar fuel production.When, under the same test conditions, CO 2 was replaced with 13 CO 2 , two main signals with m/z values of 17 and 45 were observed, which are attributed to 13 CH 4 and 13 CO 2 , respectively, as shown in Fig. S8.This study confirmed that CO 2 is the feedstock for solar fuel generation.No hydrocarbon production was observed under the same test conditions with argon in place of CO 2 , further confirming that the feedstock for the production of hydrocarbon is merely CO 2 and excluding the possibility of contamination by organic residues.Furthermore, the control test, without light irradiation or catalyst, did not contribute to the generation of solar fuel, proving that the reduction of CO 2 was exclusively induced by solar illumination and catalyst. To understand the impact of surface properties, such as the BET surface area (S BET ), average pore diameter (d avg ), and total pore volume (V tot ) on CO 2 reduction performance, N 2 sorption analysis was performed over TOH, CD/TOH-2, TON, and CD/TON catalysts (Fig. 7a and Fig. S9).According to the IUPAC classification 46, the TOH and CD/ TOH-2 catalysts display type-IV isotherms with H4 hysteresis loops representing narrow slit-shaped pores, whereas TON and CD/TON samples display type-IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops reflecting slit-shaped porosity.The surface properties of all catalysts are summarized in Table 1.It can be seen that the porous features of TOH are in good agreement with the results of TEM analysis.Moreover, the developed TOH affords extraordinary surface properties compared to the reference TON, consistent with its CO 2 reduction activities, which demonstrate that the surface properties play a significant role in improving the CO 2 reduction efficiency.In contrast to their CO 2 reduction activities, CD/TOH-2 and CD/TON hybrids exhibit slightly inferior surface properties than their respective TOH and TON counterparts.As such, the surface area factor could explain TOH's better performance compared to TON, but it could not explain why the CD/ TOH-2 and CD/TON hybrids show greater activities than their TOH and TON counterparts, even though they possess inferior surface properties. Given that CO 2 adsorption is another crucial factor that significantly influences the CO 2 reduction efficiency of a catalyst 47,48, we further studied the CO 2 adsorption capacities of the prepared catalysts, and results are presented in Fig. 7b.The CO 2 adsorption isotherm of the base material, TOH, demonstrates a rapid rise in CO 2 adsorption with increasing CO 2 relative pressure.As a consequence, TOH displayed exceptional CO 2 adsorption capacity (0.42 mmol/g) compared to TON (0.21 mmol/g), which was certainly due to TOH's larger surface area and better porous structure.Interestingly, the CD/TOH-2 hybrid affords further improved CO 2 adsorption capacity (0.57 mmol/g) relative to TOH.This further improved CO 2 adsorption capacity of the CD/TOH-2 hybrid cannot be explained by the surface area effect, as the hybrid showed less surface area than TOH, but it can be associated with CD.It is reasonable to assume that the delocalized -conjugated bonds present in CD are conducive to the adsorption of CO 2 through - conjugation interaction, as CO 2 molecules also contain delocalized -conjugated bonds 49.This phenomenon is further supported by the improved CO 2 adsorption of CD/TON (0.31 mmol/g) relative to that of TON.These results indicate that the addition of CD to TOH plays a critical role in enhancing the CO 2 uptake besides the surface area.Such excellent CO 2 adsorption ability of the present hybrid system is advantageous to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. It is widely known that photocatalytic CO 2 redox reactions over photocatalysts entail three intertwined fundamental processes described in this section 50.The first is light absorption and excitation to generate electrons and holes; the second is charge separation and transfer to the catalyst surface; and the third is the subsequent CO 2 adsorption, activation, and surface redox reactions.The UV-vis DRS/ absorption studies discussed above clearly demonstrate that the addition of CD significantly improves the light response of TOH; as a result, the target CD/TOH hybrids display remarkable light absorption in the UV and visible range, which leads to the production of a greater number of photoexcited electrons and holes.In addition, the extraordinary upconverted PL characteristics of CD enable the absorption of longer wavelengths of visible light and emit shorter wavelengths (Fig. S10), which could induce TOH to generate more electrons and holes 51.
