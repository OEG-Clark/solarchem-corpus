Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of the as-prepared N TiO 2 and pristine TiO 2 .Without a nitrogen-source, the pristine TiO 2 has a rutile phase 18; when a nitrogen-sources is introduced, the rutile phase is retained in the resulting N TiO 2 .Overall, both the pristine TiO 2 and the N TiO 2 have the same dominant phase structure of rutile, as well as the same kinds of facets.When compared with the pristine TiO 2 , a striking increase arises in the intensities of the rutile (3 1 0) facet of N TiO 2 .This observation can be interpreted as due to the nitrogen atoms in NH 3 /N 2 H 4 becoming highly active under hydrothermal conditions, and are able to substitute for the oxygen atoms of TiO 2 .Once such point-defects form in TiO 2 embryos, the crystallization process prefers to continue along this facet and leads to oriented N TiO 2 crystals.Meanwhile, it needs to be noted that the intensity of the rutile (1 1 0) facet of the N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 is apparently higher than that of the NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 .According to the previous report on rutile with coexposed facets, the exposed c-axis (1 1 0) facet possesses oxygen vacancies which readily acts as the active sites to enhance the absorption of CO 2 and promote the charge transfer to adsorbed CO 2 molecules 19.Furthermore, the presence of (1 1 0) facet could significantly facilitate the efficient separation of photo-generated charge carriers among the crystal facets coexposed, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic performance 20.Neither of the N TiO 2 patterns possesses a characteristic peak related to an N-containing compound 21, which can be attributed to the amount of N element in the as-prepared samples being too small to be detected.Therefore, it can be safely said that the nitrogen doping treatment has little effect on the kinds of facets that are formed, and the only major effect is on the relative intensities of each peak. The XPS data in Fig. 3 exhibit the survey spectra and N 1s spectra of as-prepared samples.Peaks at 284.6 eV binding energy (BE) result from the carbon used as a reference in the XPS measurements.Compared with pristine TiO 2 , the survey spectra of N TiO 2 contain peaks at approximately 400 eV, which appear to be the suspected N 1s peaks, as shown in Fig. 3.For the further details, the high-resolution XPS measurements were carried out.In the inset spectra of Fig. 3, Gaussian fitting is conducted to analyze the N 1s peaks, and the results show that the N 1s spectra contain strong peaks at ca. 396 eV and weak peaks at ca. 400 eV.For N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 , its Gaussian fitting curves (green lines) possess peaks located at 396.6 eV and 399.8 eV, respectively, and at 396.3 eV and 400.3 eV (pink lines) for NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 .Generally, the presence of peaks at 396.3 eV and 396.6 eV BE represents the existence of atomic -N, indicating that the introduction of substitutional nitrogen in TiO 2 has been accomplished, as asserted by Asahi et al. 9, and these N atoms exist in the form of an O Ti N linkage.It worth noting that the BE of N atoms in N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 is higher than that of NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 , which can be attributed to the difference of electron density around N 22.During the N doping process, the N atoms in N 2 H 4 are more active than the N atom in NH 3 , due to the N N bond in N 2 H 4 , and are therefore more likely to create a N Ti N linkage in which the electron density around N is greater than that of the O Ti N linkage.Peaks at 399.8 eV and 400.3 eV BE are typically assignable to interstitial N atoms, normally manifested as Ti N O and/or Ti O N. An immediate Ti N bond is established between Ti and the introduced N atom, creating an N-induced mid-gap and narrowing the bandgap.Using the N 1s and O 1s peaks, the ratio of N to O in the range of the XPS testing depth can be calculated.The resulting stoichiometric ratios are estimated to be TiO 1.96 N 0.04 for N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 and TiO 1.982 N 0.018 for NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 , which may also reflect to some degree the difficulty of nitrogendoping for different nitrogen-sources.According to the fact that doped titania can keep its original featured structure under low concentration of dopants 23, the N TiO 2 in this study could thus retain the rutile phase, which is consistent with the above XRD results. Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectra of the resulting N TiO 2 and pristine TiO 2 .Broad peaks ranging from 400 to 800 cm -1 are assigned to the Ti O stretching vibrations of TiO 2 in both N TiO 2 and pristine TiO 2 .Peaks centered at about 1600 cm -1 result from the H O H bending vibrations of surface-adsorbed water molecules and the NH groups in the Ti N O linkage of both N TiO 2 14,24, while the peaks at 3410 cm -1 arise from OH stretching 25.Peaks located at 1050 cm -1 derive from the N O vibrations of the NH 2 groups in the Ti O N linkage of both N TiO 2 26.In addition, N 2 H 4doped N TiO 2 has a peak at 1400 cm -1 corresponding to N N vibrations 5.The coexistence of NH , NH 2 and N N groups in N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 indicates a partial decomposition of N 2 H 4 into NH 3 , which is in consistence with the results of Gai 5.Both N-related groups tend to have a discrete distribution on the surface of N TiO 2 .As previous reports on amine-functionalized TiO 2 , the amine groups such as NH 2 and NH can remarkably increase the chemisorption of CO 2 on the TiO 2 surface; efficiently promote the activation of CO 2 and the charge transfer from the excited TiO 2 to adsorbed CO 2 , enhancing the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into gaseous products, for example, CH 4 and CO 14.It is vital for the existence of N N groups in N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 , which provides a reducing environment in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and facilitates the further reduction of reaction intermediates such as CO, leading to CH 4 as the ultimate product.Consequently, different nitrogen-sources lead to a difference of groups on the surfaces of the N TiO 2 , as well as a difference in their quantities, which play a crucial role in the photocatalytic reaction. To investigate the influence of nitrogen-source on the UV-vis absorption performance of the N TiO 2 , the measurements of the UV-vis absorption spectra were carried out with the pristine and nitrogen-doped TiO 2 , and the results are displayed in Fig. 5. Compared with the pristine TiO 2 , the N TiO 2 showed a remarkable red-shifted absorption profile in the range from 300 to 450 nm, and the absorption spectrum extends to the visible light region 5,26,27, which can be ascribed the N dopant into the TiO 2 lattice as shown in the XPS result.It is apparent that the cutoff wavelength of the N TiO 2 is related to the nitrogen-source.In addition, the N TiO 2 shows an obviously enhanced visible light absorbance 5,27,28, furthermore, the absorbance of the N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 is higher than that of the NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 , which is mainly resulted from the difference of the N dopant concentration in corresponding N TiO 2 .Thus, N TiO 2 exhibits visible light photoactivity; both the varying cutoff wavelength and absorbance are closely connected with the nitrogen-source. Several 12-h measurements of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction were carried out with the prepared N TiO 2 and pristine TiO 2 samples under visible light illumination.The corresponding data (for the initial 8 h) are plotted as shown in Fig. 6.As the proportion of UV in incident light is actually small, less than 5, the total yield with the pristine TiO 2 is at a considerably low level during the entire measurement, merely several ppm/g cata./h.In contrast, the total yields with N TiO 2 are 60-80 times higher than that of the pristine TiO 2 .The total yield using N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 (maximum was 416 ppm/g cata./h) was noticeably higher than that from NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 (maximum was 338 ppm/g cata./h) during the entire survey, reaching a maximum value of 35 at the 6th hour (Fig. 6a).The significant increase of total yields can be attributed to the introduction of nitrogen in TiO 2 , leading to a narrowing of bandgap to enable to perform photocatalytic reaction under visible light illumination.Meanwhile, the compositions of the reduced products were investigated.As illustrated, the reduced products of the pristine TiO 2 were CO and CH 4 roughly at a volume ratio of 3:1 (Fig. 6b).However, the reduced products of the N TiO 2 showed a significant feature of extramalization (volume proportion up to nearly 99), namely the selectivity in dominant reduced product.The dominant substance was CH 4 for N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 (Fig. 6c), while conversely, it was CO for NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 (Fig. 6d).The selectivity can be interpreted such that CH 4 acts as the dominant reduced product for N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 resulting from the presence of these reducing N N groups which is beneficial for the complete conversion of CO 2 in the photocatalytic reduction into CH 4 , while CO is the dominant reduced product for NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 .In spite of the discrepancy in their respective photocatalytic abilities, both N TiO 2 catalysts showed good photocatalytic activities under visible light illumination.Hence, nitrogen-doping treatment of TiO 2 does not merely result in visible light photoactivity, but can also bring about selectivity in photocatalytic reduced products, which results from the nitrogen-sources possessing different chemical bonds. Based on the above results, a mechanism is proposed to elucidate the product selectivity of the N TiO 2 in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, and the schematic drawing is shown in Fig. 7.In presence of H 2 O in a gaseous reaction condition, CO 2 molecules adsorb on TiO 2 surface in the form of a carbonate and a linear species, either acting as donor of electrons by adsorbing on Lewis acid sites of N TiO 2 surface (oxygen vacancies) with its oxygen end, or functioning as acceptor of electrons by adsorbing on Lewis basic sites of N TiO 2 surface (surface oxygen atoms) with its electrophilic carbon atom 29.Recurring to a strong interaction with TiO 2 , the adsorbed CO 2 possesses a sufficient low LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) which is accessible for the transfer of photo-generated electrons from TiO 2 surface to the adsorbed CO 2 , accomplishing the activation of CO 2 .The introduction of N results in the presence of basic groups such as NH 2 , NH and N N, and these amine groups can significantly boost the chemisorption of CO 2 on the N TiO 2 surface by forming covalent C N bonds 14,26,30,31, efficiently facilitating the charge transfer from the excited TiO 2 to adsorbed CO 2 and enhancing the activation of CO 2 .Moreover, the direct increase of hydroxyl groups on surface of N TiO 2 leads to a more basic environment to further enhance the activation of CO 2 .Upon irradiation, photo-generated electron-hole pairs are present in N TiO 2 photocatalyst, leaving partial of the charge carriers after the recombination process.The reduction of CO 2 by one electron forms the radical of CO 2 -(Eq.( 1) in Table 1). In a basic TiO 2 such as N TiO 2 , the CO 2 activation is promoted by a electron-donating process from the alkali groups ( NH 2 , NH and N N) to CO 2 , which is actually a stoichiometrical consumption of the alkali atom or groups in an environment containing water vapor and oxygen.Fortunately, this process is highly unfavorable, instead, a proton-assisted multiple-electron process is more readily adopted as an alternative pathway of the CO 2 reduction 31.Thus, these basic groups (amine groups) are retained to obtain a sustainable photocatalytic performance.As the modification of TiO 2 surface has an impact on aspects of CO 2 reduction including the thermodynamics and kinetics of CO 2 activation, and the further conversion.The N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 and NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 both have the amine groups ( NH 2 and NH ); for the aminefunctionalized NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 , it favors the selective reduction of CO 2 into CO (Eq.( 3) in Table 1) 14; while for the N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 , intermediates of the CO 2 reduction (e.g., CO) tends to be further reduced to CH 4 (Eq.( 6) in Table 1) due to the presence of reducing N N groups in the N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 .Consequently, the N TiO 2 synthesized with different nitrogen-sources shows product selectivity in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ."}, {"llm generation": "N TiO2 (N2H4-doped N TiO2 and NH3-doped N TiO2)", "source": "The dominant reduced product of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction of N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 was CH 4 under visible light illumination, and the maximum total yield was 416 ppm/g cata./h; in contrast, the dominant reduced product was CO for NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 with a maximum total yield of 338 ppm/g cata./h.", "context": "In summary, using N 2 H 4 or NH 3 as nitrogen-sources, rutile N TiO 2 was synthesized via hydrothermal treatment.The binding energies of the substitutional-state N were 396.6 eV and 396.3 eV in N 2 H 4 -doped and NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 , respectively.In comparison with NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 , N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 had N N groups other than N O and OH groups.The dominant reduced product of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction of N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 was CH 4 under visible light illumination, and the maximum total yield was 416 ppm/g cata./h; in contrast, the dominant reduced product was CO for NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 with a maximum total yield of 338 ppm/g cata./h.The existence of N N groups in surface of N TiO 2 provides a reducing environment, leading to CH 4 acting as the dominant reduced product.By selecting a nitrogen-source with the appropriate chemical bond form, control over the desirable reduced products of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction under visible light illumination is possible.Importantly, in addition, the effect of nitrogen-doping is reinterpreted, and these results shall change the conventional views of doping in both theoretical and practical viewpoints.

The XPS data in Fig. 3 exhibit the survey spectra and N 1s spectra of as-prepared samples.Peaks at 284.6 eV binding energy (BE) result from the carbon used as a reference in the XPS measurements.Compared with pristine TiO 2 , the survey spectra of N TiO 2 contain peaks at approximately 400 eV, which appear to be the suspected N 1s peaks, as shown in Fig. 3.For the further details, the high-resolution XPS measurements were carried out.In the inset spectra of Fig. 3, Gaussian fitting is conducted to analyze the N 1s peaks, and the results show that the N 1s spectra contain strong peaks at ca. 396 eV and weak peaks at ca. 400 eV.For N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 , its Gaussian fitting curves (green lines) possess peaks located at 396.6 eV and 399.8 eV, respectively, and at 396.3 eV and 400.3 eV (pink lines) for NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 .Generally, the presence of peaks at 396.3 eV and 396.6 eV BE represents the existence of atomic -N, indicating that the introduction of substitutional nitrogen in TiO 2 has been accomplished, as asserted by Asahi et al. 9, and these N atoms exist in the form of an O Ti N linkage.It worth noting that the BE of N atoms in N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 is higher than that of NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 , which can be attributed to the difference of electron density around N 22.During the N doping process, the N atoms in N 2 H 4 are more active than the N atom in NH 3 , due to the N N bond in N 2 H 4 , and are therefore more likely to create a N Ti N linkage in which the electron density around N is greater than that of the O Ti N linkage.Peaks at 399.8 eV and 400.3 eV BE are typically assignable to interstitial N atoms, normally manifested as Ti N O and/or Ti O N. An immediate Ti N bond is established between Ti and the introduced N atom, creating an N-induced mid-gap and narrowing the bandgap.Using the N 1s and O 1s peaks, the ratio of N to O in the range of the XPS testing depth can be calculated.The resulting stoichiometric ratios are estimated to be TiO 1.96 N 0.04 for N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 and TiO 1.982 N 0.018 for NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 , which may also reflect to some degree the difficulty of nitrogendoping for different nitrogen-sources.According to the fact that doped titania can keep its original featured structure under low concentration of dopants 23, the N TiO 2 in this study could thus retain the rutile phase, which is consistent with the above XRD results. Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectra of the resulting N TiO 2 and pristine TiO 2 .Broad peaks ranging from 400 to 800 cm -1 are assigned to the Ti O stretching vibrations of TiO 2 in both N TiO 2 and pristine TiO 2 .Peaks centered at about 1600 cm -1 result from the H O H bending vibrations of surface-adsorbed water molecules and the NH groups in the Ti N O linkage of both N TiO 2 14,24, while the peaks at 3410 cm -1 arise from OH stretching 25.Peaks located at 1050 cm -1 derive from the N O vibrations of the NH 2 groups in the Ti O N linkage of both N TiO 2 26.In addition, N 2 H 4doped N TiO 2 has a peak at 1400 cm -1 corresponding to N N vibrations 5.The coexistence of NH , NH 2 and N N groups in N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 indicates a partial decomposition of N 2 H 4 into NH 3 , which is in consistence with the results of Gai 5.Both N-related groups tend to have a discrete distribution on the surface of N TiO 2 .As previous reports on amine-functionalized TiO 2 , the amine groups such as NH 2 and NH can remarkably increase the chemisorption of CO 2 on the TiO 2 surface; efficiently promote the activation of CO 2 and the charge transfer from the excited TiO 2 to adsorbed CO 2 , enhancing the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into gaseous products, for example, CH 4 and CO 14.It is vital for the existence of N N groups in N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 , which provides a reducing environment in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and facilitates the further reduction of reaction intermediates such as CO, leading to CH 4 as the ultimate product.Consequently, different nitrogen-sources lead to a difference of groups on the surfaces of the N TiO 2 , as well as a difference in their quantities, which play a crucial role in the photocatalytic reaction. To investigate the influence of nitrogen-source on the UV-vis absorption performance of the N TiO 2 , the measurements of the UV-vis absorption spectra were carried out with the pristine and nitrogen-doped TiO 2 , and the results are displayed in Fig. 5. Compared with the pristine TiO 2 , the N TiO 2 showed a remarkable red-shifted absorption profile in the range from 300 to 450 nm, and the absorption spectrum extends to the visible light region 5,26,27, which can be ascribed the N dopant into the TiO 2 lattice as shown in the XPS result.It is apparent that the cutoff wavelength of the N TiO 2 is related to the nitrogen-source.In addition, the N TiO 2 shows an obviously enhanced visible light absorbance 5,27,28, furthermore, the absorbance of the N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 is higher than that of the NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 , which is mainly resulted from the difference of the N dopant concentration in corresponding N TiO 2 .Thus, N TiO 2 exhibits visible light photoactivity; both the varying cutoff wavelength and absorbance are closely connected with the nitrogen-source. Several 12-h measurements of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction were carried out with the prepared N TiO 2 and pristine TiO 2 samples under visible light illumination.The corresponding data (for the initial 8 h) are plotted as shown in Fig. 6.As the proportion of UV in incident light is actually small, less than 5, the total yield with the pristine TiO 2 is at a considerably low level during the entire measurement, merely several ppm/g cata./h.In contrast, the total yields with N TiO 2 are 60-80 times higher than that of the pristine TiO 2 .The total yield using N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 (maximum was 416 ppm/g cata./h) was noticeably higher than that from NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 (maximum was 338 ppm/g cata./h) during the entire survey, reaching a maximum value of 35 at the 6th hour (Fig. 6a).The significant increase of total yields can be attributed to the introduction of nitrogen in TiO 2 , leading to a narrowing of bandgap to enable to perform photocatalytic reaction under visible light illumination.Meanwhile, the compositions of the reduced products were investigated.As illustrated, the reduced products of the pristine TiO 2 were CO and CH 4 roughly at a volume ratio of 3:1 (Fig. 6b).However, the reduced products of the N TiO 2 showed a significant feature of extramalization (volume proportion up to nearly 99), namely the selectivity in dominant reduced product.The dominant substance was CH 4 for N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 (Fig. 6c), while conversely, it was CO for NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 (Fig. 6d).The selectivity can be interpreted such that CH 4 acts as the dominant reduced product for N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 resulting from the presence of these reducing N N groups which is beneficial for the complete conversion of CO 2 in the photocatalytic reduction into CH 4 , while CO is the dominant reduced product for NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 .In spite of the discrepancy in their respective photocatalytic abilities, both N TiO 2 catalysts showed good photocatalytic activities under visible light illumination.Hence, nitrogen-doping treatment of TiO 2 does not merely result in visible light photoactivity, but can also bring about selectivity in photocatalytic reduced products, which results from the nitrogen-sources possessing different chemical bonds. Based on the above results, a mechanism is proposed to elucidate the product selectivity of the N TiO 2 in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, and the schematic drawing is shown in Fig. 7.In presence of H 2 O in a gaseous reaction condition, CO 2 molecules adsorb on TiO 2 surface in the form of a carbonate and a linear species, either acting as donor of electrons by adsorbing on Lewis acid sites of N TiO 2 surface (oxygen vacancies) with its oxygen end, or functioning as acceptor of electrons by adsorbing on Lewis basic sites of N TiO 2 surface (surface oxygen atoms) with its electrophilic carbon atom 29.Recurring to a strong interaction with TiO 2 , the adsorbed CO 2 possesses a sufficient low LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) which is accessible for the transfer of photo-generated electrons from TiO 2 surface to the adsorbed CO 2 , accomplishing the activation of CO 2 .The introduction of N results in the presence of basic groups such as NH 2 , NH and N N, and these amine groups can significantly boost the chemisorption of CO 2 on the N TiO 2 surface by forming covalent C N bonds 14,26,30,31, efficiently facilitating the charge transfer from the excited TiO 2 to adsorbed CO 2 and enhancing the activation of CO 2 .Moreover, the direct increase of hydroxyl groups on surface of N TiO 2 leads to a more basic environment to further enhance the activation of CO 2 .Upon irradiation, photo-generated electron-hole pairs are present in N TiO 2 photocatalyst, leaving partial of the charge carriers after the recombination process.The reduction of CO 2 by one electron forms the radical of CO 2 -(Eq.( 1) in Table 1). In a basic TiO 2 such as N TiO 2 , the CO 2 activation is promoted by a electron-donating process from the alkali groups ( NH 2 , NH and N N) to CO 2 , which is actually a stoichiometrical consumption of the alkali atom or groups in an environment containing water vapor and oxygen.Fortunately, this process is highly unfavorable, instead, a proton-assisted multiple-electron process is more readily adopted as an alternative pathway of the CO 2 reduction 31.Thus, these basic groups (amine groups) are retained to obtain a sustainable photocatalytic performance.As the modification of TiO 2 surface has an impact on aspects of CO 2 reduction including the thermodynamics and kinetics of CO 2 activation, and the further conversion.The N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 and NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 both have the amine groups ( NH 2 and NH ); for the aminefunctionalized NH 3 -doped N TiO 2 , it favors the selective reduction of CO 2 into CO (Eq.( 3) in Table 1) 14; while for the N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 , intermediates of the CO 2 reduction (e.g., CO) tends to be further reduced to CH 4 (Eq.( 6) in Table 1) due to the presence of reducing N N groups in the N 2 H 4 -doped N TiO 2 .Consequently, the N TiO 2 synthesized with different nitrogen-sources shows product selectivity in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
