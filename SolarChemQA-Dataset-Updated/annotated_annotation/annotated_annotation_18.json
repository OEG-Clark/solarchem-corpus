At low amounts of RuP photosensitiser (up to around 40 nmol, panel B), total CO production over 4 h depends on the amount used in assembly.Above this point, addition of extra RuP has little (if any) effect on the total CO production.As with the CODH dependence described above, this is not due to the surface becoming saturated with RuP above this point: the red data points in Fig. 2, panel B show that the amount of RuP adsorbed is approximately proportional to the amount that is supplied.Instead, we propose that at RuP loadings in excess of 40 nmol, the rate of electron injection into TiO 2 is sufficiently high for the amount of electroactive CODH being supplied.Crucially, the system is not limited by the light source: halving the distance of the lamp from the reaction vessel (thereby increasing light intensity by a factor of four), led to no increase in CO production. The role of the semiconductor in the photocatalyst is two-fold.Firstly, it acts as a scaffold for enzyme and dye molecules: experiments in which TiO 2 is omitted yield no detectable CO, nor do experiments in which phosphate (25 mM, in great excess over enzyme/photosensitiser) is present, since phosphate blocks all available binding sites.Secondly, the conduction band maintains the energy of the photoinjected electrons above a minimum potential threshold that is sufficient for CO 2 reduction by CODH.We therefore studied the effect of changing the semiconductor to materials other than P25 TiO 2 (Fig. 3). Experiments in which 5 mg of pure rutile nanoparticles (average diameter 100 nm) were used showed no detectable CO production over 4 h.UV-vis spectrophotometry indicated low uptake of both enzyme and photosensitiser components (0.71 nmol and 8.3 nmol respectively) to the rutile nanoparticles (Table 1).The lack of CO production is expected because the rutile conduction band (A0.32V vs. SHE at pH 6) 34 is too low in energy for CO 2 reduction (standard reduction potential of A0.46 V vs. SHE, corrected to pH 6).However, the complete lack of activity also adds weight to our mechanistic interpretation of the system: it rules out the possibility of a pathway for CO 2 reduction in which electrons from the photosensitiser pass directly to a neighbouring enzyme molecule, without passing through TiO 2 (we might still expect a small amount of CO production from this route).We deduce that the nanoparticles in the P25 TiO 2 system have a role beyond providing a mutual support for photosensitiser and enzyme. When 5 mg of pure anatase nanoparticles (average diameter 25 nm) was used, the overall activity was similar (within 20) to that observed with P25.This is expected, since P25 comprises Fig. 2 Black data points: total visible light-driven CO production at 20 C after 4 h, by systems prepared with varying amounts of (A) Ch CODH I, and (B) RuP.In panel A, all systems were prepared with 56 nmol RuP; and in panel B, all systems were prepared with 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I.In each experiment, Ch CODH I was adsorbed onto the P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles (5 mg) before sensitising with RuP, and the buffer was 200 mM MES (pH 6).Red data points: amounts of Ch CODH I and RuP adsorbed on 5 mg P25 TiO 2 .These data were calculated from UV-vis spectrophotometry measurements (Supplementary Information), using the relative intensities of the peaks at 280 nm (CODH) or 455 nm (RuP) before and after stirring with nanoparticles for 20 min.In the RuP adsorption study (Panel B, red data points), the nanoparticles were first modified by adsorption of 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I prior to RuP, in order to be consistent with the photocatalyst preparation method.Fig. 3 CO production at 5 mL suspensions of various semiconductors (5 mg of nanoparticles, except for ZnO (20 mg)) modified with Ch CODH I (2.56 nmol) and RuP (56 nmol).Each system was prepared and tested according to the protocol detailed in the experimental section.The buffer in each experiment was 200 mM MES, pH 6, 20 C. The black trace, using P25 TiO 2 , corresponds to our standard conditions benchmark, as referred to in the main text.80 anatase.Comparing photocatalysts prepared with 25 mg and 5 mg P25 TiO 2 (Supplementary Information), the total CO production after 4 h was very similar in each case, but the greater quantity of TiO 2 gave a more stable system (as shown by a more linear plot).The source of instability is under further investigation. The surface charge distribution (Supplementary Information) of Ch CODH II (the structure of which is closely related to that of Ch CODH I) shows that there are three highly negatively charged patches near to the D-cluster that is the electron entry point.To promote adsorption of the enzyme in an orientation such that the D-cluster is close to the nanoparticle surface, we investigated zinc oxide as an alternative semiconductor.Although the conduction band energies of anatase and ZnO are very similar, ZnO has a much higher isoelectric point than P25 TiO 2 (9.5 compared to 6.2), 35,36 and therefore at pH 6 the ZnO surface will carry a significant net positive charge, which we anticipate should favour CODH adsorption in the desired orientation.Due to the slight solubility of ZnO in our buffer solution (5 mL of 200 mM MES, pH 6), 20 mg of ZnO (an excess above the solubility limit) was used in trial CO 2 photoreduction experiments, along with standard system amounts of Ch CODH I (2.56 nmol) and RuP (56 nmol).In this system, 0.5 mmol CO was produced after 4 h: 10 of that produced using P25 TiO 2 .Additionally, CO production appeared to cease after 1 h -possibly due to surface layers of ZnO dissolving over time, with simultaneous desorption of CODH and RuP.Some of the difference in activity may be attributed to poorer binding of dye to ZnO compared to our standard system using P25 TiO 2 : only around 60 (35.7 nmol) of the 56 nmol RuP added is bound to ZnO after the 20 min adsorption period, compared to almost 100 with P25 TiO 2 (Table 1). Strontium titanate is an attractive option for the semiconductor, due to its conduction band electrons being more reducing than those in anatase (the SrTiO 3 conduction band energy is about 0.2 V more negative than that of anatase). 37As shown in Fig. 3, CO 2 photoreduction by a SrTiO 3 -based system under identical conditions (5 mg SrTiO 3 , 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I, 56 nmol RuP) was poor, with only around 0.5 mmol CO produced after 4 h.This cannot be explained by low uptake of enzyme or photosensitiser (binding of both CODH and RuP is almost complete, Table 1).A likely reason is that the potential difference between the SrTiO 3 conduction band and the excited state of the dye is too small to drive rapid electron injection into the semiconductor. Variation of the amount of P25 TiO 2 (Fig. 4A) has significant effect on overall activity.When the amount of P25 TiO 2 used in a 5 mL supension is increased from 1 mg to 5 mg, overall activity increases by 150.This is attributable to the greater available space for adsorption of each component -with 1 mg P25 TiO 2 , only around 28 nmol of RuP and 1.9 nmol of Ch CODH I is adsorbed.At 25 mg P25 TiO 2 the overall activity is no greater than at 5 mg, since there is almost complete adsorption of the two components when using 5 mg, and extra TiO 2 surface area is of no use. In our previous paper, we ruled out photoinstability (i.e.degradation of RuP or enzyme), substrate depletion and product inhibition as causes of the decrease in activity over time. 24We expect to lose a small amount of activity over 4 h due to detachment of the enzyme molecules (around 20-25, Supplementary Information) but this does not fully account for the loss of activity over this time (CO production rate in the fourth hour is roughly a quarter of the production rate in the first hour, Fig. 3 black trace).We therefore looked into further factors. The order in which the nanoparticles are functionalised (i.e.whether enzyme or photosensitiser is adsorbed onto the surface first) has no effect on either overall activity (Fig. 4B) or stability (Supplementary Information).This implies that the existing presence of either Ch CODH I or RuP has no effect on the adsorption of the second component. Following injection of an electron from the photoexcited state of RuP ('RuP') into TiO 2 , the photosensitiser must be regenerated by reduction back to its initial state.The electrons for this regeneration are provided by a sacrificial electron donor, which in our benchmark system is MES (already present at 200 mM in order to buffer the high CO 2 concentration).More commonly used sacrificial electron donors in photochemical systems are triethanolamine (TEOA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).The inclusion of a 25 mM component of TEOA in the aqueous buffer gave no increase in activity (nor stability).However, the same concentration of EDTA produced an enhancement of activity of around 40 (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Information). We tested four different CODHs (Fig. 4D).CODH I and CODH II from the anaerobic organism Ch showed similar activity (around 5 mmol CO produced after 4 h).Systems using either CODH/ACS (a Ni-CODH as part of a complex with ACS, acetyl CoA synthase) from Moorella thermoacetica, or an oxygen-tolerant CODH (a MoFeS flavoprotein containing 2Fe-2S clusters) from Oligotropha carboxidovorans failed to produce any detectable CO (Supplementary Information). Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans is an anaerobic organism, and the activity of the CODH enzymes it expresses is known to be heavily suppressed by oxygen.However, for a solar fuel catalyst to be a viable proposition on a large scale, it should ideally be able to function in air, and this led us to evaluate the air (and O 2 ) tolerance of our system.In the experiments shown in Fig. 5, systems were prepared according to the standard system protocol, and irradiated for 1.5 h.Then, for 20 min the suspension of nanoparticles was either purged with O 2 (blue line), stirred in air with the seal of the tube removed (red line), or kept sealed and stirred under its existing gas atmosphere (black line).The vessel was then re-sealed (if necessary), and purged with 98 CO 2 /2 CH 4 for 20 min, and irradiation restarted. After exposure to O 2 , the system was almost completely inactivated.Following exposure to air (red trace), the system was largely inactivated, but about 15 of its activity was retained.However, we are confident that leakage of air into the reaction vessel is not responsible for the instability observed in the experiments in Fig. 3.The vessel remains tightly sealed throughout each 4 h experiment, and although the rubber septum is pierced every half hour for GC gas measurements, control experiments in which the septum remained intact (with only one gas measurement at the end of the experiment) yielded very similar amounts of CO (within experimental error of the black trace in Fig. 3). During the functionalisation of TiO 2 nanoparticles with CODH, enzyme molecules adsorb in the most favourable orientation according to the interaction between the surface residues of the protein and the hydroxylated TiO 2 surface.However, the orientation of immobilised CODH molecules is not necessarily the most favourable for electron transfer from TiO 2 to the D-cluster.We thus explored some straightforward strategies for controlling the orientation of CODH molecules for enhanced electron transfer into the enzyme.Our approach used 'linking' molecules, which bind to the TiO 2 surface and provide an anchor for the negatively charged patches of residues around the D-cluster of CODH (described earlier) to bind to. We tested a range of surface linker modifications, including polymyxin B sulfate as a cationic layer, and glutamic acid (reported to coordinate strongly to TiO 2 surfaces) 38 with its amine group (protonated at pH 6) providing an anchor.Neither of these methods had any effect on activity, nor stability.Next, we used o-phosphorylethanol amine (OPEA), which contains a phosphonate group for binding to TiO 2 , and an amine group Fig. 5 The effect of exposure to air or O 2 on the activity of the functionalised P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles at pH 6, 20 C. After 1.5 h of irradiation, the suspension was either stirred in air (red), purged with O 2 (blue), or stirred while remaining sealed for 20 min as a control (black).The tube was then re-sealed and purged with 2 CH 4 /98 CO 2 , and irradiation restarted.(again, protonated at pH 6) as an anchor.We modified the TiO 2 P25 surface by adding OPEA (0.3 mg per 5 mg of nanoparticles) before adsorption of enzyme, and the effect on CO production is shown in Fig. 6. Rather than having the desired effect, the modifying layer decreased the rate of catalysis, and UV-vis spectrophotometry studies on the buffer solution (Supplementary Information) showed that this is (at least in part) due to lower uptake of enzyme when OPEA is used."}, {"llm generation": "Evonik Degussa P25 TiO2", "source": "Of the semiconductor materials that we investigated, we found photocatalysts prepared with Evonik Degussa P25 TiO 2 (a commercially available 3 : 1 mixture of anatase/rutile) and ordinary anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles to be the most effective, in terms of overall turnover rate.", "context": "Aqueous suspensions of semiconductor nanoparticles, modified with an efficient enzyme for CO 2 /CO interconversion, and sensitised to visible light using a ruthenium photosensitiser, provide a model catalytic system for solar fuel generation from CO 2 .Of the semiconductor materials that we investigated, we found photocatalysts prepared with Evonik Degussa P25 TiO 2 (a commercially available 3 : 1 mixture of anatase/rutile) and ordinary anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles to be the most effective, in terms of overall turnover rate.This is in line with these materials a) having conduction band potentials significantly more positive than the excited state potential of our photosensitiser, but also sufficiently reducing to drive very efficient CO 2 reduction at CODH; and b) showing high binding affinity for both CODH and photosensitiser.The P25 TiO 2 -based photocatalyst has a turnover frequency of 0.14 s A1 (average rate per total enzyme molecule over 4 h at 20 C).Although this is slower than what might be achieved if the enzyme was subjected to highly reducing potentials, we are probably limited here by the narrow driving force of the anatase conduction band electrons for CO 2 reduction (around 60 mV).Using the light intensity, and illuminated facial area of the reaction vessel, we estimated an average quantum yield of approximately 0.07.Our experiments so far have not been designed to optimise quantum efficiency, but to focus on the reproducible effects of enzyme and RuP loading and selection of nanomaterial. The fact that we could not improve significantly upon a turnover frequency at 20 C of 0.14 s A1 is intriguing because at this temperature the enzyme is easily able to catalyse CO 2 reduction at a rate of nearly 100 s A1 using the methyl viologen radical, formally an uphill reaction based on standard potentials.The inclusion of EDTA as an additional electron donor increases the activity slightly (by around 40) thus suggesting that the low activity is at least partially rooted in efficient regeneration of the photosensitiser.Our future attention thus turns to investigating different photosensitisers and minimising recombination losses.Another possibility is that CODH is relatively ineffective at retaining electrons before they are trapped during product formation.Recombination rates may be very enzyme dependent.This kind of study, incorporating into a model system an enzyme that is such an efficient and specific catalyst for CO 2 reduction, has nonetheless provided a great deal of information and constructive insight into the factors determining rates of solar-driven CO 2 reduction.

At low amounts of RuP photosensitiser (up to around 40 nmol, panel B), total CO production over 4 h depends on the amount used in assembly.Above this point, addition of extra RuP has little (if any) effect on the total CO production.As with the CODH dependence described above, this is not due to the surface becoming saturated with RuP above this point: the red data points in Fig. 2, panel B show that the amount of RuP adsorbed is approximately proportional to the amount that is supplied.Instead, we propose that at RuP loadings in excess of 40 nmol, the rate of electron injection into TiO 2 is sufficiently high for the amount of electroactive CODH being supplied.Crucially, the system is not limited by the light source: halving the distance of the lamp from the reaction vessel (thereby increasing light intensity by a factor of four), led to no increase in CO production. The role of the semiconductor in the photocatalyst is two-fold.Firstly, it acts as a scaffold for enzyme and dye molecules: experiments in which TiO 2 is omitted yield no detectable CO, nor do experiments in which phosphate (25 mM, in great excess over enzyme/photosensitiser) is present, since phosphate blocks all available binding sites.Secondly, the conduction band maintains the energy of the photoinjected electrons above a minimum potential threshold that is sufficient for CO 2 reduction by CODH.We therefore studied the effect of changing the semiconductor to materials other than P25 TiO 2 (Fig. 3). Experiments in which 5 mg of pure rutile nanoparticles (average diameter 100 nm) were used showed no detectable CO production over 4 h.UV-vis spectrophotometry indicated low uptake of both enzyme and photosensitiser components (0.71 nmol and 8.3 nmol respectively) to the rutile nanoparticles (Table 1).The lack of CO production is expected because the rutile conduction band (A0.32V vs. SHE at pH 6) 34 is too low in energy for CO 2 reduction (standard reduction potential of A0.46 V vs. SHE, corrected to pH 6).However, the complete lack of activity also adds weight to our mechanistic interpretation of the system: it rules out the possibility of a pathway for CO 2 reduction in which electrons from the photosensitiser pass directly to a neighbouring enzyme molecule, without passing through TiO 2 (we might still expect a small amount of CO production from this route).We deduce that the nanoparticles in the P25 TiO 2 system have a role beyond providing a mutual support for photosensitiser and enzyme. When 5 mg of pure anatase nanoparticles (average diameter 25 nm) was used, the overall activity was similar (within 20) to that observed with P25.This is expected, since P25 comprises Fig. 2 Black data points: total visible light-driven CO production at 20 C after 4 h, by systems prepared with varying amounts of (A) Ch CODH I, and (B) RuP.In panel A, all systems were prepared with 56 nmol RuP; and in panel B, all systems were prepared with 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I.In each experiment, Ch CODH I was adsorbed onto the P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles (5 mg) before sensitising with RuP, and the buffer was 200 mM MES (pH 6).Red data points: amounts of Ch CODH I and RuP adsorbed on 5 mg P25 TiO 2 .These data were calculated from UV-vis spectrophotometry measurements (Supplementary Information), using the relative intensities of the peaks at 280 nm (CODH) or 455 nm (RuP) before and after stirring with nanoparticles for 20 min.In the RuP adsorption study (Panel B, red data points), the nanoparticles were first modified by adsorption of 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I prior to RuP, in order to be consistent with the photocatalyst preparation method.Fig. 3 CO production at 5 mL suspensions of various semiconductors (5 mg of nanoparticles, except for ZnO (20 mg)) modified with Ch CODH I (2.56 nmol) and RuP (56 nmol).Each system was prepared and tested according to the protocol detailed in the experimental section.The buffer in each experiment was 200 mM MES, pH 6, 20 C. The black trace, using P25 TiO 2 , corresponds to our standard conditions benchmark, as referred to in the main text.80 anatase.Comparing photocatalysts prepared with 25 mg and 5 mg P25 TiO 2 (Supplementary Information), the total CO production after 4 h was very similar in each case, but the greater quantity of TiO 2 gave a more stable system (as shown by a more linear plot).The source of instability is under further investigation. The surface charge distribution (Supplementary Information) of Ch CODH II (the structure of which is closely related to that of Ch CODH I) shows that there are three highly negatively charged patches near to the D-cluster that is the electron entry point.To promote adsorption of the enzyme in an orientation such that the D-cluster is close to the nanoparticle surface, we investigated zinc oxide as an alternative semiconductor.Although the conduction band energies of anatase and ZnO are very similar, ZnO has a much higher isoelectric point than P25 TiO 2 (9.5 compared to 6.2), 35,36 and therefore at pH 6 the ZnO surface will carry a significant net positive charge, which we anticipate should favour CODH adsorption in the desired orientation.Due to the slight solubility of ZnO in our buffer solution (5 mL of 200 mM MES, pH 6), 20 mg of ZnO (an excess above the solubility limit) was used in trial CO 2 photoreduction experiments, along with standard system amounts of Ch CODH I (2.56 nmol) and RuP (56 nmol).In this system, 0.5 mmol CO was produced after 4 h: 10 of that produced using P25 TiO 2 .Additionally, CO production appeared to cease after 1 h -possibly due to surface layers of ZnO dissolving over time, with simultaneous desorption of CODH and RuP.Some of the difference in activity may be attributed to poorer binding of dye to ZnO compared to our standard system using P25 TiO 2 : only around 60 (35.7 nmol) of the 56 nmol RuP added is bound to ZnO after the 20 min adsorption period, compared to almost 100 with P25 TiO 2 (Table 1). Strontium titanate is an attractive option for the semiconductor, due to its conduction band electrons being more reducing than those in anatase (the SrTiO 3 conduction band energy is about 0.2 V more negative than that of anatase). 37As shown in Fig. 3, CO 2 photoreduction by a SrTiO 3 -based system under identical conditions (5 mg SrTiO 3 , 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I, 56 nmol RuP) was poor, with only around 0.5 mmol CO produced after 4 h.This cannot be explained by low uptake of enzyme or photosensitiser (binding of both CODH and RuP is almost complete, Table 1).A likely reason is that the potential difference between the SrTiO 3 conduction band and the excited state of the dye is too small to drive rapid electron injection into the semiconductor. Variation of the amount of P25 TiO 2 (Fig. 4A) has significant effect on overall activity.When the amount of P25 TiO 2 used in a 5 mL supension is increased from 1 mg to 5 mg, overall activity increases by 150.This is attributable to the greater available space for adsorption of each component -with 1 mg P25 TiO 2 , only around 28 nmol of RuP and 1.9 nmol of Ch CODH I is adsorbed.At 25 mg P25 TiO 2 the overall activity is no greater than at 5 mg, since there is almost complete adsorption of the two components when using 5 mg, and extra TiO 2 surface area is of no use. In our previous paper, we ruled out photoinstability (i.e.degradation of RuP or enzyme), substrate depletion and product inhibition as causes of the decrease in activity over time. 24We expect to lose a small amount of activity over 4 h due to detachment of the enzyme molecules (around 20-25, Supplementary Information) but this does not fully account for the loss of activity over this time (CO production rate in the fourth hour is roughly a quarter of the production rate in the first hour, Fig. 3 black trace).We therefore looked into further factors. The order in which the nanoparticles are functionalised (i.e.whether enzyme or photosensitiser is adsorbed onto the surface first) has no effect on either overall activity (Fig. 4B) or stability (Supplementary Information).This implies that the existing presence of either Ch CODH I or RuP has no effect on the adsorption of the second component. Following injection of an electron from the photoexcited state of RuP ('RuP') into TiO 2 , the photosensitiser must be regenerated by reduction back to its initial state.The electrons for this regeneration are provided by a sacrificial electron donor, which in our benchmark system is MES (already present at 200 mM in order to buffer the high CO 2 concentration).More commonly used sacrificial electron donors in photochemical systems are triethanolamine (TEOA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).The inclusion of a 25 mM component of TEOA in the aqueous buffer gave no increase in activity (nor stability).However, the same concentration of EDTA produced an enhancement of activity of around 40 (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Information). We tested four different CODHs (Fig. 4D).CODH I and CODH II from the anaerobic organism Ch showed similar activity (around 5 mmol CO produced after 4 h).Systems using either CODH/ACS (a Ni-CODH as part of a complex with ACS, acetyl CoA synthase) from Moorella thermoacetica, or an oxygen-tolerant CODH (a MoFeS flavoprotein containing 2Fe-2S clusters) from Oligotropha carboxidovorans failed to produce any detectable CO (Supplementary Information). Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans is an anaerobic organism, and the activity of the CODH enzymes it expresses is known to be heavily suppressed by oxygen.However, for a solar fuel catalyst to be a viable proposition on a large scale, it should ideally be able to function in air, and this led us to evaluate the air (and O 2 ) tolerance of our system.In the experiments shown in Fig. 5, systems were prepared according to the standard system protocol, and irradiated for 1.5 h.Then, for 20 min the suspension of nanoparticles was either purged with O 2 (blue line), stirred in air with the seal of the tube removed (red line), or kept sealed and stirred under its existing gas atmosphere (black line).The vessel was then re-sealed (if necessary), and purged with 98 CO 2 /2 CH 4 for 20 min, and irradiation restarted. After exposure to O 2 , the system was almost completely inactivated.Following exposure to air (red trace), the system was largely inactivated, but about 15 of its activity was retained.However, we are confident that leakage of air into the reaction vessel is not responsible for the instability observed in the experiments in Fig. 3.The vessel remains tightly sealed throughout each 4 h experiment, and although the rubber septum is pierced every half hour for GC gas measurements, control experiments in which the septum remained intact (with only one gas measurement at the end of the experiment) yielded very similar amounts of CO (within experimental error of the black trace in Fig. 3). During the functionalisation of TiO 2 nanoparticles with CODH, enzyme molecules adsorb in the most favourable orientation according to the interaction between the surface residues of the protein and the hydroxylated TiO 2 surface.However, the orientation of immobilised CODH molecules is not necessarily the most favourable for electron transfer from TiO 2 to the D-cluster.We thus explored some straightforward strategies for controlling the orientation of CODH molecules for enhanced electron transfer into the enzyme.Our approach used 'linking' molecules, which bind to the TiO 2 surface and provide an anchor for the negatively charged patches of residues around the D-cluster of CODH (described earlier) to bind to. We tested a range of surface linker modifications, including polymyxin B sulfate as a cationic layer, and glutamic acid (reported to coordinate strongly to TiO 2 surfaces) 38 with its amine group (protonated at pH 6) providing an anchor.Neither of these methods had any effect on activity, nor stability.Next, we used o-phosphorylethanol amine (OPEA), which contains a phosphonate group for binding to TiO 2 , and an amine group Fig. 5 The effect of exposure to air or O 2 on the activity of the functionalised P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles at pH 6, 20 C. After 1.5 h of irradiation, the suspension was either stirred in air (red), purged with O 2 (blue), or stirred while remaining sealed for 20 min as a control (black).The tube was then re-sealed and purged with 2 CH 4 /98 CO 2 , and irradiation restarted.(again, protonated at pH 6) as an anchor.We modified the TiO 2 P25 surface by adding OPEA (0.3 mg per 5 mg of nanoparticles) before adsorption of enzyme, and the effect on CO production is shown in Fig. 6. Rather than having the desired effect, the modifying layer decreased the rate of catalysis, and UV-vis spectrophotometry studies on the buffer solution (Supplementary Information) showed that this is (at least in part) due to lower uptake of enzyme when OPEA is used."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "Aqueous suspensions of semiconductor nanoparticles, modified with an efficient enzyme for CO 2 /CO interconversion, and sensitised to visible light using a ruthenium photosensitiser, provide a model catalytic system for solar fuel generation from CO 2 .", "context": "Aqueous suspensions of semiconductor nanoparticles, modified with an efficient enzyme for CO 2 /CO interconversion, and sensitised to visible light using a ruthenium photosensitiser, provide a model catalytic system for solar fuel generation from CO 2 .Of the semiconductor materials that we investigated, we found photocatalysts prepared with Evonik Degussa P25 TiO 2 (a commercially available 3 : 1 mixture of anatase/rutile) and ordinary anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles to be the most effective, in terms of overall turnover rate.This is in line with these materials a) having conduction band potentials significantly more positive than the excited state potential of our photosensitiser, but also sufficiently reducing to drive very efficient CO 2 reduction at CODH; and b) showing high binding affinity for both CODH and photosensitiser.The P25 TiO 2 -based photocatalyst has a turnover frequency of 0.14 s A1 (average rate per total enzyme molecule over 4 h at 20 C).Although this is slower than what might be achieved if the enzyme was subjected to highly reducing potentials, we are probably limited here by the narrow driving force of the anatase conduction band electrons for CO 2 reduction (around 60 mV).Using the light intensity, and illuminated facial area of the reaction vessel, we estimated an average quantum yield of approximately 0.07.Our experiments so far have not been designed to optimise quantum efficiency, but to focus on the reproducible effects of enzyme and RuP loading and selection of nanomaterial.

At low amounts of RuP photosensitiser (up to around 40 nmol, panel B), total CO production over 4 h depends on the amount used in assembly.Above this point, addition of extra RuP has little (if any) effect on the total CO production.As with the CODH dependence described above, this is not due to the surface becoming saturated with RuP above this point: the red data points in Fig. 2, panel B show that the amount of RuP adsorbed is approximately proportional to the amount that is supplied.Instead, we propose that at RuP loadings in excess of 40 nmol, the rate of electron injection into TiO 2 is sufficiently high for the amount of electroactive CODH being supplied.Crucially, the system is not limited by the light source: halving the distance of the lamp from the reaction vessel (thereby increasing light intensity by a factor of four), led to no increase in CO production. The role of the semiconductor in the photocatalyst is two-fold.Firstly, it acts as a scaffold for enzyme and dye molecules: experiments in which TiO 2 is omitted yield no detectable CO, nor do experiments in which phosphate (25 mM, in great excess over enzyme/photosensitiser) is present, since phosphate blocks all available binding sites.Secondly, the conduction band maintains the energy of the photoinjected electrons above a minimum potential threshold that is sufficient for CO 2 reduction by CODH.We therefore studied the effect of changing the semiconductor to materials other than P25 TiO 2 (Fig. 3). Experiments in which 5 mg of pure rutile nanoparticles (average diameter 100 nm) were used showed no detectable CO production over 4 h.UV-vis spectrophotometry indicated low uptake of both enzyme and photosensitiser components (0.71 nmol and 8.3 nmol respectively) to the rutile nanoparticles (Table 1).The lack of CO production is expected because the rutile conduction band (A0.32V vs. SHE at pH 6) 34 is too low in energy for CO 2 reduction (standard reduction potential of A0.46 V vs. SHE, corrected to pH 6).However, the complete lack of activity also adds weight to our mechanistic interpretation of the system: it rules out the possibility of a pathway for CO 2 reduction in which electrons from the photosensitiser pass directly to a neighbouring enzyme molecule, without passing through TiO 2 (we might still expect a small amount of CO production from this route).We deduce that the nanoparticles in the P25 TiO 2 system have a role beyond providing a mutual support for photosensitiser and enzyme. When 5 mg of pure anatase nanoparticles (average diameter 25 nm) was used, the overall activity was similar (within 20) to that observed with P25.This is expected, since P25 comprises Fig. 2 Black data points: total visible light-driven CO production at 20 C after 4 h, by systems prepared with varying amounts of (A) Ch CODH I, and (B) RuP.In panel A, all systems were prepared with 56 nmol RuP; and in panel B, all systems were prepared with 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I.In each experiment, Ch CODH I was adsorbed onto the P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles (5 mg) before sensitising with RuP, and the buffer was 200 mM MES (pH 6).Red data points: amounts of Ch CODH I and RuP adsorbed on 5 mg P25 TiO 2 .These data were calculated from UV-vis spectrophotometry measurements (Supplementary Information), using the relative intensities of the peaks at 280 nm (CODH) or 455 nm (RuP) before and after stirring with nanoparticles for 20 min.In the RuP adsorption study (Panel B, red data points), the nanoparticles were first modified by adsorption of 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I prior to RuP, in order to be consistent with the photocatalyst preparation method.Fig. 3 CO production at 5 mL suspensions of various semiconductors (5 mg of nanoparticles, except for ZnO (20 mg)) modified with Ch CODH I (2.56 nmol) and RuP (56 nmol).Each system was prepared and tested according to the protocol detailed in the experimental section.The buffer in each experiment was 200 mM MES, pH 6, 20 C. The black trace, using P25 TiO 2 , corresponds to our standard conditions benchmark, as referred to in the main text.80 anatase.Comparing photocatalysts prepared with 25 mg and 5 mg P25 TiO 2 (Supplementary Information), the total CO production after 4 h was very similar in each case, but the greater quantity of TiO 2 gave a more stable system (as shown by a more linear plot).The source of instability is under further investigation. The surface charge distribution (Supplementary Information) of Ch CODH II (the structure of which is closely related to that of Ch CODH I) shows that there are three highly negatively charged patches near to the D-cluster that is the electron entry point.To promote adsorption of the enzyme in an orientation such that the D-cluster is close to the nanoparticle surface, we investigated zinc oxide as an alternative semiconductor.Although the conduction band energies of anatase and ZnO are very similar, ZnO has a much higher isoelectric point than P25 TiO 2 (9.5 compared to 6.2), 35,36 and therefore at pH 6 the ZnO surface will carry a significant net positive charge, which we anticipate should favour CODH adsorption in the desired orientation.Due to the slight solubility of ZnO in our buffer solution (5 mL of 200 mM MES, pH 6), 20 mg of ZnO (an excess above the solubility limit) was used in trial CO 2 photoreduction experiments, along with standard system amounts of Ch CODH I (2.56 nmol) and RuP (56 nmol).In this system, 0.5 mmol CO was produced after 4 h: 10 of that produced using P25 TiO 2 .Additionally, CO production appeared to cease after 1 h -possibly due to surface layers of ZnO dissolving over time, with simultaneous desorption of CODH and RuP.Some of the difference in activity may be attributed to poorer binding of dye to ZnO compared to our standard system using P25 TiO 2 : only around 60 (35.7 nmol) of the 56 nmol RuP added is bound to ZnO after the 20 min adsorption period, compared to almost 100 with P25 TiO 2 (Table 1). Strontium titanate is an attractive option for the semiconductor, due to its conduction band electrons being more reducing than those in anatase (the SrTiO 3 conduction band energy is about 0.2 V more negative than that of anatase). 37As shown in Fig. 3, CO 2 photoreduction by a SrTiO 3 -based system under identical conditions (5 mg SrTiO 3 , 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I, 56 nmol RuP) was poor, with only around 0.5 mmol CO produced after 4 h.This cannot be explained by low uptake of enzyme or photosensitiser (binding of both CODH and RuP is almost complete, Table 1).A likely reason is that the potential difference between the SrTiO 3 conduction band and the excited state of the dye is too small to drive rapid electron injection into the semiconductor. Variation of the amount of P25 TiO 2 (Fig. 4A) has significant effect on overall activity.When the amount of P25 TiO 2 used in a 5 mL supension is increased from 1 mg to 5 mg, overall activity increases by 150.This is attributable to the greater available space for adsorption of each component -with 1 mg P25 TiO 2 , only around 28 nmol of RuP and 1.9 nmol of Ch CODH I is adsorbed.At 25 mg P25 TiO 2 the overall activity is no greater than at 5 mg, since there is almost complete adsorption of the two components when using 5 mg, and extra TiO 2 surface area is of no use. In our previous paper, we ruled out photoinstability (i.e.degradation of RuP or enzyme), substrate depletion and product inhibition as causes of the decrease in activity over time. 24We expect to lose a small amount of activity over 4 h due to detachment of the enzyme molecules (around 20-25, Supplementary Information) but this does not fully account for the loss of activity over this time (CO production rate in the fourth hour is roughly a quarter of the production rate in the first hour, Fig. 3 black trace).We therefore looked into further factors. The order in which the nanoparticles are functionalised (i.e.whether enzyme or photosensitiser is adsorbed onto the surface first) has no effect on either overall activity (Fig. 4B) or stability (Supplementary Information).This implies that the existing presence of either Ch CODH I or RuP has no effect on the adsorption of the second component. Following injection of an electron from the photoexcited state of RuP ('RuP') into TiO 2 , the photosensitiser must be regenerated by reduction back to its initial state.The electrons for this regeneration are provided by a sacrificial electron donor, which in our benchmark system is MES (already present at 200 mM in order to buffer the high CO 2 concentration).More commonly used sacrificial electron donors in photochemical systems are triethanolamine (TEOA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).The inclusion of a 25 mM component of TEOA in the aqueous buffer gave no increase in activity (nor stability).However, the same concentration of EDTA produced an enhancement of activity of around 40 (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Information). We tested four different CODHs (Fig. 4D).CODH I and CODH II from the anaerobic organism Ch showed similar activity (around 5 mmol CO produced after 4 h).Systems using either CODH/ACS (a Ni-CODH as part of a complex with ACS, acetyl CoA synthase) from Moorella thermoacetica, or an oxygen-tolerant CODH (a MoFeS flavoprotein containing 2Fe-2S clusters) from Oligotropha carboxidovorans failed to produce any detectable CO (Supplementary Information). Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans is an anaerobic organism, and the activity of the CODH enzymes it expresses is known to be heavily suppressed by oxygen.However, for a solar fuel catalyst to be a viable proposition on a large scale, it should ideally be able to function in air, and this led us to evaluate the air (and O 2 ) tolerance of our system.In the experiments shown in Fig. 5, systems were prepared according to the standard system protocol, and irradiated for 1.5 h.Then, for 20 min the suspension of nanoparticles was either purged with O 2 (blue line), stirred in air with the seal of the tube removed (red line), or kept sealed and stirred under its existing gas atmosphere (black line).The vessel was then re-sealed (if necessary), and purged with 98 CO 2 /2 CH 4 for 20 min, and irradiation restarted. After exposure to O 2 , the system was almost completely inactivated.Following exposure to air (red trace), the system was largely inactivated, but about 15 of its activity was retained.However, we are confident that leakage of air into the reaction vessel is not responsible for the instability observed in the experiments in Fig. 3.The vessel remains tightly sealed throughout each 4 h experiment, and although the rubber septum is pierced every half hour for GC gas measurements, control experiments in which the septum remained intact (with only one gas measurement at the end of the experiment) yielded very similar amounts of CO (within experimental error of the black trace in Fig. 3). During the functionalisation of TiO 2 nanoparticles with CODH, enzyme molecules adsorb in the most favourable orientation according to the interaction between the surface residues of the protein and the hydroxylated TiO 2 surface.However, the orientation of immobilised CODH molecules is not necessarily the most favourable for electron transfer from TiO 2 to the D-cluster.We thus explored some straightforward strategies for controlling the orientation of CODH molecules for enhanced electron transfer into the enzyme.Our approach used 'linking' molecules, which bind to the TiO 2 surface and provide an anchor for the negatively charged patches of residues around the D-cluster of CODH (described earlier) to bind to. We tested a range of surface linker modifications, including polymyxin B sulfate as a cationic layer, and glutamic acid (reported to coordinate strongly to TiO 2 surfaces) 38 with its amine group (protonated at pH 6) providing an anchor.Neither of these methods had any effect on activity, nor stability.Next, we used o-phosphorylethanol amine (OPEA), which contains a phosphonate group for binding to TiO 2 , and an amine group Fig. 5 The effect of exposure to air or O 2 on the activity of the functionalised P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles at pH 6, 20 C. After 1.5 h of irradiation, the suspension was either stirred in air (red), purged with O 2 (blue), or stirred while remaining sealed for 20 min as a control (black).The tube was then re-sealed and purged with 2 CH 4 /98 CO 2 , and irradiation restarted.(again, protonated at pH 6) as an anchor.We modified the TiO 2 P25 surface by adding OPEA (0.3 mg per 5 mg of nanoparticles) before adsorption of enzyme, and the effect on CO production is shown in Fig. 6. Rather than having the desired effect, the modifying layer decreased the rate of catalysis, and UV-vis spectrophotometry studies on the buffer solution (Supplementary Information) showed that this is (at least in part) due to lower uptake of enzyme when OPEA is used."}], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "To evaluate the performance of the functionalised nanoparticles for CO 2 photoreduction, the pressure vessel containing the suspension was sealed tightly with a rubber septum, before purging the headspace with 98 CO 2 /2 CH 4 for 20 min while stirring.", "context": "All starting materials were obtained from commercial suppliers; they were of the highest available purity and used as received unless otherwise noted.Nanoparticles were obtained from Evonik Degussa (P25 TiO 2 ), or Sigma (anatase, rutile, ZnO and SrTiO 3 ).Solutions were prepared with purified water (Millipore, 18 MU cm).Buffered solutions containing only MES, or combinations of MES, triethanolamine (TEOA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were titrated to the desired pH with NaOH or HCl at the experimental temperature. Ru II (bpy) 2 (4,4 0 -(PO 3 H 2 ) 2 -bpy)Br 2 ('RuP') was prepared according to a published procedure. 29Carbon monoxide dehydrogenases from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans were purified with only slight modifications of the procedure described previously 23 (Supplementary Information).CODH from Moorella thermoacetica (Mt) was purified as described previously. 30,31A further sample of Oligotropha carboxydovorans (Oc) CODH was kindly provided by Prof. Hille. We performed a solution assay to determine the inherent CO 2 reduction activity of Ch CODH I under the same conditons as the photocatalyst (pH 6, 20 C), using reduced methyl viologen (MV , E 0 14 A0.44 V) as an electron donor (Supplementary Information).From six measurements (each carried out in an anaerobic glove box, O 2 3 ppm) we obtained an average turnover frequency of 95 s A1 .Noting this is an enzyme from a thermophilic organism, this rate, which is much lower than that measured for CO oxidation at 70 C, still compares favourably with synthetic catalysts. Suspensions of functionalised nanoparticles were prepared according to the following procedure, which was carried out anaerobically in a glovebox (Belle, O 2 3 ppm).Firstly, nanoparticles were dispersed in 5 mL of aqueous buffer solution by sonication for 20 min in a Pyrex pressure vessel (total volume 9 mL, once sealed).A solution of CODH was then added, and the suspension stirred gently at room temperature for 20 min to allow adsorption of enzyme molecules to the nanoparticles.To photosensitise the particles to visible light, the desired amount of RuP (l max 14 455 nm) was added from a buffered aqueous stock solution (0.5 mg mL A1 ), before stirring for 20 min to allow adsorption.The particles were kept in suspension by gentle stirring at all times between assembly and completion of photochemical experiments. For our benchmark system, we used 5 mg P25 TiO 2 (as described earlier), 200 mM MES (pH 6) as buffer, 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I (20 mL of 128 mM solution) and 56 nmol RuP (0.05 mg; 100 mL of 0.5 mg mL A1 stock solution).Samples prepared in this way, using these amounts of components, will be referred to as our 'standard system.' To evaluate the performance of the functionalised nanoparticles for CO 2 photoreduction, the pressure vessel containing the suspension was sealed tightly with a rubber septum, before purging the headspace with 98 CO 2 /2 CH 4 for 20 min while stirring.The particles were then irradiated with visible light, at a distance of 7 cm.The light source used was a Kodak Carousel S-AV 1010 projector fitted with a 250 W (24 V) tungsten-halogen bulb and a 420 nm long-pass filter (UQG Optics).The light intensity at the position of the photocatalyst was 45 mW cm A2 , measured using a Melles Griot Broadband Power/Energy Meter, model number 13PEM001.The suspension was stirred gently throughout CO production experiments, and the temperature was regulated with a water bath connected to a thermostatted water circulator (VWR Model 1146D).The production of CO was detected by gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies 7890A GC equipped with a Restek ShinCarbon ST micropacked column held isothermally at 34 C) using He carrier gas and a thermal conductivity detector.The amount of CO was quantified against the internal standard (2 CH 4 ) with reference to calibration plots obtained with various known amounts of CO (Supplementary Information). The extent of adsorption and desorption of various amounts of CODH and RuP on nanoparticles was quantified by analysing the absorbance of solutions at 280 nm (for CODH) and 455 nm (for RuP) before and after stirring for 20 min with nanoparticles.After stirring, the nanoparticles were removed by centrifugation (10 min at 8000 rpm) followed by filtration.The extinction coefficients are 146 mM A1 cm A1 at 280 nm (Ch CODH I) and 8.49 mM A1 cm A1 at 455 nm (RuP).At low loadings of Ch CODH I on 5 mg P25 TiO 2 (below around 1 nmol, panel A) the total turnover of the system depends heavily on the amount of enzyme used to prepare the nanoparticles.However, functionalisation with Ch CODH I in excess of around 1 nmol has little effect on the total CO production.This insensitivity to higher enzyme concentration is not due to the TiO 2 surface becoming saturated with enzyme molecules, as UV-vis spectrophotometry showed that the amount of CODH taken up by the nanoparticles is almost complete at all concentrations used (panel A, red data points).However, what is unknown is how much of this enzyme is adsorbed in an electroactive state (i.e.so that electrons can be readily transferred from semiconductor to D-cluster).Images of the functionalised nanoparticles were collected by electron microscopy (the enzyme has a distinctive shape that might be recognisable) but the resolution was not high enough to reveal bound enzyme molecules."}]}}
