On the other hand, molecular structure information of the samples was further researched by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) technique.As shown in Fig. S1a, due to the typical stretching pattern of the g-C 3 N heterocyclic, we can see that the prominent characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are between 1200 and 1710 cm -1 46.The peaks appear at 1241 cm -1 , 1323 cm -1 , and 1411 cm -1 , indicates the existence of stretching vibration of aromatic g-C 3 N 4 bond.The wide peak at 2800-3500 cm -1 may be caused by the stretching vibration of hydroxy group in air 47.The characteristic peaks of C-In 2 O 3 appear at 538 cm -1 , 565 cm -1 , and 602 cm -1 respectively (Fig. S1b) 38, corresponding to the stretching vibration of In--O bond.In Fig. S1a, in the curves of all the samples, the characteristic peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and C-In 2 O appeared simultaneously, which indicated that the composite of the prepared samples was successful. The surface chemical states and interfacial electronic properties of the samples were further studied by XPS technique.As shown in Fig. 2a In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5, which is the conjugate peak caused by g-C 3 N 4 48.In 444.70 eV in C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 51.According to the above results, it can be concluded that g-C 3 N 4 and C-In 2 O 3 successfully recombined, and there is a strong interaction between the contact interface, which is conducive to the formation of the heterojunction. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study the micromorphology of the prepared samples 52.As shown in Fig. 3a, the morphology of MIL-68 (In) is about 5 m rod-like.After calcining MIL-68 (In), it can be observed that the obtained C-In 2 O 3 is a uniform tubular structure, which well inherits the morphology of the precursor (Fig. 3b).In Fig. S2a, we can further confirm its hollow structure, and it can be observed that the prepared C-In 2 O 3 is composed of many indium oxide particles.This structure is beneficial to the light scattering and diffuse reflection inside the catalyst, which is in favor of improving light utilization efficiency 53.Fig. S2b is the elemental maps of C-In 2 O 3 .It is worth noting that the prepared samples not only contain In and O elements, but also a small amount of C elements are uniformly distributed in the indium oxide tube, which is consistent with XRD (Fig. 1) 38.Finally, in order to further verify the doping of C element, we performed XPS and In the process of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the photocatalytic activity is seriously affected by the light utilization rate of the catalyst.To reveal the optical absorption characteristics of the samples, the UV-Vis absorption spectra of all samples were studied 55.As displayed in Fig. 4a, the MIL-68(In) has a very narrow peak with a light absorption edge of 310 nm.Compared with MIL-68(In), it can be seen that the light absorption edge of C-In 2 O 3 has a significant red shift, which means that the light capture capability of MIL-68(In) has been improved after calcination 56, further confirms the superiority of MOF derivatives.And with the increase of g-C 3 N 4 content, which increases the light absorption intensity around 400 nm. According to the relationship between (h) 1/2 and photon energy used as Tauc plots (Fig. 4b) 57, the band gap energies (E g ) of g-C 3 N 4 , C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 and C-In 2 O 3 were 2.72, 2.67 and 2.51 eV, respectively.To determine the energy band structure of C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction, the Mott-Schottky plots and XPS analysis was carried out to find the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of the semiconductor, respectively 58 As shown in Fig. 4c ande, the CB and VB of g-C 3 N 4 are -1.20 and 1.60.The CB and VB of C-In 2 O 3 are -0.81 and 1.69 (Fig. 4d andf), respectively.The CB of both of them satisfies the condition of reducing CO 2 (E -0.53eV), and the band gap structure is favorable for the formation of type-II heterojunction, which can greatly improve the photovoltaic activity.Then, we check the calculation by empirical formula (E CB E G -E VB ) and find that the experimental results are basically consistent 59,60. The specific surface area and pore size distribution curves of MIL-68 (In), C-In 2 O 3 and C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 were measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, and the results were shown in Fig. 5.The nitrogen adsorption isotherms of MIL-68(In) show a type-I curve with a loop ring of type-H3, which indicates that the existence of a microporous in the sample 61,62.However, the adsorption isotherms of C-In 2 O 3 and C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 are type-IV with a loop ring of type-H3.The pore size of C-In 2 O 3 has changed from micropore to mesopore, which will facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products.All above conclusions are further verified by the corresponding pore size distribution curves (Fig. 5b).In addition, the average pore size and specific surface area of the samples are listed in Table 1.We can see that, When C-In 2 O 3 is combined with g-C 3 N 4 , its specific surface area does not change greatly, which may be due to the small load of g-C 3 N 4 (Table 1). The CO 2 photoreduction reaction was driven by ultraviolet light, and the samples were taken once an hour for a total of four times.We can know that the main photocatalytic reduction products are CO and CH (Fig. 6).MIL-68(In) had the lowest CO and CH 4 production rates of 24.95 mol/g/h and 11.67 mol/g/h, respectively.The yields of CO and CH 4 on C-In 2 O 3 are 3.04 and 4.77 times that of MIL-68 (In), respectively.We also used In 2 O 3 for photocatalytic reaction to compare with the photocatalytic performance of C-In 2 O 3 (Fig. S5).It can be seen that the performance of C-In 2 O 3 is better, which may be because the doping of C element and hollow structure can improve the carrier transmission efficiency, has better light capture ability, and has more active sites 53.With g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets decorated on the C-In 2 O 3 , we can see that its photocatalytic performance presents a volcanic-type image.Especially, C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 exhibits the highest CO and CH 4 production rate of 153.42 mol/g/h and 110.31 mol/g/h.Compared with C-In 2 O 3 , its photocatalytic yield increased nearly by 2.03 times and 2.01 times.Therefore, it can be inferred that in the presence of appropriate g-C 3 N nanosheets, C-In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 form a type-II heterojunction, and the special carrier transfer path between the complexes effectively inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs, thus greatly improving the photocatalytic performance 27.However, over-decoration of g-C 3 N nanosheets will affect the light capture capability of the catalyst and conceal the active site, thus reducing the photocatalytic activity. In addition, in order to test the stability of C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5, we conducted 5 cycles of 4 h each cycle.As shown in Fig. S6a, its photocatalytic performance was slightly reduced, which may be caused by the loss of the catalyst when it was recovered after each cycle experiment. The surface area and pore size of samples.What's more, the XRD pattern shows that the structure of C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 does not change significantly before and after the reaction (Fig. S6b).Finally, the reaction solution was collected and centrifuged for 10 min, and the supernatant was taken for ICP test.The results were shown in Table S1, and no In ion was detected, which further demonstrated the stability of the catalyst.As displayed in Fig. S7, under different experimental conditions, CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out.When the light source was absent in CO 2 reduction system, no product was detected, indicating that the reaction is a light-induced reaction.No reduction products were detected when the experiment was carried out in the nitrogen environment, proving CO 2 is the only source of carbon.In Fig. S8 and Table S2, the results showed that in our reaction system and test method, the presence of CH 3 OH was not detected. It is acknowledged that the photochemical properties of catalysts play an essential role in photocatalysis.For detailed, the photocatalytic performance of the material is determined by the electron-hole transfer and separation efficiency as well as the optical capture ability 63.Therefore, we used photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) response to verify the electron-hole separation, recombination, and transfer rates of all catalysts.The photocurrent intensity of the prepared sample was investigated during the alternating cycle of visible light irradiation and dark environment, and its photocurrent curve over time is shown in Fig. 7a.Compared with C-In 2 O 3 and its complex, the photocurrent intensity of g-C 3 N 4 is very weak, which may be due to the doping of C element in C-In 2 O 3 and the hollow tubular structure, which improves the photogenerated carrier transmission efficiency and optical capture ability.53.In addition, the photocurrent intensity of each composite is higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 and C-In 2 O 3 , which indicates that the formation of heterojunction between g-C 3 N 4 and C-In 2 O 3 can effectively inhibit the recombination of photoelectron-hole pairs and improve the separation and transfer rate.It is worth noting that the photocurrent intensity of C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 is the strongest, indicating that the charge separation efficiency can be best improved when the content of g-C 3 N 4 is 5.The as-prepared samples of photocurrent intensity in descending order, in turn, is C- The size of the radius of the semicircle is proportional to the size of the impedance in the catalytic process 64.The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are shown in Fig. 7b.The arc radius decreases rapidly after the composite of g-C 3 N 4 and C-In 2 O 3 , which indicates that the formation of heterojunction effectively reduces the electron transmission impedance and improves the photogenerated electron transfer rate between the material interface 65,66.Similar to the photocurrent test results, the C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 has the smallest impedance.Then, we performed PL emission spectroscopy to detect the carrier dynamics between phases 67.As shown in Fig. 7c, the steady-state PL intensity of C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 is lower than that of other samples, indicating that it has the lowest recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 68.Further, time-resolved PL found that C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 (5.19 ns) had a lower average value (A) than C-In 2 O 3 (6.94ns) and g-C 3 N 4 (7.68 ns).This suggests that the existence of nonradiative pathway inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs and is beneficial to the separation of carriers 697071.As mentioned above, it can be proved that g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and C-In 2 O 3 successfully compound to form a type-II heterojunction, which greatly improves the electron-hole pair separation and transmission efficiency in the process of photocatalysis, and plays an essential role in improving the photocatalytic reduction performance 27. As shown in Fig. 8, the intermediate products of the reaction process were further investigated by in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR).The increasing absorption peaks near 1530 cm -1 were attributed to b-CO 3 2-, m-CO 3 2-and COOH 72.The band around 1715 cm -1 can be assigned to stretching vibrations of HCO 3 - 73. Finally, the gradually increasing small peak around 2020 cm -1 showed that CO was formed as a product 747576.Based on the above analysis, we proposed the preliminary reaction mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 27.The simultaneous transfer of carriers on different semiconductors significantly improves the charge separation efficiency, while the recombination of electron-hole pairs is greatly suppressed 79.Then, the residual C element acts as electron transport medium to increase the efficiency of electron transport between monomers 80.Finally, the sacrifice agent TEOA can rapidly consume photogenerated holes and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs, thus establishing a stable channel for electrons to reduce CO 2 molecules.For these reasons, C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 heterojunction exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity under UV irradiation."}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Typically, the sealed stainless reactor involved 20 mg photocatalyst, 5 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) and 95 mL of deionized water under UV light for 4 h.", "context": "Terephthalic acid (C 8 H 6 O 4 ), urea (CO(NH 2 ) 2 ), N, N-dimethylformamide (C 3 H 7 NO), ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) and nitric acid were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.Indium Nitrate Hydrate (In (NO 3 ) 3 H 2 O) supplied by Aladdin Chemical Co., Ltd.All chemicals are analytical grade and no further purification is required when used.

Finally, the gradually increasing small peak around 2020 cm -1 showed that CO was formed as a product 747576.Based on the above analysis, we proposed the preliminary reaction mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 27.The simultaneous transfer of carriers on different semiconductors significantly improves the charge separation efficiency, while the recombination of electron-hole pairs is greatly suppressed 79.Then, the residual C element acts as electron transport medium to increase the efficiency of electron transport between monomers 80.Finally, the sacrifice agent TEOA can rapidly consume photogenerated holes and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs, thus establishing a stable channel for electrons to reduce CO 2 molecules.For these reasons, C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 heterojunction exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity under UV irradiation."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "In order to have a more intuitive understanding of the operation principle of C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 heterostructure, combined with UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Mott-Schottky plots and valence band (VB) spectra of XPS, the mechanism diagram of CO reduction under UV lamp irradiation was made (Fig. 9).", "context": "In summary, we obtained tubular C-In 2 O 3 through MIL-68(In) calcination, which greatly improved its light capture ability and electron transport ability.Then, g-C 3 N 4 is supported on the surface of C-In 2 O 3 by hydrothermal, so as to change the electron transport mode and effectively inhibit the recombination of electron hole pairs.At the same time, the residual C element can also be used as electron transport medium to accelerate the transmission of photogenerated carriers.Therefore, the type-II heterojunction formed by C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 greatly improves the photocatalytic performance, which the CO and CH 4 yields of C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 are 6.15 and 9.5 times of than that of MIL-68(In).

The protocol for the preparation of MIL-68(In) is adapted from a previous report with slight modifications 38,39.Typically, 468 mg of Indium nitrate hydrate and 180 mg terephthalic acid were dissolved in 40 mL of DMF.Next, the solution was transferred to a round-bottomed flask for vigorous stirring for 15 min, followed by a 120 C oil bath for 30 min.After natural cooling down, the precursors were centrifugally separated and washed three times with water and ethanol.The white precipitate was vacuum dried at 80 C for 12 h. The as-obtained MIL-68(In) were first annealed in air at 120 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 Cmin -1 , and then further annealed at 500 C for 2 h with the same heating rate 40.

On the other hand, molecular structure information of the samples was further researched by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) technique.As shown in Fig. S1a, due to the typical stretching pattern of the g-C 3 N heterocyclic, we can see that the prominent characteristic peaks of pure g-C 3 N 4 are between 1200 and 1710 cm -1 46.The peaks appear at 1241 cm -1 , 1323 cm -1 , and 1411 cm -1 , indicates the existence of stretching vibration of aromatic g-C 3 N 4 bond.The wide peak at 2800-3500 cm -1 may be caused by the stretching vibration of hydroxy group in air 47.The characteristic peaks of C-In 2 O 3 appear at 538 cm -1 , 565 cm -1 , and 602 cm -1 respectively (Fig. S1b) 38, corresponding to the stretching vibration of In--O bond.In Fig. S1a, in the curves of all the samples, the characteristic peaks of g-C 3 N 4 and C-In 2 O appeared simultaneously, which indicated that the composite of the prepared samples was successful. The surface chemical states and interfacial electronic properties of the samples were further studied by XPS technique.As shown in Fig. 2a In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5, which is the conjugate peak caused by g-C 3 N 4 48.In 444.70 eV in C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 51.According to the above results, it can be concluded that g-C 3 N 4 and C-In 2 O 3 successfully recombined, and there is a strong interaction between the contact interface, which is conducive to the formation of the heterojunction. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study the micromorphology of the prepared samples 52.As shown in Fig. 3a, the morphology of MIL-68 (In) is about 5 m rod-like.After calcining MIL-68 (In), it can be observed that the obtained C-In 2 O 3 is a uniform tubular structure, which well inherits the morphology of the precursor (Fig. 3b).In Fig. S2a, we can further confirm its hollow structure, and it can be observed that the prepared C-In 2 O 3 is composed of many indium oxide particles.This structure is beneficial to the light scattering and diffuse reflection inside the catalyst, which is in favor of improving light utilization efficiency 53.Fig. S2b is the elemental maps of C-In 2 O 3 .It is worth noting that the prepared samples not only contain In and O elements, but also a small amount of C elements are uniformly distributed in the indium oxide tube, which is consistent with XRD (Fig. 1) 38.Finally, in order to further verify the doping of C element, we performed XPS and In the process of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the photocatalytic activity is seriously affected by the light utilization rate of the catalyst.To reveal the optical absorption characteristics of the samples, the UV-Vis absorption spectra of all samples were studied 55.As displayed in Fig. 4a, the MIL-68(In) has a very narrow peak with a light absorption edge of 310 nm.Compared with MIL-68(In), it can be seen that the light absorption edge of C-In 2 O 3 has a significant red shift, which means that the light capture capability of MIL-68(In) has been improved after calcination 56, further confirms the superiority of MOF derivatives.And with the increase of g-C 3 N 4 content, which increases the light absorption intensity around 400 nm. According to the relationship between (h) 1/2 and photon energy used as Tauc plots (Fig. 4b) 57, the band gap energies (E g ) of g-C 3 N 4 , C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 and C-In 2 O 3 were 2.72, 2.67 and 2.51 eV, respectively.To determine the energy band structure of C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction, the Mott-Schottky plots and XPS analysis was carried out to find the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of the semiconductor, respectively 58 As shown in Fig. 4c ande, the CB and VB of g-C 3 N 4 are -1.20 and 1.60.The CB and VB of C-In 2 O 3 are -0.81 and 1.69 (Fig. 4d andf), respectively.The CB of both of them satisfies the condition of reducing CO 2 (E -0.53eV), and the band gap structure is favorable for the formation of type-II heterojunction, which can greatly improve the photovoltaic activity.Then, we check the calculation by empirical formula (E CB E G -E VB ) and find that the experimental results are basically consistent 59,60. The specific surface area and pore size distribution curves of MIL-68 (In), C-In 2 O 3 and C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 were measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, and the results were shown in Fig. 5.The nitrogen adsorption isotherms of MIL-68(In) show a type-I curve with a loop ring of type-H3, which indicates that the existence of a microporous in the sample 61,62.However, the adsorption isotherms of C-In 2 O 3 and C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 are type-IV with a loop ring of type-H3.The pore size of C-In 2 O 3 has changed from micropore to mesopore, which will facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products.All above conclusions are further verified by the corresponding pore size distribution curves (Fig. 5b).In addition, the average pore size and specific surface area of the samples are listed in Table 1.We can see that, When C-In 2 O 3 is combined with g-C 3 N 4 , its specific surface area does not change greatly, which may be due to the small load of g-C 3 N 4 (Table 1). The CO 2 photoreduction reaction was driven by ultraviolet light, and the samples were taken once an hour for a total of four times.We can know that the main photocatalytic reduction products are CO and CH (Fig. 6).MIL-68(In) had the lowest CO and CH 4 production rates of 24.95 mol/g/h and 11.67 mol/g/h, respectively.The yields of CO and CH 4 on C-In 2 O 3 are 3.04 and 4.77 times that of MIL-68 (In), respectively.We also used In 2 O 3 for photocatalytic reaction to compare with the photocatalytic performance of C-In 2 O 3 (Fig. S5).It can be seen that the performance of C-In 2 O 3 is better, which may be because the doping of C element and hollow structure can improve the carrier transmission efficiency, has better light capture ability, and has more active sites 53.With g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets decorated on the C-In 2 O 3 , we can see that its photocatalytic performance presents a volcanic-type image.Especially, C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 exhibits the highest CO and CH 4 production rate of 153.42 mol/g/h and 110.31 mol/g/h.Compared with C-In 2 O 3 , its photocatalytic yield increased nearly by 2.03 times and 2.01 times.Therefore, it can be inferred that in the presence of appropriate g-C 3 N nanosheets, C-In 2 O 3 and g-C 3 N 4 form a type-II heterojunction, and the special carrier transfer path between the complexes effectively inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs, thus greatly improving the photocatalytic performance 27.However, over-decoration of g-C 3 N nanosheets will affect the light capture capability of the catalyst and conceal the active site, thus reducing the photocatalytic activity. In addition, in order to test the stability of C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5, we conducted 5 cycles of 4 h each cycle.As shown in Fig. S6a, its photocatalytic performance was slightly reduced, which may be caused by the loss of the catalyst when it was recovered after each cycle experiment. The surface area and pore size of samples.What's more, the XRD pattern shows that the structure of C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 does not change significantly before and after the reaction (Fig. S6b).Finally, the reaction solution was collected and centrifuged for 10 min, and the supernatant was taken for ICP test.The results were shown in Table S1, and no In ion was detected, which further demonstrated the stability of the catalyst.As displayed in Fig. S7, under different experimental conditions, CO 2 reduction experiments were carried out.When the light source was absent in CO 2 reduction system, no product was detected, indicating that the reaction is a light-induced reaction.No reduction products were detected when the experiment was carried out in the nitrogen environment, proving CO 2 is the only source of carbon.In Fig. S8 and Table S2, the results showed that in our reaction system and test method, the presence of CH 3 OH was not detected. It is acknowledged that the photochemical properties of catalysts play an essential role in photocatalysis.For detailed, the photocatalytic performance of the material is determined by the electron-hole transfer and separation efficiency as well as the optical capture ability 63.Therefore, we used photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) response to verify the electron-hole separation, recombination, and transfer rates of all catalysts.The photocurrent intensity of the prepared sample was investigated during the alternating cycle of visible light irradiation and dark environment, and its photocurrent curve over time is shown in Fig. 7a.Compared with C-In 2 O 3 and its complex, the photocurrent intensity of g-C 3 N 4 is very weak, which may be due to the doping of C element in C-In 2 O 3 and the hollow tubular structure, which improves the photogenerated carrier transmission efficiency and optical capture ability.53.In addition, the photocurrent intensity of each composite is higher than that of g-C 3 N 4 and C-In 2 O 3 , which indicates that the formation of heterojunction between g-C 3 N 4 and C-In 2 O 3 can effectively inhibit the recombination of photoelectron-hole pairs and improve the separation and transfer rate.It is worth noting that the photocurrent intensity of C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 is the strongest, indicating that the charge separation efficiency can be best improved when the content of g-C 3 N 4 is 5.The as-prepared samples of photocurrent intensity in descending order, in turn, is C- The size of the radius of the semicircle is proportional to the size of the impedance in the catalytic process 64.The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are shown in Fig. 7b.The arc radius decreases rapidly after the composite of g-C 3 N 4 and C-In 2 O 3 , which indicates that the formation of heterojunction effectively reduces the electron transmission impedance and improves the photogenerated electron transfer rate between the material interface 65,66.Similar to the photocurrent test results, the C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 has the smallest impedance.Then, we performed PL emission spectroscopy to detect the carrier dynamics between phases 67.As shown in Fig. 7c, the steady-state PL intensity of C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 is lower than that of other samples, indicating that it has the lowest recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs 68.Further, time-resolved PL found that C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 (5.19 ns) had a lower average value (A) than C-In 2 O 3 (6.94ns) and g-C 3 N 4 (7.68 ns).This suggests that the existence of nonradiative pathway inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs and is beneficial to the separation of carriers 697071.As mentioned above, it can be proved that g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and C-In 2 O 3 successfully compound to form a type-II heterojunction, which greatly improves the electron-hole pair separation and transmission efficiency in the process of photocatalysis, and plays an essential role in improving the photocatalytic reduction performance 27. As shown in Fig. 8, the intermediate products of the reaction process were further investigated by in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR).The increasing absorption peaks near 1530 cm -1 were attributed to b-CO 3 2-, m-CO 3 2-and COOH 72.The band around 1715 cm -1 can be assigned to stretching vibrations of HCO 3 - 73. Finally, the gradually increasing small peak around 2020 cm -1 showed that CO was formed as a product 747576.Based on the above analysis, we proposed the preliminary reaction mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 27.The simultaneous transfer of carriers on different semiconductors significantly improves the charge separation efficiency, while the recombination of electron-hole pairs is greatly suppressed 79.Then, the residual C element acts as electron transport medium to increase the efficiency of electron transport between monomers 80.Finally, the sacrifice agent TEOA can rapidly consume photogenerated holes and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs, thus establishing a stable channel for electrons to reduce CO 2 molecules.For these reasons, C-In 2 O 3 /g-C 3 N 4 -5 heterojunction exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity under UV irradiation."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "Typically, the sealed stainless reactor involved 20 mg photocatalyst, 5 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) and 95 mL of deionized water under UV light for 4 h.
