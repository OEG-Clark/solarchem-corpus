All the samples show the type IV isotherms with H 1 -type hysteresis loop in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.4-0.95,demonstrating their mesoporous characteristics.While the mesoporous features of these catalysts become more significant with increasing the content of doped molybdenum, indicating the presence of Mo element in g-C 3 N 4 is beneficial for the formation of mesopores.These mesopores should originate from the stacking of g-C 3 N 4 sheets 32 since Mo species can strongly interact with the interlayers of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets through N-bridge linking and increase the space between interlayers in the wake of Mo species doping.The pore size distribution obtained from the analysis of desorption branch of the isotherms is shown in Fig. 2b.It can be seen that all samples have relatively a narrow pore size distribution and their average pore diameters are in the range of 3.6-3.9nm.The corresponding textural properties are summarized in Table 1.Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , these Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts have a larger BET surface area and this value is increasing with the enhancement of Mo doping.The enlargement of the specific surface area is probably due to the hindered crystal growth of graphitic carbon nitride by molybdenum doping, which mainly arises from mesopores according to our measurement. The TEM images of the representative Mo-CN-4 sample are shown in Fig. 3.The low-magnification TEM image given in Fig. 3a reveals that large domains with worm-like mesoporous channels are presented in Mo-CN-4 sample, and the pore size estimated from its high-magnification TEM as shown in Fig. 3c is about 3-4 nm, which is consistent with the result of BJH analysis.While the pure g-C 3 N 4 (P-CN) prepared without Mo doping exhibits a sheet-like morphology with less mesoporous characters (Fig. 3d).In addition, the presence of Mo species in Mo-CN-4 sample can be confirmed by its EDX result shown in Fig. 3b. Fig. 4a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 samples within the range 200-800 nm.It is apparent that the UV-vis spectra of all the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 samples had extended a red shift and significant absorption between 400 and 800 nm, both increased with the increase of Mo doping concentration.The red shift of the adsorption edge of the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts has been attributed to the charge-transfer transition between the molybdenum ion d-electrons and the g-C 3 N 4 conduction or valence band 26.It has been reported that metal doping could form a dopant energy level within the band gap of g-C 3 N 4 , the electronic transitions from the valence band to dopant level or from the dopant level to the conduction band can effectively red shift the band edge absorption threshold 33.In addition, the optical band gap energy of the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts displayed obvious red shifts with respect to that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (listed in Table 1), which are in good consistent with the DRS result. To investigate the photocatalytic performance of the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts with different Mo doping concentrations, their activities for the photocatalytic reduction CO 2 with H 2 O under UV irradiation were studied.Fig. 5 shows the evolution of two main products (CO and CH 4 ) as functions of irradiation time for all catalysts.From the curves, it can be seen that the yields of both CO and CH 4 are increased with the irradiation time for all catalysts.It should be noted that the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts exhibit much higher photocatalytic activity than pure g-C 3 N 4 , and their activity increases with the increase of Mo doping concentration and reaches to the best for the sample Mo-CN-4 with CO and CH 4 yields about 887 and 123 mol g -1 -cat., respectively, after 8 h of UV irradiation.Herein, the slight reduced photocatalytic activity of Mo-CN-5 may ascribe to its decreased crystallinity degree which will produce excessive lattice defects, and some lattice defects usually act as recombination centers for the photoinduced electron/hole pairs during the photocatalytic process 34. The excellent photocatalytic efficiency of the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts can be attributed to their worm-like mesostructure and narrow band gap, which enable to harvest light more efficiency.Meanwhile, the heteroatom molybdenum may act as the photogenerated electron target to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.In order to prove the above conclusion, the separation efficiency of the photo-generated electrons and holes was characterized by photoluminescence.Fig. 5c compares the PL spectra for the P-CN sample and the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts.It can be observed that the P-CN sample exhibits a strong emission peak at about 445 nm at ambient temperature, which is equivalent to the bandgap energy of 2.65 eV.In comparison with that of pure g-C 3 N 4 , the strong PL spectra quench quickly for the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts.It is generally acknowledged that the higher fluorescence intensity means more recombination of electron-hole pairs and lower photocatalytic activities 35.The results illustrate that molybdenum doping gives a positive effect on decreasing the recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers."}, {"llm generation": "Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4", "source": "In summary, the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts were prepared by a simple pyrolysis method to enhance photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 for reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to produce CO and CH 4 .", "context": "In summary, the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts were prepared by a simple pyrolysis method to enhance photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 for reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to produce CO and CH 4 .From the results we measured, the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic efficiency when compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , and Mo-CN-4 sample possessed the best activity among the catalysts with different Mo doping concentrations.The remarkable improvement in the photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the lowered recombination rate of electron-hole pairs, the larger surface area, the better mesoporous structure and the lower band gap energy of the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts.The present research is expected to be useful in development of new doping photocatalysts and provide some meaningful information for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion.

The crystallographic phase of the prepared products was determined by Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (Cu K 1 radiation, 1.5406A), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA (scanning step: 0.02 /s) in the 2 range of 10-80.The morphologies and structure of the prepared samples were examined by a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010).Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K on a BeiShiDe 3H-2000PS4 apparatus.Before measurements, the samples were degassed in vacuum at 200 C for 6 h.The Brumauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was utilized to calculate the specific surface areas.The pore size distributions were derived from the desorption branches of the isotherms using the Barrett-Joyner-Halanda (BJH) method.The total pore volume (V t ) was estimated at a relative pressure of 0.99.The diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples over a range of 200-800 nm were recorded by a Shimadezu UV-2401 spectrophotometer.Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed on a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer at room temperature. The photocatalyic reduction of CO 2 experiments was carried out in a home-made Teflon-lined stainless chamber with a quartz window at the top for light irradiation.The volume of the chamber was 2700 mL.0.1 g of the test catalyst powder was located on stainless omentum which was placed in the center of a reactor.The bottom of glass wool support was moisturized with 5.0 g of deionized water to gain saturated water vapor in the reactor.A 300 W Hg lamp was used at the light source of the photocatalytic reaction.Light was passed through a quartz window and the circulated cooling water was used to keep the photoreactor at ambient temperature during the reaction.The distance between the substrate and Hg lamp was about 15 cm (the intensity of light measured by a digital Lux meter is around 108,500 lx), the reaction temperature and pressure were maintained at 30 C and 110 KPa, respectively.Prior to illumination, the reactor was vacuumed and purged with the CO 2 H 2 O mixture at about 20 mL/min for 2 h to establish an adsorption-desorption balance.After that, the reactor was tightly closed and the Hg lamp was then switched on to start the experiment.The gas phase products were taken at various time during the irradiation and analyzed by gas chromatography. 17,31.Furthermore, the crystallization degree of the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts decreased evidently with the increase of Mo concentration, since the doped foreign ion alleviated the crystallization process during calcination 26."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "To investigate the photocatalytic performance of the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts with different Mo doping concentrations, their activities for the photocatalytic reduction CO 2 with H 2 O under UV irradiation were studied.", "context": "Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution curves of above samples are shown in Fig. 2. All the samples show the type IV isotherms with H 1 -type hysteresis loop in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.4-0.95,demonstrating their mesoporous characteristics.While the mesoporous features of these catalysts become more significant with increasing the content of doped molybdenum, indicating the presence of Mo element in g-C 3 N 4 is beneficial for the formation of mesopores.These mesopores should originate from the stacking of g-C 3 N 4 sheets 32 since Mo species can strongly interact with the interlayers of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets through N-bridge linking and increase the space between interlayers in the wake of Mo species doping.The pore size distribution obtained from the analysis of desorption branch of the isotherms is shown in Fig. 2b.It can be seen that all samples have relatively a narrow pore size distribution and their average pore diameters are in the range of 3.6-3.9nm.The corresponding textural properties are summarized in Table 1.Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , these Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts have a larger BET surface area and this value is increasing with the enhancement of Mo doping.The enlargement of the specific surface area is probably due to the hindered crystal growth of graphitic carbon nitride by molybdenum doping, which mainly arises from mesopores according to our measurement. The TEM images of the representative Mo-CN-4 sample are shown in Fig. 3.The low-magnification TEM image given in Fig. 3a reveals that large domains with worm-like mesoporous channels are presented in Mo-CN-4 sample, and the pore size estimated from its high-magnification TEM as shown in Fig. 3c is about 3-4 nm, which is consistent with the result of BJH analysis.While the pure g-C 3 N 4 (P-CN) prepared without Mo doping exhibits a sheet-like morphology with less mesoporous characters (Fig. 3d).In addition, the presence of Mo species in Mo-CN-4 sample can be confirmed by its EDX result shown in Fig. 3b. Fig. 4a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 samples within the range 200-800 nm.It is apparent that the UV-vis spectra of all the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 samples had extended a red shift and significant absorption between 400 and 800 nm, both increased with the increase of Mo doping concentration.The red shift of the adsorption edge of the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts has been attributed to the charge-transfer transition between the molybdenum ion d-electrons and the g-C 3 N 4 conduction or valence band 26.It has been reported that metal doping could form a dopant energy level within the band gap of g-C 3 N 4 , the electronic transitions from the valence band to dopant level or from the dopant level to the conduction band can effectively red shift the band edge absorption threshold 33.In addition, the optical band gap energy of the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts displayed obvious red shifts with respect to that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (listed in Table 1), which are in good consistent with the DRS result. To investigate the photocatalytic performance of the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts with different Mo doping concentrations, their activities for the photocatalytic reduction CO 2 with H 2 O under UV irradiation were studied.Fig. 5 shows the evolution of two main products (CO and CH 4 ) as functions of irradiation time for all catalysts.From the curves, it can be seen that the yields of both CO and CH 4 are increased with the irradiation time for all catalysts.It should be noted that the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts exhibit much higher photocatalytic activity than pure g-C 3 N 4 , and their activity increases with the increase of Mo doping concentration and reaches to the best for the sample Mo-CN-4 with CO and CH 4 yields about 887 and 123 mol g -1 -cat., respectively, after 8 h of UV irradiation.Herein, the slight reduced photocatalytic activity of Mo-CN-5 may ascribe to its decreased crystallinity degree which will produce excessive lattice defects, and some lattice defects usually act as recombination centers for the photoinduced electron/hole pairs during the photocatalytic process 34. The excellent photocatalytic efficiency of the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts can be attributed to their worm-like mesostructure and narrow band gap, which enable to harvest light more efficiency.Meanwhile, the heteroatom molybdenum may act as the photogenerated electron target to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.In order to prove the above conclusion, the separation efficiency of the photo-generated electrons and holes was characterized by photoluminescence.Fig. 5c compares the PL spectra for the P-CN sample and the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts.It can be observed that the P-CN sample exhibits a strong emission peak at about 445 nm at ambient temperature, which is equivalent to the bandgap energy of 2.65 eV.In comparison with that of pure g-C 3 N 4 , the strong PL spectra quench quickly for the Mo-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts.It is generally acknowledged that the higher fluorescence intensity means more recombination of electron-hole pairs and lower photocatalytic activities 35.The results illustrate that molybdenum doping gives a positive effect on decreasing the recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
