The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out using TEOA as the sacrificial reagent in MeCN upon visible-light irradiation, and the electron-rich coordination environment that can weaken and break one of the carbon-oxygen bonds in CO 2 , tending to form CO, while the electron-deficiency coordination environment (electron withdraw) that can enhance the carbon-oxygen bonding force, including Ru NPs, to a certain extent inclines to form HCOOH 66.As control experiments, no reaction took place in dark or without catalyst, demonstrating a truly photocatalytic behavior.Compared to TpPa-1, Ru/TpPa-1 catalysts are more active.One can see that the maximum yield of HCOOH produced in 10 h can be up to 108.8 mol g cat -1 h -1 over 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1, much higher than that observed over TpPa-1 (32.4 mol g cat -1 h -1 ).The photocatalytic activity is inferior to most of the reported photocatalytic systems coupled with Re or Ru complexes as photosensitizers, but competitive with some representative MOF-based photocatalysts under similar conditions (Table S1).To verify the origin of the produced HCOOH, Ar instead of CO 2 as the reactant was introduced into the reaction system using 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1 as the photocatalyst under otherwise similar conditions and no hydrocarbon production was detected.Furthermore, the isotopic 13 CO 2 was also employed in the photocatalytic reaction, and the 13 C NMR spectrum clearly shows a peak at 165.1 ppm (Fig. S9), corresponding to HCOOH, when 13 CO 2 was introduced.These results unambiguously demonstrate that the produced HCOOH indeed originates from CO 2 .Finally, a five-run experiment on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was then carried out to check the reusability of 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1 as an illustrative example (Fig. S10).The used photocatalyst was collected from the reaction medium, washed with deionized water, and then dried at 120 C for 12 h, which was reused in the next run of the photocatalytic reaction.Obviously, the recycling use of the photocatalyst for five runs shows no obvious decrease in the photocatalytic activity.In addition, the XRD and FT-IR characterization results for the used photocatalyst after the 5th-run reaction are almost the same as those for the fresh one (Figs.S11 andS12), and the Ru NPs after the 5th-run photocatalytic reaction did not aggregate and were still highly dispersed on the TpPa-1 matrix (Fig. S13), suggesting the high durability of the prepared catalyst. Mott-Schottky measurements, a generally accepted method for determining the flat band position of semiconductors 75, were first applied to estimate the flat band position of TpPa-1 before the investigation for the effects of the loaded Ru NPs on the photocatalysis.As can be seen, TpPa-1 has some characteristics for an n-type semiconductor due to the positive slope, therefore, the conduction band (LUMO) position should be close to the flat band position that was determined to be -0.96vs Ag/AgCl (-0.76 V vs NHE) (Fig. S14).With the bandgap energy estimated to be 2.05 eV from the Tauc plot determined by the Kubelka-Munk functions, the valence band (HOMO) of TpPa-1 was then calculated to be 1.29 V vs NHE (Fig. 6).The LUMO energy level of TpPa-1 is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 to form HCOOH (-0.28 V vs. NHE 76), indicating that it is theoretically feasible for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to generate HCOOH over TpPa-1.As the cocatalyst, the Ru NPs deposited on TpPa-1 should not transform the energy levels of TpPa-1.The loading of noble metals onto photocatalysts is a generally adopted method to inhibit the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes 68.When the Ru NPs are introduced onto TpPa-1, these nanoparticles can accept the photo-generated electrons from the LUMO energy level of TpPa-1, because noble metals are usually good electron traps (Fig. 6), leading to an improved separation of the photo-generated charge carriers and ultimately to an enhanced photocatalytic performance.This is in line with the results of the PL and photoelectric measurements.The PL spectra of TpPa-1 and Ru/TpPa-1 excited at 326 nm are shown in Fig. 7. TpPa-1 exhibits a PL peak at around 480 nm and the excitation peak is greatly weakened with the loading of the Ru NPs, indicating the rapid charge transfer between the Ru NPs and TpPa-1.In other words, the introduction of the Ru NPs increases the separation efficiency and decreases the recombination of the photogenerated electrons-holes in Ru/TpPa-1.The time-resolved fluorescence spectra of TpPa-1 and Ru/TpPa-1 at 480 nm emission were used to measure the fluorescence life expectancy.The average fluorescence lifetimes of TpPa-1, 1.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1, 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1, and 5.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1 are 6.26, 6.03, 5.39, and 5.54 ns (Fig. 8), respectively, which decreases obviously with the loading of the Ru NPs.This implies that the interactions between the Ru NPs and TpPa-1 can generate new methods to extend the life of photo-generated charge carriers by promoting the transfer of electrons through the Ru NPs.The optimized loading amount of the Ru NPs onto the COF would be 3.0 wt because of its lowest PL intensity and lifetime among the three catalysts with different Ru loadings.This indicates that the adequate Ru NPs loaded on TpPa-1 can improve the separation of the photo-generated charge carriers, while excessive Ru NPs on the COF surface may cause the conversion of Ru clusters into the recombination center of electrons and holes and the blocking of the COF pores to reduce the photoexciting capacity of TpPa-1.Fig. 9 shows the transient photocurrent density responses of the catalysts in an on-off cycle mode upon visible-light irradiation.All Ru/TpPa-1 catalysts show much higher photoelectric currents in comparison with TpPa-1, among which 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1 exhibits the best photocurrent response.In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as a common electrochemical method has been widely used in evaluating the interface charge transfer efficiency of photocatalysts 77.In general, the smaller arc radius of the EIS spectrum, the lower the charge-transfer resistance value, corresponding to more efficient separation and transport of photoexcited electron-hole pairs 787980.As shown in Fig. 10, the EIS results reflect that the smallest arc radius for 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1, compared to those for other photocatalysts, suggests the fastest interfacial charge transfer, resulting in the most effective separation and transport of photo-generated charges.Based on these results, it can be inferred that the loading of the Ru NPs onto TpPa-1 not only enhances the visible light absorption but also facilitates the photo-induced charge transfer and restrains the recombination of photo-generated charges efficiently, resulting in the higher photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "visible-light", "source": "In summary, the ketoamine-based COF (TpPa-1) loaded with different amounts of Ru NPs, Ru/TpPa-1, was employed in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using TEOA as the sacrificial agent upon visible-light irradiation for the first time.", "context": "In summary, the ketoamine-based COF (TpPa-1) loaded with different amounts of Ru NPs, Ru/TpPa-1, was employed in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using TEOA as the sacrificial agent upon visible-light irradiation for the first time.All Ru/TpPa-1 photocatalysts show significantly enhanced activities for CO 2 reduction compared to the parent TpPa-1, giving the maximum HCOOH production rate of 108.8 mol g cat -1 h -1 over 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1 and competitive with some representative MOF-based photocatalysts under similar conditions.The introduction of Ru NPs can not only enhance the visible-light absorption but also facilitate the photo-generated charge transfer and restrain the recombination of photo-generated charges efficiently.This study demonstrates the great potential of COFs as a platform for effectively photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Although the activity of Ru/TpPa-1 is still not satisfied, considering the availability of different organic linkers and the possibility to modulate the composition, structure, and properties of COFs, high-efficient COFs-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO 2 can be developed in the future.And the present strategy provides some guidance in the development of more efficiently heterogeneous photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction.

stacking between COF layers and corresponds to the (0 0 1) plane.Besides, all the diffraction peaks of TpPa-1 are quite different from those of p-phenylenediamine and 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (Fig. S1), further indicating the successful synthesis of TpPa-1.The prepared TpPa-1 was then treated with ruthenium trichloride, and reduced by H 2 to produce Ru/ TpPa-1 composites with 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 wt loaded amounts, respectively.The crystalline structure of TpPa-1 is reserved after the loading of Ru NPs, and no characteristic peaks of Ru species can be observed, indicating that the Ru NPs are well dispersed onto the COF.As shown in Table 1, the Ru contents in Ru/TpPa-1 samples, determined by the ICP-AES analysis, are 0.9, 2.8, and 4.7 wt, respectively, very close to the corresponding nominal ones.The FT-IR spectra of Ru/TpPa-1 show two strong representative peaks for C C (1578 cm -1 ) stretching present in the keto form and the C-N (1258 cm -1 ) stretching of TpPa-1, confirming the loading of Ru NPs without disturbing the basic TpPa-1 architecture (Fig. S2).In comparison with TpPa-1, the BET surface areas and the pore volumes of Ru/TpPa-1 samples tend to decrease gradually with increasing the amount of the Ru NPs loaded onto the matrix (Fig. S3 and Table 1), because the pore surface and interlayer spacings in the host COF framework are partially occupied by the dispersed Ru NPs located at the surface as well as inside the COF matrix.The SEM images (Fig. S4) show that TpPa-1 crystallizes with a flowerlike morphology and its surface becomes rougher with increasing the amount of the Ru NPs loaded.And the EDX mappings for the C, N, O, and Ru elements of all Ru/TpPa-1 samples, as shown in Figs.S5-S7, reveal the uniform distribution of the Ru NPs.The sizes of the Ru NPs loaded on TpPa-1 have a mean diameter of 8 nm from the TEM observation, as shown in Fig. 2, and the HR-TEM images of Ru/TpPa-1 samples show the characteristic spacings of 0.213 and 0.564 nm for the (1 0 0) and the (2 1 0) lattice planes of metallic Ru (JCPDS, NO. 06-0663), respectively.The XPS characterization was carried out to analyze the Ru chemical state of the prepared samples, as shown in Figs.S8 and3.There are two peaks located at 485.6 and 463.4 eV for RuCl 3 (Fig. 3a), which are assigned to the 3p 1/2 and 3p 3/2 of Ru 3 .On the other hand, the peaks for the Ru 3p 1/2 and 3p 3/2 of Ru/TpPa-1 shift to 484.3 and 462.1 eV, respectively, which can be ascribed to Ru 0 74, indicating the successful reduction of Ru 3 ions into the metallic Ru.As can be seen in Fig. 4, the UV-vis DRS spectra of Ru/TpPa-1 show an extending absorption band in the visible-light region ranging from 550 to 800 nm, compared with TpPa-1, in accordance with their reddishbrown color changed from orange-red.The enhanced visible-light harvesting would be of utmost importance for photocatalysis and thus Ru/ TpPa-1 catalysts are expected to possess a better photocatalytic activity toward the target reaction. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out using TEOA as the sacrificial reagent in MeCN upon visible-light irradiation, and the electron-rich coordination environment that can weaken and break one of the carbon-oxygen bonds in CO 2 , tending to form CO, while the electron-deficiency coordination environment (electron withdraw) that can enhance the carbon-oxygen bonding force, including Ru NPs, to a certain extent inclines to form HCOOH 66.As control experiments, no reaction took place in dark or without catalyst, demonstrating a truly photocatalytic behavior.Compared to TpPa-1, Ru/TpPa-1 catalysts are more active.One can see that the maximum yield of HCOOH produced in 10 h can be up to 108.8 mol g cat -1 h -1 over 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1, much higher than that observed over TpPa-1 (32.4 mol g cat -1 h -1 ).The photocatalytic activity is inferior to most of the reported photocatalytic systems coupled with Re or Ru complexes as photosensitizers, but competitive with some representative MOF-based photocatalysts under similar conditions (Table S1).To verify the origin of the produced HCOOH, Ar instead of CO 2 as the reactant was introduced into the reaction system using 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1 as the photocatalyst under otherwise similar conditions and no hydrocarbon production was detected.Furthermore, the isotopic 13 CO 2 was also employed in the photocatalytic reaction, and the 13 C NMR spectrum clearly shows a peak at 165.1 ppm (Fig. S9), corresponding to HCOOH, when 13 CO 2 was introduced.These results unambiguously demonstrate that the produced HCOOH indeed originates from CO 2 .Finally, a five-run experiment on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was then carried out to check the reusability of 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1 as an illustrative example (Fig. S10).The used photocatalyst was collected from the reaction medium, washed with deionized water, and then dried at 120 C for 12 h, which was reused in the next run of the photocatalytic reaction.Obviously, the recycling use of the photocatalyst for five runs shows no obvious decrease in the photocatalytic activity.In addition, the XRD and FT-IR characterization results for the used photocatalyst after the 5th-run reaction are almost the same as those for the fresh one (Figs.S11 andS12), and the Ru NPs after the 5th-run photocatalytic reaction did not aggregate and were still highly dispersed on the TpPa-1 matrix (Fig. S13), suggesting the high durability of the prepared catalyst. Mott-Schottky measurements, a generally accepted method for determining the flat band position of semiconductors 75, were first applied to estimate the flat band position of TpPa-1 before the investigation for the effects of the loaded Ru NPs on the photocatalysis.As can be seen, TpPa-1 has some characteristics for an n-type semiconductor due to the positive slope, therefore, the conduction band (LUMO) position should be close to the flat band position that was determined to be -0.96vs Ag/AgCl (-0.76 V vs NHE) (Fig. S14).With the bandgap energy estimated to be 2.05 eV from the Tauc plot determined by the Kubelka-Munk functions, the valence band (HOMO) of TpPa-1 was then calculated to be 1.29 V vs NHE (Fig. 6).The LUMO energy level of TpPa-1 is more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 to form HCOOH (-0.28 V vs. NHE 76), indicating that it is theoretically feasible for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to generate HCOOH over TpPa-1.As the cocatalyst, the Ru NPs deposited on TpPa-1 should not transform the energy levels of TpPa-1.The loading of noble metals onto photocatalysts is a generally adopted method to inhibit the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes 68.When the Ru NPs are introduced onto TpPa-1, these nanoparticles can accept the photo-generated electrons from the LUMO energy level of TpPa-1, because noble metals are usually good electron traps (Fig. 6), leading to an improved separation of the photo-generated charge carriers and ultimately to an enhanced photocatalytic performance.This is in line with the results of the PL and photoelectric measurements.The PL spectra of TpPa-1 and Ru/TpPa-1 excited at 326 nm are shown in Fig. 7. TpPa-1 exhibits a PL peak at around 480 nm and the excitation peak is greatly weakened with the loading of the Ru NPs, indicating the rapid charge transfer between the Ru NPs and TpPa-1.In other words, the introduction of the Ru NPs increases the separation efficiency and decreases the recombination of the photogenerated electrons-holes in Ru/TpPa-1.The time-resolved fluorescence spectra of TpPa-1 and Ru/TpPa-1 at 480 nm emission were used to measure the fluorescence life expectancy.The average fluorescence lifetimes of TpPa-1, 1.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1, 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1, and 5.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1 are 6.26, 6.03, 5.39, and 5.54 ns (Fig. 8), respectively, which decreases obviously with the loading of the Ru NPs.This implies that the interactions between the Ru NPs and TpPa-1 can generate new methods to extend the life of photo-generated charge carriers by promoting the transfer of electrons through the Ru NPs.The optimized loading amount of the Ru NPs onto the COF would be 3.0 wt because of its lowest PL intensity and lifetime among the three catalysts with different Ru loadings.This indicates that the adequate Ru NPs loaded on TpPa-1 can improve the separation of the photo-generated charge carriers, while excessive Ru NPs on the COF surface may cause the conversion of Ru clusters into the recombination center of electrons and holes and the blocking of the COF pores to reduce the photoexciting capacity of TpPa-1.Fig. 9 shows the transient photocurrent density responses of the catalysts in an on-off cycle mode upon visible-light irradiation.All Ru/TpPa-1 catalysts show much higher photoelectric currents in comparison with TpPa-1, among which 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1 exhibits the best photocurrent response.In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as a common electrochemical method has been widely used in evaluating the interface charge transfer efficiency of photocatalysts 77.In general, the smaller arc radius of the EIS spectrum, the lower the charge-transfer resistance value, corresponding to more efficient separation and transport of photoexcited electron-hole pairs 787980.As shown in Fig. 10, the EIS results reflect that the smallest arc radius for 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1, compared to those for other photocatalysts, suggests the fastest interfacial charge transfer, resulting in the most effective separation and transport of photo-generated charges.Based on these results, it can be inferred that the loading of the Ru NPs onto TpPa-1 not only enhances the visible light absorption but also facilitates the photo-induced charge transfer and restrains the recombination of photo-generated charges efficiently, resulting in the higher photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "Photocatalyst: 15 mg, MeCN/TEOA volume ratio: 10/1, and total solution volume: 110 mL.", "context": "In summary, the ketoamine-based COF (TpPa-1) loaded with different amounts of Ru NPs, Ru/TpPa-1, was employed in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 using TEOA as the sacrificial agent upon visible-light irradiation for the first time.All Ru/TpPa-1 photocatalysts show significantly enhanced activities for CO 2 reduction compared to the parent TpPa-1, giving the maximum HCOOH production rate of 108.8 mol g cat -1 h -1 over 3.0 wt Ru/TpPa-1 and competitive with some representative MOF-based photocatalysts under similar conditions.The introduction of Ru NPs can not only enhance the visible-light absorption but also facilitate the photo-generated charge transfer and restrain the recombination of photo-generated charges efficiently.This study demonstrates the great potential of COFs as a platform for effectively photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Although the activity of Ru/TpPa-1 is still not satisfied, considering the availability of different organic linkers and the possibility to modulate the composition, structure, and properties of COFs, high-efficient COFs-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO 2 can be developed in the future.And the present strategy provides some guidance in the development of more efficiently heterogeneous photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction.
