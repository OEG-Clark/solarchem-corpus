To more accurately probe surface crystal structure information, twodimension grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) has been employed to study the crystal orientation and layer spacing 44,45.As shown in Figs.2a, b andS3, the U-BOC exhibits more preferred (001) orientation than BOC, which are consistent with the above HR-TEM (Figs. 1b andS1) and XRD (Fig. S2) results.Moreover, the U-BOC exhibits larger layer spacing in out-plane (7.74 A) and in-plane (7.51 A) direction than those of BOC samples (7.52 and 7.29 A), respectively, owing to the slightly changed surface atom arrangement in U-BOC (Tables S1 andS2).To further confirm the above conclusion, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy was conducted to explore detailed information about the bond length and atom coordination.As shown in Fig. 2c, the Bi L-edge extended XAFS k 2 (k) oscillation curves clearly reveal that the ultrathin structures have less influence on the frequencies but remarkably reduced the amplitude, which should be attributed to the distorted crystal structure.These demonstrations can be further supported by corresponding Fourier transform (FT) of the k 2 (k) functions in R space (Fig. 2d and Table S3). More specifically, the FT curve of BOC exhibits three main peaks at 1.77, 2.78 and 3.73 A, corresponding to Bi-O, Bi-Cl and Bi-Bi coordination, respectively 18,29.Compared with BOC, the Bi -O and Bi -Bi peaks of U-BOC slightly shift to the lower R direction with 0.01 and 0.03 A, respectively, while the Bi -Cl peak position shifts to a higher value (0.09 A), indicating the Bi-O and Bi-Bi bond are slightly shortened as well as the Bi -Cl bond is elongated in the U-BOC.To further explore the surface characteristic, the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique was also employed.As shown in Fig. S4, except for the large noise resulting from the surface-bulk structure transitions, only a weak vacancy signal appears in the U-BOC samples.Furthermore, Raman spectra (Fig. S5) clearly reveal the distinct peak changes of U-BOC with respect to BOC samples, including the intensity decrease, blue shift of vibration peak, and new peak appearances at 74 and 99 cm -1 , corresponding to the first-order scattering Eg and A 1g modes of Bi, respectively.Notably, the decrease of the peak at 198 cm -1 (internal Eg Bi -Cl stretching) should be attributed to the decreased crystallization intensity, while the blue shift and new peak originating from the formation of low-coordinated Bi species in U-BOC 25. The electronic structure characteristics of U-BOC and BOC were explored via density function theory (DFT).As shown in Fig. S6, compared with perfect BOC, the presence of vacuum layer over exposed surface (001) facets of U-BOC results in the significantly enhanced charge density at the surface region, indicating the electron can be easily photoexcited to the conduction band, which can effectively facilitate charge separation and transportation.Notably, the length elongation of Bi-Cl bond in U-BOC surface is also achieved, which is consistent with the results of 2D-GIWAXS and XAFS.Subsequently, steady and timeresolved transient photoluminescence (PL) have also been performed on both U-BOC and BOC to explore the effects of structural characteristics on the photocharge separation and migration capability.As shown in Fig. S7a andb, the PL peaks of BOC and U-BOC can be deconvoluted into three main emission peaks located at 423.8, 460 and 512.7 nm, which are indexed to Cl vacancy, isolated V Bi defects, and triple vacancy associates \"V Bi V O V Bi \", respectively 19.Compared with BOC, the significant enhancement of PL peak intensity, especially for triple vacancy associates V Bi \", in U-BOC clearly demonstrates that the increased surface defect states can effectively restrain the charge recombination.The photoluminescence decay kinetics was further investigated by time-resolved spectra (Fig. S7c).The corresponding time-decay curve of as-prepared samples with an emission at 450 nm can well be fitted with a biexponential function (Table S4).More specifically, the U-BOC exhibits longer average lifetimes (13.08 ns) than BOC (9.51 ns), indicating its lower charge recombination under the excited state attributed to the non-radiative defect recombination in the surface 46,47.Based on the above results, the increased photoluminescence intensity and prolonged charge lifetime are apparently associated with surface defect states on the U-BOC.Moreover, ultrafast transient absorption (TA) has been also employed to investigate the excited-state energy relaxation process and charge migration behaviors.As shown in Fig. 2e, the U-BOC exhibits a stimulated emission (SE) signal, which can be characterized by two time constants: 1 2.87 0.08 ps (71.0) and 2 1348.90 141.63 ps (29.0), and the weighted average lifetime is 1341.92 141.43 ps.The photoinduced absorption (PA) signal of BOC shown in Fig. 2f demonstrates two-time constants: 1 4.98 0.13 ps (96.3) and 2 463.77 305 ps (3.7), and the weighted average lifetime is calculated to be 363.59 301 ps.These results indicate that the charge migration ability in BOC is much lower than U-BOC.The (photo)electrochemical performance has been further studied, the linear sweeping voltammograms (LSVs, Fig. S8) and chronoamperometric i-t curves (Fig. S9) clearly reveal that U-BOC exhibits a much higher photocurrent density than BOC, indicating its more efficient charge separation and transfer.To further reveal the interfacial charge transfer process, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed for these obtained samples.According to the Nyquist plots (Fig. S10), the U-BOC exhibits remarkably decreased resistances in charge transport processes compared with BOC.Based on the above results, the ultrathin structure and low-coordinated species in U-BOC can significantly improve the photogenerated charge separation efficiency. To further reveal the effect of low-coordinated species and charge migration behavior in as-prepared samples, synchronous illumination Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (SI-XPS) technique (Fig. S11) was performed to explore the surface chemical state information for water molecules absorption on both U-BOC and BOC 48495051.In the case of U-BOC (Figs. 3a andS12), under the dark condition, the low-coordinated species of O (2x)-, Cl (1x)-and Bi (3x)-have been clearly detected in the low bonding energy (BE) region, indicating the outward migration of surface exposed Cl atoms from the lattice phase due to a relatively weak binding force for the surface exposed Cl atoms.Upon the light irradiation, the typical peaks of low-valence species completely disappear in the SI-XPS spectra, while the reconstructed surface chemical bonds for Bi-O and Bi-Cl bonds are detected again, which is accompanied by significantly enhanced BE offsets for the Bi 4f, O 1s and Cl 2p peaks with 1.04, 1.23 and 1.39 eV, respectively.Moreover, the corresponding contour profiles of U-BOC were obtained under the ground and excitation states have been repeated for four cycles in Fig. 3b, indicating the bond evolution in water molecules absorption on U-BOC has an excellent repeatability.Moreover, the charge migration and surface chemical state on BOC have also been performed by SI-XPS (Fig. S13), and the relatively slight surface bond and structure evolution can be also observed.On the basis of the above SI-XPS results, it can be concluded that the exposed 001 facets of BiOCl nanosheets are terminated with chlorine atoms.Owing to the ultrathin structure and weak binding-force for the surface chlorine atoms, their dynamic migration under the ground and excitation states would lead to the significant evolutions of atomic and electronic structure in the lattice layer.To further confirm the above bond changes of as-prepared samples, synchronous illumination Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SI-FTIR) was also performed.As shown in Fig. S14a, the Bi-O stretching vibration peak (526 cm -1 ) of U-BOC has been significantly increased under the light irradiation.In contrast, no obvious change on Bi -O stretching vibration peak (526 cm -1 ) can be detected for BOC (Fig. S14b).These SI-FTIR experiments further confirm the above SI-XPS results about the chemical bond variation and charge migration of U-BOC under the photoexcited state. The atomic and electronic structure evolutions from SI-XPS results inspire us to gain deep insight into the crystal structure and energy band structure of BiOCl nanosheets.The novel synchronous illumination Xray diffraction (SI-XRD) technique has been employed to capture the evolution of crystal structure information under light excitation state (Fig. S15) 52.Figs.S16 andS17a show the typical XRD patterns of U-BOC and BOC before and after light irradiation, respectively.It can be clearly seen that under the light irradiation, all the diffraction peaks of both U-BOC and BOC slightly shifted toward the low-value direction, corresponding to the increases of their interlayer lattice spacing ( 4 10 -5 A for U-BOC (Fig. 4a) and 7 10 -5 A for BOC (Fig. S17b), respectively).Combined with the above SI-XPS results, it can be concluded that except for the dynamic evolution of the atomic and electronic structure of BiOCl, the related crystal structure expansions have also been demonstrated.Subsequently, their bandgaps were explored by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS, inset image of Fig. 4b).As shown in Figs.4b andS18, the bandgap of U-BOC is 3.38 eV, slightly smaller than that of BOC ( 3.56 eV), which might be attributed to the ultrathin structure and surface low-coordinated states.Moreover, the valance band (VB) positions of U-BOC and BOC samples were measured using the valence-band XPS equipped with synchronous photo-irradiation (PVBS).As shown in Fig. 4c, the VB maximum under the ground states for U-BOC and BOC are 1.20 and 3.10 eV (1.90 and 3.80 eV vs. NHE (pH 0)), respectively.Under the light irradiation, the significant shifts of VB position towards the high values changes have been observed on both U-BOC ( 2.20 eV) and BOC ( 3.90 eV) samples, respectively.Based on the above VB values and related bandgaps, the corresponding CB positions under the ground and excitation states have been calculated and shown in Fig. 4d.Obviously, a more negative CB bottom of U-BOC under light excitation has been obtained compared with BOC, indicating that their possibility for CO 2 reduction and water splitting. To further confirm the above results for SI-XPS and SI-XRD, the photocatalytic performances of both U-BOC and BOC samples for CO 2 reduction have been performed.Before CO 2 reduction experiment, the photocatalytic performances for overall water splitting have been first explored.As shown in Fig. S19, a track amount of hydrogen (0.14 mol g -1 h -1 ) is generated over as-prepared U-BOC, while no hydrogen product can be detected in the BOC, which is highly consistent with the bandgap structure variations under excitation states (Fig. 4d).Note that no evident oxygen evolution from water splitting has been detected in both U-BOC and BOC systems.Subsequently, the active species during the overall water splitting process was investigated by an in-situ electron spin resonance (ESR) technique.As shown in Fig. S20, no signal can be observed in the dark condition, indicating that there is no chemisorption of O 2 on the photocatalyst surface.After the UV irradiation for 20 min, the evident ESR sign peak of DMPO/O 2 -can be observed in U-BOC in comparison with that of BOC, indicating that the presence of a huge number of proton and O 2 -active groups in water solution 16.Their photocatalytic activities for CO 2 reduction using water as an electron donor have been conducted and shown in Fig. 5.Note that CO is the dominant product for CO 2 reduction reaction over both U-BOC and BOC photocatalysts, accompanying by a trace amount of CH 4 (Fig. S21), indicating that the preferential two-electron process of CO to the eightelectron reduction of CH 4 .More specifically, U-BOC exhibits much higher photocatalytic activities for CO 2 reduction into CO (64.1 mol g -1 ) than that of BOC samples (10.0 mol g -1 ) during 3 h test (Fig. 5a).Subsequently, the isotopic labeling experiment using 13 CO 2 as the feeding gas (Fig. 5b) was carried out and 13 CO peaks at m/z of 29 were detected in the reaction systems, further confirming that CO should be produced from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The photocatalytic stability of U-BOC was also explored by cycling experiments.As shown in Fig. 5c, the U-BOC catalyst can generally keep its original activity ever after three cycles, indicating its excellent photostability for CO 2 reduction.To further reveal the reaction intermediates during the CO 2 reduction process, in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was employed and the related results are shown in Fig. 5d.Upon light irradiation, the new infrared peaks in the region of 1220-2200 cm -1 gradually increase in intensity for the two samples.The absorption bands at 1249, 1352, 1385, 1481 and 1583 cm -1 in U-BOC and 1231, 1259, 1331, 1380 and 1583 cm -1 in BOC can be attributed to CO 3 2-, originating from the interaction of CO 2 and H 2 O 53.Furthermore, the absorption peaks at 1550 and 1760 cm -1 in U-BOC and 1760, 1550 and 1411 cm -1 in BOC can be assigned to the COOH group, which is regarded as the activation and reaction of adsorbed CO 2 54.More importantly, the most remarkable difference in the in-situ FTIR spectra for the two samples is that the CO absorption peak at 1954 cm -1 can only be detected in the U-BOC system, indicating that abundant CO species is generated on the surface of U-BOC, which are a more important part of an intermediate for the selective generation of CO 55.Subsequently, to further confirm the CO 2 adsorption capacity over these two photocatalysts, CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were carried out 56.As shown in Fig. S22, all the desorption temperatures of CO 2 chemisorption on U-BOC are higher than that of BOC, indicating that absorbed CO 2 molecules are binding with the surface more strongly, due to the surface of U-BOC with strong alkaline active sites caused by the changes of surface atomic and electronic structure.Therefore, these results can be further verified that the above performance for CO 2 reduction on as-prepared catalysts. To further clarify the effect of surface exposed halogen atom on photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the associated surface substitution (Br or I atoms replacing Cl atoms) experiments were carried out.As shown in Fig. S23, U-BOC exhibits the highest photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity (21.36 mol g -1 h -1 ) than that of Br/U-BOC (17.84 mol g -1 h -1 ) and I/U-BOC (10.38 mol g -1 h -1 ), indicating the electronegativity of the surface exposed halogen atoms can significantly affect the photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.Herein, it is considered that owing to its higher electronegativity than both Br and I atom, the surface exposed Cl atom in U-BOC can more effectively capture electrons from the lattice phase under the light irradiation, which results in the electron enrichment on the surface Cl atom for enhancing photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity.Thus, based on the above evidence for structure and performance, the catalytic mechanism for clarifying atomic and electronic structure changes over U-BOC in CO 2 reduction process can be summarized as in Scheme 1.For U-BOC catalyst, under the ground state, the surface exposed Cl 1 atom deviates from the lattice phase, the electron injection from Cl 1 to interlayer Bi, O and Cl 2 atoms would result in the appearance of low-coordinated species (Bi (3x)-, O (2x)-and Cl (1x)-) and the bond shortening of Bi -O and Bi -Cl 2 .Under light irradiation, the surface exposed Cl 1 can efficiently attract light energy and fall back to the lattice phase.Simultaneously, the electron injection from low-coordinated species into the surface Cl 1 would induce the length elongation of Bi -O and Bi -Cl 2 bonds, leading to the complete disappearance of low coordinated species and the increase of interlayer spacing.During CO 2 reduction process, CO 2 molecule is initially adsorbed on surface Cl 1 sites of U-BOC, meanwhile, the water molecule is dissociated into hydroxy and hydrogen ions.Then, the active CO 2 molecule interacts with the surface protons, the COOH intermediates are gradually generated.Finally, further protonation process, the CO molecules are progressively yielded on the surface of U-BOC, which can significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity for the CO generation."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
