The chemical composition is further confirmed by XPS analysis.All the signals of Zn, Auger Zn, Cd, Se and Auger Se can be observed in the XPS survey spectrum for ZnSe/CdSe-3 sample (Fig. 4a), further verifying the formation of CdSe in the composites.In detail, the two fitted peaks at the binding energy of 54.9 and 54.1 eV for ZnSe/CdSe-3 correspond to Se 3d 3/2 and Se 3d 5/2 of Se 2-(Fig.4b), and the peaks at 1044.3 and 1021.2 eV are assigned to Zn 2p 1/2 and Zn 2p 3/2 of Zn 2 (Fig. 4c) 14,55.It is noted that the binding energies of both Se 3d and Zn 2p for ZnSe/CdSe-3 are lower than that for ZnSe.The binding energies of Cd 3d are almost the same for CdSe and ZnSe/CdSe (Fig. 4d), with two peaks ascribed to Cd 3d 3/2 and Cd 3d 5/2 of Cd 2 centered respectively at 412.0 and 405.2 eV 55,56.Thus, it is speculated that low coordination Se atoms exist in the ZnSe of ZnSe/CdSe-3 sample.The electron cloud density around Zn atoms in pure ZnSe is lower than that of ZnSe/CdSe-3, implying the existence of Se vacancies (V Se ) in ZnSe/CdSe-3.This result can be evidenced by ESR spectra (Fig. 5), as ZnSe/CdSe-3 shows a strong ESR response at g-value of 2.0036 caused by the electron-trapped centers of V Se 57.Since there is no ESR signal for pristine ZnSe and CdSe, it is proposed that the V Se in ZnSe/CdSe is formed during the cation-exchange process through preferential generation of CdSe (10 -35.2 ) driven by its lower K sp compared to ZnSe (10 -25.4 ) 55, leaving V Se in the ZnSe part.Furthermore, ICP-MS was adopted to determine the atomic ratio of Zn to Cd in different samples.It is found that the Cd amount grows in sequence from ZnSe/CdSe-1 to ZnSe/CdSe-5 (Table S1), which is consistent with the precursor amount. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in aqueous solution with TEOA as the sacrificial agent over the as-prepared samples since no product can be detected using water as the electron donor even under the full spectrum irradiation (Fig. S4a).Except that no any products are detected over CdSe, CO is observed as the only product for all the catalysts.Furthermore, control experiments were conducted without CO 2 or light, with no product detected, confirming CO 2 is the only carbon source of the produced CO (Fig. S4b).There are no any liquid products either, as confirmed by GC results (Fig. S4c).As shown in Fig. 6a, the yield of CO for ZnSe/CdSe composites is much higher than that of pristine ZnSe after 6 h continuous irradiation.It is noted that the CO yield for ZnSe/CdSe-3 reaches 116.9 mol g -1 , about 33.4 times of that for pristine ZnSe (3.5 mol g -1 ).In addition, long-term reaction test has manifested the relatively stable performance of ZnSe/CdSe-3 (Fig. 6b), as the CO yield increases at a near-linear trend under continuous irradiation for 12 h.Moreover, there was little change in the morphology of ZnSe/CdSe-3 after being used for CO 2 photoreduction experiment (Fig. S5a).HRTEM, XRD patterns and XPS analysis further confirm no variation in the composition of ZnSe/CdSe-3 after the reaction, suggesting its potential for long-term application (Fig. S5b-d). The generation, separation and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers play an important role in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and are thus investigated to elucidate the enhanced performance of ZnSe/ CdSe.The light absorption property was evaluated by recording the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra.As shown in Fig. 7, ZnSe exhibits light absorption at wavelength shorter than 470 nm, while CdSe responds to a wider wavelength range that extends to more than 700 nm.The visible-light absorption is remarkably enhanced once ZnSe is loaded by CdSe, indicating increased ability of the charge carrier generation. The photoelectrochemical measurements under OCP were carried out to gain more information on the charge behavior of different samples.Fig. 8a depicts the transient photocurrent response of the samples upon chopped-light irradiation.Generally, high photocurrent is an indicator of highly efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers, as the photocurrent under OCP mainly results from the photoinduced charge diffusion.It is evident that ZnSe/CdSe-3 displays much higher photocurrent response than ZnSe, demonstrating better photoinduced charge carrier separation and transfer of ZnSe/CdSe-3. EIS analysis was employed to further evaluate the performance of charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.It is normally accepted that a small radius of the semicircle in Nyquist plot indicates a low charge transfer resistance and high electron-hole separation efficiency.The resistance under irradiation is lower than the corresponding value in dark for both samples (Fig. 8b), due to higher charge carrier density caused by the photogenerated charge carriers.Moreover, the arc radius for ZnSe/CdSe-3 is smaller than that of ZnSe both in dark and under irradiation, suggesting an enhanced charge carrier separation and faster interfacial charge transfer in ZnSe/CdSe-3.Furthermore, charge transfer dynamics are studied by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra (Fig. 8c), fitted by a biexponential model (Table S2).The average lifetime for ZnSe/CdSe-3 (0.97 ns) is shorter than that for ZnSe (1.17 ns), indicating an accelerated charge transfer between ZnSe and CdSe in ZnSe/CdSe-3. It is generally acknowledged that the charge separation in a composite is closely related to its band alignment.Based on the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the bandgap is determined to be 2.64 and 1.75 eV for ZnSe and CdSe, respectively (Fig. S6a).The band edge position of ZnSe and CdSe can be derived from the Mott-Schottky measurements.The positive slope for both ZnSe (Fig. S6b) and CdSe (Fig. S6c) indicates that they are n-type semiconductors, which agrees well with the anodic photocurrent response results (Fig. 8a).The flat band potential (E fb ) is determined to be -1.29 and -0.28 V (vs NHE) for ZnSe and CdSe, respectively.Considering that the E fb of an n-type semiconductor is close to its conduction band (CB), the respective CB potential for ZnSe and CdSe is estimated approximately to be -1.29 and -0.28 V (vs NHE) and, accordingly, the valence band (VB) potential is 1.35 and 1.47 V (vs NHE), respectively.Hence, the band alignment of ZnSe/CdSe presents as a staggered structure, as shown in Fig. S6d. ESR analysis was carried out to detect signal would be detected.Such a Z-scheme charge transfer pathway was further verified by DFT theoretical calculations.The (111) facet of both ZnSe and CdSe is adopted for the calculation since the surface at the contact interface is (111) for both materials according to Fig. 2. The band-decomposed charge density of both valance band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) for the ZnSe/CdSe composite has been calculated.As shown in Fig. 10a (also see Fig. S7), the CBM and VBM are not localized in ZnSe/CdSe because the contribution is from all of the states (i.e., Zn and Se from ZnSe, Cd and Se from CdSe).In other words, the photogenerated electrons and holes are not spatially separated like those in the type-II heterojunction since they are delocalized.So fast recombination of charge carriers can occur in the ZnSe/CdSe composite 58,59.Furthermore, the calculated work function of the exposed ZnSe (111) and CdSe (111) surface is 4.95 and 5.65 eV, respectively (Fig. 10b andc).When the surface of ZnSe (111) gets into contact with CdSe (111), a built-in electric field directed from ZnSe to CdSe will be established which can facilitate the charge carrier transfer that follows the Z-scheme pathway between ZnSe and CdSe. Therefore, the reaction mechanism is established based on the above charge transfer analysis and the band structure presented in Fig. S6d.As shown in Fig. 11, under irradiation the built-in electric field can restrain Moreover, the CO 2 photoreduction performance is highly related to the adsorption and activation of CO 2 , as well as the prompt desorption of the product (here the CO).It is reported that the vacancies in a photocatalyst are in favor of molecule adsorption 606162.Accordingly, DFT theoretical calculations were carried out to investigate the role of V Se in CO 2 and CO adsorption so as to elucidate the enhanced photocatalytic reduction performance of ZnSe/CdSe composites, especially ZnSe/CdSe-3.The model of theoretical calculation is simplified by only using the ZnSe since the V Se is on the ZnSe side in the composite in light of the XPS analysis.The optimized geometry structure and adsorption energy of CO 2 and CO on pristine ZnSe and ZnSe with V Se are presented in Table 1, which are calculated using the total energy given in Table S3.It is noted that pristine ZnSe shows relatively weaker molecule affinity for both CO 2 and CO gases as compared to ZnSe with V Se .Although the CO desorption from pristine ZnSe surface is easy, its CO 2 adsorption capacity is rather low, which is unfavorable for CO 2 reduction, as the retention time of CO 2 on the photocatalyst should be long enough for the reaction to occur.Thus, the V Se in ZnSe/CdSe composites introduced by the cation-exchange reaction can be the factor that favors the CO reduction.This speculation is further supported by the experimental results of CO 2 adsorption isotherms (Fig. 12).The pure ZnSe exhibits a weak CO 2 molecule adsorption capacity.In comparison, all the ZnSe/CdSe composites show boosted CO 2 adsorption capability, with ZnSe/CdSe-3 the highest.Moreover, it is claimed that vacancies are also in favor of charge carrier separation by working as electron-trapping sites 636465.Thus, the influence from V Se on enhanced CO 2 adsorption ability and promoted electron trapping ability, as well as on charge carrier separation, may synergistically contribute to improved CO reduction performance."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
