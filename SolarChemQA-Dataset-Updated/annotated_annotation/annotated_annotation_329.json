The structure of the pure TiO 2 film is shown in Fig. 2(a).The TiO 2 film surface appears as a flat garden with a rough surface (see Supplementary information Fig. S1 Fig. S1).The film consists of a large number of isolated flowers with continuous distributed nanopetals.This morphology is referred to as a TiO 2 nano-flower film in this study.The film with a rough surface can provide more active sites for the reactants.In our previous study, a TiO 2 nanosheet film was obtained at 180 C in a NaOH solution in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate 23.Further investigation revealed that sodium dodecyl sulfate plays an important role in the formation of nano-flower structures.Deng et al. 46 demonstrated that Na 2 Ti 2 O 4 (OH) 2 could be obtained from the reaction between the To observe the Cu species, the morphology of the Cu decorated samples was observed in the back-scattered electron (BSE) emission mode of the SEM, as shown in Fig. 2. The Cu species, which exhibit quasi-spherical structures, are uniformly dispersed on the surface of the TiO 2 films.The density of the Cu NPs on the surface of the 0.1 Cu/TiO 2 NFF (Fig. 2(b)) is lower than that on the surface of the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 NFF (Fig. 2(c)), which may be due to the lower concentration of Cu 2 in the reaction solution, and the size of the most of the particles was 50-100 nm (see Supplementary information Fig. S2).However, a higher concentration of Cu 2 may lead to a larger Cu particles (100 nm) on the surface of the 1.0 Cu/ TiO 2 NFF (Fig. 2(d)). To confirm the chemical state of the Cu element, the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 film was also characterized using XPS.Fig. 3(a) shows the XPS survey spectrum of the composite, and the results indicated that the composite contains Cu, Ti, O and C. Chemical binding energies were observed at 931.1, 530.7, 458.3 and 284.6 eV for Cu2P 3/2 , O1s, Ti2p 3/2 , and C1s, respectively.Fig. 3(b) shows a representative Cu2P core level XPS spectrum with two peaks at 933.1 and 952.8 eV for Cu2p 3/2 and Cu2p 1/2 , respectively.These peaks are primarily due to metallic copper because copper in oxidation states typically exhibits two satellite or shake-up peaks 29,31,47.In addition, the Raman signals of anatase TiO 2 were enhanced based on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from the Cu NPs (Fig. 4), which indicates that metallic Cu exists in the samples.Cu is prone to surface oxidation upon exposure to ambient laboratory atmospheric conditions at room temperature, and the oxidation products include Cu 2 O and CuO 43,44.In this study, PVP was used as the capping molecule to protect the Cu NPs from oxidation according to the literature 44.The representative Ti core level XPS spectrum in Fig. 3(c) displays two peaks at 458.3 and 464.0 eV, which were assigned to Ti2p 3/2 and Ti2p 1/2 , respectively 48.In addition, O1s peak as fitted by two components at 530.6 and 531.6 eV in Fig. 3(d), which correspond to the lattice oxygen and surface hydroxyl oxygen of TiO 2 49, respectively.Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis diffuse reflection absorption spectrum of the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 film.This film exhibits strong absorption below 400 nm due to the absorption of TiO 2 from the band-band electron transition.In addition, the pure TiO 2 film exhibited a visible light harvesting property, and the absorption in the visible region was substantially enhanced as the wavelength of light increased, which differs from the absorption of the commercial P25 photocatalyst (see Supplementary information Fig. S3).The visible light harvesting property of the TiO 2 film is closely related to its nanostructures due to the scattering of light caused by pores or cracks in the film 50,51.The 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 film exhibits enhanced light absorption in the visible region due to LSPR-absorption of the Cu particles.The LSPR-absorption peak at approximately 560 nm also confirms that metallic Cu exists in the composite.The Cu NPs in the reaction solution may be large, which results in a red shift in their LSPRabsorption compared to that of Cu NPs on the surface of TiO 2 (inset in Fig. 5).In addition, LSPR-absorption of the Cu NPs was not observed for the 0.1 Cu/TiO 2 and 1.0 Cu/TiO 2 NFFs (not shown here), which is most likely due to fewer Cu NPs on 0.1 Cu/TiO 2 NFF surface and larger Cu NPs on 1.0 Cu/TiO 2 NFF surface (Fig. 2(b) and(d)). Fig. 6 shows the PL emission spectra of the samples.The signals at 396 nm and 467 nm result from the free-excitation emission of the band gap and the charge-transfer transition from Ti 3 to the oxygen anion in a TiO 6 octahedral complex, respectively 52,53.The emission spectra of the Cu modified films are similar to those of the pure TiO 2 films.However, fluorescence quenching was observed after Cu deposition.Electron transfer from the excited TiO 2 to the surface-attached nanoparticles is thermodynamically favorable due to the larger work functions of the Cu NPs 47.Therefore, the recombination of charge carriers was effectively suppressed by the deposition of Cu NPs, leading to a lower emission intensity.In addition to good visible light absorption, a lower electron-hole recombination rate is also necessary for an efficient photocatalyst. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was carried under light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 7.In the absence of Cu species, the pure TiO 2 film has a very low CH 3 OH production rate of 0.30 mmol cm A2 h A1 under UV and visible light irradiation (l 420 nm).Loading with a small amount of metallic Cu NPs could significantly improve the performance.The CH 3 OH production rate increased to 1.8 mmol cm A2 h A1 over the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 film, indicating that the Cu NPs play an important role in the activity of the samples.However, the enhancement is no longer significant when the content of metallic Cu increases on the surface of TiO 2 films, which is most likely due to excess Cu leading to larger Cu particles (as shown in Fig. 2(d)).These larger particles negatively affect the photocatalytic efficiency due to their poor LSPR effect even though excess Cu can result in good charge separation performance (Fig. 5).Further analysis indicates that CH 3 OH production rate of the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 film is 6.0 times higher than that of the pure TiO 2 film under UV and visible light irradiation (l 420 nm), and the corresponding energy efficiency reached 0.8 over the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 NFF.Fig. 8 shows the relationship between the irradiation time and the CH 3 OH production rate under UV light irradiation.The CH 3 OH production rate increased gradually with the irradiation time increased, and the CH 3 OH production rate of the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 film is 3.6 times higher than that of the pure TiO 2 film under 3 h of UV light irradiation.The corresponding production rate was 0.90 and 0.25 mmol cm A2 h A1 respectively.This enhancement is due to the charge transfer property of the metallic Cu NPs.The TiO 2 electrons that were excited under UV light irradiation can migrate to the Cu NPs and decrease the recombination probability of the electrons and holes, promoting the reaction process.Under visible light irradiation (l 420 nm), CH 3 OH was not detected for either sample, even after a long irradiation period.However, Logar et al. demonstrated that the visible photocatalytic activity of a Cu/ TiO 2 nanobelt can be induced by metallic Cu LSPR-mediated charge injection from the metal to the semiconductor during degradation of the organic cationic dye methyl orange 47. In this study, the inactivity of the Cu/TiO 2 film under visible light irradiation may be due to the holes retained in the plasmonic Cu NPs after electron transfer to the semiconductor.These nanoparticles possess insufficient energy to drive a parallel oxidation reaction at the surface of the Cu NPs.Based on this analysis, the photoactivity enhancement of the TiO 2 film may be due to the role of electron trapping and LSPR-absorption of metallic Cu NPs, especially the LSPR effect.The CH 3 OH production rate of the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 NFF was 0.90 mmol cm A2 h A1 after 3 h of UV light irradiation, and the CH 3 OH production rate reached 1.8 mmol cm A2 h A1 when visible light was added, indicating that visible light can enhance the activity of TiO 2 due to the LSPR effect of the Cu NPs. Based on this analysis, we believe the Cu NPs play crucial role in the photocatalytic process (Fig. 9).First, conduction band electrons (e A ) in TiO 2 are generated under UV light irradiation, followed by migration to metallic Cu.Then, the energy of the trapped electrons is enhanced by Cu NPs via the strong local electron field from the LSPR effect, which results in the electrons easily reacting with CO 2 species.The active valence band holes (h vb ) in TiO 2 can oxidized H 2 O or OH A to produce OH, which can release O 2 and H 54.H and active e A would reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH 55565758596061.The synergetic effect between the charge transfer property and LSPR-absorption of the Cu NPs is achieved and results in an improved photocatalytic performance over Cu/TiO 2 surface."}, {"llm generation": "0.5 Cu/TiO2 film", "source": "The CH 3 OH production rate increased to 1.8 mmol cm A2 h A1 over the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 film, indicating that the Cu NPs play an important role in the activity of the samples.", "context": "Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the prepared samples.All of the peaks can be indexed using the Ti substrate (JCPDS file No: 65-6231), anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS file No: 21-1272), and rutile TiO 2 (JCPDS file no.21-1276), respectively.The content of rutile TiO 2 is very low, suggesting that anatase TiO 2 can convert to rutile TiO 2 at 400 C.This anatase/rutile mixed phase is suitable for the photocatalytic reaction 3,9.The XRD patterns of the Cu modified TiO 2 films are similar to those of the pure TiO 2 film, and the signals corresponding to the Cu species were not observed even in the 1.0 Cu/TiO 2 NFF, which may be due to the low amount and high dispersion of the Cu particles.However, the existence of Cu was confirmed by BSE and XPS analysis below.

The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was carried under light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 7.In the absence of Cu species, the pure TiO 2 film has a very low CH 3 OH production rate of 0.30 mmol cm A2 h A1 under UV and visible light irradiation (l 420 nm).Loading with a small amount of metallic Cu NPs could significantly improve the performance.The CH 3 OH production rate increased to 1.8 mmol cm A2 h A1 over the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 film, indicating that the Cu NPs play an important role in the activity of the samples.However, the enhancement is no longer significant when the content of metallic Cu increases on the surface of TiO 2 films, which is most likely due to excess Cu leading to larger Cu particles (as shown in Fig. 2(d)).These larger particles negatively affect the photocatalytic efficiency due to their poor LSPR effect even though excess Cu can result in good charge separation performance (Fig. 5).Further analysis indicates that CH 3 OH production rate of the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 film is 6.0 times higher than that of the pure TiO 2 film under UV and visible light irradiation (l 420 nm), and the corresponding energy efficiency reached 0.8 over the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 NFF.Fig. 8 shows the relationship between the irradiation time and the CH 3 OH production rate under UV light irradiation.The CH 3 OH production rate increased gradually with the irradiation time increased, and the CH 3 OH production rate of the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 film is 3.6 times higher than that of the pure TiO 2 film under 3 h of UV light irradiation.The corresponding production rate was 0.90 and 0.25 mmol cm A2 h A1 respectively.This enhancement is due to the charge transfer property of the metallic Cu NPs.The TiO 2 electrons that were excited under UV light irradiation can migrate to the Cu NPs and decrease the recombination probability of the electrons and holes, promoting the reaction process.Under visible light irradiation (l 420 nm), CH 3 OH was not detected for either sample, even after a long irradiation period.However, Logar et al. demonstrated that the visible photocatalytic activity of a Cu/ TiO 2 nanobelt can be induced by metallic Cu LSPR-mediated charge injection from the metal to the semiconductor during degradation of the organic cationic dye methyl orange 47. In this study, the inactivity of the Cu/TiO 2 film under visible light irradiation may be due to the holes retained in the plasmonic Cu NPs after electron transfer to the semiconductor.These nanoparticles possess insufficient energy to drive a parallel oxidation reaction at the surface of the Cu NPs.Based on this analysis, the photoactivity enhancement of the TiO 2 film may be due to the role of electron trapping and LSPR-absorption of metallic Cu NPs, especially the LSPR effect.The CH 3 OH production rate of the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 NFF was 0.90 mmol cm A2 h A1 after 3 h of UV light irradiation, and the CH 3 OH production rate reached 1.8 mmol cm A2 h A1 when visible light was added, indicating that visible light can enhance the activity of TiO 2 due to the LSPR effect of the Cu NPs. Based on this analysis, we believe the Cu NPs play crucial role in the photocatalytic process (Fig. 9).First, conduction band electrons (e A ) in TiO 2 are generated under UV light irradiation, followed by migration to metallic Cu.Then, the energy of the trapped electrons is enhanced by Cu NPs via the strong local electron field from the LSPR effect, which results in the electrons easily reacting with CO 2 species.The active valence band holes (h vb ) in TiO 2 can oxidized H 2 O or OH A to produce OH, which can release O 2 and H 54.H and active e A would reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH 55565758596061.The synergetic effect between the charge transfer property and LSPR-absorption of the Cu NPs is achieved and results in an improved photocatalytic performance over Cu/TiO 2 surface."}, {"llm generation": "Cu NPs", "source": "The Cu NPs can effectively suppress the recombination of charge carriers and improve the charge transfer efficiency.", "context": "A metallic Cu modified TiO 2 film was prepared by using a hydrothermal method and a microwave-assisted reduction process.The Cu NPs can effectively suppress the recombination of charge carriers and improve the charge transfer efficiency.In addition, the visible light absorption and the Raman scattering of TiO 2 can be enhanced by the Cu NPs due to their LSPR absorption.The LSPR absorption can greatly increase the energy of trapped electrons, allowing them to easily react with electron acceptors, and the CH 3 OH production rate reached 1.8 mmol cm A2 h A1 over the 0.5 Cu/TiO 2 film under UV and visible light irradiation, which is 6.0 times higher than that over a pure TiO 2 film.In this study, the visible light capturing ability of the TiO 2 film was achieved by selfstructure regulation.Therefore, a simple strategy for the development of inexpensive and high performing film-shaped plasmonic photocatalyst systems has been reported.
