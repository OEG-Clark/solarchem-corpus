The desired heterostructure photocatalyst (1 wt of MoS 2 ) is synthesized typically by taking a fixed amount of synthesized CdIn 2 S 4 and dissolve it in 40 ml of deionized water in a round bottom flask.0.1 mmol of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and 0.2 mmol of thioacetamide were added and stirred for 30 min to form a suspension.The above solution is transferred into 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and the mixture was heated at 210 C for 24 h 19.The final product was collected by centrifugation.The precipitate was washed thoroughly with deionized water and ethanol and dried overnight at 50 C temperature.The assynthesized samples MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 samples with 0.5 wt, 1 wt and 1.5 wt of MoS 2 are labeled as CISM0.5,CISM1 and CISM1.5, respectively.The synthesis process is illustrated in Fig. 1. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction was carried out as in our previous paper 20.In a typical experiment, 20 mg of as-prepared catalyst was placed in 40 ml of aqueous solution in Pyrex photoreactor (125 ml) containing sacrificial electron donor (SED) and 300 W Xe arc lamp (visible light source) was positioned 10 cm far from the reactor to drive the photocatalytic reaction.The hydrogen production yield was examined by a gas chromatograph (Perkin Elmer Clarus 590 GC with Molecular Sieve/5 A column) operational with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The stability of the photocatalyst was tested for four successive cycles.On first cycle, photocatalytic activity was performed continuously for 4 h followed by degassing and purged with nitrogen gas before the second cycle of the experiment.Similarly, experiments were carried out in third and fourth cycles.The Apparent Quantum Efficiency (AQE) was evaluated for hydrogen production.The same procedure was followed by using different catalysts prepared in this study. The CO 2 reduction of photocatalysts was carried out in accordance with our recently reported work 21.In a typical reaction, an Xe arc lamp of 300 W is used as the light source to activate the photocatalytic reaction.The reactor is placed 10 cm far from the light source.The methanol yield was quantitatively determined by using Gas Chromatography FID using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, injector temperature: 250 o C, and FID detector temperature: 275 o C. GC-FID system calibration curve is used to quantify and confirm the product.A few blank tests were executed to confirm the photoreduction of CO 2 .They are all noted in Table 1.220), (311), ( 222), (400), ( 422) and (511) lattice planes 22.No other impurity peaks are noticed demonstrating the high purity of the synthesized photocatalyst.No MoS 2 peaks were noticed in the composites.This could be due to the low intensity of MoS 2 and/or the overlapping of two peaks for MoS 2 (14.5 ) and CdIn 2 S 4 (14.1 ).We have discussed CIS and CISM1 extensively as CIS is the starting material and CISM1 is the best in its photocatalytic performance."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis", "source": "Therefore, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were used to study as-prepared photocatalysts (Fig. 7a).", "context": "The surface properties like surface area, pore diameter and pore volume of the photocatalysts CdIn 2 S 4 and CISM1 are observed with the aid of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms curves (Fig. 2b).Type-IV isotherms are displayed by the synthesized samples with an H3 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification, indicating the presence of mesopores 23.The effective BET surface area of CIS and CISM1 was 3.54 and 7.96 m 2 /g, respectively.The pore diameter for CdIn 2 S 4 and CISM1 are 48.47 and 19.39 nm, respectively.Similarly, the total pore volume of CdIn 2 S 4 and CISM1 are 0.0429 and 0.0385 cc/g, respectively.The BET surface area of CISM1 was found to be twice higher than that of CdIn 2 S 4 .The reasons are attributed to hierarchical pseudo-spherical structure formation in CISM1 and reducing the aggregation of CdIn 2 S 4 .Above all, it has been broadly agreed that superior photocatalytic activity takes place where there is greater BET surface area 24. The morphology of the synthesized photocatalysts was observed through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) for CdIn 2 S 4 and CISM1 in Fig. 3(a-b) and (c-d), respectively. The surface morphology of pristine CIS appeared as a microsphere with a wide diameter enables the cocatalyst to spread over it.It is observed that CIS is assembled with nanoflakes in terms of random self-assembly.The catalytic activity of the sample is enhanced due to the increased specific surface area.It is observed that the denser the nanoflakes larger the microspheres. 25 Fig. 4 (a-b) depicts the High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) of CISM1.It displays a fine MoS 2 layer over CdIn 2 S 4 .Fig. 4d clearly confirms the heterojunction formation.The crystalline lattice spacing of CdIn 2 S 4 (0.38 nm) and MoS 2 (0.61 nm) were assigned to (311) and (002) planes, respectively 25,26.Fig. S1 (a-c) shows the pristine CdIn 2 S 4 with nanoflakes self-assembled microsphere. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) is used for elemental mapping of pristine CIS and CISM1 which are shown in Fig. S1 (d-g) and Fig. 5 respectively.All these elements are uniformly distributed in the MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 composite.Two integrated sulfide-photoactive semiconductors are pictorially displayed the hierarchical pseudo-spherical structure with MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 . XPS analysis was carried to know the atomic states of the CISM1 photocatalyst (Fig. 6).The characteristic binding energy 6 (a-b) 27.In Fig. 6c two binding energy peaks of S 2p (159.65 eV and 160.84 eV) correspond to S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 with split energy difference of 1.2 eV which provides evidence that S is in S 2-state 28.Finally, Fig. 6d shows the Mo 3d states at 230.89 eV and 233.91 eV representing binding energies of Mo 3d 5/2 and Mo 3d 3/2 , respectively.It has a spin-orbit separation of 3.02 eV assigned to Mo 4 29.From the above XPS results, it can be corroborated that the MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 nanoflakes self-assembled pseudo-spherical structure heterojunction has been efficiently synthesized.These synthesized photocatalysts enhanced the light-induced charge transport during the photocatalytic applications. Absorption and transmission of light are crucial in photocatalysts.Therefore, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were used to study as-prepared photocatalysts (Fig. 7a).Pristine CdIn 2 S 4 harvests light from UV to the Visible region up to 560 nm.MoS 2 harvests most of the light from UV to the Visible region up to 850 nm.As the MoS 2 is added to CdIn 2 S 4 , light absorption is increased and a red-shift is noticed.This shift could be understood as a strong interaction between MoS 2 and CdIn 2 S 4 30.Using the formula h A(h-E g ) n/2 , the bandgap (E g ) can be determined where signifies absorption coefficient, h is Planck constant, is the frequency of light and A is proportionality constant.Here the 'n' value depends on the type of optical transition property the semiconductor possesses (n 1 for direct and n 4 for indirect transition).The n value of CdIn 2 S 4 and MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 was 1 31.The bandgap energies were calculated to be 2.21 eV (CIS) and The rate of separation and recombination of photoinduced charge carriers of the catalysts are studied by photoluminescence (PL) spectra at room temperature.The behavior of induced charge carriers from the electron-hole pair recombination process illustrated.The PL spectra were collected at 380 nm excitation, as CdIn 2 S 4 showed an absorption band at this wavelength in UVvisible spectra.It is noted that the recombination probability of photogenerated charge carriers is related to the PL intensity.Photocatalyst CISM1 demonstrates a greater decrease when compared with other catalysts (Fig. 7c).CISM1 composite shows a lower PL intensity than CIS.In principle, this observation shows that the addition of MoS 2 can subdue electron-hole recombination.This decrease in intensity influences the increase in the lifetime of exciton and effective interfacial electron transfer from excited CdIn 2 S 4 to MoS 2 in CISM1 photocatalyst due to heterojunction formation thus leading to reduction of recombination and higher hydrogen production 32,33. TRPL spectroscopy is employed to understand the charge carrier dynamics of synthesized photocatalysts (Fig. 7d).The decay component of CISM1 showed a longer average lifetime (4 ns) than that of CIS (3.3 ns), which shows that composite CISM1 can effectively retard carrier recombination and enhance the photoexcited charges 34,35. PEC study was carried out to study the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance studies (EIS) for the prepared catalysts CdIn 2 S 4 and MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 under the artificial solar simulator of AM 1G illuminator (100 mWcm -2 ).The LSV studies were carried out at a scan rate of 2 mV/s from -1 V to 1 V vs. RHE.As shown in Fig. 8a, the LSV showed no considerable current at the dark conditions for both CIS and CISM1 whereas photocurrent density increased under the illumination.The photocurrent density of CISM1 is considerably higher than that of CIS.This higher current density is originated due to efficient charge separation at the interfacial band arrangement between CdIn 2 S 4 and MoS 2 .These results indicate that MoS 2 deposition on CdIn 2 S 4 has helped in improving photocatalytic performance.CISM1 displayed high current density of 0.075 mA/cm 2 and CIS 0.025 mA/cm 2 at 1 V vs. calomel electrode.In order to study the photoresponse of the electrodes, the photocurrent scans (I-t curves) were carried out under on/off light irradiation (Fig. 8b).There is a significant enhancement of photocurrent during the regular interval of light on/off operations.Photocurrents of CIS and CISM1 are 0.95 A/cm 2 and 2.25 A/cm 2 , respectively.There is an increase in photocurrent for CISM1 due to optimum loading of MoS 2 which improved the electron-hole separation 36.As Fig. 8c shows Nyquist impedance plots (EIS) for CIS and CISM1 in 0.1 M of Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution.CISM1 composite has displayed a smaller arc radius, which means high interfacial charge separation efficiency 37.Mott-Schottky (M-S) plots are carried out at frequencies of 2100 and 3100 Hz.Using the Mott-Schottky equation flat-band potential is determined by equation 38. Here the dielectric constant of free space is and the film electrode is 0 , rest of the variables N D for donor density, C for space charge capacitance, E for applied potential, T for temperature, k B for Boltzmann's constant and q for the electronic charge.The intersection points in the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 8d) show the flat potential (E fb ) for each photocatalyst under the different frequencies applied.The E fb of CIS and MoS 2 are -0.9 and -0.11 eV versus those of Ag/AgCl electrode respectively. The photocatalytic performance was studied for all the synthesized photocatalysts.Fig. 9(a) shows the results of the hydrogen evolution at every hour and the overall rate of hydrogen at the same condition.The CIS has shown less photocatalytic activity (1292 mol g -1 h -1 ) under the same reaction condition.It can be understood in terms of the fast recombination of photoinduced charges.However, with the presence of MoS 2 components on the CdIn 2 S 4 , the hydrogen evolution rates significantly increased depending on the MoS 2 content.CISM1 sample has shown the highest value (2365 mol g -1 h -1 ) of the hydrogen production rates which is almost double that of pure CdIn 2 S 4 .The order of H 2 evolution rate follows CISM1 (2365 mol g 9b).The AQE of MoS 2 , CIS, CISM0.5, CISM1 and CISM1.5, samples for H 2 evolution at 400 nm wavelengths are 0.12, 1.27, 2.01, 2.3 and 2.1 respectively.The photocatalytic activity is listed in Table S1.An increase in the MoS 2 has decreased the photocatalytic performance.This could be understood as the following factors: (i) increased MoS 2 can lead to shadowing effect of MoS 2 where the light absorption is hampered for the generation of photoinduced charges by CdIn 2 S 4 44; (ii) photoactive sites of CdIn 2 S 4 are overridden thus hindering heterojunction contact with others; (iii) overloading of MoS 2 can become an epicenter for recombination of photogenerated charges 45.The stability of the CISM1 composite was evaluated for 4 cycles with every 3 h (Fig. 9d).There was no significant decrease in H 2 evolution during the stability test.This indicates that CISM1 composite is stable.Variation in catalyst amounts was studied for CISM1 (Fig. 9c).For 20 mg of catalyst, the rate of H 2 evolution is 2365 mol g -1 h -1 .Due to the loading increased the rate of hydrogen evolution decreased due to the shielding effect caused by a large amount of catalyst.The role of various sacrificial electron donors is also studied over CISM1 composite.The effect of different SED's (TEOA, methanol (MeOH), glycine (Gly), NaS 2 Na 2 SO 3 and without SED) in hydrogen productions were studied and incorporated in the supporting information (Fig. S2).In consequence, NaS 2 Na 2 SO 3 is the most effective for higher activity.Further, we compared the activity for photocatalytic H 2 generation among MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 and other photocatalysts that are given in the Table S2.From the above results, a tentative photocatalytic mechanism for MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 is proposed and illustrated schematically in Fig. 10.Under visible light illumination, the electron-hole pairs at conduction band Additionally, photocatalytic performance is explored by studying the CO 2 reduction.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to methanol for all the synthesized samples are listed in Table 1.The amount of methanol formation by MoS 2 , CIS, CISM0.5, CISM1 and CISM1.5 are shown in Fig. 11.The activity of pure MoS 2 and CIS are considerably low.It is primarily due to rapid recombination of photoinduced charge carriers in single-component semiconductor photocatalysts.CISM1 displayed the highest activity (6383 mol g -1 cat) at the rate of 1276 mol g -1 h -1 cat.The rate of methanol yield for the rest of photocatalysts MoS 2 , CIS, CISM0.5 and CISM1.5 are found to be 253, 544, 856 and 1066 mol g -1 h -1 cat, respectively.The order of CO 2 reduction follows CISM1CISM1.25CISM1.5CISM0.75CISM0.5CISMoS 2 .These photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results agree with the trend of hydrogen production as well as PL results.Furthermore, 1 H NMR analysis was carried out to confirm methanol formation in the reaction mixture after 5 h of the photocatalytic activity.The photoreduction of CO 2 to methanol is confirmed by GC-FID, and 1 H NMR results shown in Fig. 11. A tentative charge transfer mechanism in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to methanol was proposed in Fig. 12.It is well known that electrons need more negative chemical potential and holes need a higher positive potential level for oxidation to reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH.The bandgap of p-type CdIn 2 S 4 is 2.1 eV and when the light is illuminated on the photocatalyst the visible light active particles undergo dissolution, triggering electrons and holes in CB and VB, respectively.The photoexcited electrons can easily migrate from CB of CdIn 2 S 4 to MoS 2 to produce methanol via photocatalytic reaction 48. From the above results, the increase in the methanol yield of CISM1 was observed compared to CIS, MoS 2 , CISM0.5 and CISM1.5.This could be explained on the basis of absorption of the number of carbonate atoms.CdIn 2 S 4 can harvest visible light and transfer the excited charge carriers to CB of MoS 2 so that the adsorbed carbonate atoms can be reduced to methanol.For the catalyst CISM1, the MoS 2 layer is optimally covered CdIn 2 S 4 and facilitates CO 2 reduction reaction.Greater the concealing of the surface of CdIn 2 S 4 by MoS 2 in CISM1.5 catalysts, poorer the lightharvesting and adsorption of carbonate atoms.The activity among the photocatalysts are compared and presented in Table 2.After the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the catalyst is collected, washed and dried for further characterization to examine the structure and morphology of CISM1 (Fig. S3).A few changes are noticed in the MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 heterojunction composite like the surface becoming smooth and CdIn 2 S 4 flakes are not observed, but there is no change in the structural pattern. The above study envisaged that the high photocatalytic performance is mainly due to the three major factors: (i) substantial improved visible light absorption by introducing MoS 2 components, (ii) formation of p-n heterojunction between CdIn 2 S 4 and MoS 2 has helped in reducing electron-hole recombination with longer average life-time 4 ns and photocurrent of 2.25 A/cm"}, {"llm generation": "artificial solar simulator", "source": "PEC study was carried out to study the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance studies (EIS) for the prepared catalysts CdIn 2 S 4 and MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 under the artificial solar simulator of AM 1G illuminator (100 mWcm -2 ).", "context": "The surface properties like surface area, pore diameter and pore volume of the photocatalysts CdIn 2 S 4 and CISM1 are observed with the aid of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms curves (Fig. 2b).Type-IV isotherms are displayed by the synthesized samples with an H3 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification, indicating the presence of mesopores 23.The effective BET surface area of CIS and CISM1 was 3.54 and 7.96 m 2 /g, respectively.The pore diameter for CdIn 2 S 4 and CISM1 are 48.47 and 19.39 nm, respectively.Similarly, the total pore volume of CdIn 2 S 4 and CISM1 are 0.0429 and 0.0385 cc/g, respectively.The BET surface area of CISM1 was found to be twice higher than that of CdIn 2 S 4 .The reasons are attributed to hierarchical pseudo-spherical structure formation in CISM1 and reducing the aggregation of CdIn 2 S 4 .Above all, it has been broadly agreed that superior photocatalytic activity takes place where there is greater BET surface area 24.

The above study envisaged that the high photocatalytic performance is mainly due to the three major factors: (i) substantial improved visible light absorption by introducing MoS 2 components, (ii) formation of p-n heterojunction between CdIn 2 S 4 and MoS 2 has helped in reducing electron-hole recombination with longer average life-time 4 ns and photocurrent of 2.25 A/cm"}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "Under visible light illumination, the electron-hole pairs at conduction band Additionally, photocatalytic performance is explored by studying the CO 2 reduction.", "context": "The surface properties like surface area, pore diameter and pore volume of the photocatalysts CdIn 2 S 4 and CISM1 are observed with the aid of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms curves (Fig. 2b).Type-IV isotherms are displayed by the synthesized samples with an H3 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification, indicating the presence of mesopores 23.The effective BET surface area of CIS and CISM1 was 3.54 and 7.96 m 2 /g, respectively.The pore diameter for CdIn 2 S 4 and CISM1 are 48.47 and 19.39 nm, respectively.Similarly, the total pore volume of CdIn 2 S 4 and CISM1 are 0.0429 and 0.0385 cc/g, respectively.The BET surface area of CISM1 was found to be twice higher than that of CdIn 2 S 4 .The reasons are attributed to hierarchical pseudo-spherical structure formation in CISM1 and reducing the aggregation of CdIn 2 S 4 .Above all, it has been broadly agreed that superior photocatalytic activity takes place where there is greater BET surface area 24. The morphology of the synthesized photocatalysts was observed through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) for CdIn 2 S 4 and CISM1 in Fig. 3(a-b) and (c-d), respectively. The surface morphology of pristine CIS appeared as a microsphere with a wide diameter enables the cocatalyst to spread over it.It is observed that CIS is assembled with nanoflakes in terms of random self-assembly.The catalytic activity of the sample is enhanced due to the increased specific surface area.It is observed that the denser the nanoflakes larger the microspheres. 25 Fig. 4 (a-b) depicts the High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) of CISM1.It displays a fine MoS 2 layer over CdIn 2 S 4 .Fig. 4d clearly confirms the heterojunction formation.The crystalline lattice spacing of CdIn 2 S 4 (0.38 nm) and MoS 2 (0.61 nm) were assigned to (311) and (002) planes, respectively 25,26.Fig. S1 (a-c) shows the pristine CdIn 2 S 4 with nanoflakes self-assembled microsphere. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) is used for elemental mapping of pristine CIS and CISM1 which are shown in Fig. S1 (d-g) and Fig. 5 respectively.All these elements are uniformly distributed in the MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 composite.Two integrated sulfide-photoactive semiconductors are pictorially displayed the hierarchical pseudo-spherical structure with MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 . XPS analysis was carried to know the atomic states of the CISM1 photocatalyst (Fig. 6).The characteristic binding energy 6 (a-b) 27.In Fig. 6c two binding energy peaks of S 2p (159.65 eV and 160.84 eV) correspond to S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 with split energy difference of 1.2 eV which provides evidence that S is in S 2-state 28.Finally, Fig. 6d shows the Mo 3d states at 230.89 eV and 233.91 eV representing binding energies of Mo 3d 5/2 and Mo 3d 3/2 , respectively.It has a spin-orbit separation of 3.02 eV assigned to Mo 4 29.From the above XPS results, it can be corroborated that the MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 nanoflakes self-assembled pseudo-spherical structure heterojunction has been efficiently synthesized.These synthesized photocatalysts enhanced the light-induced charge transport during the photocatalytic applications. Absorption and transmission of light are crucial in photocatalysts.Therefore, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were used to study as-prepared photocatalysts (Fig. 7a).Pristine CdIn 2 S 4 harvests light from UV to the Visible region up to 560 nm.MoS 2 harvests most of the light from UV to the Visible region up to 850 nm.As the MoS 2 is added to CdIn 2 S 4 , light absorption is increased and a red-shift is noticed.This shift could be understood as a strong interaction between MoS 2 and CdIn 2 S 4 30.Using the formula h A(h-E g ) n/2 , the bandgap (E g ) can be determined where signifies absorption coefficient, h is Planck constant, is the frequency of light and A is proportionality constant.Here the 'n' value depends on the type of optical transition property the semiconductor possesses (n 1 for direct and n 4 for indirect transition).The n value of CdIn 2 S 4 and MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 was 1 31.The bandgap energies were calculated to be 2.21 eV (CIS) and The rate of separation and recombination of photoinduced charge carriers of the catalysts are studied by photoluminescence (PL) spectra at room temperature.The behavior of induced charge carriers from the electron-hole pair recombination process illustrated.The PL spectra were collected at 380 nm excitation, as CdIn 2 S 4 showed an absorption band at this wavelength in UVvisible spectra.It is noted that the recombination probability of photogenerated charge carriers is related to the PL intensity.Photocatalyst CISM1 demonstrates a greater decrease when compared with other catalysts (Fig. 7c).CISM1 composite shows a lower PL intensity than CIS.In principle, this observation shows that the addition of MoS 2 can subdue electron-hole recombination.This decrease in intensity influences the increase in the lifetime of exciton and effective interfacial electron transfer from excited CdIn 2 S 4 to MoS 2 in CISM1 photocatalyst due to heterojunction formation thus leading to reduction of recombination and higher hydrogen production 32,33. TRPL spectroscopy is employed to understand the charge carrier dynamics of synthesized photocatalysts (Fig. 7d).The decay component of CISM1 showed a longer average lifetime (4 ns) than that of CIS (3.3 ns), which shows that composite CISM1 can effectively retard carrier recombination and enhance the photoexcited charges 34,35. PEC study was carried out to study the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance studies (EIS) for the prepared catalysts CdIn 2 S 4 and MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 under the artificial solar simulator of AM 1G illuminator (100 mWcm -2 ).The LSV studies were carried out at a scan rate of 2 mV/s from -1 V to 1 V vs. RHE.As shown in Fig. 8a, the LSV showed no considerable current at the dark conditions for both CIS and CISM1 whereas photocurrent density increased under the illumination.The photocurrent density of CISM1 is considerably higher than that of CIS.This higher current density is originated due to efficient charge separation at the interfacial band arrangement between CdIn 2 S 4 and MoS 2 .These results indicate that MoS 2 deposition on CdIn 2 S 4 has helped in improving photocatalytic performance.CISM1 displayed high current density of 0.075 mA/cm 2 and CIS 0.025 mA/cm 2 at 1 V vs. calomel electrode.In order to study the photoresponse of the electrodes, the photocurrent scans (I-t curves) were carried out under on/off light irradiation (Fig. 8b).There is a significant enhancement of photocurrent during the regular interval of light on/off operations.Photocurrents of CIS and CISM1 are 0.95 A/cm 2 and 2.25 A/cm 2 , respectively.There is an increase in photocurrent for CISM1 due to optimum loading of MoS 2 which improved the electron-hole separation 36.As Fig. 8c shows Nyquist impedance plots (EIS) for CIS and CISM1 in 0.1 M of Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution.CISM1 composite has displayed a smaller arc radius, which means high interfacial charge separation efficiency 37.Mott-Schottky (M-S) plots are carried out at frequencies of 2100 and 3100 Hz.Using the Mott-Schottky equation flat-band potential is determined by equation 38. Here the dielectric constant of free space is and the film electrode is 0 , rest of the variables N D for donor density, C for space charge capacitance, E for applied potential, T for temperature, k B for Boltzmann's constant and q for the electronic charge.The intersection points in the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 8d) show the flat potential (E fb ) for each photocatalyst under the different frequencies applied.The E fb of CIS and MoS 2 are -0.9 and -0.11 eV versus those of Ag/AgCl electrode respectively. The photocatalytic performance was studied for all the synthesized photocatalysts.Fig. 9(a) shows the results of the hydrogen evolution at every hour and the overall rate of hydrogen at the same condition.The CIS has shown less photocatalytic activity (1292 mol g -1 h -1 ) under the same reaction condition.It can be understood in terms of the fast recombination of photoinduced charges.However, with the presence of MoS 2 components on the CdIn 2 S 4 , the hydrogen evolution rates significantly increased depending on the MoS 2 content.CISM1 sample has shown the highest value (2365 mol g -1 h -1 ) of the hydrogen production rates which is almost double that of pure CdIn 2 S 4 .The order of H 2 evolution rate follows CISM1 (2365 mol g 9b).The AQE of MoS 2 , CIS, CISM0.5, CISM1 and CISM1.5, samples for H 2 evolution at 400 nm wavelengths are 0.12, 1.27, 2.01, 2.3 and 2.1 respectively.The photocatalytic activity is listed in Table S1.An increase in the MoS 2 has decreased the photocatalytic performance.This could be understood as the following factors: (i) increased MoS 2 can lead to shadowing effect of MoS 2 where the light absorption is hampered for the generation of photoinduced charges by CdIn 2 S 4 44; (ii) photoactive sites of CdIn 2 S 4 are overridden thus hindering heterojunction contact with others; (iii) overloading of MoS 2 can become an epicenter for recombination of photogenerated charges 45.The stability of the CISM1 composite was evaluated for 4 cycles with every 3 h (Fig. 9d).There was no significant decrease in H 2 evolution during the stability test.This indicates that CISM1 composite is stable.Variation in catalyst amounts was studied for CISM1 (Fig. 9c).For 20 mg of catalyst, the rate of H 2 evolution is 2365 mol g -1 h -1 .Due to the loading increased the rate of hydrogen evolution decreased due to the shielding effect caused by a large amount of catalyst.The role of various sacrificial electron donors is also studied over CISM1 composite.The effect of different SED's (TEOA, methanol (MeOH), glycine (Gly), NaS 2 Na 2 SO 3 and without SED) in hydrogen productions were studied and incorporated in the supporting information (Fig. S2).In consequence, NaS 2 Na 2 SO 3 is the most effective for higher activity.Further, we compared the activity for photocatalytic H 2 generation among MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 and other photocatalysts that are given in the Table S2.From the above results, a tentative photocatalytic mechanism for MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 is proposed and illustrated schematically in Fig. 10.Under visible light illumination, the electron-hole pairs at conduction band Additionally, photocatalytic performance is explored by studying the CO 2 reduction.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to methanol for all the synthesized samples are listed in Table 1.The amount of methanol formation by MoS 2 , CIS, CISM0.5, CISM1 and CISM1.5 are shown in Fig. 11.The activity of pure MoS 2 and CIS are considerably low.It is primarily due to rapid recombination of photoinduced charge carriers in single-component semiconductor photocatalysts.CISM1 displayed the highest activity (6383 mol g -1 cat) at the rate of 1276 mol g -1 h -1 cat.The rate of methanol yield for the rest of photocatalysts MoS 2 , CIS, CISM0.5 and CISM1.5 are found to be 253, 544, 856 and 1066 mol g -1 h -1 cat, respectively.The order of CO 2 reduction follows CISM1CISM1.25CISM1.5CISM0.75CISM0.5CISMoS 2 .These photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results agree with the trend of hydrogen production as well as PL results.Furthermore, 1 H NMR analysis was carried out to confirm methanol formation in the reaction mixture after 5 h of the photocatalytic activity.The photoreduction of CO 2 to methanol is confirmed by GC-FID, and 1 H NMR results shown in Fig. 11.

The morphology of the synthesized photocatalysts was observed through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) for CdIn 2 S 4 and CISM1 in Fig. 3(a-b) and (c-d), respectively. The surface morphology of pristine CIS appeared as a microsphere with a wide diameter enables the cocatalyst to spread over it.It is observed that CIS is assembled with nanoflakes in terms of random self-assembly.The catalytic activity of the sample is enhanced due to the increased specific surface area.It is observed that the denser the nanoflakes larger the microspheres. 25 Fig. 4 (a-b) depicts the High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) of CISM1.It displays a fine MoS 2 layer over CdIn 2 S 4 .Fig. 4d clearly confirms the heterojunction formation.The crystalline lattice spacing of CdIn 2 S 4 (0.38 nm) and MoS 2 (0.61 nm) were assigned to (311) and (002) planes, respectively 25,26.Fig. S1 (a-c) shows the pristine CdIn 2 S 4 with nanoflakes self-assembled microsphere. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) is used for elemental mapping of pristine CIS and CISM1 which are shown in Fig. S1 (d-g) and Fig. 5 respectively.All these elements are uniformly distributed in the MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 composite.Two integrated sulfide-photoactive semiconductors are pictorially displayed the hierarchical pseudo-spherical structure with MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 . XPS analysis was carried to know the atomic states of the CISM1 photocatalyst (Fig. 6).The characteristic binding energy 6 (a-b) 27.In Fig. 6c two binding energy peaks of S 2p (159.65 eV and 160.84 eV) correspond to S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 with split energy difference of 1.2 eV which provides evidence that S is in S 2-state 28.Finally, Fig. 6d shows the Mo 3d states at 230.89 eV and 233.91 eV representing binding energies of Mo 3d 5/2 and Mo 3d 3/2 , respectively.It has a spin-orbit separation of 3.02 eV assigned to Mo 4 29.From the above XPS results, it can be corroborated that the MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 nanoflakes self-assembled pseudo-spherical structure heterojunction has been efficiently synthesized.These synthesized photocatalysts enhanced the light-induced charge transport during the photocatalytic applications. Absorption and transmission of light are crucial in photocatalysts.Therefore, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were used to study as-prepared photocatalysts (Fig. 7a).Pristine CdIn 2 S 4 harvests light from UV to the Visible region up to 560 nm.MoS 2 harvests most of the light from UV to the Visible region up to 850 nm.As the MoS 2 is added to CdIn 2 S 4 , light absorption is increased and a red-shift is noticed.This shift could be understood as a strong interaction between MoS 2 and CdIn 2 S 4 30.Using the formula h A(h-E g ) n/2 , the bandgap (E g ) can be determined where signifies absorption coefficient, h is Planck constant, is the frequency of light and A is proportionality constant.Here the 'n' value depends on the type of optical transition property the semiconductor possesses (n 1 for direct and n 4 for indirect transition).The n value of CdIn 2 S 4 and MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 was 1 31.The bandgap energies were calculated to be 2.21 eV (CIS) and The rate of separation and recombination of photoinduced charge carriers of the catalysts are studied by photoluminescence (PL) spectra at room temperature.The behavior of induced charge carriers from the electron-hole pair recombination process illustrated.The PL spectra were collected at 380 nm excitation, as CdIn 2 S 4 showed an absorption band at this wavelength in UVvisible spectra.It is noted that the recombination probability of photogenerated charge carriers is related to the PL intensity.Photocatalyst CISM1 demonstrates a greater decrease when compared with other catalysts (Fig. 7c).CISM1 composite shows a lower PL intensity than CIS.In principle, this observation shows that the addition of MoS 2 can subdue electron-hole recombination.This decrease in intensity influences the increase in the lifetime of exciton and effective interfacial electron transfer from excited CdIn 2 S 4 to MoS 2 in CISM1 photocatalyst due to heterojunction formation thus leading to reduction of recombination and higher hydrogen production 32,33. TRPL spectroscopy is employed to understand the charge carrier dynamics of synthesized photocatalysts (Fig. 7d).The decay component of CISM1 showed a longer average lifetime (4 ns) than that of CIS (3.3 ns), which shows that composite CISM1 can effectively retard carrier recombination and enhance the photoexcited charges 34,35. PEC study was carried out to study the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance studies (EIS) for the prepared catalysts CdIn 2 S 4 and MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 under the artificial solar simulator of AM 1G illuminator (100 mWcm -2 ).The LSV studies were carried out at a scan rate of 2 mV/s from -1 V to 1 V vs. RHE.As shown in Fig. 8a, the LSV showed no considerable current at the dark conditions for both CIS and CISM1 whereas photocurrent density increased under the illumination.The photocurrent density of CISM1 is considerably higher than that of CIS.This higher current density is originated due to efficient charge separation at the interfacial band arrangement between CdIn 2 S 4 and MoS 2 .These results indicate that MoS 2 deposition on CdIn 2 S 4 has helped in improving photocatalytic performance.CISM1 displayed high current density of 0.075 mA/cm 2 and CIS 0.025 mA/cm 2 at 1 V vs. calomel electrode.In order to study the photoresponse of the electrodes, the photocurrent scans (I-t curves) were carried out under on/off light irradiation (Fig. 8b).There is a significant enhancement of photocurrent during the regular interval of light on/off operations.Photocurrents of CIS and CISM1 are 0.95 A/cm 2 and 2.25 A/cm 2 , respectively.There is an increase in photocurrent for CISM1 due to optimum loading of MoS 2 which improved the electron-hole separation 36.As Fig. 8c shows Nyquist impedance plots (EIS) for CIS and CISM1 in 0.1 M of Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution.CISM1 composite has displayed a smaller arc radius, which means high interfacial charge separation efficiency 37.Mott-Schottky (M-S) plots are carried out at frequencies of 2100 and 3100 Hz.Using the Mott-Schottky equation flat-band potential is determined by equation 38. Here the dielectric constant of free space is and the film electrode is 0 , rest of the variables N D for donor density, C for space charge capacitance, E for applied potential, T for temperature, k B for Boltzmann's constant and q for the electronic charge.The intersection points in the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 8d) show the flat potential (E fb ) for each photocatalyst under the different frequencies applied.The E fb of CIS and MoS 2 are -0.9 and -0.11 eV versus those of Ag/AgCl electrode respectively. The photocatalytic performance was studied for all the synthesized photocatalysts.Fig. 9(a) shows the results of the hydrogen evolution at every hour and the overall rate of hydrogen at the same condition.The CIS has shown less photocatalytic activity (1292 mol g -1 h -1 ) under the same reaction condition.It can be understood in terms of the fast recombination of photoinduced charges.However, with the presence of MoS 2 components on the CdIn 2 S 4 , the hydrogen evolution rates significantly increased depending on the MoS 2 content.CISM1 sample has shown the highest value (2365 mol g -1 h -1 ) of the hydrogen production rates which is almost double that of pure CdIn 2 S 4 .The order of H 2 evolution rate follows CISM1 (2365 mol g 9b).The AQE of MoS 2 , CIS, CISM0.5, CISM1 and CISM1.5, samples for H 2 evolution at 400 nm wavelengths are 0.12, 1.27, 2.01, 2.3 and 2.1 respectively.The photocatalytic activity is listed in Table S1.An increase in the MoS 2 has decreased the photocatalytic performance.This could be understood as the following factors: (i) increased MoS 2 can lead to shadowing effect of MoS 2 where the light absorption is hampered for the generation of photoinduced charges by CdIn 2 S 4 44; (ii) photoactive sites of CdIn 2 S 4 are overridden thus hindering heterojunction contact with others; (iii) overloading of MoS 2 can become an epicenter for recombination of photogenerated charges 45.The stability of the CISM1 composite was evaluated for 4 cycles with every 3 h (Fig. 9d).There was no significant decrease in H 2 evolution during the stability test.This indicates that CISM1 composite is stable.Variation in catalyst amounts was studied for CISM1 (Fig. 9c).For 20 mg of catalyst, the rate of H 2 evolution is 2365 mol g -1 h -1 .Due to the loading increased the rate of hydrogen evolution decreased due to the shielding effect caused by a large amount of catalyst.The role of various sacrificial electron donors is also studied over CISM1 composite.The effect of different SED's (TEOA, methanol (MeOH), glycine (Gly), NaS 2 Na 2 SO 3 and without SED) in hydrogen productions were studied and incorporated in the supporting information (Fig. S2).In consequence, NaS 2 Na 2 SO 3 is the most effective for higher activity.Further, we compared the activity for photocatalytic H 2 generation among MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 and other photocatalysts that are given in the Table S2.From the above results, a tentative photocatalytic mechanism for MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 is proposed and illustrated schematically in Fig. 10.Under visible light illumination, the electron-hole pairs at conduction band Additionally, photocatalytic performance is explored by studying the CO 2 reduction.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to methanol for all the synthesized samples are listed in Table 1.The amount of methanol formation by MoS 2 , CIS, CISM0.5, CISM1 and CISM1.5 are shown in Fig. 11.The activity of pure MoS 2 and CIS are considerably low.It is primarily due to rapid recombination of photoinduced charge carriers in single-component semiconductor photocatalysts.CISM1 displayed the highest activity (6383 mol g -1 cat) at the rate of 1276 mol g -1 h -1 cat.The rate of methanol yield for the rest of photocatalysts MoS 2 , CIS, CISM0.5 and CISM1.5 are found to be 253, 544, 856 and 1066 mol g -1 h -1 cat, respectively.The order of CO 2 reduction follows CISM1CISM1.25CISM1.5CISM0.75CISM0.5CISMoS 2 .These photocatalytic CO 2 reduction results agree with the trend of hydrogen production as well as PL results.Furthermore, 1 H NMR analysis was carried out to confirm methanol formation in the reaction mixture after 5 h of the photocatalytic activity.The photoreduction of CO 2 to methanol is confirmed by GC-FID, and 1 H NMR results shown in Fig. 11. A tentative charge transfer mechanism in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to methanol was proposed in Fig. 12.It is well known that electrons need more negative chemical potential and holes need a higher positive potential level for oxidation to reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH.The bandgap of p-type CdIn 2 S 4 is 2.1 eV and when the light is illuminated on the photocatalyst the visible light active particles undergo dissolution, triggering electrons and holes in CB and VB, respectively.The photoexcited electrons can easily migrate from CB of CdIn 2 S 4 to MoS 2 to produce methanol via photocatalytic reaction 48. From the above results, the increase in the methanol yield of CISM1 was observed compared to CIS, MoS 2 , CISM0.5 and CISM1.5.This could be explained on the basis of absorption of the number of carbonate atoms.CdIn 2 S 4 can harvest visible light and transfer the excited charge carriers to CB of MoS 2 so that the adsorbed carbonate atoms can be reduced to methanol.For the catalyst CISM1, the MoS 2 layer is optimally covered CdIn 2 S 4 and facilitates CO 2 reduction reaction.Greater the concealing of the surface of CdIn 2 S 4 by MoS 2 in CISM1.5 catalysts, poorer the lightharvesting and adsorption of carbonate atoms.The activity among the photocatalysts are compared and presented in Table 2.After the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, the catalyst is collected, washed and dried for further characterization to examine the structure and morphology of CISM1 (Fig. S3).A few changes are noticed in the MoS 2 CdIn 2 S 4 heterojunction composite like the surface becoming smooth and CdIn 2 S 4 flakes are not observed, but there is no change in the structural pattern. The above study envisaged that the high photocatalytic performance is mainly due to the three major factors: (i) substantial improved visible light absorption by introducing MoS 2 components, (ii) formation of p-n heterojunction between CdIn 2 S 4 and MoS 2 has helped in reducing electron-hole recombination with longer average life-time 4 ns and photocurrent of 2.25 A/cm"}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Continuous", "source": "On first cycle, photocatalytic activity was performed continuously for 4 h followed by degassing and purged with nitrogen gas before the second cycle of the experiment.", "context": "In a typical procedure, 0.4 mmol of Cadmium chloride, 0.2 mmol of Indium chloride tetrahydrate and 1 mmol of thioacetamide (TAA) were dissolved in distilled water (50 ml).The mixture was stirred for 30 min.The above solution is transferred into 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 160 C for 16 h 18.The synthesized material was collected and washed thoroughly with deionized water and ethanol and dried at 40 C temperature overnight.
