Subsequently, indium(III) nitrate dissolved in isopropanol was added drop-wise and stirred for another 12 h until clear sol was produced.The sol obtained was poured into a glass container for monolith coating. The monolith was initially washed with acetone and isopropanol to remove any organic material, and then dried at 80 C for 12 h.The SHIMADZU analytical balance ATY-224 with specifications: Max 220 g, Min 10 mg, d 0.1 mg, e 1 mg was used to measure the weight of the monoliths.For every sample, three readings were noted for bare monolith as well as coated monoliths and their average values are reported.For example, the weight of the 2 cm 100 CPSI bare monolith was 46.8219 g, aggregated from three different readings, i.e.(a) 46.8214 g, (b) 46.8225 g, and (c) 46.5218 g.After the weight of the dried monolith was recorded, it was immersed slowly into the indium loaded TiO 2 sol and kept for a few minutes.The excess sol from the channels was blown off using compressed air and dried with an air drier.To increase the film thickness and catalyst loading, the monolith was dipped for the second time using the same procedure.The coated monolith was then put into the oven, dried at 80 C for 12 h and finally calcined in a muffle furnace at a rate of 5 C min -1 up to a maximum of 500 C and held for 5 h.After calcination, the average weight of the coated monolith was 47.3532 g calculated from three readings (a) 47.3539 g, (b) 47.3531 g, and (c) 47.3526 g.Therefore, the catalyst coated over monolith channels was 0.5313 g calculated by subtracting coated monolith weight (47.3532 g) from un-coated monolith weight (46.8219 g).In/TiO 2 sol was dried and calcined with the same procedure as explained above to obtain In/TiO 2 powder.For comparison, bare TiO 2 nanoparticles were also similarly prepared and coated inside the microchannels of the monolith. In order to determine the structure and crystallinity of the photocatalysts, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on Bruker D8 advance diffractometer (Cu K radiation, wavelength 1.54 A, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA).The surface morphology was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with JEOL JSM6390 LV SEM instrument.The particle size and lattice structure of the individual crystals was visualized by high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) carried out with FEI-Tecni G2 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) at EFGO Scientific, Kulim, Kedah, Malaysia.Textural characterization of the samples was carried out with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption properties were examined at 77 K.The specific surface area (S BET ) of monolayer coverage was determined using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.The pore size distribution was calculated using the adsorption branch of the isotherm by means of Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.Meanwhile, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples were measured with UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer, Shimadzu UV 3101pc. The schematic photocatalytic reaction system for reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O in gaseous phase is illustrated in Fig. 2. The reactor consisted of a stainless steel cylindrical vessel with 5.5 cm length and a total volume of 150 cm 3 .The monoliths were supplied by Pingxiang Meitao Chemical Packing Co., Ltd., China.The dimensions of the monolith are as follows: diameter 6 cm; length from 0.50 to 10 cm, channels per square inch (CPSI) 100 and 400.After coating with about 50 mg catalyst the monolith was placed at the center of the cylindrical stainless steel reactor, equipped with a quartz window for passing light irradiations from the reflector lamp located above the reactor.The reactor temperature was adjusted using heating and cooling jackets.The light source used to activate the photocatalytic reactions was a 200 W mercury lamp for UV irradiations source, having non-collimated irradiations with maximum intensity at 252 nm.The lamp was equipped with a cooling fan at the top and sides to remove lamp heat.The light intensity was measured with an online optical process monitor ILT OPM-1D and a SED008/W sensor.The average irradiation intensity passing through the top of the reactor was 150 mW/cm 2 .The reactor was covered with aluminum foil to ensure lights for reactions came through the quartz window only.In case of the cell type photoreactor, the reactor chamber and the light source was the same with the monolith reactor.Furthermore, 50 mg of nanocatalyst powder was suspended uniformly at the bottom of the reactor to ensure the light was efficiently distributed over the catalyst surface. Prior to feeding, both reactors were purged using helium (He) flow to remove air as well as to check for leakage under 2 bar pressure for 10 h.Pure CO 2 (purity 99.995) was bubbled through deionized water saturator for 1 h to remove dissolved oxygen and air.The temperature inside the water bubbler was controlled using a temperature controller.The compressed CO 2 regulated by a mass flow controller (MFC), was bubbled through the deionized water and its concentration was adjusted with helium regulated by the MFC.The partial pressure of H 2 O vapors was adjusted by changing the temperature of the water saturator.The gases, CO 2 , He and H 2 O mixed well inside the gas mixer, continuously passed through the reactor containing powdered catalyst or coated monolith for about 1 h prior to switching on the lamp.The pressure inside the reactor was adjusted to 0.20 bars above atmospheric pressure while temperature inside the reactor was controlled using a heating jacket. The products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890N, USA) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionized detector (FID).The gaseous products from the reactor were also taken using gastight syringe (Agilent, 1000 l) for offline analysis using the same volume as in the online analysis.Furthermore, the FID detector was connected with a HP-PLOT Q capillary column (Agilent, length 30 m. ID 0.53 mm, film 40 m) for separation of C 1 -C 6 paraffins and olefins hydrocarbons, alcohols and oxygenated compounds.The TCD detector was connected to UCW982, DC-200, Porapak Q and Mol Sieve 13X columns.The UCW-982 was used for back flush and reversed flow to ensure C 6 and higher compounds could be detected earlier in the chromatogram.Meanwhile, C 1 -C 2 , C 3 -C 5 compounds and light gasses (H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO) were separated using Porapak Q, DC-200, and MS-13X columns, respectively."}, {"llm generation": "indium doped TiO2", "source": "Therefore, a new monolith photoreactor design is eminent in the photocatalytic reactor research field while indium doped TiO 2 is a highly efficient catalyst for maximizing CO yield rates and selectivity.", "context": "A microchannel monolith photoreactor with catalysts coated as very thin film on the walls of the channels is presented for higher CO 2 reduction rate.By doping TiO 2 with indium, pure anatase phase of TiO 2 was achieved with smaller particle size, larger surface area and mesoporous structure.The geometric of the monolith profoundly improved product yield rates.Furthermore, the effect of temperature, catalyst loading and partial pressure of CO 2 were also investigated.CO and CH 4 were observed as the main products with yield rate 962 and 55.4 mol g-catal. - h -1 , respectively and selectivity of 94.39 and 5.44, respectively over 10 wt. indium doped TiO 2 supported over microchannels at 373 K and 0.20 bars.The other products observed were C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 6 .The performance comparison between the photoreactors revealed 183-fold higher yield of CO in the monolith compared to cell type reactor.The quantum efficiency achieved in the cell type reactor was also much lower (0.0005) compared to the microchannel monolith reactor (0.10).More importantly, the quantum efficiency was significantly improved using microchannels compared to internally illuminated monolith as reported previously.The higher efficiency of the monolith photoreactor was supposedly due to higher illuminated surface area, higher photon energy consumption and better utilization of reactor volume.The kinetic equation based on L-H mechanism could effectively estimate the reaction rate and product formation during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O. Therefore, a new monolith photoreactor design is eminent in the photocatalytic reactor research field while indium doped TiO 2 is a highly efficient catalyst for maximizing CO yield rates and selectivity."}], "co-catalyst": [], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV", "source": "The light source used to activate the photocatalytic reactions was a 200 W mercury lamp for UV irradiations source, having non-collimated irradiations with maximum intensity at 252 nm.", "context": "Fig. 1 describes the procedure of catalyst synthesis and coating on monolith channels.The sol-gel single step method was used to prepare mesoporous TiO 2 and In/TiO 2 nanoparticles.The precursory of titanium solution was prepared with molar ratios: Ti (C 4 H 9 O) 4 :15C 2 H 5 OH:2CH 3 COOH (1 M).Typically, 30 ml of isopropanol was added into 10 ml of titanium tetra iso-propoxide and stirred well for 30 min.The controlled hydrolysis was conducted by adding drop wise a mixture of 6.37 ml acetic acid (1 M) and 10 ml isopropanol under vigorous stirring.The mixture was continuously stirred for 24 h at 30 C.

The monolith was initially washed with acetone and isopropanol to remove any organic material, and then dried at 80 C for 12 h.The SHIMADZU analytical balance ATY-224 with specifications: Max 220 g, Min 10 mg, d 0.1 mg, e 1 mg was used to measure the weight of the monoliths.For every sample, three readings were noted for bare monolith as well as coated monoliths and their average values are reported.For example, the weight of the 2 cm 100 CPSI bare monolith was 46.8219 g, aggregated from three different readings, i.e.(a) 46.8214 g, (b) 46.8225 g, and (c) 46.5218 g.After the weight of the dried monolith was recorded, it was immersed slowly into the indium loaded TiO 2 sol and kept for a few minutes.The excess sol from the channels was blown off using compressed air and dried with an air drier.To increase the film thickness and catalyst loading, the monolith was dipped for the second time using the same procedure.The coated monolith was then put into the oven, dried at 80 C for 12 h and finally calcined in a muffle furnace at a rate of 5 C min -1 up to a maximum of 500 C and held for 5 h.After calcination, the average weight of the coated monolith was 47.3532 g calculated from three readings (a) 47.3539 g, (b) 47.3531 g, and (c) 47.3526 g.Therefore, the catalyst coated over monolith channels was 0.5313 g calculated by subtracting coated monolith weight (47.3532 g) from un-coated monolith weight (46.8219 g).In/TiO 2 sol was dried and calcined with the same procedure as explained above to obtain In/TiO 2 powder.For comparison, bare TiO 2 nanoparticles were also similarly prepared and coated inside the microchannels of the monolith. In order to determine the structure and crystallinity of the photocatalysts, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on Bruker D8 advance diffractometer (Cu K radiation, wavelength 1.54 A, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA).The surface morphology was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with JEOL JSM6390 LV SEM instrument.The particle size and lattice structure of the individual crystals was visualized by high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) carried out with FEI-Tecni G2 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) at EFGO Scientific, Kulim, Kedah, Malaysia.Textural characterization of the samples was carried out with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption properties were examined at 77 K.The specific surface area (S BET ) of monolayer coverage was determined using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.The pore size distribution was calculated using the adsorption branch of the isotherm by means of Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.Meanwhile, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples were measured with UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer, Shimadzu UV 3101pc. The schematic photocatalytic reaction system for reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O in gaseous phase is illustrated in Fig. 2. The reactor consisted of a stainless steel cylindrical vessel with 5.5 cm length and a total volume of 150 cm 3 .The monoliths were supplied by Pingxiang Meitao Chemical Packing Co., Ltd., China.The dimensions of the monolith are as follows: diameter 6 cm; length from 0.50 to 10 cm, channels per square inch (CPSI) 100 and 400.After coating with about 50 mg catalyst the monolith was placed at the center of the cylindrical stainless steel reactor, equipped with a quartz window for passing light irradiations from the reflector lamp located above the reactor.The reactor temperature was adjusted using heating and cooling jackets.The light source used to activate the photocatalytic reactions was a 200 W mercury lamp for UV irradiations source, having non-collimated irradiations with maximum intensity at 252 nm.The lamp was equipped with a cooling fan at the top and sides to remove lamp heat.The light intensity was measured with an online optical process monitor ILT OPM-1D and a SED008/W sensor.The average irradiation intensity passing through the top of the reactor was 150 mW/cm 2 .The reactor was covered with aluminum foil to ensure lights for reactions came through the quartz window only.In case of the cell type photoreactor, the reactor chamber and the light source was the same with the monolith reactor.Furthermore, 50 mg of nanocatalyst powder was suspended uniformly at the bottom of the reactor to ensure the light was efficiently distributed over the catalyst surface. Prior to feeding, both reactors were purged using helium (He) flow to remove air as well as to check for leakage under 2 bar pressure for 10 h.Pure CO 2 (purity 99.995) was bubbled through deionized water saturator for 1 h to remove dissolved oxygen and air.The temperature inside the water bubbler was controlled using a temperature controller.The compressed CO 2 regulated by a mass flow controller (MFC), was bubbled through the deionized water and its concentration was adjusted with helium regulated by the MFC.The partial pressure of H 2 O vapors was adjusted by changing the temperature of the water saturator.The gases, CO 2 , He and H 2 O mixed well inside the gas mixer, continuously passed through the reactor containing powdered catalyst or coated monolith for about 1 h prior to switching on the lamp.The pressure inside the reactor was adjusted to 0.20 bars above atmospheric pressure while temperature inside the reactor was controlled using a heating jacket. The products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890N, USA) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionized detector (FID).The gaseous products from the reactor were also taken using gastight syringe (Agilent, 1000 l) for offline analysis using the same volume as in the online analysis.Furthermore, the FID detector was connected with a HP-PLOT Q capillary column (Agilent, length 30 m. ID 0.53 mm, film 40 m) for separation of C 1 -C 6 paraffins and olefins hydrocarbons, alcohols and oxygenated compounds.The TCD detector was connected to UCW982, DC-200, Porapak Q and Mol Sieve 13X columns.The UCW-982 was used for back flush and reversed flow to ensure C 6 and higher compounds could be detected earlier in the chromatogram.Meanwhile, C 1 -C 2 , C 3 -C 5 compounds and light gasses (H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO) were separated using Porapak Q, DC-200, and MS-13X columns, respectively."}, {"llm generation": "Monolithic", "source": "A microchannel monolith photoreactor with catalysts coated as very thin film on the walls of the channels is presented for higher CO 2 reduction rate.", "context": "A microchannel monolith photoreactor with catalysts coated as very thin film on the walls of the channels is presented for higher CO 2 reduction rate.By doping TiO 2 with indium, pure anatase phase of TiO 2 was achieved with smaller particle size, larger surface area and mesoporous structure.The geometric of the monolith profoundly improved product yield rates.Furthermore, the effect of temperature, catalyst loading and partial pressure of CO 2 were also investigated.CO and CH 4 were observed as the main products with yield rate 962 and 55.4 mol g-catal. - h -1 , respectively and selectivity of 94.39 and 5.44, respectively over 10 wt. indium doped TiO 2 supported over microchannels at 373 K and 0.20 bars.The other products observed were C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 6 .The performance comparison between the photoreactors revealed 183-fold higher yield of CO in the monolith compared to cell type reactor.The quantum efficiency achieved in the cell type reactor was also much lower (0.0005) compared to the microchannel monolith reactor (0.10).More importantly, the quantum efficiency was significantly improved using microchannels compared to internally illuminated monolith as reported previously.The higher efficiency of the monolith photoreactor was supposedly due to higher illuminated surface area, higher photon energy consumption and better utilization of reactor volume.The kinetic equation based on L-H mechanism could effectively estimate the reaction rate and product formation during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O. Therefore, a new monolith photoreactor design is eminent in the photocatalytic reactor research field while indium doped TiO 2 is a highly efficient catalyst for maximizing CO yield rates and selectivity."}], "operation mode": []}}
