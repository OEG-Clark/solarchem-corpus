The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax , and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites (Fig. 3f) showed that the pure C-TiO 2Ax possessed similar patterns with anatase TiO 2 .C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites exhibited the characteristic PXRD peaks of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , with the intensity of the characteristic peaks of C-TiO 2Ax increasing with the enhancement of C-TiO 2Ax content (Fig. S1 ).SEM and TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite were taken to directly analyze its structure (Fig. 3a-d).As shown in the SEM image (Fig. 3a), the layered structure of g-C 3 N 4 was maintained in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mappings and the spectrum (Fig. 3b) of the selected area showed that the Ti and O elements were highly dispersed on the g-C 3 N 4 surface.TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in Fig. 3c reveal the size of TiO 2Ax nanoparticles were mainly distributed between 6 and 9 nm.Compared with the 590 nm particle size of TiO 2 in TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S2 ), which was synthesized by a traditional hydrothermal method, 13 the size of TiO 2Ax in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was reduced by two orders of magnitude.Therefore, employing polyoxotitanate as a Ti source could be an efficient and effective method to obtain ultrasmall TiO 2Ax nanoparticle-based composite materials.Highresolution TEM (HRTEM) was employed to identify the phase of the TiO 2Ax nanoparticles in the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite.As shown in Fig. 3d, the distance between the adjacent lattice planes was 0.35 nm along 101 direction, which is a typical lattice plane distance for anatase TiO 2 . 20The structure of the TiO 2Ax -coated amorphous carbon layer can be clearly observed from Fig. 3e.Furthermore, the carbon layer was the link connecting g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax nanoparticles.For the electron pool character of the carbon layer, such a structure will facilitate photoinduced electron transfer.In order to illuminate the source of amorphous carbon, an HRTEM image of bare C-TiO 2Ax was collected.A clear carbon coating around TiO 2Ax nanoparticles was found, which strongly excluded the possibility of the carbon source being from g-C 3 N 4 . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further employed to determine the atomic valence states and bonding environment in C-TiO 2Ax and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Fig. 3 shows the XPS of C-TiO 2Ax , in which the high-resolution spectra of Ti 2p located at 465.0, 464.2, 459.2, and 458.7 eV could be assigned to Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 3 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 , and Ti 3 2p 3/2 , respectively. 25he C 1s had three peaks at 284. Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 clusters may be the main source of amorphous carbon. The XPS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. S3, and the high-resolution XPS results of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p are exhibited in Fig. 4a-d Compared with C-TiO 2Ax , the peak of O-H group is shied a little, which should be attributed to the chemical environment change. 29The C 1s XPS spectrum exhibits anisomerous peaks with an obvious shoulder.Aer tting, ve peaks could be observed with the binding energies of 289.9, 288.6, 287.6, 286.0, and 284.6 eV.The peaks located at 287.6 and 286.0 eV are attributed to hybridized carbon atoms containing the C-(N) 3 and N-C-N group of g-C 3 N 4 , while the one at 284.6 eV is assigned to the C-C coordination, originating from adventitious carbon of the XPS instrument itself. 30The peak emerging at 288.6 eV is matched with the Ti-O-C.The le peak at 289.9 eV is 0.4 eV shied compared with the corresponding peak in pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S5 ), which might due to the formation of chemical bonds. 31The N 1s could be tted into four peaks, located at 403.8, 400.8, 399.6, and 398.2 eV.The peak at 398.2 eV is assigned to sp 2 -hybridized aromatic N bound to C atoms (C N-C), while the signal at the binding energy of 399.6 eV indicates tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 .The peaks at 400.8 and 403.8 eV are assigned to C-N-H groups and charging effects. 32 The N 2 adsorption behavior was measured to reveal the change in surface of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites.The adsorptiondesorption isotherms at 77 K (Fig. S6 ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 showed a gradual decrease in BET surface areas (S BET ) with values of 94.1, 87.2, and 77.8 m 2 g A1 , respectively, while the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 was relatively high (99.4,m 2 g A1 ).Compared with the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 , the decrease in composite materials accounted for the loading of C-TiO 2Ax , whereby with the increase in loading content, the decrement enhances.The CO 2 adsorption ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was also measured.As shown in Fig. 4e, the maximum CO 2 uptake at 273 K for C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 was 17.7, 15.9, and 9.2 cm 3 g A1 , respectively, which are different to that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (11.5 cm 3 g A1 ).In contrast to N 2 adsorption, the improvement in CO 2 adsorption of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2 and 3 probably comes from the increased interaction of C-TiO 2Ax with CO 2 molecules, while the decrease in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4 may be due to the sharply decreased surface area. As H protons have a signicant inuence on the CO 2 reduction activity, the H proton adsorption capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was studied with HCl as the H source.The H adsorption curve of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. 4f.It was found that at the initial 5 min, 1.5 mmol g A1 H was adsorbed by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , corresponding to 300 mmol g A1 min A1 .Aer 3 h, it reached saturated adsorption and the amount was 4.46 mmol g A1 , which is 2.8-fold higher than bare g-C 3 N 4 (1.55 mmol g A1 ).Such a high protons accumulation capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may signicantly boost the reductive performance of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 via the low-energy proton-coupled pathway. UV-Visible adsorption spectra can provide insightful information into the interactions of photocatalytic materials with photons of different energy.Fig. 3g shows the optical absorption spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax and their composite materials.Pure C-TiO 2Ax has strong absorption within the whole visible light, while bare g-C 3 N 4 was only able to absorb light with l m 450 nm.All C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites showed an obvious light absorption from 300 to 800 nm, and with increase in doping concentration of TiO 2Ax , the absorption intensity region from 460 to 800 nm was improved.Therefore, we could expect that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may exhibit an outstanding performance in visible-light photocatalysis. As for heterojunction semiconductor, the energy level of each component has a signicant inuence on the catalytic reactivity.The energy level of the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 was well studied in our former work 33 and the band gap was 2.73 eV, with the conduction band energy (E CB ) and the valence band energy (E VB ) at A0.75 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively, vs. a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).For our materials, E VB was determined from cyclic voltammograms (CV, Fig. S7 ) and E CB was calculated based on the optical band gap (E g ). 9 Using analyses and calculations based on Fig. S8, the E VB energy of C-TiO 2Ax was 1.63 eV.E g was estimated from the Tauc plot (Fig. S8 ), which was determined to be 2.18 eV.According to the formula E CB 14 E VB A E g , the E CB of C-TiO 2Ax was estimated to be A0.55 V.The energy levels of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were appropriate for reducing CO 2 to CO and water oxidation. Given that charge separation has a signicant effect on the redox reaction occurring at a photocatalyst surface, the transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax were collected. 34,35In Fig. 4g, the photocurrent value of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 can be seen to be rapidly elevated with the light turned on and then it gradually climbs up to the highest current level (up to 0.83 mA cm A2 ) during irradiation.When the irradiation was turned off, a sharp decrease emerged.This switch loop could be implemented repeatedly multiple times.A similar phenomenon occurred with pure C-TiO 2Ax and bare g-C 3 N 4 materials during on-off irradiation; however, the photocurrent densities of them were 4-fold and 2.5-fold lower than C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Additionally, the photocurrent value of pure TiO 2 was 2-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax , illuminating that the C doping plays a crucial role in facilitating the charge separation generated by TiO 2Ax . Under visible light irradiation, the EIS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 heterjunction, bare g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax and TiO 2 were measured.As shown in Fig. 4h, the charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was 47 U cm A2 , which was considerably lower than those of bare C-TiO 2Ax (108 U cm A2 ) and g-C 3 N 4 (82 U cm A2 ).These results indicate that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 composite performed a higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers and a relatively lower recombination rate of electron-hole pairs under visible light.Simultaneously, R ct of pure TiO 2 was 172 U cm A2 , which was 1.6-fold higher than C-TiO 2Ax .This further revealed that the carbon layer plays a positive role in promoting photoinduced charge separation. The CO 2 reduction experiment was performed following the photocatalytic condition using (Au, Cu)/TiO 2 as the catalyst reported by Neatu and co-worker, in which only light, CO 2 , and H 2 O were used in the system. 36Our experiment was carried out employing C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 as a photocatalyst under a visiblelight-driven system (l 420 nm) with CO 2 atmosphere and water vapor.As a control, the photocatalytic performances of bare g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were investigated.Fig. 5a shows that CO gas was generated as the main reductive reaction products aer 12 h irradiation.Clearly, pure C-TiO 2Ax showed around 0.575 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0252 mmol g A1 H 2 while bare g-C 3 N 4 presented 0.164 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0144 mmol g A1 H 2 (hydrogen production is shown in Fig. S9 ).Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , a higher photocatalytic activity was achieved by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites and the content of C-TiO 2Ax showed a considerable inuence on the photocatalytic activity: (I) the catalyst with 1 content of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -1) showed an obvious improvement in CO generation (up to 0.412 mmol g A1 ), while H 2 evolution was almost unchanged (0.0181 mmol g A1 ), (II) enhancing the amount of C-TiO 2Ax to 6 wt of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3) resulted in an evident enhancement in both yield and selectivity.CO generation was around 5 and 15 times higher than that of bare C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, keeping in 2.460 mmol g A1 , while the yield of H 2 was scarcely increased to about 0.0741 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 97 selectivity of CO.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 remained at 40.995 mmol g TiO 2 A1 , (III) further enhancement of the C-TiO 2Ax content (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4) led to a decrease in CO generation, which might result from the decreased CO 2 adsorption capacity.These results reveal that the combination of C-TiO 2Ax with g-C 3 N 4 led to a superior enhancement in both production and selectivity toward CO and showed that the optimal catalyst was C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3. To illuminate the source of generated CO, isotopic experiments were carried out using 13 CO 2 as the gas atmosphere 33 under similar photocatalytic conditions.As exhibited in Fig. 5g, peaks at 1.88 min and 13.08 min with m/z 29 and 45 were assigned to 13 CO and 13 CO 2 , respectively.No signal at m/z 28 This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018 was found (Fig. 5f).This information provided unambiguous evidence that the produced CO originated from the photoreduction of CO 2 rather than from the decomposition of any other organic species in the system. In order to further reveal the importance of the composite structure of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in CO 2 photoreduction, control experiments employing different TiO 2 -based composites as photocatalysts were carried out under similar conditions (Table 1).When using commercial P25 TiO 2 (entry 2) as the photocatalyst, around 0.0301 mmol g A1 CO was generated, which was about 20fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .When reducing TiO 2 to TiO 2Ax , the generation of CO was enhanced to 0.255 mmol g A1 (entry 3); however, this was still 2.3-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .These results implied the carbon layer played a positive part in TiO 2 in CO 2 reduction.With TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 4) as the catalyst, made from P25 and g-C 3 N 4 , the yield was higher than bare P25 but was 68 times lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Replacing P25 with titanium isopropoxide as the starting material, the resultant TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 5) exhibited a sharply increased reactivity, with up to 0.274 mmol g A1 CO generation.However, this reactivity was one order of magnitude lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.These results illuminated that the carbon layer and excellent light adsorption of TiO 2Ax play a pivotal role in the photocatalysis.Using black TiO 2 nanobelts-doped g-C 3 N 4 (ref.25) as the catalyst (entry 6), 0.535 mmol g A1 CO was produced, which was 4.6-fold lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, revealing a small size of nanoparticles was indispensable.Besides these TiO 2 -based catalysts, the CO generation rate of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was one order higher than most the reported TiO 2 -based catalysts and it outperformed any other reported TiO 2 -based material under similar conditions (Table S1 ). 25,37 further expose the photocatalytic ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , the CO 2 reduction reaction was performed under the irradiation of whole light (Fig. 5b).Under irradiation of 12 h, around 4.500 mmol g A1 CO was produced by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.The yields of C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 were 2.900 and 0.600 mmol g A1 , respectively.These results suggest that in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax may be responsible for the active CO 2 reductive site.For TiO 2Ax , commercial P25, and TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 , the yields were 0.800, 0.050, and 0.180 mmol g A1 , respectively.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 stayed at 78.98 mmol g TiO 2 A1 (Fig. 5c), which was around 70 times higher than that of bare TiO 2Ax . The reactivity of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst in different time periods was revealed through detecting the amount of CO every other hour (Fig. 5e).No apparent CO was detected in the rst hour, illustrating this photocatalytic system needed an activation process for light excitation and adsorption equilibrium of the starting materials on the catalyst.Aer that, the yield of CO per hour almost increased at a constant speed in a linear fashion. The stability of a photocatalyst is vital to its practical and industrial application.The stability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was studied through ve-run cycling photocatalytic experiments (Fig. 5d).Aer 60 h visible-light irradiation, almost no obvious decrease was observed in CO generation, and the total production amount reached 12.30 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 204.96 mmol g TiO 2 . Aer catalysis, PXRD spectroscopies (Fig. S10 ) and UVvisible adsorption spectra (Fig. S11 ) of the sample were collected, which revealed there was little change in the structure of the catalyst and thus is demonstrated a reliable photostability.Furthermore, we also investigated the inuence of the amount of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst on the photocatalytic reactivity.When increasing the catalyst amount to 5, 10, or 30 mg, nearly the same catalytic activity to 1 mg was observed and their CO yields were close at 2.39, 2.35, 2.51 mmol g A1 .These results demonstrate that with the increase in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 amount, the high reactivity rate can still be maintained (Fig. S12 ). Control experiments were performed to elucidate the importance of the components in the photoreduction system.Through mechanically mixing C-TiO 2Ax (6 wt) with g-C 3 N 4 (entry 7), the yield was similar to bare g-C 3 N 4 .The signicant decreases implied that a loose contact is insufficient for the reduction of CO 2 .Without either C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 (entry 8) or light (entry 9), no gas was detected, which indicated that the other components cannot arouse CO 2 reduction, and thus again proved that the photogenerated charge pairs originated from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Once CO 2 gas was changed to Ar (entry 10), the generation of CO also stopped, therefore further excluding the source being from the degradation effects of organic species.In the absence of vapor (entry 7), the yield of CO dramatically decreased to 0.0997 mmol g A1 , implying vapor might be essential as an electron/proton donor. The performance of a photocatalytic system in CO 2 reduction is dictated by a balance between the thermodynamics and kinetics.A famous mechanism path is to rst convert CO 2 into CO 2 c A , which needs a high negative equilibrium potential of 1.9 V versus NHE. 38,39However, the photoinduced electrons in the conduction band edge of all semiconductors cannot provide enough driving force to carry out the one-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO 2 c A . 40,41Another mechanistic route is through protoncoupled electron transfer processes, which could bypass the formation of CO 2 c A .Through transferring the protons with electrons, the large activation barriers can be readily avoided. 42owever, the proton-participating route has a signicant kinetic dependence on the electron density on the surface of semiconductors catalysts.As discussed above, the initial H protons capture-speed of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 is 300 mmol g A1 min A1 , which is two orders of magnitude higher than the generation speed of CO (3.41 mmol g A1 min A1 ).The affluent protons accumulated on the surfaces of photocatalyst provide a guarantee for the successful reduction of CO 2 through the proton-coupled pathway. As for the other half reaction, the reactivity of water oxidation triggered by photogenerated holes has a considerable inuence on the efficiency of CO 2 reduction in H 2 O system.For water oxidation, the challenge lies mainly in the release of diatomic O 2 .The stepwise two-electron/two-step pathway is proposed as an optimum approach between thermodynamic and kinetic constraints for water oxidation. 9,16In our photocatalytic system, g-C 3 N 4 incorporated with amorphous carbon layers was designed to full the two-electron/two-step oxidation pathway.The oxidation product of O 2 around 1.22 mmol g A1 and negligible H 2 O 2 was detected in the catalytic system using C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst.Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments (Fig. S13 and S14 ) directly conrmed that the oxidation reaction undergoes a two-electron process. In photocatalysis, three universally accepted steps are involved: light harvesting, charge separation, and transportation to surface sites, thus triggering redox reactions. 43,44As for CO 2 reduction, two more steps should be taken into account, they are CO 2 and proton adsorption.CO 2 adsorption through interactions with surface atoms facilitates the formation of a partially charged species, which could lower the energy barrier and lead to increased reactivity.Proton participation could also conduct the reduction in a low-energy way. 45n CO 2 reduction with C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst, C-TiO 2Ax contributes most of the adsorbed photons, while g-C 3 N 4 could absorb the light before 450 nm.The ultrathin carbon layer serving as an electron reservoir takes an important role in accumulating the photoinduced electrons, therefore efficiently suppressing the recombination of the generated electronhole (e-h ) pairs.The ultrasmall size of C-TiO 2Ax supplies sufficient reductive sites.Owing to the slower recombination speed of electron-hole pairs of g-C 3 N 4 than that of C-TiO 2Ax , g-C 3 N 4 could supply photoexcited electrons to C-TiO 2Ax .The mesoporous structure of g-C 3 N 4 provides an appropriate accumulation space for CO 2 and H protons.Under the assistance of the carbon layer, g-C 3 N 4 becomes an active photocatalyst for water oxidation through an efficient two-electron/two-step pathway.The spatially separated reductive and oxidative sites could exclude the possibility of re-oxidation of the reduction products. Based on the above discussion, a possible catalytic mechanism for CO 2 reduction over C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is proposed (Fig. S15 ).First, CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2Ax spheres and unoccupied g-C 3 N 4 .Aer irradiation, charge separation occurs in g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax , producing the electron-hole pairs.The generated electrons transfer to the amorphous carbon and trigger the reductive reaction under the assistance of a H proton from water to produce CO, while the remaining holes on g-C 3 N 4 with the assistance of the carbon layers perform the oxidative reaction and generate O 2 via a twoelectron/two-step pathway."}, {"llm generation": "C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3", "source": "(II) enhancing the amount of C-TiO 2Ax to 6 wt of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3) resulted in an evident enhancement in both yield and selectivity.", "context": "Synthesis and structural analysis of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite For the synthesis of the targeted three-component photocatalyst, g-C 3 N 4 (ref.23) and Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 22,24 were rst prepared following the reported literature.Through one-pot pyrolyzing the mixtures of Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 and g-C 3 N 4 with different weight ratios under 350 C and an air atmosphere, the three-component composites of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 with different contents of C-TiO 2Ax were fabricated (Fig. 2).Bare C-TiO 2Ax was obtained by directly heating Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 under similar conditions.Their photographs are shown in Fig. 3g.As determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the corresponding TiO 2Ax content in the resultant C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites was respectively 1 wt, 4.5 wt, 6 wt, and 10 wt based on the Ti content and the samples were labeled as C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -1, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax , and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites (Fig. 3f) showed that the pure C-TiO 2Ax possessed similar patterns with anatase TiO 2 .C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites exhibited the characteristic PXRD peaks of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , with the intensity of the characteristic peaks of C-TiO 2Ax increasing with the enhancement of C-TiO 2Ax content (Fig. S1 ).SEM and TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite were taken to directly analyze its structure (Fig. 3a-d).As shown in the SEM image (Fig. 3a), the layered structure of g-C 3 N 4 was maintained in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mappings and the spectrum (Fig. 3b) of the selected area showed that the Ti and O elements were highly dispersed on the g-C 3 N 4 surface.TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in Fig. 3c reveal the size of TiO 2Ax nanoparticles were mainly distributed between 6 and 9 nm.Compared with the 590 nm particle size of TiO 2 in TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S2 ), which was synthesized by a traditional hydrothermal method, 13 the size of TiO 2Ax in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was reduced by two orders of magnitude.Therefore, employing polyoxotitanate as a Ti source could be an efficient and effective method to obtain ultrasmall TiO 2Ax nanoparticle-based composite materials.Highresolution TEM (HRTEM) was employed to identify the phase of the TiO 2Ax nanoparticles in the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite.As shown in Fig. 3d, the distance between the adjacent lattice planes was 0.35 nm along 101 direction, which is a typical lattice plane distance for anatase TiO 2 . 20The structure of the TiO 2Ax -coated amorphous carbon layer can be clearly observed from Fig. 3e.Furthermore, the carbon layer was the link connecting g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax nanoparticles.For the electron pool character of the carbon layer, such a structure will facilitate photoinduced electron transfer.In order to illuminate the source of amorphous carbon, an HRTEM image of bare C-TiO 2Ax was collected.A clear carbon coating around TiO 2Ax nanoparticles was found, which strongly excluded the possibility of the carbon source being from g-C 3 N 4 . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further employed to determine the atomic valence states and bonding environment in C-TiO 2Ax and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Fig. 3 shows the XPS of C-TiO 2Ax , in which the high-resolution spectra of Ti 2p located at 465.0, 464.2, 459.2, and 458.7 eV could be assigned to Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 3 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 , and Ti 3 2p 3/2 , respectively. 25he C 1s had three peaks at 284. Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 clusters may be the main source of amorphous carbon. The XPS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. S3, and the high-resolution XPS results of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p are exhibited in Fig. 4a-d Compared with C-TiO 2Ax , the peak of O-H group is shied a little, which should be attributed to the chemical environment change. 29The C 1s XPS spectrum exhibits anisomerous peaks with an obvious shoulder.Aer tting, ve peaks could be observed with the binding energies of 289.9, 288.6, 287.6, 286.0, and 284.6 eV.The peaks located at 287.6 and 286.0 eV are attributed to hybridized carbon atoms containing the C-(N) 3 and N-C-N group of g-C 3 N 4 , while the one at 284.6 eV is assigned to the C-C coordination, originating from adventitious carbon of the XPS instrument itself. 30The peak emerging at 288.6 eV is matched with the Ti-O-C.The le peak at 289.9 eV is 0.4 eV shied compared with the corresponding peak in pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S5 ), which might due to the formation of chemical bonds. 31The N 1s could be tted into four peaks, located at 403.8, 400.8, 399.6, and 398.2 eV.The peak at 398.2 eV is assigned to sp 2 -hybridized aromatic N bound to C atoms (C N-C), while the signal at the binding energy of 399.6 eV indicates tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 .The peaks at 400.8 and 403.8 eV are assigned to C-N-H groups and charging effects. 32 The N 2 adsorption behavior was measured to reveal the change in surface of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites.The adsorptiondesorption isotherms at 77 K (Fig. S6 ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 showed a gradual decrease in BET surface areas (S BET ) with values of 94.1, 87.2, and 77.8 m 2 g A1 , respectively, while the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 was relatively high (99.4,m 2 g A1 ).Compared with the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 , the decrease in composite materials accounted for the loading of C-TiO 2Ax , whereby with the increase in loading content, the decrement enhances.The CO 2 adsorption ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was also measured.As shown in Fig. 4e, the maximum CO 2 uptake at 273 K for C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 was 17.7, 15.9, and 9.2 cm 3 g A1 , respectively, which are different to that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (11.5 cm 3 g A1 ).In contrast to N 2 adsorption, the improvement in CO 2 adsorption of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2 and 3 probably comes from the increased interaction of C-TiO 2Ax with CO 2 molecules, while the decrease in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4 may be due to the sharply decreased surface area. As H protons have a signicant inuence on the CO 2 reduction activity, the H proton adsorption capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was studied with HCl as the H source.The H adsorption curve of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. 4f.It was found that at the initial 5 min, 1.5 mmol g A1 H was adsorbed by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , corresponding to 300 mmol g A1 min A1 .Aer 3 h, it reached saturated adsorption and the amount was 4.46 mmol g A1 , which is 2.8-fold higher than bare g-C 3 N 4 (1.55 mmol g A1 ).Such a high protons accumulation capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may signicantly boost the reductive performance of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 via the low-energy proton-coupled pathway. UV-Visible adsorption spectra can provide insightful information into the interactions of photocatalytic materials with photons of different energy.Fig. 3g shows the optical absorption spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax and their composite materials.Pure C-TiO 2Ax has strong absorption within the whole visible light, while bare g-C 3 N 4 was only able to absorb light with l m 450 nm.All C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites showed an obvious light absorption from 300 to 800 nm, and with increase in doping concentration of TiO 2Ax , the absorption intensity region from 460 to 800 nm was improved.Therefore, we could expect that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may exhibit an outstanding performance in visible-light photocatalysis. As for heterojunction semiconductor, the energy level of each component has a signicant inuence on the catalytic reactivity.The energy level of the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 was well studied in our former work 33 and the band gap was 2.73 eV, with the conduction band energy (E CB ) and the valence band energy (E VB ) at A0.75 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively, vs. a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).For our materials, E VB was determined from cyclic voltammograms (CV, Fig. S7 ) and E CB was calculated based on the optical band gap (E g ). 9 Using analyses and calculations based on Fig. S8, the E VB energy of C-TiO 2Ax was 1.63 eV.E g was estimated from the Tauc plot (Fig. S8 ), which was determined to be 2.18 eV.According to the formula E CB 14 E VB A E g , the E CB of C-TiO 2Ax was estimated to be A0.55 V.The energy levels of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were appropriate for reducing CO 2 to CO and water oxidation. Given that charge separation has a signicant effect on the redox reaction occurring at a photocatalyst surface, the transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax were collected. 34,35In Fig. 4g, the photocurrent value of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 can be seen to be rapidly elevated with the light turned on and then it gradually climbs up to the highest current level (up to 0.83 mA cm A2 ) during irradiation.When the irradiation was turned off, a sharp decrease emerged.This switch loop could be implemented repeatedly multiple times.A similar phenomenon occurred with pure C-TiO 2Ax and bare g-C 3 N 4 materials during on-off irradiation; however, the photocurrent densities of them were 4-fold and 2.5-fold lower than C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Additionally, the photocurrent value of pure TiO 2 was 2-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax , illuminating that the C doping plays a crucial role in facilitating the charge separation generated by TiO 2Ax . Under visible light irradiation, the EIS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 heterjunction, bare g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax and TiO 2 were measured.As shown in Fig. 4h, the charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was 47 U cm A2 , which was considerably lower than those of bare C-TiO 2Ax (108 U cm A2 ) and g-C 3 N 4 (82 U cm A2 ).These results indicate that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 composite performed a higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers and a relatively lower recombination rate of electron-hole pairs under visible light.Simultaneously, R ct of pure TiO 2 was 172 U cm A2 , which was 1.6-fold higher than C-TiO 2Ax .This further revealed that the carbon layer plays a positive role in promoting photoinduced charge separation. The CO 2 reduction experiment was performed following the photocatalytic condition using (Au, Cu)/TiO 2 as the catalyst reported by Neatu and co-worker, in which only light, CO 2 , and H 2 O were used in the system. 36Our experiment was carried out employing C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 as a photocatalyst under a visiblelight-driven system (l 420 nm) with CO 2 atmosphere and water vapor.As a control, the photocatalytic performances of bare g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were investigated.Fig. 5a shows that CO gas was generated as the main reductive reaction products aer 12 h irradiation.Clearly, pure C-TiO 2Ax showed around 0.575 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0252 mmol g A1 H 2 while bare g-C 3 N 4 presented 0.164 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0144 mmol g A1 H 2 (hydrogen production is shown in Fig. S9 ).Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , a higher photocatalytic activity was achieved by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites and the content of C-TiO 2Ax showed a considerable inuence on the photocatalytic activity: (I) the catalyst with 1 content of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -1) showed an obvious improvement in CO generation (up to 0.412 mmol g A1 ), while H 2 evolution was almost unchanged (0.0181 mmol g A1 ), (II) enhancing the amount of C-TiO 2Ax to 6 wt of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3) resulted in an evident enhancement in both yield and selectivity.CO generation was around 5 and 15 times higher than that of bare C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, keeping in 2.460 mmol g A1 , while the yield of H 2 was scarcely increased to about 0.0741 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 97 selectivity of CO.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 remained at 40.995 mmol g TiO 2 A1 , (III) further enhancement of the C-TiO 2Ax content (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4) led to a decrease in CO generation, which might result from the decreased CO 2 adsorption capacity.These results reveal that the combination of C-TiO 2Ax with g-C 3 N 4 led to a superior enhancement in both production and selectivity toward CO and showed that the optimal catalyst was C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3. To illuminate the source of generated CO, isotopic experiments were carried out using 13 CO 2 as the gas atmosphere 33 under similar photocatalytic conditions.As exhibited in Fig. 5g, peaks at 1.88 min and 13.08 min with m/z 29 and 45 were assigned to 13 CO and 13 CO 2 , respectively.No signal at m/z 28 This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018 was found (Fig. 5f).This information provided unambiguous evidence that the produced CO originated from the photoreduction of CO 2 rather than from the decomposition of any other organic species in the system. In order to further reveal the importance of the composite structure of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in CO 2 photoreduction, control experiments employing different TiO 2 -based composites as photocatalysts were carried out under similar conditions (Table 1).When using commercial P25 TiO 2 (entry 2) as the photocatalyst, around 0.0301 mmol g A1 CO was generated, which was about 20fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .When reducing TiO 2 to TiO 2Ax , the generation of CO was enhanced to 0.255 mmol g A1 (entry 3); however, this was still 2.3-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .These results implied the carbon layer played a positive part in TiO 2 in CO 2 reduction.With TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 4) as the catalyst, made from P25 and g-C 3 N 4 , the yield was higher than bare P25 but was 68 times lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Replacing P25 with titanium isopropoxide as the starting material, the resultant TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 5) exhibited a sharply increased reactivity, with up to 0.274 mmol g A1 CO generation.However, this reactivity was one order of magnitude lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.These results illuminated that the carbon layer and excellent light adsorption of TiO 2Ax play a pivotal role in the photocatalysis.Using black TiO 2 nanobelts-doped g-C 3 N 4 (ref.25) as the catalyst (entry 6), 0.535 mmol g A1 CO was produced, which was 4.6-fold lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, revealing a small size of nanoparticles was indispensable.Besides these TiO 2 -based catalysts, the CO generation rate of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was one order higher than most the reported TiO 2 -based catalysts and it outperformed any other reported TiO 2 -based material under similar conditions (Table S1 ). 25,37 further expose the photocatalytic ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , the CO 2 reduction reaction was performed under the irradiation of whole light (Fig. 5b).Under irradiation of 12 h, around 4.500 mmol g A1 CO was produced by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.The yields of C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 were 2.900 and 0.600 mmol g A1 , respectively.These results suggest that in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax may be responsible for the active CO 2 reductive site.For TiO 2Ax , commercial P25, and TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 , the yields were 0.800, 0.050, and 0.180 mmol g A1 , respectively.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 stayed at 78.98 mmol g TiO 2 A1 (Fig. 5c), which was around 70 times higher than that of bare TiO 2Ax . The reactivity of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst in different time periods was revealed through detecting the amount of CO every other hour (Fig. 5e).No apparent CO was detected in the rst hour, illustrating this photocatalytic system needed an activation process for light excitation and adsorption equilibrium of the starting materials on the catalyst.Aer that, the yield of CO per hour almost increased at a constant speed in a linear fashion. The stability of a photocatalyst is vital to its practical and industrial application.The stability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was studied through ve-run cycling photocatalytic experiments (Fig. 5d).Aer 60 h visible-light irradiation, almost no obvious decrease was observed in CO generation, and the total production amount reached 12.30 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 204.96 mmol g TiO 2 . Aer catalysis, PXRD spectroscopies (Fig. S10 ) and UVvisible adsorption spectra (Fig. S11 ) of the sample were collected, which revealed there was little change in the structure of the catalyst and thus is demonstrated a reliable photostability.Furthermore, we also investigated the inuence of the amount of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst on the photocatalytic reactivity.When increasing the catalyst amount to 5, 10, or 30 mg, nearly the same catalytic activity to 1 mg was observed and their CO yields were close at 2.39, 2.35, 2.51 mmol g A1 .These results demonstrate that with the increase in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 amount, the high reactivity rate can still be maintained (Fig. S12 ). Control experiments were performed to elucidate the importance of the components in the photoreduction system.Through mechanically mixing C-TiO 2Ax (6 wt) with g-C 3 N 4 (entry 7), the yield was similar to bare g-C 3 N 4 .The signicant decreases implied that a loose contact is insufficient for the reduction of CO 2 .Without either C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 (entry 8) or light (entry 9), no gas was detected, which indicated that the other components cannot arouse CO 2 reduction, and thus again proved that the photogenerated charge pairs originated from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Once CO 2 gas was changed to Ar (entry 10), the generation of CO also stopped, therefore further excluding the source being from the degradation effects of organic species.In the absence of vapor (entry 7), the yield of CO dramatically decreased to 0.0997 mmol g A1 , implying vapor might be essential as an electron/proton donor. The performance of a photocatalytic system in CO 2 reduction is dictated by a balance between the thermodynamics and kinetics.A famous mechanism path is to rst convert CO 2 into CO 2 c A , which needs a high negative equilibrium potential of 1.9 V versus NHE. 38,39However, the photoinduced electrons in the conduction band edge of all semiconductors cannot provide enough driving force to carry out the one-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO 2 c A . 40,41Another mechanistic route is through protoncoupled electron transfer processes, which could bypass the formation of CO 2 c A .Through transferring the protons with electrons, the large activation barriers can be readily avoided. 42owever, the proton-participating route has a signicant kinetic dependence on the electron density on the surface of semiconductors catalysts.As discussed above, the initial H protons capture-speed of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 is 300 mmol g A1 min A1 , which is two orders of magnitude higher than the generation speed of CO (3.41 mmol g A1 min A1 ).The affluent protons accumulated on the surfaces of photocatalyst provide a guarantee for the successful reduction of CO 2 through the proton-coupled pathway. As for the other half reaction, the reactivity of water oxidation triggered by photogenerated holes has a considerable inuence on the efficiency of CO 2 reduction in H 2 O system.For water oxidation, the challenge lies mainly in the release of diatomic O 2 .The stepwise two-electron/two-step pathway is proposed as an optimum approach between thermodynamic and kinetic constraints for water oxidation. 9,16In our photocatalytic system, g-C 3 N 4 incorporated with amorphous carbon layers was designed to full the two-electron/two-step oxidation pathway.The oxidation product of O 2 around 1.22 mmol g A1 and negligible H 2 O 2 was detected in the catalytic system using C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst.Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments (Fig. S13 and S14 ) directly conrmed that the oxidation reaction undergoes a two-electron process. In photocatalysis, three universally accepted steps are involved: light harvesting, charge separation, and transportation to surface sites, thus triggering redox reactions. 43,44As for CO 2 reduction, two more steps should be taken into account, they are CO 2 and proton adsorption.CO 2 adsorption through interactions with surface atoms facilitates the formation of a partially charged species, which could lower the energy barrier and lead to increased reactivity.Proton participation could also conduct the reduction in a low-energy way. 45n CO 2 reduction with C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst, C-TiO 2Ax contributes most of the adsorbed photons, while g-C 3 N 4 could absorb the light before 450 nm.The ultrathin carbon layer serving as an electron reservoir takes an important role in accumulating the photoinduced electrons, therefore efficiently suppressing the recombination of the generated electronhole (e-h ) pairs.The ultrasmall size of C-TiO 2Ax supplies sufficient reductive sites.Owing to the slower recombination speed of electron-hole pairs of g-C 3 N 4 than that of C-TiO 2Ax , g-C 3 N 4 could supply photoexcited electrons to C-TiO 2Ax .The mesoporous structure of g-C 3 N 4 provides an appropriate accumulation space for CO 2 and H protons.Under the assistance of the carbon layer, g-C 3 N 4 becomes an active photocatalyst for water oxidation through an efficient two-electron/two-step pathway.The spatially separated reductive and oxidative sites could exclude the possibility of re-oxidation of the reduction products. Based on the above discussion, a possible catalytic mechanism for CO 2 reduction over C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is proposed (Fig. S15 ).First, CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2Ax spheres and unoccupied g-C 3 N 4 .Aer irradiation, charge separation occurs in g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax , producing the electron-hole pairs.The generated electrons transfer to the amorphous carbon and trigger the reductive reaction under the assistance of a H proton from water to produce CO, while the remaining holes on g-C 3 N 4 with the assistance of the carbon layers perform the oxidative reaction and generate O 2 via a twoelectron/two-step pathway."}, {"llm generation": "C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4", "source": "(III) further enhancement of the C-TiO 2Ax content (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4) led to a decrease in CO generation, which might result from the decreased CO 2 adsorption capacity.", "context": "Synthesis and structural analysis of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite For the synthesis of the targeted three-component photocatalyst, g-C 3 N 4 (ref.23) and Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 22,24 were rst prepared following the reported literature.Through one-pot pyrolyzing the mixtures of Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 and g-C 3 N 4 with different weight ratios under 350 C and an air atmosphere, the three-component composites of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 with different contents of C-TiO 2Ax were fabricated (Fig. 2).Bare C-TiO 2Ax was obtained by directly heating Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 under similar conditions.Their photographs are shown in Fig. 3g.As determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the corresponding TiO 2Ax content in the resultant C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites was respectively 1 wt, 4.5 wt, 6 wt, and 10 wt based on the Ti content and the samples were labeled as C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -1, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax , and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites (Fig. 3f) showed that the pure C-TiO 2Ax possessed similar patterns with anatase TiO 2 .C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites exhibited the characteristic PXRD peaks of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , with the intensity of the characteristic peaks of C-TiO 2Ax increasing with the enhancement of C-TiO 2Ax content (Fig. S1 ).SEM and TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite were taken to directly analyze its structure (Fig. 3a-d).As shown in the SEM image (Fig. 3a), the layered structure of g-C 3 N 4 was maintained in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mappings and the spectrum (Fig. 3b) of the selected area showed that the Ti and O elements were highly dispersed on the g-C 3 N 4 surface.TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in Fig. 3c reveal the size of TiO 2Ax nanoparticles were mainly distributed between 6 and 9 nm.Compared with the 590 nm particle size of TiO 2 in TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S2 ), which was synthesized by a traditional hydrothermal method, 13 the size of TiO 2Ax in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was reduced by two orders of magnitude.Therefore, employing polyoxotitanate as a Ti source could be an efficient and effective method to obtain ultrasmall TiO 2Ax nanoparticle-based composite materials.Highresolution TEM (HRTEM) was employed to identify the phase of the TiO 2Ax nanoparticles in the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite.As shown in Fig. 3d, the distance between the adjacent lattice planes was 0.35 nm along 101 direction, which is a typical lattice plane distance for anatase TiO 2 . 20The structure of the TiO 2Ax -coated amorphous carbon layer can be clearly observed from Fig. 3e.Furthermore, the carbon layer was the link connecting g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax nanoparticles.For the electron pool character of the carbon layer, such a structure will facilitate photoinduced electron transfer.In order to illuminate the source of amorphous carbon, an HRTEM image of bare C-TiO 2Ax was collected.A clear carbon coating around TiO 2Ax nanoparticles was found, which strongly excluded the possibility of the carbon source being from g-C 3 N 4 . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further employed to determine the atomic valence states and bonding environment in C-TiO 2Ax and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Fig. 3 shows the XPS of C-TiO 2Ax , in which the high-resolution spectra of Ti 2p located at 465.0, 464.2, 459.2, and 458.7 eV could be assigned to Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 3 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 , and Ti 3 2p 3/2 , respectively. 25he C 1s had three peaks at 284. Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 clusters may be the main source of amorphous carbon. The XPS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. S3, and the high-resolution XPS results of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p are exhibited in Fig. 4a-d Compared with C-TiO 2Ax , the peak of O-H group is shied a little, which should be attributed to the chemical environment change. 29The C 1s XPS spectrum exhibits anisomerous peaks with an obvious shoulder.Aer tting, ve peaks could be observed with the binding energies of 289.9, 288.6, 287.6, 286.0, and 284.6 eV.The peaks located at 287.6 and 286.0 eV are attributed to hybridized carbon atoms containing the C-(N) 3 and N-C-N group of g-C 3 N 4 , while the one at 284.6 eV is assigned to the C-C coordination, originating from adventitious carbon of the XPS instrument itself. 30The peak emerging at 288.6 eV is matched with the Ti-O-C.The le peak at 289.9 eV is 0.4 eV shied compared with the corresponding peak in pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S5 ), which might due to the formation of chemical bonds. 31The N 1s could be tted into four peaks, located at 403.8, 400.8, 399.6, and 398.2 eV.The peak at 398.2 eV is assigned to sp 2 -hybridized aromatic N bound to C atoms (C N-C), while the signal at the binding energy of 399.6 eV indicates tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 .The peaks at 400.8 and 403.8 eV are assigned to C-N-H groups and charging effects. 32 The N 2 adsorption behavior was measured to reveal the change in surface of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites.The adsorptiondesorption isotherms at 77 K (Fig. S6 ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 showed a gradual decrease in BET surface areas (S BET ) with values of 94.1, 87.2, and 77.8 m 2 g A1 , respectively, while the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 was relatively high (99.4,m 2 g A1 ).Compared with the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 , the decrease in composite materials accounted for the loading of C-TiO 2Ax , whereby with the increase in loading content, the decrement enhances.The CO 2 adsorption ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was also measured.As shown in Fig. 4e, the maximum CO 2 uptake at 273 K for C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 was 17.7, 15.9, and 9.2 cm 3 g A1 , respectively, which are different to that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (11.5 cm 3 g A1 ).In contrast to N 2 adsorption, the improvement in CO 2 adsorption of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2 and 3 probably comes from the increased interaction of C-TiO 2Ax with CO 2 molecules, while the decrease in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4 may be due to the sharply decreased surface area. As H protons have a signicant inuence on the CO 2 reduction activity, the H proton adsorption capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was studied with HCl as the H source.The H adsorption curve of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. 4f.It was found that at the initial 5 min, 1.5 mmol g A1 H was adsorbed by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , corresponding to 300 mmol g A1 min A1 .Aer 3 h, it reached saturated adsorption and the amount was 4.46 mmol g A1 , which is 2.8-fold higher than bare g-C 3 N 4 (1.55 mmol g A1 ).Such a high protons accumulation capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may signicantly boost the reductive performance of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 via the low-energy proton-coupled pathway. UV-Visible adsorption spectra can provide insightful information into the interactions of photocatalytic materials with photons of different energy.Fig. 3g shows the optical absorption spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax and their composite materials.Pure C-TiO 2Ax has strong absorption within the whole visible light, while bare g-C 3 N 4 was only able to absorb light with l m 450 nm.All C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites showed an obvious light absorption from 300 to 800 nm, and with increase in doping concentration of TiO 2Ax , the absorption intensity region from 460 to 800 nm was improved.Therefore, we could expect that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may exhibit an outstanding performance in visible-light photocatalysis. As for heterojunction semiconductor, the energy level of each component has a signicant inuence on the catalytic reactivity.The energy level of the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 was well studied in our former work 33 and the band gap was 2.73 eV, with the conduction band energy (E CB ) and the valence band energy (E VB ) at A0.75 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively, vs. a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).For our materials, E VB was determined from cyclic voltammograms (CV, Fig. S7 ) and E CB was calculated based on the optical band gap (E g ). 9 Using analyses and calculations based on Fig. S8, the E VB energy of C-TiO 2Ax was 1.63 eV.E g was estimated from the Tauc plot (Fig. S8 ), which was determined to be 2.18 eV.According to the formula E CB 14 E VB A E g , the E CB of C-TiO 2Ax was estimated to be A0.55 V.The energy levels of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were appropriate for reducing CO 2 to CO and water oxidation. Given that charge separation has a signicant effect on the redox reaction occurring at a photocatalyst surface, the transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax were collected. 34,35In Fig. 4g, the photocurrent value of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 can be seen to be rapidly elevated with the light turned on and then it gradually climbs up to the highest current level (up to 0.83 mA cm A2 ) during irradiation.When the irradiation was turned off, a sharp decrease emerged.This switch loop could be implemented repeatedly multiple times.A similar phenomenon occurred with pure C-TiO 2Ax and bare g-C 3 N 4 materials during on-off irradiation; however, the photocurrent densities of them were 4-fold and 2.5-fold lower than C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Additionally, the photocurrent value of pure TiO 2 was 2-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax , illuminating that the C doping plays a crucial role in facilitating the charge separation generated by TiO 2Ax . Under visible light irradiation, the EIS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 heterjunction, bare g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax and TiO 2 were measured.As shown in Fig. 4h, the charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was 47 U cm A2 , which was considerably lower than those of bare C-TiO 2Ax (108 U cm A2 ) and g-C 3 N 4 (82 U cm A2 ).These results indicate that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 composite performed a higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers and a relatively lower recombination rate of electron-hole pairs under visible light.Simultaneously, R ct of pure TiO 2 was 172 U cm A2 , which was 1.6-fold higher than C-TiO 2Ax .This further revealed that the carbon layer plays a positive role in promoting photoinduced charge separation. The CO 2 reduction experiment was performed following the photocatalytic condition using (Au, Cu)/TiO 2 as the catalyst reported by Neatu and co-worker, in which only light, CO 2 , and H 2 O were used in the system. 36Our experiment was carried out employing C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 as a photocatalyst under a visiblelight-driven system (l 420 nm) with CO 2 atmosphere and water vapor.As a control, the photocatalytic performances of bare g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were investigated.Fig. 5a shows that CO gas was generated as the main reductive reaction products aer 12 h irradiation.Clearly, pure C-TiO 2Ax showed around 0.575 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0252 mmol g A1 H 2 while bare g-C 3 N 4 presented 0.164 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0144 mmol g A1 H 2 (hydrogen production is shown in Fig. S9 ).Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , a higher photocatalytic activity was achieved by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites and the content of C-TiO 2Ax showed a considerable inuence on the photocatalytic activity: (I) the catalyst with 1 content of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -1) showed an obvious improvement in CO generation (up to 0.412 mmol g A1 ), while H 2 evolution was almost unchanged (0.0181 mmol g A1 ), (II) enhancing the amount of C-TiO 2Ax to 6 wt of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3) resulted in an evident enhancement in both yield and selectivity.CO generation was around 5 and 15 times higher than that of bare C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, keeping in 2.460 mmol g A1 , while the yield of H 2 was scarcely increased to about 0.0741 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 97 selectivity of CO.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 remained at 40.995 mmol g TiO 2 A1 , (III) further enhancement of the C-TiO 2Ax content (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4) led to a decrease in CO generation, which might result from the decreased CO 2 adsorption capacity.These results reveal that the combination of C-TiO 2Ax with g-C 3 N 4 led to a superior enhancement in both production and selectivity toward CO and showed that the optimal catalyst was C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3. To illuminate the source of generated CO, isotopic experiments were carried out using 13 CO 2 as the gas atmosphere 33 under similar photocatalytic conditions.As exhibited in Fig. 5g, peaks at 1.88 min and 13.08 min with m/z 29 and 45 were assigned to 13 CO and 13 CO 2 , respectively.No signal at m/z 28 This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018 was found (Fig. 5f).This information provided unambiguous evidence that the produced CO originated from the photoreduction of CO 2 rather than from the decomposition of any other organic species in the system. In order to further reveal the importance of the composite structure of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in CO 2 photoreduction, control experiments employing different TiO 2 -based composites as photocatalysts were carried out under similar conditions (Table 1).When using commercial P25 TiO 2 (entry 2) as the photocatalyst, around 0.0301 mmol g A1 CO was generated, which was about 20fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .When reducing TiO 2 to TiO 2Ax , the generation of CO was enhanced to 0.255 mmol g A1 (entry 3); however, this was still 2.3-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .These results implied the carbon layer played a positive part in TiO 2 in CO 2 reduction.With TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 4) as the catalyst, made from P25 and g-C 3 N 4 , the yield was higher than bare P25 but was 68 times lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Replacing P25 with titanium isopropoxide as the starting material, the resultant TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 5) exhibited a sharply increased reactivity, with up to 0.274 mmol g A1 CO generation.However, this reactivity was one order of magnitude lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.These results illuminated that the carbon layer and excellent light adsorption of TiO 2Ax play a pivotal role in the photocatalysis.Using black TiO 2 nanobelts-doped g-C 3 N 4 (ref.25) as the catalyst (entry 6), 0.535 mmol g A1 CO was produced, which was 4.6-fold lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, revealing a small size of nanoparticles was indispensable.Besides these TiO 2 -based catalysts, the CO generation rate of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was one order higher than most the reported TiO 2 -based catalysts and it outperformed any other reported TiO 2 -based material under similar conditions (Table S1 ). 25,37 further expose the photocatalytic ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , the CO 2 reduction reaction was performed under the irradiation of whole light (Fig. 5b).Under irradiation of 12 h, around 4.500 mmol g A1 CO was produced by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.The yields of C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 were 2.900 and 0.600 mmol g A1 , respectively.These results suggest that in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax may be responsible for the active CO 2 reductive site.For TiO 2Ax , commercial P25, and TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 , the yields were 0.800, 0.050, and 0.180 mmol g A1 , respectively.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 stayed at 78.98 mmol g TiO 2 A1 (Fig. 5c), which was around 70 times higher than that of bare TiO 2Ax . The reactivity of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst in different time periods was revealed through detecting the amount of CO every other hour (Fig. 5e).No apparent CO was detected in the rst hour, illustrating this photocatalytic system needed an activation process for light excitation and adsorption equilibrium of the starting materials on the catalyst.Aer that, the yield of CO per hour almost increased at a constant speed in a linear fashion. The stability of a photocatalyst is vital to its practical and industrial application.The stability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was studied through ve-run cycling photocatalytic experiments (Fig. 5d).Aer 60 h visible-light irradiation, almost no obvious decrease was observed in CO generation, and the total production amount reached 12.30 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 204.96 mmol g TiO 2 . Aer catalysis, PXRD spectroscopies (Fig. S10 ) and UVvisible adsorption spectra (Fig. S11 ) of the sample were collected, which revealed there was little change in the structure of the catalyst and thus is demonstrated a reliable photostability.Furthermore, we also investigated the inuence of the amount of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst on the photocatalytic reactivity.When increasing the catalyst amount to 5, 10, or 30 mg, nearly the same catalytic activity to 1 mg was observed and their CO yields were close at 2.39, 2.35, 2.51 mmol g A1 .These results demonstrate that with the increase in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 amount, the high reactivity rate can still be maintained (Fig. S12 ). Control experiments were performed to elucidate the importance of the components in the photoreduction system.Through mechanically mixing C-TiO 2Ax (6 wt) with g-C 3 N 4 (entry 7), the yield was similar to bare g-C 3 N 4 .The signicant decreases implied that a loose contact is insufficient for the reduction of CO 2 .Without either C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 (entry 8) or light (entry 9), no gas was detected, which indicated that the other components cannot arouse CO 2 reduction, and thus again proved that the photogenerated charge pairs originated from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Once CO 2 gas was changed to Ar (entry 10), the generation of CO also stopped, therefore further excluding the source being from the degradation effects of organic species.In the absence of vapor (entry 7), the yield of CO dramatically decreased to 0.0997 mmol g A1 , implying vapor might be essential as an electron/proton donor. The performance of a photocatalytic system in CO 2 reduction is dictated by a balance between the thermodynamics and kinetics.A famous mechanism path is to rst convert CO 2 into CO 2 c A , which needs a high negative equilibrium potential of 1.9 V versus NHE. 38,39However, the photoinduced electrons in the conduction band edge of all semiconductors cannot provide enough driving force to carry out the one-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO 2 c A . 40,41Another mechanistic route is through protoncoupled electron transfer processes, which could bypass the formation of CO 2 c A .Through transferring the protons with electrons, the large activation barriers can be readily avoided. 42owever, the proton-participating route has a signicant kinetic dependence on the electron density on the surface of semiconductors catalysts.As discussed above, the initial H protons capture-speed of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 is 300 mmol g A1 min A1 , which is two orders of magnitude higher than the generation speed of CO (3.41 mmol g A1 min A1 ).The affluent protons accumulated on the surfaces of photocatalyst provide a guarantee for the successful reduction of CO 2 through the proton-coupled pathway. As for the other half reaction, the reactivity of water oxidation triggered by photogenerated holes has a considerable inuence on the efficiency of CO 2 reduction in H 2 O system.For water oxidation, the challenge lies mainly in the release of diatomic O 2 .The stepwise two-electron/two-step pathway is proposed as an optimum approach between thermodynamic and kinetic constraints for water oxidation. 9,16In our photocatalytic system, g-C 3 N 4 incorporated with amorphous carbon layers was designed to full the two-electron/two-step oxidation pathway.The oxidation product of O 2 around 1.22 mmol g A1 and negligible H 2 O 2 was detected in the catalytic system using C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst.Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments (Fig. S13 and S14 ) directly conrmed that the oxidation reaction undergoes a two-electron process. In photocatalysis, three universally accepted steps are involved: light harvesting, charge separation, and transportation to surface sites, thus triggering redox reactions. 43,44As for CO 2 reduction, two more steps should be taken into account, they are CO 2 and proton adsorption.CO 2 adsorption through interactions with surface atoms facilitates the formation of a partially charged species, which could lower the energy barrier and lead to increased reactivity.Proton participation could also conduct the reduction in a low-energy way. 45n CO 2 reduction with C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst, C-TiO 2Ax contributes most of the adsorbed photons, while g-C 3 N 4 could absorb the light before 450 nm.The ultrathin carbon layer serving as an electron reservoir takes an important role in accumulating the photoinduced electrons, therefore efficiently suppressing the recombination of the generated electronhole (e-h ) pairs.The ultrasmall size of C-TiO 2Ax supplies sufficient reductive sites.Owing to the slower recombination speed of electron-hole pairs of g-C 3 N 4 than that of C-TiO 2Ax , g-C 3 N 4 could supply photoexcited electrons to C-TiO 2Ax .The mesoporous structure of g-C 3 N 4 provides an appropriate accumulation space for CO 2 and H protons.Under the assistance of the carbon layer, g-C 3 N 4 becomes an active photocatalyst for water oxidation through an efficient two-electron/two-step pathway.The spatially separated reductive and oxidative sites could exclude the possibility of re-oxidation of the reduction products. Based on the above discussion, a possible catalytic mechanism for CO 2 reduction over C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is proposed (Fig. S15 ).First, CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2Ax spheres and unoccupied g-C 3 N 4 .Aer irradiation, charge separation occurs in g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax , producing the electron-hole pairs.The generated electrons transfer to the amorphous carbon and trigger the reductive reaction under the assistance of a H proton from water to produce CO, while the remaining holes on g-C 3 N 4 with the assistance of the carbon layers perform the oxidative reaction and generate O 2 via a twoelectron/two-step pathway."}, {"llm generation": "P25 TiO 2", "source": "When using commercial P25 TiO 2 (entry 2) as the photocatalyst, around 0.0301 mmol g A1 CO was generated, which was about 20fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .", "context": "Synthesis and structural analysis of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite For the synthesis of the targeted three-component photocatalyst, g-C 3 N 4 (ref.23) and Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 22,24 were rst prepared following the reported literature.Through one-pot pyrolyzing the mixtures of Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 and g-C 3 N 4 with different weight ratios under 350 C and an air atmosphere, the three-component composites of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 with different contents of C-TiO 2Ax were fabricated (Fig. 2).Bare C-TiO 2Ax was obtained by directly heating Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 under similar conditions.Their photographs are shown in Fig. 3g.As determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the corresponding TiO 2Ax content in the resultant C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites was respectively 1 wt, 4.5 wt, 6 wt, and 10 wt based on the Ti content and the samples were labeled as C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -1, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax , and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites (Fig. 3f) showed that the pure C-TiO 2Ax possessed similar patterns with anatase TiO 2 .C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites exhibited the characteristic PXRD peaks of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , with the intensity of the characteristic peaks of C-TiO 2Ax increasing with the enhancement of C-TiO 2Ax content (Fig. S1 ).SEM and TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite were taken to directly analyze its structure (Fig. 3a-d).As shown in the SEM image (Fig. 3a), the layered structure of g-C 3 N 4 was maintained in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mappings and the spectrum (Fig. 3b) of the selected area showed that the Ti and O elements were highly dispersed on the g-C 3 N 4 surface.TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in Fig. 3c reveal the size of TiO 2Ax nanoparticles were mainly distributed between 6 and 9 nm.Compared with the 590 nm particle size of TiO 2 in TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S2 ), which was synthesized by a traditional hydrothermal method, 13 the size of TiO 2Ax in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was reduced by two orders of magnitude.Therefore, employing polyoxotitanate as a Ti source could be an efficient and effective method to obtain ultrasmall TiO 2Ax nanoparticle-based composite materials.Highresolution TEM (HRTEM) was employed to identify the phase of the TiO 2Ax nanoparticles in the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite.As shown in Fig. 3d, the distance between the adjacent lattice planes was 0.35 nm along 101 direction, which is a typical lattice plane distance for anatase TiO 2 . 20The structure of the TiO 2Ax -coated amorphous carbon layer can be clearly observed from Fig. 3e.Furthermore, the carbon layer was the link connecting g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax nanoparticles.For the electron pool character of the carbon layer, such a structure will facilitate photoinduced electron transfer.In order to illuminate the source of amorphous carbon, an HRTEM image of bare C-TiO 2Ax was collected.A clear carbon coating around TiO 2Ax nanoparticles was found, which strongly excluded the possibility of the carbon source being from g-C 3 N 4 . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further employed to determine the atomic valence states and bonding environment in C-TiO 2Ax and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Fig. 3 shows the XPS of C-TiO 2Ax , in which the high-resolution spectra of Ti 2p located at 465.0, 464.2, 459.2, and 458.7 eV could be assigned to Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 3 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 , and Ti 3 2p 3/2 , respectively. 25he C 1s had three peaks at 284. Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 clusters may be the main source of amorphous carbon. The XPS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. S3, and the high-resolution XPS results of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p are exhibited in Fig. 4a-d Compared with C-TiO 2Ax , the peak of O-H group is shied a little, which should be attributed to the chemical environment change. 29The C 1s XPS spectrum exhibits anisomerous peaks with an obvious shoulder.Aer tting, ve peaks could be observed with the binding energies of 289.9, 288.6, 287.6, 286.0, and 284.6 eV.The peaks located at 287.6 and 286.0 eV are attributed to hybridized carbon atoms containing the C-(N) 3 and N-C-N group of g-C 3 N 4 , while the one at 284.6 eV is assigned to the C-C coordination, originating from adventitious carbon of the XPS instrument itself. 30The peak emerging at 288.6 eV is matched with the Ti-O-C.The le peak at 289.9 eV is 0.4 eV shied compared with the corresponding peak in pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S5 ), which might due to the formation of chemical bonds. 31The N 1s could be tted into four peaks, located at 403.8, 400.8, 399.6, and 398.2 eV.The peak at 398.2 eV is assigned to sp 2 -hybridized aromatic N bound to C atoms (C N-C), while the signal at the binding energy of 399.6 eV indicates tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 .The peaks at 400.8 and 403.8 eV are assigned to C-N-H groups and charging effects. 32 The N 2 adsorption behavior was measured to reveal the change in surface of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites.The adsorptiondesorption isotherms at 77 K (Fig. S6 ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 showed a gradual decrease in BET surface areas (S BET ) with values of 94.1, 87.2, and 77.8 m 2 g A1 , respectively, while the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 was relatively high (99.4,m 2 g A1 ).Compared with the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 , the decrease in composite materials accounted for the loading of C-TiO 2Ax , whereby with the increase in loading content, the decrement enhances.The CO 2 adsorption ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was also measured.As shown in Fig. 4e, the maximum CO 2 uptake at 273 K for C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 was 17.7, 15.9, and 9.2 cm 3 g A1 , respectively, which are different to that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (11.5 cm 3 g A1 ).In contrast to N 2 adsorption, the improvement in CO 2 adsorption of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2 and 3 probably comes from the increased interaction of C-TiO 2Ax with CO 2 molecules, while the decrease in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4 may be due to the sharply decreased surface area. As H protons have a signicant inuence on the CO 2 reduction activity, the H proton adsorption capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was studied with HCl as the H source.The H adsorption curve of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. 4f.It was found that at the initial 5 min, 1.5 mmol g A1 H was adsorbed by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , corresponding to 300 mmol g A1 min A1 .Aer 3 h, it reached saturated adsorption and the amount was 4.46 mmol g A1 , which is 2.8-fold higher than bare g-C 3 N 4 (1.55 mmol g A1 ).Such a high protons accumulation capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may signicantly boost the reductive performance of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 via the low-energy proton-coupled pathway. UV-Visible adsorption spectra can provide insightful information into the interactions of photocatalytic materials with photons of different energy.Fig. 3g shows the optical absorption spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax and their composite materials.Pure C-TiO 2Ax has strong absorption within the whole visible light, while bare g-C 3 N 4 was only able to absorb light with l m 450 nm.All C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites showed an obvious light absorption from 300 to 800 nm, and with increase in doping concentration of TiO 2Ax , the absorption intensity region from 460 to 800 nm was improved.Therefore, we could expect that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may exhibit an outstanding performance in visible-light photocatalysis. As for heterojunction semiconductor, the energy level of each component has a signicant inuence on the catalytic reactivity.The energy level of the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 was well studied in our former work 33 and the band gap was 2.73 eV, with the conduction band energy (E CB ) and the valence band energy (E VB ) at A0.75 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively, vs. a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).For our materials, E VB was determined from cyclic voltammograms (CV, Fig. S7 ) and E CB was calculated based on the optical band gap (E g ). 9 Using analyses and calculations based on Fig. S8, the E VB energy of C-TiO 2Ax was 1.63 eV.E g was estimated from the Tauc plot (Fig. S8 ), which was determined to be 2.18 eV.According to the formula E CB 14 E VB A E g , the E CB of C-TiO 2Ax was estimated to be A0.55 V.The energy levels of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were appropriate for reducing CO 2 to CO and water oxidation. Given that charge separation has a signicant effect on the redox reaction occurring at a photocatalyst surface, the transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax were collected. 34,35In Fig. 4g, the photocurrent value of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 can be seen to be rapidly elevated with the light turned on and then it gradually climbs up to the highest current level (up to 0.83 mA cm A2 ) during irradiation.When the irradiation was turned off, a sharp decrease emerged.This switch loop could be implemented repeatedly multiple times.A similar phenomenon occurred with pure C-TiO 2Ax and bare g-C 3 N 4 materials during on-off irradiation; however, the photocurrent densities of them were 4-fold and 2.5-fold lower than C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Additionally, the photocurrent value of pure TiO 2 was 2-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax , illuminating that the C doping plays a crucial role in facilitating the charge separation generated by TiO 2Ax . Under visible light irradiation, the EIS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 heterjunction, bare g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax and TiO 2 were measured.As shown in Fig. 4h, the charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was 47 U cm A2 , which was considerably lower than those of bare C-TiO 2Ax (108 U cm A2 ) and g-C 3 N 4 (82 U cm A2 ).These results indicate that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 composite performed a higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers and a relatively lower recombination rate of electron-hole pairs under visible light.Simultaneously, R ct of pure TiO 2 was 172 U cm A2 , which was 1.6-fold higher than C-TiO 2Ax .This further revealed that the carbon layer plays a positive role in promoting photoinduced charge separation. The CO 2 reduction experiment was performed following the photocatalytic condition using (Au, Cu)/TiO 2 as the catalyst reported by Neatu and co-worker, in which only light, CO 2 , and H 2 O were used in the system. 36Our experiment was carried out employing C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 as a photocatalyst under a visiblelight-driven system (l 420 nm) with CO 2 atmosphere and water vapor.As a control, the photocatalytic performances of bare g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were investigated.Fig. 5a shows that CO gas was generated as the main reductive reaction products aer 12 h irradiation.Clearly, pure C-TiO 2Ax showed around 0.575 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0252 mmol g A1 H 2 while bare g-C 3 N 4 presented 0.164 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0144 mmol g A1 H 2 (hydrogen production is shown in Fig. S9 ).Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , a higher photocatalytic activity was achieved by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites and the content of C-TiO 2Ax showed a considerable inuence on the photocatalytic activity: (I) the catalyst with 1 content of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -1) showed an obvious improvement in CO generation (up to 0.412 mmol g A1 ), while H 2 evolution was almost unchanged (0.0181 mmol g A1 ), (II) enhancing the amount of C-TiO 2Ax to 6 wt of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3) resulted in an evident enhancement in both yield and selectivity.CO generation was around 5 and 15 times higher than that of bare C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, keeping in 2.460 mmol g A1 , while the yield of H 2 was scarcely increased to about 0.0741 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 97 selectivity of CO.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 remained at 40.995 mmol g TiO 2 A1 , (III) further enhancement of the C-TiO 2Ax content (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4) led to a decrease in CO generation, which might result from the decreased CO 2 adsorption capacity.These results reveal that the combination of C-TiO 2Ax with g-C 3 N 4 led to a superior enhancement in both production and selectivity toward CO and showed that the optimal catalyst was C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3. To illuminate the source of generated CO, isotopic experiments were carried out using 13 CO 2 as the gas atmosphere 33 under similar photocatalytic conditions.As exhibited in Fig. 5g, peaks at 1.88 min and 13.08 min with m/z 29 and 45 were assigned to 13 CO and 13 CO 2 , respectively.No signal at m/z 28 This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018 was found (Fig. 5f).This information provided unambiguous evidence that the produced CO originated from the photoreduction of CO 2 rather than from the decomposition of any other organic species in the system. In order to further reveal the importance of the composite structure of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in CO 2 photoreduction, control experiments employing different TiO 2 -based composites as photocatalysts were carried out under similar conditions (Table 1).When using commercial P25 TiO 2 (entry 2) as the photocatalyst, around 0.0301 mmol g A1 CO was generated, which was about 20fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .When reducing TiO 2 to TiO 2Ax , the generation of CO was enhanced to 0.255 mmol g A1 (entry 3); however, this was still 2.3-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .These results implied the carbon layer played a positive part in TiO 2 in CO 2 reduction.With TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 4) as the catalyst, made from P25 and g-C 3 N 4 , the yield was higher than bare P25 but was 68 times lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Replacing P25 with titanium isopropoxide as the starting material, the resultant TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 5) exhibited a sharply increased reactivity, with up to 0.274 mmol g A1 CO generation.However, this reactivity was one order of magnitude lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.These results illuminated that the carbon layer and excellent light adsorption of TiO 2Ax play a pivotal role in the photocatalysis.Using black TiO 2 nanobelts-doped g-C 3 N 4 (ref.25) as the catalyst (entry 6), 0.535 mmol g A1 CO was produced, which was 4.6-fold lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, revealing a small size of nanoparticles was indispensable.Besides these TiO 2 -based catalysts, the CO generation rate of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was one order higher than most the reported TiO 2 -based catalysts and it outperformed any other reported TiO 2 -based material under similar conditions (Table S1 ). 25,37 further expose the photocatalytic ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , the CO 2 reduction reaction was performed under the irradiation of whole light (Fig. 5b).Under irradiation of 12 h, around 4.500 mmol g A1 CO was produced by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.The yields of C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 were 2.900 and 0.600 mmol g A1 , respectively.These results suggest that in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax may be responsible for the active CO 2 reductive site.For TiO 2Ax , commercial P25, and TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 , the yields were 0.800, 0.050, and 0.180 mmol g A1 , respectively.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 stayed at 78.98 mmol g TiO 2 A1 (Fig. 5c), which was around 70 times higher than that of bare TiO 2Ax . The reactivity of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst in different time periods was revealed through detecting the amount of CO every other hour (Fig. 5e).No apparent CO was detected in the rst hour, illustrating this photocatalytic system needed an activation process for light excitation and adsorption equilibrium of the starting materials on the catalyst.Aer that, the yield of CO per hour almost increased at a constant speed in a linear fashion. The stability of a photocatalyst is vital to its practical and industrial application.The stability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was studied through ve-run cycling photocatalytic experiments (Fig. 5d).Aer 60 h visible-light irradiation, almost no obvious decrease was observed in CO generation, and the total production amount reached 12.30 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 204.96 mmol g TiO 2 . Aer catalysis, PXRD spectroscopies (Fig. S10 ) and UVvisible adsorption spectra (Fig. S11 ) of the sample were collected, which revealed there was little change in the structure of the catalyst and thus is demonstrated a reliable photostability.Furthermore, we also investigated the inuence of the amount of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst on the photocatalytic reactivity.When increasing the catalyst amount to 5, 10, or 30 mg, nearly the same catalytic activity to 1 mg was observed and their CO yields were close at 2.39, 2.35, 2.51 mmol g A1 .These results demonstrate that with the increase in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 amount, the high reactivity rate can still be maintained (Fig. S12 ). Control experiments were performed to elucidate the importance of the components in the photoreduction system.Through mechanically mixing C-TiO 2Ax (6 wt) with g-C 3 N 4 (entry 7), the yield was similar to bare g-C 3 N 4 .The signicant decreases implied that a loose contact is insufficient for the reduction of CO 2 .Without either C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 (entry 8) or light (entry 9), no gas was detected, which indicated that the other components cannot arouse CO 2 reduction, and thus again proved that the photogenerated charge pairs originated from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Once CO 2 gas was changed to Ar (entry 10), the generation of CO also stopped, therefore further excluding the source being from the degradation effects of organic species.In the absence of vapor (entry 7), the yield of CO dramatically decreased to 0.0997 mmol g A1 , implying vapor might be essential as an electron/proton donor. The performance of a photocatalytic system in CO 2 reduction is dictated by a balance between the thermodynamics and kinetics.A famous mechanism path is to rst convert CO 2 into CO 2 c A , which needs a high negative equilibrium potential of 1.9 V versus NHE. 38,39However, the photoinduced electrons in the conduction band edge of all semiconductors cannot provide enough driving force to carry out the one-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO 2 c A . 40,41Another mechanistic route is through protoncoupled electron transfer processes, which could bypass the formation of CO 2 c A .Through transferring the protons with electrons, the large activation barriers can be readily avoided. 42owever, the proton-participating route has a signicant kinetic dependence on the electron density on the surface of semiconductors catalysts.As discussed above, the initial H protons capture-speed of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 is 300 mmol g A1 min A1 , which is two orders of magnitude higher than the generation speed of CO (3.41 mmol g A1 min A1 ).The affluent protons accumulated on the surfaces of photocatalyst provide a guarantee for the successful reduction of CO 2 through the proton-coupled pathway. As for the other half reaction, the reactivity of water oxidation triggered by photogenerated holes has a considerable inuence on the efficiency of CO 2 reduction in H 2 O system.For water oxidation, the challenge lies mainly in the release of diatomic O 2 .The stepwise two-electron/two-step pathway is proposed as an optimum approach between thermodynamic and kinetic constraints for water oxidation. 9,16In our photocatalytic system, g-C 3 N 4 incorporated with amorphous carbon layers was designed to full the two-electron/two-step oxidation pathway.The oxidation product of O 2 around 1.22 mmol g A1 and negligible H 2 O 2 was detected in the catalytic system using C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst.Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments (Fig. S13 and S14 ) directly conrmed that the oxidation reaction undergoes a two-electron process. In photocatalysis, three universally accepted steps are involved: light harvesting, charge separation, and transportation to surface sites, thus triggering redox reactions. 43,44As for CO 2 reduction, two more steps should be taken into account, they are CO 2 and proton adsorption.CO 2 adsorption through interactions with surface atoms facilitates the formation of a partially charged species, which could lower the energy barrier and lead to increased reactivity.Proton participation could also conduct the reduction in a low-energy way. 45n CO 2 reduction with C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst, C-TiO 2Ax contributes most of the adsorbed photons, while g-C 3 N 4 could absorb the light before 450 nm.The ultrathin carbon layer serving as an electron reservoir takes an important role in accumulating the photoinduced electrons, therefore efficiently suppressing the recombination of the generated electronhole (e-h ) pairs.The ultrasmall size of C-TiO 2Ax supplies sufficient reductive sites.Owing to the slower recombination speed of electron-hole pairs of g-C 3 N 4 than that of C-TiO 2Ax , g-C 3 N 4 could supply photoexcited electrons to C-TiO 2Ax .The mesoporous structure of g-C 3 N 4 provides an appropriate accumulation space for CO 2 and H protons.Under the assistance of the carbon layer, g-C 3 N 4 becomes an active photocatalyst for water oxidation through an efficient two-electron/two-step pathway.The spatially separated reductive and oxidative sites could exclude the possibility of re-oxidation of the reduction products. Based on the above discussion, a possible catalytic mechanism for CO 2 reduction over C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is proposed (Fig. S15 ).First, CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2Ax spheres and unoccupied g-C 3 N 4 .Aer irradiation, charge separation occurs in g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax , producing the electron-hole pairs.The generated electrons transfer to the amorphous carbon and trigger the reductive reaction under the assistance of a H proton from water to produce CO, while the remaining holes on g-C 3 N 4 with the assistance of the carbon layers perform the oxidative reaction and generate O 2 via a twoelectron/two-step pathway."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4", "source": "With TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 4) as the catalyst, made from P25 and g-C 3 N 4 , the yield was higher than bare P25 but was 68 times lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.", "context": "Synthesis and structural analysis of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite For the synthesis of the targeted three-component photocatalyst, g-C 3 N 4 (ref.23) and Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 22,24 were rst prepared following the reported literature.Through one-pot pyrolyzing the mixtures of Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 and g-C 3 N 4 with different weight ratios under 350 C and an air atmosphere, the three-component composites of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 with different contents of C-TiO 2Ax were fabricated (Fig. 2).Bare C-TiO 2Ax was obtained by directly heating Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 under similar conditions.Their photographs are shown in Fig. 3g.As determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the corresponding TiO 2Ax content in the resultant C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites was respectively 1 wt, 4.5 wt, 6 wt, and 10 wt based on the Ti content and the samples were labeled as C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -1, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax , and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites (Fig. 3f) showed that the pure C-TiO 2Ax possessed similar patterns with anatase TiO 2 .C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites exhibited the characteristic PXRD peaks of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , with the intensity of the characteristic peaks of C-TiO 2Ax increasing with the enhancement of C-TiO 2Ax content (Fig. S1 ).SEM and TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite were taken to directly analyze its structure (Fig. 3a-d).As shown in the SEM image (Fig. 3a), the layered structure of g-C 3 N 4 was maintained in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mappings and the spectrum (Fig. 3b) of the selected area showed that the Ti and O elements were highly dispersed on the g-C 3 N 4 surface.TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in Fig. 3c reveal the size of TiO 2Ax nanoparticles were mainly distributed between 6 and 9 nm.Compared with the 590 nm particle size of TiO 2 in TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S2 ), which was synthesized by a traditional hydrothermal method, 13 the size of TiO 2Ax in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was reduced by two orders of magnitude.Therefore, employing polyoxotitanate as a Ti source could be an efficient and effective method to obtain ultrasmall TiO 2Ax nanoparticle-based composite materials.Highresolution TEM (HRTEM) was employed to identify the phase of the TiO 2Ax nanoparticles in the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite.As shown in Fig. 3d, the distance between the adjacent lattice planes was 0.35 nm along 101 direction, which is a typical lattice plane distance for anatase TiO 2 . 20The structure of the TiO 2Ax -coated amorphous carbon layer can be clearly observed from Fig. 3e.Furthermore, the carbon layer was the link connecting g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax nanoparticles.For the electron pool character of the carbon layer, such a structure will facilitate photoinduced electron transfer.In order to illuminate the source of amorphous carbon, an HRTEM image of bare C-TiO 2Ax was collected.A clear carbon coating around TiO 2Ax nanoparticles was found, which strongly excluded the possibility of the carbon source being from g-C 3 N 4 . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further employed to determine the atomic valence states and bonding environment in C-TiO 2Ax and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Fig. 3 shows the XPS of C-TiO 2Ax , in which the high-resolution spectra of Ti 2p located at 465.0, 464.2, 459.2, and 458.7 eV could be assigned to Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 3 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 , and Ti 3 2p 3/2 , respectively. 25he C 1s had three peaks at 284. Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 clusters may be the main source of amorphous carbon. The XPS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. S3, and the high-resolution XPS results of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p are exhibited in Fig. 4a-d Compared with C-TiO 2Ax , the peak of O-H group is shied a little, which should be attributed to the chemical environment change. 29The C 1s XPS spectrum exhibits anisomerous peaks with an obvious shoulder.Aer tting, ve peaks could be observed with the binding energies of 289.9, 288.6, 287.6, 286.0, and 284.6 eV.The peaks located at 287.6 and 286.0 eV are attributed to hybridized carbon atoms containing the C-(N) 3 and N-C-N group of g-C 3 N 4 , while the one at 284.6 eV is assigned to the C-C coordination, originating from adventitious carbon of the XPS instrument itself. 30The peak emerging at 288.6 eV is matched with the Ti-O-C.The le peak at 289.9 eV is 0.4 eV shied compared with the corresponding peak in pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S5 ), which might due to the formation of chemical bonds. 31The N 1s could be tted into four peaks, located at 403.8, 400.8, 399.6, and 398.2 eV.The peak at 398.2 eV is assigned to sp 2 -hybridized aromatic N bound to C atoms (C N-C), while the signal at the binding energy of 399.6 eV indicates tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 .The peaks at 400.8 and 403.8 eV are assigned to C-N-H groups and charging effects. 32 The N 2 adsorption behavior was measured to reveal the change in surface of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites.The adsorptiondesorption isotherms at 77 K (Fig. S6 ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 showed a gradual decrease in BET surface areas (S BET ) with values of 94.1, 87.2, and 77.8 m 2 g A1 , respectively, while the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 was relatively high (99.4,m 2 g A1 ).Compared with the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 , the decrease in composite materials accounted for the loading of C-TiO 2Ax , whereby with the increase in loading content, the decrement enhances.The CO 2 adsorption ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was also measured.As shown in Fig. 4e, the maximum CO 2 uptake at 273 K for C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 was 17.7, 15.9, and 9.2 cm 3 g A1 , respectively, which are different to that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (11.5 cm 3 g A1 ).In contrast to N 2 adsorption, the improvement in CO 2 adsorption of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2 and 3 probably comes from the increased interaction of C-TiO 2Ax with CO 2 molecules, while the decrease in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4 may be due to the sharply decreased surface area. As H protons have a signicant inuence on the CO 2 reduction activity, the H proton adsorption capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was studied with HCl as the H source.The H adsorption curve of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. 4f.It was found that at the initial 5 min, 1.5 mmol g A1 H was adsorbed by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , corresponding to 300 mmol g A1 min A1 .Aer 3 h, it reached saturated adsorption and the amount was 4.46 mmol g A1 , which is 2.8-fold higher than bare g-C 3 N 4 (1.55 mmol g A1 ).Such a high protons accumulation capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may signicantly boost the reductive performance of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 via the low-energy proton-coupled pathway. UV-Visible adsorption spectra can provide insightful information into the interactions of photocatalytic materials with photons of different energy.Fig. 3g shows the optical absorption spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax and their composite materials.Pure C-TiO 2Ax has strong absorption within the whole visible light, while bare g-C 3 N 4 was only able to absorb light with l m 450 nm.All C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites showed an obvious light absorption from 300 to 800 nm, and with increase in doping concentration of TiO 2Ax , the absorption intensity region from 460 to 800 nm was improved.Therefore, we could expect that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may exhibit an outstanding performance in visible-light photocatalysis. As for heterojunction semiconductor, the energy level of each component has a signicant inuence on the catalytic reactivity.The energy level of the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 was well studied in our former work 33 and the band gap was 2.73 eV, with the conduction band energy (E CB ) and the valence band energy (E VB ) at A0.75 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively, vs. a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).For our materials, E VB was determined from cyclic voltammograms (CV, Fig. S7 ) and E CB was calculated based on the optical band gap (E g ). 9 Using analyses and calculations based on Fig. S8, the E VB energy of C-TiO 2Ax was 1.63 eV.E g was estimated from the Tauc plot (Fig. S8 ), which was determined to be 2.18 eV.According to the formula E CB 14 E VB A E g , the E CB of C-TiO 2Ax was estimated to be A0.55 V.The energy levels of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were appropriate for reducing CO 2 to CO and water oxidation. Given that charge separation has a signicant effect on the redox reaction occurring at a photocatalyst surface, the transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax were collected. 34,35In Fig. 4g, the photocurrent value of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 can be seen to be rapidly elevated with the light turned on and then it gradually climbs up to the highest current level (up to 0.83 mA cm A2 ) during irradiation.When the irradiation was turned off, a sharp decrease emerged.This switch loop could be implemented repeatedly multiple times.A similar phenomenon occurred with pure C-TiO 2Ax and bare g-C 3 N 4 materials during on-off irradiation; however, the photocurrent densities of them were 4-fold and 2.5-fold lower than C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Additionally, the photocurrent value of pure TiO 2 was 2-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax , illuminating that the C doping plays a crucial role in facilitating the charge separation generated by TiO 2Ax . Under visible light irradiation, the EIS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 heterjunction, bare g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax and TiO 2 were measured.As shown in Fig. 4h, the charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was 47 U cm A2 , which was considerably lower than those of bare C-TiO 2Ax (108 U cm A2 ) and g-C 3 N 4 (82 U cm A2 ).These results indicate that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 composite performed a higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers and a relatively lower recombination rate of electron-hole pairs under visible light.Simultaneously, R ct of pure TiO 2 was 172 U cm A2 , which was 1.6-fold higher than C-TiO 2Ax .This further revealed that the carbon layer plays a positive role in promoting photoinduced charge separation. The CO 2 reduction experiment was performed following the photocatalytic condition using (Au, Cu)/TiO 2 as the catalyst reported by Neatu and co-worker, in which only light, CO 2 , and H 2 O were used in the system. 36Our experiment was carried out employing C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 as a photocatalyst under a visiblelight-driven system (l 420 nm) with CO 2 atmosphere and water vapor.As a control, the photocatalytic performances of bare g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were investigated.Fig. 5a shows that CO gas was generated as the main reductive reaction products aer 12 h irradiation.Clearly, pure C-TiO 2Ax showed around 0.575 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0252 mmol g A1 H 2 while bare g-C 3 N 4 presented 0.164 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0144 mmol g A1 H 2 (hydrogen production is shown in Fig. S9 ).Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , a higher photocatalytic activity was achieved by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites and the content of C-TiO 2Ax showed a considerable inuence on the photocatalytic activity: (I) the catalyst with 1 content of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -1) showed an obvious improvement in CO generation (up to 0.412 mmol g A1 ), while H 2 evolution was almost unchanged (0.0181 mmol g A1 ), (II) enhancing the amount of C-TiO 2Ax to 6 wt of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3) resulted in an evident enhancement in both yield and selectivity.CO generation was around 5 and 15 times higher than that of bare C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, keeping in 2.460 mmol g A1 , while the yield of H 2 was scarcely increased to about 0.0741 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 97 selectivity of CO.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 remained at 40.995 mmol g TiO 2 A1 , (III) further enhancement of the C-TiO 2Ax content (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4) led to a decrease in CO generation, which might result from the decreased CO 2 adsorption capacity.These results reveal that the combination of C-TiO 2Ax with g-C 3 N 4 led to a superior enhancement in both production and selectivity toward CO and showed that the optimal catalyst was C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3. To illuminate the source of generated CO, isotopic experiments were carried out using 13 CO 2 as the gas atmosphere 33 under similar photocatalytic conditions.As exhibited in Fig. 5g, peaks at 1.88 min and 13.08 min with m/z 29 and 45 were assigned to 13 CO and 13 CO 2 , respectively.No signal at m/z 28 This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018 was found (Fig. 5f).This information provided unambiguous evidence that the produced CO originated from the photoreduction of CO 2 rather than from the decomposition of any other organic species in the system. In order to further reveal the importance of the composite structure of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in CO 2 photoreduction, control experiments employing different TiO 2 -based composites as photocatalysts were carried out under similar conditions (Table 1).When using commercial P25 TiO 2 (entry 2) as the photocatalyst, around 0.0301 mmol g A1 CO was generated, which was about 20fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .When reducing TiO 2 to TiO 2Ax , the generation of CO was enhanced to 0.255 mmol g A1 (entry 3); however, this was still 2.3-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .These results implied the carbon layer played a positive part in TiO 2 in CO 2 reduction.With TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 4) as the catalyst, made from P25 and g-C 3 N 4 , the yield was higher than bare P25 but was 68 times lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Replacing P25 with titanium isopropoxide as the starting material, the resultant TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 5) exhibited a sharply increased reactivity, with up to 0.274 mmol g A1 CO generation.However, this reactivity was one order of magnitude lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.These results illuminated that the carbon layer and excellent light adsorption of TiO 2Ax play a pivotal role in the photocatalysis.Using black TiO 2 nanobelts-doped g-C 3 N 4 (ref.25) as the catalyst (entry 6), 0.535 mmol g A1 CO was produced, which was 4.6-fold lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, revealing a small size of nanoparticles was indispensable.Besides these TiO 2 -based catalysts, the CO generation rate of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was one order higher than most the reported TiO 2 -based catalysts and it outperformed any other reported TiO 2 -based material under similar conditions (Table S1 ). 25,37 further expose the photocatalytic ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , the CO 2 reduction reaction was performed under the irradiation of whole light (Fig. 5b).Under irradiation of 12 h, around 4.500 mmol g A1 CO was produced by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.The yields of C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 were 2.900 and 0.600 mmol g A1 , respectively.These results suggest that in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax may be responsible for the active CO 2 reductive site.For TiO 2Ax , commercial P25, and TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 , the yields were 0.800, 0.050, and 0.180 mmol g A1 , respectively.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 stayed at 78.98 mmol g TiO 2 A1 (Fig. 5c), which was around 70 times higher than that of bare TiO 2Ax . The reactivity of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst in different time periods was revealed through detecting the amount of CO every other hour (Fig. 5e).No apparent CO was detected in the rst hour, illustrating this photocatalytic system needed an activation process for light excitation and adsorption equilibrium of the starting materials on the catalyst.Aer that, the yield of CO per hour almost increased at a constant speed in a linear fashion. The stability of a photocatalyst is vital to its practical and industrial application.The stability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was studied through ve-run cycling photocatalytic experiments (Fig. 5d).Aer 60 h visible-light irradiation, almost no obvious decrease was observed in CO generation, and the total production amount reached 12.30 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 204.96 mmol g TiO 2 . Aer catalysis, PXRD spectroscopies (Fig. S10 ) and UVvisible adsorption spectra (Fig. S11 ) of the sample were collected, which revealed there was little change in the structure of the catalyst and thus is demonstrated a reliable photostability.Furthermore, we also investigated the inuence of the amount of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst on the photocatalytic reactivity.When increasing the catalyst amount to 5, 10, or 30 mg, nearly the same catalytic activity to 1 mg was observed and their CO yields were close at 2.39, 2.35, 2.51 mmol g A1 .These results demonstrate that with the increase in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 amount, the high reactivity rate can still be maintained (Fig. S12 ). Control experiments were performed to elucidate the importance of the components in the photoreduction system.Through mechanically mixing C-TiO 2Ax (6 wt) with g-C 3 N 4 (entry 7), the yield was similar to bare g-C 3 N 4 .The signicant decreases implied that a loose contact is insufficient for the reduction of CO 2 .Without either C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 (entry 8) or light (entry 9), no gas was detected, which indicated that the other components cannot arouse CO 2 reduction, and thus again proved that the photogenerated charge pairs originated from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Once CO 2 gas was changed to Ar (entry 10), the generation of CO also stopped, therefore further excluding the source being from the degradation effects of organic species.In the absence of vapor (entry 7), the yield of CO dramatically decreased to 0.0997 mmol g A1 , implying vapor might be essential as an electron/proton donor. The performance of a photocatalytic system in CO 2 reduction is dictated by a balance between the thermodynamics and kinetics.A famous mechanism path is to rst convert CO 2 into CO 2 c A , which needs a high negative equilibrium potential of 1.9 V versus NHE. 38,39However, the photoinduced electrons in the conduction band edge of all semiconductors cannot provide enough driving force to carry out the one-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO 2 c A . 40,41Another mechanistic route is through protoncoupled electron transfer processes, which could bypass the formation of CO 2 c A .Through transferring the protons with electrons, the large activation barriers can be readily avoided. 42owever, the proton-participating route has a signicant kinetic dependence on the electron density on the surface of semiconductors catalysts.As discussed above, the initial H protons capture-speed of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 is 300 mmol g A1 min A1 , which is two orders of magnitude higher than the generation speed of CO (3.41 mmol g A1 min A1 ).The affluent protons accumulated on the surfaces of photocatalyst provide a guarantee for the successful reduction of CO 2 through the proton-coupled pathway. As for the other half reaction, the reactivity of water oxidation triggered by photogenerated holes has a considerable inuence on the efficiency of CO 2 reduction in H 2 O system.For water oxidation, the challenge lies mainly in the release of diatomic O 2 .The stepwise two-electron/two-step pathway is proposed as an optimum approach between thermodynamic and kinetic constraints for water oxidation. 9,16In our photocatalytic system, g-C 3 N 4 incorporated with amorphous carbon layers was designed to full the two-electron/two-step oxidation pathway.The oxidation product of O 2 around 1.22 mmol g A1 and negligible H 2 O 2 was detected in the catalytic system using C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst.Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments (Fig. S13 and S14 ) directly conrmed that the oxidation reaction undergoes a two-electron process. In photocatalysis, three universally accepted steps are involved: light harvesting, charge separation, and transportation to surface sites, thus triggering redox reactions. 43,44As for CO 2 reduction, two more steps should be taken into account, they are CO 2 and proton adsorption.CO 2 adsorption through interactions with surface atoms facilitates the formation of a partially charged species, which could lower the energy barrier and lead to increased reactivity.Proton participation could also conduct the reduction in a low-energy way. 45n CO 2 reduction with C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst, C-TiO 2Ax contributes most of the adsorbed photons, while g-C 3 N 4 could absorb the light before 450 nm.The ultrathin carbon layer serving as an electron reservoir takes an important role in accumulating the photoinduced electrons, therefore efficiently suppressing the recombination of the generated electronhole (e-h ) pairs.The ultrasmall size of C-TiO 2Ax supplies sufficient reductive sites.Owing to the slower recombination speed of electron-hole pairs of g-C 3 N 4 than that of C-TiO 2Ax , g-C 3 N 4 could supply photoexcited electrons to C-TiO 2Ax .The mesoporous structure of g-C 3 N 4 provides an appropriate accumulation space for CO 2 and H protons.Under the assistance of the carbon layer, g-C 3 N 4 becomes an active photocatalyst for water oxidation through an efficient two-electron/two-step pathway.The spatially separated reductive and oxidative sites could exclude the possibility of re-oxidation of the reduction products. Based on the above discussion, a possible catalytic mechanism for CO 2 reduction over C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is proposed (Fig. S15 ).First, CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2Ax spheres and unoccupied g-C 3 N 4 .Aer irradiation, charge separation occurs in g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax , producing the electron-hole pairs.The generated electrons transfer to the amorphous carbon and trigger the reductive reaction under the assistance of a H proton from water to produce CO, while the remaining holes on g-C 3 N 4 with the assistance of the carbon layers perform the oxidative reaction and generate O 2 via a twoelectron/two-step pathway."}, {"llm generation": "black TiO 2 nanobelts-doped g-C 3 N 4", "source": "Using black TiO 2 nanobelts-doped g-C 3 N 4 (ref.25) as the catalyst (entry 6), 0.535 mmol g A1 CO was produced, which was 4.6-fold lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, revealing a small size of nanoparticles was indispensable.", "context": "Synthesis and structural analysis of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite For the synthesis of the targeted three-component photocatalyst, g-C 3 N 4 (ref.23) and Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 22,24 were rst prepared following the reported literature.Through one-pot pyrolyzing the mixtures of Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 and g-C 3 N 4 with different weight ratios under 350 C and an air atmosphere, the three-component composites of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 with different contents of C-TiO 2Ax were fabricated (Fig. 2).Bare C-TiO 2Ax was obtained by directly heating Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 under similar conditions.Their photographs are shown in Fig. 3g.As determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the corresponding TiO 2Ax content in the resultant C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites was respectively 1 wt, 4.5 wt, 6 wt, and 10 wt based on the Ti content and the samples were labeled as C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -1, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax , and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites (Fig. 3f) showed that the pure C-TiO 2Ax possessed similar patterns with anatase TiO 2 .C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites exhibited the characteristic PXRD peaks of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , with the intensity of the characteristic peaks of C-TiO 2Ax increasing with the enhancement of C-TiO 2Ax content (Fig. S1 ).SEM and TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite were taken to directly analyze its structure (Fig. 3a-d).As shown in the SEM image (Fig. 3a), the layered structure of g-C 3 N 4 was maintained in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mappings and the spectrum (Fig. 3b) of the selected area showed that the Ti and O elements were highly dispersed on the g-C 3 N 4 surface.TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in Fig. 3c reveal the size of TiO 2Ax nanoparticles were mainly distributed between 6 and 9 nm.Compared with the 590 nm particle size of TiO 2 in TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S2 ), which was synthesized by a traditional hydrothermal method, 13 the size of TiO 2Ax in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was reduced by two orders of magnitude.Therefore, employing polyoxotitanate as a Ti source could be an efficient and effective method to obtain ultrasmall TiO 2Ax nanoparticle-based composite materials.Highresolution TEM (HRTEM) was employed to identify the phase of the TiO 2Ax nanoparticles in the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite.As shown in Fig. 3d, the distance between the adjacent lattice planes was 0.35 nm along 101 direction, which is a typical lattice plane distance for anatase TiO 2 . 20The structure of the TiO 2Ax -coated amorphous carbon layer can be clearly observed from Fig. 3e.Furthermore, the carbon layer was the link connecting g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax nanoparticles.For the electron pool character of the carbon layer, such a structure will facilitate photoinduced electron transfer.In order to illuminate the source of amorphous carbon, an HRTEM image of bare C-TiO 2Ax was collected.A clear carbon coating around TiO 2Ax nanoparticles was found, which strongly excluded the possibility of the carbon source being from g-C 3 N 4 . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further employed to determine the atomic valence states and bonding environment in C-TiO 2Ax and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Fig. 3 shows the XPS of C-TiO 2Ax , in which the high-resolution spectra of Ti 2p located at 465.0, 464.2, 459.2, and 458.7 eV could be assigned to Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 3 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 , and Ti 3 2p 3/2 , respectively. 25he C 1s had three peaks at 284. Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 clusters may be the main source of amorphous carbon. The XPS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. S3, and the high-resolution XPS results of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p are exhibited in Fig. 4a-d Compared with C-TiO 2Ax , the peak of O-H group is shied a little, which should be attributed to the chemical environment change. 29The C 1s XPS spectrum exhibits anisomerous peaks with an obvious shoulder.Aer tting, ve peaks could be observed with the binding energies of 289.9, 288.6, 287.6, 286.0, and 284.6 eV.The peaks located at 287.6 and 286.0 eV are attributed to hybridized carbon atoms containing the C-(N) 3 and N-C-N group of g-C 3 N 4 , while the one at 284.6 eV is assigned to the C-C coordination, originating from adventitious carbon of the XPS instrument itself. 30The peak emerging at 288.6 eV is matched with the Ti-O-C.The le peak at 289.9 eV is 0.4 eV shied compared with the corresponding peak in pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S5 ), which might due to the formation of chemical bonds. 31The N 1s could be tted into four peaks, located at 403.8, 400.8, 399.6, and 398.2 eV.The peak at 398.2 eV is assigned to sp 2 -hybridized aromatic N bound to C atoms (C N-C), while the signal at the binding energy of 399.6 eV indicates tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 .The peaks at 400.8 and 403.8 eV are assigned to C-N-H groups and charging effects. 32 The N 2 adsorption behavior was measured to reveal the change in surface of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites.The adsorptiondesorption isotherms at 77 K (Fig. S6 ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 showed a gradual decrease in BET surface areas (S BET ) with values of 94.1, 87.2, and 77.8 m 2 g A1 , respectively, while the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 was relatively high (99.4,m 2 g A1 ).Compared with the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 , the decrease in composite materials accounted for the loading of C-TiO 2Ax , whereby with the increase in loading content, the decrement enhances.The CO 2 adsorption ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was also measured.As shown in Fig. 4e, the maximum CO 2 uptake at 273 K for C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 was 17.7, 15.9, and 9.2 cm 3 g A1 , respectively, which are different to that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (11.5 cm 3 g A1 ).In contrast to N 2 adsorption, the improvement in CO 2 adsorption of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2 and 3 probably comes from the increased interaction of C-TiO 2Ax with CO 2 molecules, while the decrease in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4 may be due to the sharply decreased surface area. As H protons have a signicant inuence on the CO 2 reduction activity, the H proton adsorption capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was studied with HCl as the H source.The H adsorption curve of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. 4f.It was found that at the initial 5 min, 1.5 mmol g A1 H was adsorbed by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , corresponding to 300 mmol g A1 min A1 .Aer 3 h, it reached saturated adsorption and the amount was 4.46 mmol g A1 , which is 2.8-fold higher than bare g-C 3 N 4 (1.55 mmol g A1 ).Such a high protons accumulation capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may signicantly boost the reductive performance of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 via the low-energy proton-coupled pathway. UV-Visible adsorption spectra can provide insightful information into the interactions of photocatalytic materials with photons of different energy.Fig. 3g shows the optical absorption spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax and their composite materials.Pure C-TiO 2Ax has strong absorption within the whole visible light, while bare g-C 3 N 4 was only able to absorb light with l m 450 nm.All C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites showed an obvious light absorption from 300 to 800 nm, and with increase in doping concentration of TiO 2Ax , the absorption intensity region from 460 to 800 nm was improved.Therefore, we could expect that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may exhibit an outstanding performance in visible-light photocatalysis. As for heterojunction semiconductor, the energy level of each component has a signicant inuence on the catalytic reactivity.The energy level of the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 was well studied in our former work 33 and the band gap was 2.73 eV, with the conduction band energy (E CB ) and the valence band energy (E VB ) at A0.75 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively, vs. a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).For our materials, E VB was determined from cyclic voltammograms (CV, Fig. S7 ) and E CB was calculated based on the optical band gap (E g ). 9 Using analyses and calculations based on Fig. S8, the E VB energy of C-TiO 2Ax was 1.63 eV.E g was estimated from the Tauc plot (Fig. S8 ), which was determined to be 2.18 eV.According to the formula E CB 14 E VB A E g , the E CB of C-TiO 2Ax was estimated to be A0.55 V.The energy levels of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were appropriate for reducing CO 2 to CO and water oxidation. Given that charge separation has a signicant effect on the redox reaction occurring at a photocatalyst surface, the transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax were collected. 34,35In Fig. 4g, the photocurrent value of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 can be seen to be rapidly elevated with the light turned on and then it gradually climbs up to the highest current level (up to 0.83 mA cm A2 ) during irradiation.When the irradiation was turned off, a sharp decrease emerged.This switch loop could be implemented repeatedly multiple times.A similar phenomenon occurred with pure C-TiO 2Ax and bare g-C 3 N 4 materials during on-off irradiation; however, the photocurrent densities of them were 4-fold and 2.5-fold lower than C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Additionally, the photocurrent value of pure TiO 2 was 2-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax , illuminating that the C doping plays a crucial role in facilitating the charge separation generated by TiO 2Ax . Under visible light irradiation, the EIS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 heterjunction, bare g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax and TiO 2 were measured.As shown in Fig. 4h, the charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was 47 U cm A2 , which was considerably lower than those of bare C-TiO 2Ax (108 U cm A2 ) and g-C 3 N 4 (82 U cm A2 ).These results indicate that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 composite performed a higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers and a relatively lower recombination rate of electron-hole pairs under visible light.Simultaneously, R ct of pure TiO 2 was 172 U cm A2 , which was 1.6-fold higher than C-TiO 2Ax .This further revealed that the carbon layer plays a positive role in promoting photoinduced charge separation. The CO 2 reduction experiment was performed following the photocatalytic condition using (Au, Cu)/TiO 2 as the catalyst reported by Neatu and co-worker, in which only light, CO 2 , and H 2 O were used in the system. 36Our experiment was carried out employing C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 as a photocatalyst under a visiblelight-driven system (l 420 nm) with CO 2 atmosphere and water vapor.As a control, the photocatalytic performances of bare g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were investigated.Fig. 5a shows that CO gas was generated as the main reductive reaction products aer 12 h irradiation.Clearly, pure C-TiO 2Ax showed around 0.575 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0252 mmol g A1 H 2 while bare g-C 3 N 4 presented 0.164 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0144 mmol g A1 H 2 (hydrogen production is shown in Fig. S9 ).Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , a higher photocatalytic activity was achieved by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites and the content of C-TiO 2Ax showed a considerable inuence on the photocatalytic activity: (I) the catalyst with 1 content of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -1) showed an obvious improvement in CO generation (up to 0.412 mmol g A1 ), while H 2 evolution was almost unchanged (0.0181 mmol g A1 ), (II) enhancing the amount of C-TiO 2Ax to 6 wt of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3) resulted in an evident enhancement in both yield and selectivity.CO generation was around 5 and 15 times higher than that of bare C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, keeping in 2.460 mmol g A1 , while the yield of H 2 was scarcely increased to about 0.0741 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 97 selectivity of CO.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 remained at 40.995 mmol g TiO 2 A1 , (III) further enhancement of the C-TiO 2Ax content (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4) led to a decrease in CO generation, which might result from the decreased CO 2 adsorption capacity.These results reveal that the combination of C-TiO 2Ax with g-C 3 N 4 led to a superior enhancement in both production and selectivity toward CO and showed that the optimal catalyst was C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3. To illuminate the source of generated CO, isotopic experiments were carried out using 13 CO 2 as the gas atmosphere 33 under similar photocatalytic conditions.As exhibited in Fig. 5g, peaks at 1.88 min and 13.08 min with m/z 29 and 45 were assigned to 13 CO and 13 CO 2 , respectively.No signal at m/z 28 This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018 was found (Fig. 5f).This information provided unambiguous evidence that the produced CO originated from the photoreduction of CO 2 rather than from the decomposition of any other organic species in the system. In order to further reveal the importance of the composite structure of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in CO 2 photoreduction, control experiments employing different TiO 2 -based composites as photocatalysts were carried out under similar conditions (Table 1).When using commercial P25 TiO 2 (entry 2) as the photocatalyst, around 0.0301 mmol g A1 CO was generated, which was about 20fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .When reducing TiO 2 to TiO 2Ax , the generation of CO was enhanced to 0.255 mmol g A1 (entry 3); however, this was still 2.3-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .These results implied the carbon layer played a positive part in TiO 2 in CO 2 reduction.With TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 4) as the catalyst, made from P25 and g-C 3 N 4 , the yield was higher than bare P25 but was 68 times lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Replacing P25 with titanium isopropoxide as the starting material, the resultant TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 5) exhibited a sharply increased reactivity, with up to 0.274 mmol g A1 CO generation.However, this reactivity was one order of magnitude lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.These results illuminated that the carbon layer and excellent light adsorption of TiO 2Ax play a pivotal role in the photocatalysis.Using black TiO 2 nanobelts-doped g-C 3 N 4 (ref.25) as the catalyst (entry 6), 0.535 mmol g A1 CO was produced, which was 4.6-fold lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, revealing a small size of nanoparticles was indispensable.Besides these TiO 2 -based catalysts, the CO generation rate of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was one order higher than most the reported TiO 2 -based catalysts and it outperformed any other reported TiO 2 -based material under similar conditions (Table S1 ). 25,37 further expose the photocatalytic ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , the CO 2 reduction reaction was performed under the irradiation of whole light (Fig. 5b).Under irradiation of 12 h, around 4.500 mmol g A1 CO was produced by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.The yields of C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 were 2.900 and 0.600 mmol g A1 , respectively.These results suggest that in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax may be responsible for the active CO 2 reductive site.For TiO 2Ax , commercial P25, and TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 , the yields were 0.800, 0.050, and 0.180 mmol g A1 , respectively.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 stayed at 78.98 mmol g TiO 2 A1 (Fig. 5c), which was around 70 times higher than that of bare TiO 2Ax . The reactivity of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst in different time periods was revealed through detecting the amount of CO every other hour (Fig. 5e).No apparent CO was detected in the rst hour, illustrating this photocatalytic system needed an activation process for light excitation and adsorption equilibrium of the starting materials on the catalyst.Aer that, the yield of CO per hour almost increased at a constant speed in a linear fashion. The stability of a photocatalyst is vital to its practical and industrial application.The stability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was studied through ve-run cycling photocatalytic experiments (Fig. 5d).Aer 60 h visible-light irradiation, almost no obvious decrease was observed in CO generation, and the total production amount reached 12.30 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 204.96 mmol g TiO 2 . Aer catalysis, PXRD spectroscopies (Fig. S10 ) and UVvisible adsorption spectra (Fig. S11 ) of the sample were collected, which revealed there was little change in the structure of the catalyst and thus is demonstrated a reliable photostability.Furthermore, we also investigated the inuence of the amount of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst on the photocatalytic reactivity.When increasing the catalyst amount to 5, 10, or 30 mg, nearly the same catalytic activity to 1 mg was observed and their CO yields were close at 2.39, 2.35, 2.51 mmol g A1 .These results demonstrate that with the increase in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 amount, the high reactivity rate can still be maintained (Fig. S12 ). Control experiments were performed to elucidate the importance of the components in the photoreduction system.Through mechanically mixing C-TiO 2Ax (6 wt) with g-C 3 N 4 (entry 7), the yield was similar to bare g-C 3 N 4 .The signicant decreases implied that a loose contact is insufficient for the reduction of CO 2 .Without either C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 (entry 8) or light (entry 9), no gas was detected, which indicated that the other components cannot arouse CO 2 reduction, and thus again proved that the photogenerated charge pairs originated from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Once CO 2 gas was changed to Ar (entry 10), the generation of CO also stopped, therefore further excluding the source being from the degradation effects of organic species.In the absence of vapor (entry 7), the yield of CO dramatically decreased to 0.0997 mmol g A1 , implying vapor might be essential as an electron/proton donor. The performance of a photocatalytic system in CO 2 reduction is dictated by a balance between the thermodynamics and kinetics.A famous mechanism path is to rst convert CO 2 into CO 2 c A , which needs a high negative equilibrium potential of 1.9 V versus NHE. 38,39However, the photoinduced electrons in the conduction band edge of all semiconductors cannot provide enough driving force to carry out the one-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO 2 c A . 40,41Another mechanistic route is through protoncoupled electron transfer processes, which could bypass the formation of CO 2 c A .Through transferring the protons with electrons, the large activation barriers can be readily avoided. 42owever, the proton-participating route has a signicant kinetic dependence on the electron density on the surface of semiconductors catalysts.As discussed above, the initial H protons capture-speed of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 is 300 mmol g A1 min A1 , which is two orders of magnitude higher than the generation speed of CO (3.41 mmol g A1 min A1 ).The affluent protons accumulated on the surfaces of photocatalyst provide a guarantee for the successful reduction of CO 2 through the proton-coupled pathway. As for the other half reaction, the reactivity of water oxidation triggered by photogenerated holes has a considerable inuence on the efficiency of CO 2 reduction in H 2 O system.For water oxidation, the challenge lies mainly in the release of diatomic O 2 .The stepwise two-electron/two-step pathway is proposed as an optimum approach between thermodynamic and kinetic constraints for water oxidation. 9,16In our photocatalytic system, g-C 3 N 4 incorporated with amorphous carbon layers was designed to full the two-electron/two-step oxidation pathway.The oxidation product of O 2 around 1.22 mmol g A1 and negligible H 2 O 2 was detected in the catalytic system using C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst.Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments (Fig. S13 and S14 ) directly conrmed that the oxidation reaction undergoes a two-electron process. In photocatalysis, three universally accepted steps are involved: light harvesting, charge separation, and transportation to surface sites, thus triggering redox reactions. 43,44As for CO 2 reduction, two more steps should be taken into account, they are CO 2 and proton adsorption.CO 2 adsorption through interactions with surface atoms facilitates the formation of a partially charged species, which could lower the energy barrier and lead to increased reactivity.Proton participation could also conduct the reduction in a low-energy way. 45n CO 2 reduction with C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst, C-TiO 2Ax contributes most of the adsorbed photons, while g-C 3 N 4 could absorb the light before 450 nm.The ultrathin carbon layer serving as an electron reservoir takes an important role in accumulating the photoinduced electrons, therefore efficiently suppressing the recombination of the generated electronhole (e-h ) pairs.The ultrasmall size of C-TiO 2Ax supplies sufficient reductive sites.Owing to the slower recombination speed of electron-hole pairs of g-C 3 N 4 than that of C-TiO 2Ax , g-C 3 N 4 could supply photoexcited electrons to C-TiO 2Ax .The mesoporous structure of g-C 3 N 4 provides an appropriate accumulation space for CO 2 and H protons.Under the assistance of the carbon layer, g-C 3 N 4 becomes an active photocatalyst for water oxidation through an efficient two-electron/two-step pathway.The spatially separated reductive and oxidative sites could exclude the possibility of re-oxidation of the reduction products. Based on the above discussion, a possible catalytic mechanism for CO 2 reduction over C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is proposed (Fig. S15 ).First, CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2Ax spheres and unoccupied g-C 3 N 4 .Aer irradiation, charge separation occurs in g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax , producing the electron-hole pairs.The generated electrons transfer to the amorphous carbon and trigger the reductive reaction under the assistance of a H proton from water to produce CO, while the remaining holes on g-C 3 N 4 with the assistance of the carbon layers perform the oxidative reaction and generate O 2 via a twoelectron/two-step pathway."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2 -based three-component photocatalyst C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4", "source": "In conclusion, we propose a design strategy of a low-cost, highly durable, and efficient TiO 2 -based three-component photocatalyst C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 for the generation of CO coupled with water oxidation.", "context": "In conclusion, we propose a design strategy of a low-cost, highly durable, and efficient TiO 2 -based three-component photocatalyst C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 for the generation of CO coupled with water oxidation.In this strategy, polyoxotitanium, Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 , is ingeniously employed as the precursor of TiO 2 .In the composite photocatalyst, an ultrasmall TiO 2Ax nanoparticle (5-8 nm) coated ultra-thin carbon layer was fabricated as the catalyst for converting CO 2 toward CO, and a g-C 3 N 4 coupled amorphous carbon layer was adopted as a catalyst for water oxidation via a two-electron/two-step pathway.Such a delicate structure widens the light adsorption into the whole visible light, meanwhile it was shown to possess a good adsorption capability for CO 2 (17.7 cm 3 g A1 ).Under visible-light irradiation, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 showed around 12.30 mmol g A1 (204.96mmol g TiO 2 A1 ) CO generation within 60 h reaction, corresponding to 0.205 mmol g A1 h A1 .When switching the condition of visible light into whole light, the photocatalytic activity displayed a 1-fold enhancement.This CO generation rate is one order higher than the reported TiO 2 -based catalyst under similar conditions.The experiments for H protons adsorption showed the capture speed of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was 300 mmol g A1 min A1 , which was two orders of magnitude higher than the generation speed of CO (3.41 mmol g A1 min A1 ).Such rich protons accumulation provides a guarantee for CO 2 reduction through the low-energy protoncoupled pathway.Coupling the reductive process with a matched water oxidation route is an attractive avenue to boost the reductive half-reaction.Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments indicated that the oxidative reaction in the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 system was carried out via the efficient two-electron/two-step pathway with O 2 as the nal oxidative product.Photocurrent studies revealed the thin carbon layer serving as electron reservoir played an important role in facilitating the generated electron-hole (e-h ) pairs separation.Because of the slower recombination speed of electronhole pairs of g-C 3 N 4 than that of C-TiO 2Ax , the photoexcited electrons on the conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 could transfer to that of C-TiO 2Ax , therefore enhancing the change separation and further increasing the photocatalytic activity.This work might open up an alternative method to produce ultrasmall black TiO 2 nanoparticles based materials and provides novel insights for the design of high-performance and low-cost photocatalysts for converting CO 2 to CO. 7, 286.1, and 288.5 eV, corresponding to C-C, C-O, and C-O-Ti, 26 respectively, which provided strong evidence for TiO 2Ax connecting to the carbon layer with chemical bonds.The O 1s had two peaks located at 531.2 eV and 529.5 eV, attributing to the O-H and Ti-O bonds, 27 respectively.The formation of Ti 3 and C might originate from the reduction effect of H 2 and CO 28 gas, which may come from the hydrolysis and decomposition of diacetone under high temperature.Control experiments were carried out to illuminate these issues.Without diacetone, only white TiO 2 was obtained, implying the indispensable role of diacetone during the formation of C-TiO 2Ax .When using titanium isopropoxide to replace Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 , yellow TiO 2 emerged, revealing Fig. 2 Schematic illustration of the fabrication of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites.The cluster in green represents Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 , the layer structure is representative of g-C 3 N 4 , the ball in yellow is on behalf of TiO 2Ax and the fullerene-like structure with grey shell is presented for the carbon layer.

The as-prepared C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 catalyst (1 mg) was dispersed in a mixture of 2 mL deionized water and ethanol (v/v 14 1 : 1) under sonication.Aer heating to 70 C, the suspension was dropcoated onto a glass of 1 cm A 2.5 cm.Then, the glass was moved to a quartz photoreactor and 0.1 mL deionized water was added to keep the glass surrounded by water vapor.Aer bubbling through with water-vapor-saturated CO 2 for 30 min, the quartz photoreactor was put into a water-cooled reactor and irradiated under visible light using a PLS-SXE300 Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff lter.To detect the gas product of CO, 500 mL gas in the middle of the test tube was taken out by syringe and injected into FID detector, using argon as carrier gas.The volume of the CO produced was calculated by comparing the integrated area of the signals of CO with a calibration curve.The injector and detector temperatures were set to 60 C. The retention time of hydrogen was 1.9 min.To detect the formation of hydrogen from the reaction mixture, 1000 mL of the headspace of the test tube was taken out by syringe and injected into a TCD detector, using a 5 A molecular sieve column and argon as the carrier gas and reference gas.The volume of the hydrogen produced was calculated by comparing the integrated area of the signals of hydrogen with a calibration curve.The injector and detector temperatures were set to 60 C. The retention time of hydrogen was 0.7 min. The electron-transfer number (n) was calculated as follows: where N is the RRDE collection efficiency, measured to be 0.4 using the system by Liu et al. 9 In detail, the RRDE electrode was dipped into 0.01 mol L A1 K 3 Fe(CN) 6 in 0.1 mol L A1 KCl solution and rotated under different rotation rates (u 14 400, 900, 1600 2500 rpm).The disk potential E disk was scanned from 0.2 V to A1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 10 mV s A1 , with the ring potential E ring xed to 0.454 V vs. Ag/AgCl (the reduced product Fe(CN) 6 4A can be oxidized at this potential), and the currentpotential voltammograms were then recorded during the electrode rotation.The RRDE measurement is shown in Fig. S13 and S14. The ratio of I ring /I disk was almost constant under various u.The calculation method of the electron-transfer number (n) was also considered by Liu et al. 9 The result of the calculation was that n equals 2."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "Pure C-TiO 2Ax has strong absorption within the whole visible light, while bare g-C 3 N 4 was only able to absorb light with l m 450 nm.", "context": "Synthesis and structural analysis of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite For the synthesis of the targeted three-component photocatalyst, g-C 3 N 4 (ref.23) and Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 22,24 were rst prepared following the reported literature.Through one-pot pyrolyzing the mixtures of Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 and g-C 3 N 4 with different weight ratios under 350 C and an air atmosphere, the three-component composites of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 with different contents of C-TiO 2Ax were fabricated (Fig. 2).Bare C-TiO 2Ax was obtained by directly heating Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 under similar conditions.Their photographs are shown in Fig. 3g.As determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the corresponding TiO 2Ax content in the resultant C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites was respectively 1 wt, 4.5 wt, 6 wt, and 10 wt based on the Ti content and the samples were labeled as C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -1, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax , and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites (Fig. 3f) showed that the pure C-TiO 2Ax possessed similar patterns with anatase TiO 2 .C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites exhibited the characteristic PXRD peaks of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , with the intensity of the characteristic peaks of C-TiO 2Ax increasing with the enhancement of C-TiO 2Ax content (Fig. S1 ).SEM and TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite were taken to directly analyze its structure (Fig. 3a-d).As shown in the SEM image (Fig. 3a), the layered structure of g-C 3 N 4 was maintained in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mappings and the spectrum (Fig. 3b) of the selected area showed that the Ti and O elements were highly dispersed on the g-C 3 N 4 surface.TEM images of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in Fig. 3c reveal the size of TiO 2Ax nanoparticles were mainly distributed between 6 and 9 nm.Compared with the 590 nm particle size of TiO 2 in TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S2 ), which was synthesized by a traditional hydrothermal method, 13 the size of TiO 2Ax in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was reduced by two orders of magnitude.Therefore, employing polyoxotitanate as a Ti source could be an efficient and effective method to obtain ultrasmall TiO 2Ax nanoparticle-based composite materials.Highresolution TEM (HRTEM) was employed to identify the phase of the TiO 2Ax nanoparticles in the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composite.As shown in Fig. 3d, the distance between the adjacent lattice planes was 0.35 nm along 101 direction, which is a typical lattice plane distance for anatase TiO 2 . 20The structure of the TiO 2Ax -coated amorphous carbon layer can be clearly observed from Fig. 3e.Furthermore, the carbon layer was the link connecting g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax nanoparticles.For the electron pool character of the carbon layer, such a structure will facilitate photoinduced electron transfer.In order to illuminate the source of amorphous carbon, an HRTEM image of bare C-TiO 2Ax was collected.A clear carbon coating around TiO 2Ax nanoparticles was found, which strongly excluded the possibility of the carbon source being from g-C 3 N 4 . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further employed to determine the atomic valence states and bonding environment in C-TiO 2Ax and C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 .Fig. 3 shows the XPS of C-TiO 2Ax , in which the high-resolution spectra of Ti 2p located at 465.0, 464.2, 459.2, and 458.7 eV could be assigned to Ti 4 2p 1/2 , Ti 3 2p 1/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 , and Ti 3 2p 3/2 , respectively. 25he C 1s had three peaks at 284. Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 clusters may be the main source of amorphous carbon. The XPS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. S3, and the high-resolution XPS results of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p are exhibited in Fig. 4a-d Compared with C-TiO 2Ax , the peak of O-H group is shied a little, which should be attributed to the chemical environment change. 29The C 1s XPS spectrum exhibits anisomerous peaks with an obvious shoulder.Aer tting, ve peaks could be observed with the binding energies of 289.9, 288.6, 287.6, 286.0, and 284.6 eV.The peaks located at 287.6 and 286.0 eV are attributed to hybridized carbon atoms containing the C-(N) 3 and N-C-N group of g-C 3 N 4 , while the one at 284.6 eV is assigned to the C-C coordination, originating from adventitious carbon of the XPS instrument itself. 30The peak emerging at 288.6 eV is matched with the Ti-O-C.The le peak at 289.9 eV is 0.4 eV shied compared with the corresponding peak in pure g-C 3 N 4 (Fig. S5 ), which might due to the formation of chemical bonds. 31The N 1s could be tted into four peaks, located at 403.8, 400.8, 399.6, and 398.2 eV.The peak at 398.2 eV is assigned to sp 2 -hybridized aromatic N bound to C atoms (C N-C), while the signal at the binding energy of 399.6 eV indicates tertiary nitrogen N-(C) 3 .The peaks at 400.8 and 403.8 eV are assigned to C-N-H groups and charging effects. 32 The N 2 adsorption behavior was measured to reveal the change in surface of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites.The adsorptiondesorption isotherms at 77 K (Fig. S6 ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 showed a gradual decrease in BET surface areas (S BET ) with values of 94.1, 87.2, and 77.8 m 2 g A1 , respectively, while the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 was relatively high (99.4,m 2 g A1 ).Compared with the S BET of bare g-C 3 N 4 , the decrease in composite materials accounted for the loading of C-TiO 2Ax , whereby with the increase in loading content, the decrement enhances.The CO 2 adsorption ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was also measured.As shown in Fig. 4e, the maximum CO 2 uptake at 273 K for C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2, 3, 4 was 17.7, 15.9, and 9.2 cm 3 g A1 , respectively, which are different to that of pure g-C 3 N 4 (11.5 cm 3 g A1 ).In contrast to N 2 adsorption, the improvement in CO 2 adsorption of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -2 and 3 probably comes from the increased interaction of C-TiO 2Ax with CO 2 molecules, while the decrease in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4 may be due to the sharply decreased surface area. As H protons have a signicant inuence on the CO 2 reduction activity, the H proton adsorption capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was studied with HCl as the H source.The H adsorption curve of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is presented in Fig. 4f.It was found that at the initial 5 min, 1.5 mmol g A1 H was adsorbed by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , corresponding to 300 mmol g A1 min A1 .Aer 3 h, it reached saturated adsorption and the amount was 4.46 mmol g A1 , which is 2.8-fold higher than bare g-C 3 N 4 (1.55 mmol g A1 ).Such a high protons accumulation capability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may signicantly boost the reductive performance of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 via the low-energy proton-coupled pathway. UV-Visible adsorption spectra can provide insightful information into the interactions of photocatalytic materials with photons of different energy.Fig. 3g shows the optical absorption spectra of g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax and their composite materials.Pure C-TiO 2Ax has strong absorption within the whole visible light, while bare g-C 3 N 4 was only able to absorb light with l m 450 nm.All C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites showed an obvious light absorption from 300 to 800 nm, and with increase in doping concentration of TiO 2Ax , the absorption intensity region from 460 to 800 nm was improved.Therefore, we could expect that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 may exhibit an outstanding performance in visible-light photocatalysis. As for heterojunction semiconductor, the energy level of each component has a signicant inuence on the catalytic reactivity.The energy level of the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 was well studied in our former work 33 and the band gap was 2.73 eV, with the conduction band energy (E CB ) and the valence band energy (E VB ) at A0.75 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively, vs. a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).For our materials, E VB was determined from cyclic voltammograms (CV, Fig. S7 ) and E CB was calculated based on the optical band gap (E g ). 9 Using analyses and calculations based on Fig. S8, the E VB energy of C-TiO 2Ax was 1.63 eV.E g was estimated from the Tauc plot (Fig. S8 ), which was determined to be 2.18 eV.According to the formula E CB 14 E VB A E g , the E CB of C-TiO 2Ax was estimated to be A0.55 V.The energy levels of both g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were appropriate for reducing CO 2 to CO and water oxidation. Given that charge separation has a signicant effect on the redox reaction occurring at a photocatalyst surface, the transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax were collected. 34,35In Fig. 4g, the photocurrent value of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 can be seen to be rapidly elevated with the light turned on and then it gradually climbs up to the highest current level (up to 0.83 mA cm A2 ) during irradiation.When the irradiation was turned off, a sharp decrease emerged.This switch loop could be implemented repeatedly multiple times.A similar phenomenon occurred with pure C-TiO 2Ax and bare g-C 3 N 4 materials during on-off irradiation; however, the photocurrent densities of them were 4-fold and 2.5-fold lower than C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Additionally, the photocurrent value of pure TiO 2 was 2-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax , illuminating that the C doping plays a crucial role in facilitating the charge separation generated by TiO 2Ax . Under visible light irradiation, the EIS of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 heterjunction, bare g-C 3 N 4 , and C-TiO 2Ax and TiO 2 were measured.As shown in Fig. 4h, the charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was 47 U cm A2 , which was considerably lower than those of bare C-TiO 2Ax (108 U cm A2 ) and g-C 3 N 4 (82 U cm A2 ).These results indicate that the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 composite performed a higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers and a relatively lower recombination rate of electron-hole pairs under visible light.Simultaneously, R ct of pure TiO 2 was 172 U cm A2 , which was 1.6-fold higher than C-TiO 2Ax .This further revealed that the carbon layer plays a positive role in promoting photoinduced charge separation. The CO 2 reduction experiment was performed following the photocatalytic condition using (Au, Cu)/TiO 2 as the catalyst reported by Neatu and co-worker, in which only light, CO 2 , and H 2 O were used in the system. 36Our experiment was carried out employing C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 as a photocatalyst under a visiblelight-driven system (l 420 nm) with CO 2 atmosphere and water vapor.As a control, the photocatalytic performances of bare g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax were investigated.Fig. 5a shows that CO gas was generated as the main reductive reaction products aer 12 h irradiation.Clearly, pure C-TiO 2Ax showed around 0.575 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0252 mmol g A1 H 2 while bare g-C 3 N 4 presented 0.164 mmol g A1 CO and 0.0144 mmol g A1 H 2 (hydrogen production is shown in Fig. S9 ).Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 and C-TiO 2Ax , a higher photocatalytic activity was achieved by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites and the content of C-TiO 2Ax showed a considerable inuence on the photocatalytic activity: (I) the catalyst with 1 content of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -1) showed an obvious improvement in CO generation (up to 0.412 mmol g A1 ), while H 2 evolution was almost unchanged (0.0181 mmol g A1 ), (II) enhancing the amount of C-TiO 2Ax to 6 wt of Ti (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3) resulted in an evident enhancement in both yield and selectivity.CO generation was around 5 and 15 times higher than that of bare C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 , respectively, keeping in 2.460 mmol g A1 , while the yield of H 2 was scarcely increased to about 0.0741 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 97 selectivity of CO.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 remained at 40.995 mmol g TiO 2 A1 , (III) further enhancement of the C-TiO 2Ax content (C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -4) led to a decrease in CO generation, which might result from the decreased CO 2 adsorption capacity.These results reveal that the combination of C-TiO 2Ax with g-C 3 N 4 led to a superior enhancement in both production and selectivity toward CO and showed that the optimal catalyst was C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3. To illuminate the source of generated CO, isotopic experiments were carried out using 13 CO 2 as the gas atmosphere 33 under similar photocatalytic conditions.As exhibited in Fig. 5g, peaks at 1.88 min and 13.08 min with m/z 29 and 45 were assigned to 13 CO and 13 CO 2 , respectively.No signal at m/z 28 This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018 was found (Fig. 5f).This information provided unambiguous evidence that the produced CO originated from the photoreduction of CO 2 rather than from the decomposition of any other organic species in the system. In order to further reveal the importance of the composite structure of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 in CO 2 photoreduction, control experiments employing different TiO 2 -based composites as photocatalysts were carried out under similar conditions (Table 1).When using commercial P25 TiO 2 (entry 2) as the photocatalyst, around 0.0301 mmol g A1 CO was generated, which was about 20fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .When reducing TiO 2 to TiO 2Ax , the generation of CO was enhanced to 0.255 mmol g A1 (entry 3); however, this was still 2.3-fold lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax .These results implied the carbon layer played a positive part in TiO 2 in CO 2 reduction.With TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 4) as the catalyst, made from P25 and g-C 3 N 4 , the yield was higher than bare P25 but was 68 times lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Replacing P25 with titanium isopropoxide as the starting material, the resultant TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 (entry 5) exhibited a sharply increased reactivity, with up to 0.274 mmol g A1 CO generation.However, this reactivity was one order of magnitude lower than that of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.These results illuminated that the carbon layer and excellent light adsorption of TiO 2Ax play a pivotal role in the photocatalysis.Using black TiO 2 nanobelts-doped g-C 3 N 4 (ref.25) as the catalyst (entry 6), 0.535 mmol g A1 CO was produced, which was 4.6-fold lower than that from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3, revealing a small size of nanoparticles was indispensable.Besides these TiO 2 -based catalysts, the CO generation rate of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was one order higher than most the reported TiO 2 -based catalysts and it outperformed any other reported TiO 2 -based material under similar conditions (Table S1 ). 25,37 further expose the photocatalytic ability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , the CO 2 reduction reaction was performed under the irradiation of whole light (Fig. 5b).Under irradiation of 12 h, around 4.500 mmol g A1 CO was produced by C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.The yields of C-TiO 2Ax and g-C 3 N 4 were 2.900 and 0.600 mmol g A1 , respectively.These results suggest that in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 , C-TiO 2Ax may be responsible for the active CO 2 reductive site.For TiO 2Ax , commercial P25, and TiO 2 g-C 3 N 4 , the yields were 0.800, 0.050, and 0.180 mmol g A1 , respectively.When normalizing the quality of TiO 2 , the generation of CO in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 stayed at 78.98 mmol g TiO 2 A1 (Fig. 5c), which was around 70 times higher than that of bare TiO 2Ax . The reactivity of the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst in different time periods was revealed through detecting the amount of CO every other hour (Fig. 5e).No apparent CO was detected in the rst hour, illustrating this photocatalytic system needed an activation process for light excitation and adsorption equilibrium of the starting materials on the catalyst.Aer that, the yield of CO per hour almost increased at a constant speed in a linear fashion. The stability of a photocatalyst is vital to its practical and industrial application.The stability of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 was studied through ve-run cycling photocatalytic experiments (Fig. 5d).Aer 60 h visible-light irradiation, almost no obvious decrease was observed in CO generation, and the total production amount reached 12.30 mmol g A1 , corresponding to 204.96 mmol g TiO 2 . Aer catalysis, PXRD spectroscopies (Fig. S10 ) and UVvisible adsorption spectra (Fig. S11 ) of the sample were collected, which revealed there was little change in the structure of the catalyst and thus is demonstrated a reliable photostability.Furthermore, we also investigated the inuence of the amount of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 catalyst on the photocatalytic reactivity.When increasing the catalyst amount to 5, 10, or 30 mg, nearly the same catalytic activity to 1 mg was observed and their CO yields were close at 2.39, 2.35, 2.51 mmol g A1 .These results demonstrate that with the increase in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 amount, the high reactivity rate can still be maintained (Fig. S12 ). Control experiments were performed to elucidate the importance of the components in the photoreduction system.Through mechanically mixing C-TiO 2Ax (6 wt) with g-C 3 N 4 (entry 7), the yield was similar to bare g-C 3 N 4 .The signicant decreases implied that a loose contact is insufficient for the reduction of CO 2 .Without either C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 (entry 8) or light (entry 9), no gas was detected, which indicated that the other components cannot arouse CO 2 reduction, and thus again proved that the photogenerated charge pairs originated from C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3.Once CO 2 gas was changed to Ar (entry 10), the generation of CO also stopped, therefore further excluding the source being from the degradation effects of organic species.In the absence of vapor (entry 7), the yield of CO dramatically decreased to 0.0997 mmol g A1 , implying vapor might be essential as an electron/proton donor. The performance of a photocatalytic system in CO 2 reduction is dictated by a balance between the thermodynamics and kinetics.A famous mechanism path is to rst convert CO 2 into CO 2 c A , which needs a high negative equilibrium potential of 1.9 V versus NHE. 38,39However, the photoinduced electrons in the conduction band edge of all semiconductors cannot provide enough driving force to carry out the one-electron reduction of CO 2 to CO 2 c A . 40,41Another mechanistic route is through protoncoupled electron transfer processes, which could bypass the formation of CO 2 c A .Through transferring the protons with electrons, the large activation barriers can be readily avoided. 42owever, the proton-participating route has a signicant kinetic dependence on the electron density on the surface of semiconductors catalysts.As discussed above, the initial H protons capture-speed of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 is 300 mmol g A1 min A1 , which is two orders of magnitude higher than the generation speed of CO (3.41 mmol g A1 min A1 ).The affluent protons accumulated on the surfaces of photocatalyst provide a guarantee for the successful reduction of CO 2 through the proton-coupled pathway. As for the other half reaction, the reactivity of water oxidation triggered by photogenerated holes has a considerable inuence on the efficiency of CO 2 reduction in H 2 O system.For water oxidation, the challenge lies mainly in the release of diatomic O 2 .The stepwise two-electron/two-step pathway is proposed as an optimum approach between thermodynamic and kinetic constraints for water oxidation. 9,16In our photocatalytic system, g-C 3 N 4 incorporated with amorphous carbon layers was designed to full the two-electron/two-step oxidation pathway.The oxidation product of O 2 around 1.22 mmol g A1 and negligible H 2 O 2 was detected in the catalytic system using C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst.Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments (Fig. S13 and S14 ) directly conrmed that the oxidation reaction undergoes a two-electron process. In photocatalysis, three universally accepted steps are involved: light harvesting, charge separation, and transportation to surface sites, thus triggering redox reactions. 43,44As for CO 2 reduction, two more steps should be taken into account, they are CO 2 and proton adsorption.CO 2 adsorption through interactions with surface atoms facilitates the formation of a partially charged species, which could lower the energy barrier and lead to increased reactivity.Proton participation could also conduct the reduction in a low-energy way. 45n CO 2 reduction with C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 -3 as the photocatalyst, C-TiO 2Ax contributes most of the adsorbed photons, while g-C 3 N 4 could absorb the light before 450 nm.The ultrathin carbon layer serving as an electron reservoir takes an important role in accumulating the photoinduced electrons, therefore efficiently suppressing the recombination of the generated electronhole (e-h ) pairs.The ultrasmall size of C-TiO 2Ax supplies sufficient reductive sites.Owing to the slower recombination speed of electron-hole pairs of g-C 3 N 4 than that of C-TiO 2Ax , g-C 3 N 4 could supply photoexcited electrons to C-TiO 2Ax .The mesoporous structure of g-C 3 N 4 provides an appropriate accumulation space for CO 2 and H protons.Under the assistance of the carbon layer, g-C 3 N 4 becomes an active photocatalyst for water oxidation through an efficient two-electron/two-step pathway.The spatially separated reductive and oxidative sites could exclude the possibility of re-oxidation of the reduction products. Based on the above discussion, a possible catalytic mechanism for CO 2 reduction over C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 is proposed (Fig. S15 ).First, CO 2 is adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2Ax spheres and unoccupied g-C 3 N 4 .Aer irradiation, charge separation occurs in g-C 3 N 4 and TiO 2Ax , producing the electron-hole pairs.The generated electrons transfer to the amorphous carbon and trigger the reductive reaction under the assistance of a H proton from water to produce CO, while the remaining holes on g-C 3 N 4 with the assistance of the carbon layers perform the oxidative reaction and generate O 2 via a twoelectron/two-step pathway."}, {"llm generation": "whole visible light", "source": "Such a delicate structure widens the light adsorption into the whole visible light, meanwhile it was shown to possess a good adsorption capability for CO 2 (17.7 cm 3 g A1 ).", "context": "In conclusion, we propose a design strategy of a low-cost, highly durable, and efficient TiO 2 -based three-component photocatalyst C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 for the generation of CO coupled with water oxidation.In this strategy, polyoxotitanium, Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 , is ingeniously employed as the precursor of TiO 2 .In the composite photocatalyst, an ultrasmall TiO 2Ax nanoparticle (5-8 nm) coated ultra-thin carbon layer was fabricated as the catalyst for converting CO 2 toward CO, and a g-C 3 N 4 coupled amorphous carbon layer was adopted as a catalyst for water oxidation via a two-electron/two-step pathway.Such a delicate structure widens the light adsorption into the whole visible light, meanwhile it was shown to possess a good adsorption capability for CO 2 (17.7 cm 3 g A1 ).Under visible-light irradiation, C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 showed around 12.30 mmol g A1 (204.96mmol g TiO 2 A1 ) CO generation within 60 h reaction, corresponding to 0.205 mmol g A1 h A1 .When switching the condition of visible light into whole light, the photocatalytic activity displayed a 1-fold enhancement.This CO generation rate is one order higher than the reported TiO 2 -based catalyst under similar conditions.The experiments for H protons adsorption showed the capture speed of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 was 300 mmol g A1 min A1 , which was two orders of magnitude higher than the generation speed of CO (3.41 mmol g A1 min A1 ).Such rich protons accumulation provides a guarantee for CO 2 reduction through the low-energy protoncoupled pathway.Coupling the reductive process with a matched water oxidation route is an attractive avenue to boost the reductive half-reaction.Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments indicated that the oxidative reaction in the C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 system was carried out via the efficient two-electron/two-step pathway with O 2 as the nal oxidative product.Photocurrent studies revealed the thin carbon layer serving as electron reservoir played an important role in facilitating the generated electron-hole (e-h ) pairs separation.Because of the slower recombination speed of electronhole pairs of g-C 3 N 4 than that of C-TiO 2Ax , the photoexcited electrons on the conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 could transfer to that of C-TiO 2Ax , therefore enhancing the change separation and further increasing the photocatalytic activity.This work might open up an alternative method to produce ultrasmall black TiO 2 nanoparticles based materials and provides novel insights for the design of high-performance and low-cost photocatalysts for converting CO 2 to CO. 7, 286.1, and 288.5 eV, corresponding to C-C, C-O, and C-O-Ti, 26 respectively, which provided strong evidence for TiO 2Ax connecting to the carbon layer with chemical bonds.The O 1s had two peaks located at 531.2 eV and 529.5 eV, attributing to the O-H and Ti-O bonds, 27 respectively.The formation of Ti 3 and C might originate from the reduction effect of H 2 and CO 28 gas, which may come from the hydrolysis and decomposition of diacetone under high temperature.Control experiments were carried out to illuminate these issues.Without diacetone, only white TiO 2 was obtained, implying the indispensable role of diacetone during the formation of C-TiO 2Ax .When using titanium isopropoxide to replace Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 , yellow TiO 2 emerged, revealing Fig. 2 Schematic illustration of the fabrication of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 composites.The cluster in green represents Ti 17 O 24 (OPr i ) 20 , the layer structure is representative of g-C 3 N 4 , the ball in yellow is on behalf of TiO 2Ax and the fullerene-like structure with grey shell is presented for the carbon layer.

Compared to the peaks of Ti 2p in pure C-TiO 2Ax (Fig. S4 ), the corresponding peaks in C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 are a little shied, centering around 464.2, 463.3, 458.3, and 457.8 eV.The O 1s of C-TiO 2Ax g-C 3 N 4 has two peaks at 532.3 and 529.5 eV, ascribed to the O-H group and Ti-O bond.
