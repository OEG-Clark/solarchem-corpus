The morphology of Ag-NPs-loaded TiO 2 NWs is examined using TEM as illustrated in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a-c) show uniform distribution of Ag-NPs over the surface of TiO 2 NWs.The TiO 2 NWs detected were of different size with diameter in the range of 20-50 nm.The particle size distribution of Ag-NPs is depicted in Fig. 3(b), which revealed Ag-NPs are very fine, with diameter range of 1.3-14 nm.Two mean diameters were detected with their values of 2 nm and 8 nm, respectively.The amounts of large size plasmonic Ag-NPs existing in the sample are approximately the same as the small size Ag-NPs.More importantly, the small size Ag-NPs presented over the TiO 2 NWs surface can serve as electrons sink to promote the charges separation.Fig. 3(d) exhibits the crystal structure of the Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs hybrids measured using a high resolution TEM.The spacing between two adjacent lattice fringes to (101) plane of anatase TiO 2 and (111) plane of Ag-NP were 0.35 nm and 0.24 nm, respectively. The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the pure TiO 2 , TiO 2 NWs and Ag-NPs modified TiO 2 NWs samples are depicted in Fig. 4. The isotherms of the pure TiO 2 , TiO 2 NWs and Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs are similar to type IV curve with the hysteresis loops which is the characteristics of mesoporous materials.The BET surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of the TiO 2 , TiO 2 NWs and modified TiO 2 NWs samples are summarized in Table 1.BET specific surface area (S BET ) of the pure TiO 2 was 42 increased to 72 m 2 g A1 for TiO 2 NWs.On the other hand, BET surface area gradually decreased to 48 m 2 g A1 when 3 wt.Ag-NPs was loaded to TiO 2 NWs.This decreased in the BET surface area could be accounted for partial TiO 2 NWs surface coverage by the deposited Ag-NPs.Similar observations were obtained in BJH adsorption pore volumes.In the case of pore diameter, pure TiO 2 pore diameter was 10 nm, increased to 25 nm in TiO 2 NWs, obviously due to the larger diameter of TiO 2 NWs.A further increase in pore diameter was observed in Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs evidently due to deposited Ag-NPs layer over the surface of these materials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze chemical states of the elements in Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(a) reveals the presence of Ti2p peaks namely Ti2p 3/2 and Ti2p 1/2 located at 458.06 eV and 363.79 eV, respectively, corresponds to Ti 4 oxidation state or titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ).The Ag3d spectrum with BE regions centered at 367. 55 eV (3d 5/2 ) and 373.53 eV (3d 3/2 ), indicating the presence of silver in metal state as depicted in Fig. 5(b) 12.Fig. 5(c) shows the O1 s spectrum with main components, one at 530.87 eV, ascribed to the lattice oxygen O 2 and binding energy component located at 532.98 eV related to metal-OH bonds or free hydroxyl group (OA AH) on the surface.The spectrum of C 1 s with peaks located at 284.60 eV and 288.44 eV are presented in Fig. 5(d).The main peak at 284.60 eV is assigned to CA AC and CA AH hydrocarbon bonds.The peak at 288.44 eV can be attributed to carbon atoms bound to oxygen with double bond C14O.The relative concentration of peak at 284.60 eV was much more and may be recognized as the carbon from carbon tap used for sample analysis 21. UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra of TiO 2 NWs and Ag-NPs modified TiO 2 NWs are shown in Fig. 6.Fig. 6(a) shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra of TiO 2 NWs and Ag-NPs modified TiO 2 NWs.Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs shows a broad visible light absorption due to LSPR absorption of Ag-NPs, indicating metallic Ag exists as recognized by XPS and TEM analysis.More importantly, LSPR images could be seen in Ag-NPs loaded TiO 2 NWs samples, when excited with a laser light of wavelength 532 nm, as depicted in the inset of Fig. 6(b).The band gap energy was calculated according to plot of (ahv) 2 vs. photon energy as depicted in Fig. 6(c).The band gap energy of 3.10, 3.17 and 3.16 eV was obtained for TiO 2 , TiO 2 NWs and Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs, respectively.The TiO 2 band gap energy has increased perhaps due to the pure anatase phase and larger crystallite size of TiO 2 NWs compared to TiO 2 nanoparticles.Ag-NPs have no significant influence on increasing the band gap energy of TiO 2 NWs.However, enhanced visible light absorption evidenced due to a broadband peak located at around 580 nm arising from SPR of Ag-NPs in the TiO 2 matrix.Fig. 7 shows PL emission spectra of the pure TiO 2 NWs and Ag-NPs modified TiO 2 NWs samples excited at a wavelength of 532 nm.The broad symmetric peaks appeared at 536 nm revealed that emission is not because of TiO 2 band edge excitation.Therefore, PL signals can be attributed to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to TiO 2 valance band.It is noticeable that emission spectra of the Ag-modified TiO 2 samples are similar to those of the pure TiO 2 NWs sample.However, the PL intensity enfeebled in Ag-NPs sample.The electron transfers from the TiO 2 NWs to Ag-promoted TiO 2 NWs are more efficient, resulting in hindered charges recombination rate. The control experiments for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 were conducted at 100 C for 2 h under visible light irradiation.Using all types of catalysts, carbon containing compounds were not detected in the reaction system without reactants or light irradiations.The effects of Ag-NPs on TiO 2 NWs performance for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 to CO is shown in Fig. 8(a).Pure TiO 2 has low photoactivity for CO production, which gradually increased using TiO 2 NWs.This was perhaps due to efficient charges transfer and higher surface area in TiO 2 NWs.Loading Ag-NPs into TiO 2 NWs significantly improved CO 2 photoreduction with optimum Ag-NPs contents of 3 wt..However, with higher Ag-loading (e.g. 5 wt.) photoactivity was reduced, possibly Ag-NPs were adjacent to each other over TiO 2 NWs, electron-hole charges recombine immediately, resulting in lower photoactivity 12.The significantly enhanced photoactivity of Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs samples were evidently due to plasmonic effect with efficient charges separation by Ag-NPs 40. The performance of Ag-NP on the photoactivity of TiO 2 NWs for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion with H 2 to CH 4 and CH 3 OH is presented in Fig. 8(b).Using pure TiO 2 NWs, only small amount of CH 4 was produced which was considerably enhanced in Ag-NPs loading TiO 2 NWs samples.The maximum yield of CH 4 was detected at optimum Ag-NPs-loading of 3 wt.and then gradually declined.On the other hand, CH 3 OH production was not detected in the pure TiO 2 but its production was evidenced in all the Ag-NPs loaded TiO 2 NWs samples.The Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs exhibits higher photoactivity for CO 2 reduction, where the yield of CH 3 OH was increased gradually by increasing the contents of Ag-NPs.The optimal 3 wt.Ag-loading was observed and its production trends were similar to that of CH 4 production.These observations have confirmed that plasmon-excited electron can be injected into TiO 2 for its excitation.On the other hand, an instant charge separation can be achieved on the Ag-NPs due to synergistic effect resulting in prolonged recombination time of the photo-generated charges.In this way, enhanced photoactivity could be achieved for visible light driven reduction of CO 2 to CO, CH 4 and CH 3 OH.The yield rates of different products are presented in Table 2. The yield of CO over Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs was 983 mmole gcatal.A1 h A1 , a 23 times more than TiO 2 NWs and 109 times higher than TiO 2 .It is likely to see that 13 mmole g-catal.A1 h A1 of CH 3 OH was produced over Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs but was not detected in TiO 2 and TiO 2 NWs.These revealed Ag-NPs are also favorable for CH 3 OH production.The selectivity of CO production over Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs increased to 98, confirming selective CO 2 reduction using H 2 as a reducing agent.The CO 2 and H 2 conversions over Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs were 1.43 and 2.35, respectively.It is remarkable to see that the conversion of H 2 was higher in Ag-loaded TiO 2 NWs samples.According to the stoichiometric reaction in Eq. ( 1), one mole of H 2 is required to produce one mole of CO. As the selectivity of CO is near to 98, suggesting CO 2 and H 2 consumption would be approximately much closer.Conversely, the higher H 2 conversion during CO 2 photo-reduction with H 2 over plasmonic Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs was certainly due to some amount of hydrogen consumed by the silver during its oxidation/reduction process under light irradiations 41.Therefore, enhanced photoactivity of Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs was mainly governed by the visible light absorption, higher surface area, photo-generated charges separation and SPR effect of Ag-NPs 13. In order to investigate the performance of selective CO 2 photoreduction to CO by H 2 reducing agent over core-shell Ag NPs/TiO 2 NWs photocatalysts under visible light irradiations, the results are compared with the work reported by various researchers.Kong et al. 12 reported CO 2 reduction with H 2 O over Ag/TiO 2 nanorods with CH 4 yield of 2.64 mmole g.catal A1 h A1 , a 5 fold higher than TiO 2 nanorods.CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO was reported over g-C 3 N 4 -N-TiO 2 in batch mode operation with a maximum yield 14.73 mmole after 12 h irradiation time 42.Over I/TiO 2 and Cu-I/TiO 2 , a CO yield rate of 3.9 and 12 mmole g-catal.A1 was reported after 3.5 h during gas phase CO 2 reduction in a batch mode operation 43.However, in current study, CO 2 reduction with H 2 to CO at selectivity 98 significantly enhanced using Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs core/shell hetero-junction.A comparison study between previous reports and current study revealed significantly improved photoactivity and selectivity using Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs photocatalysts. The efficiency of Ag-NPs modified TiO 2 NWs was further examined based on the quantum yield, calculated for each experiment, as the ratio of the product rate (mole per sec) with photonic flux (mole per sec).The quantum yield of CO 2 photoreduction can be defined as the ratio of amount of products (mole per sec) with photonic flux (mole per sec) as shown in Eq. ( 2) 44. Quantum yield 14 n A production rate molsec moles of photon flux molsec A 100 2 The quantum yield was calculated based on 2, 6 and 8 electrons (n) used for CO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 production rate and moles of photon input energy over the catalyst surface.The quantum yields (QY) of CO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 production over 3 wt.Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs were 0.15, 0.01 and 0.006, respectively (Table 1).The significantly enhanced QY over Ag-NPs/TiO 2 was evidently due to efficient charge transfer rate and SPR effect of Ag-NPs. It is generally accepted that the photocatalyst efficiency is mainly dependent on the light absorption ability, surface properties (e.g., specific surface area, pore structure, pore volume and adsorption property etc.) and photo-generated electron/hole pairs separation efficiency.It is evidenced that photoactivity for CO evolution rate over the TiO 2 NWs can be improved by 23 fold via 3 wt.Ag-NPs loading.However, as discussed above that the TiO 2 NWs surface area is much higher than the Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs, indicating that this factor is not crucial to the photocatalytic activity for Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs.Therefore, the enhanced photocatalytic activity of core/shell Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs hetero-junction can be mainly attributed to LSPR excitation of TiO 2 NWs under visible light and charges separation by Ag-NPs.This synergistic effect between Ag-NPs and TiO 2 NWs can greatly promote the production and separation of photo-generated carriers under visible light irradiation The effects of UV and visible light irradiations on the photoactivity of Ag-NPs-loaded TiO 2 NWs catalyst were investigated in a continuous photoreactor, since the catalyst active sites were utilized more for CO 2 reduction over the irradiation time than the batch process.Besides, commercially continuous processes are preferable for fuel production.and higher photon energy (150 mW/cm 2 ).Therefore, the production of CO as the main product was found to be higher using UV-light irradiation.However, the deactivation of catalyst was found after 60 min, after which CO yield dropped rapidly 45.On the other hand, using visible light irradiations, Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs photocatalyst found to be efficient for continuous production of CO over the entire irradiation time.The simulated sunlight contains the same spectra as the real sunlight with intensity 100 mW/cm 2 , while the visible lamp (Car-HID lamp) has the light intensity of 20 mW/cm 2 .Therefore, the amount of CO produced was different due to different in light intensities.Using solar simulator the yield of CO produced was 3.17 fold more than using visible-light (Car-HID lamp).Therefore, the plasmonic effect of Ag-NPs-promoted the photoactivity of TiO 2 NWs under visible light irradiations. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 under visible and UV-light is depicted in Fig. 9(b).The production of CH 4 was significant using solar simulated light which revealed that visible light is encouraging for the production of useful chemicals.The decreased in CH 4 production over the irradiation time was probably, initially, some amount of CO was converted to CH 4 , when there was more production of electrons at the start of the reaction.In general, significantly enhanced photoactivity of Ag-NPs loaded over TiO 2 NWs toward CO 2 reduction was evidently due to synergistic effects of Ag-NPs for the absorption of visible light and efficient separation of charges over the TiO 2 NWs surface. The stability of Ag-NPs-loaded TiO 2 NWs catalyst was further investigated to evaluate the life of catalyst under UV and visible light irradiations.In order to investigate the stability of Ag-NPs-loaded TiO 2 NWs catalyst, all the experiments were repeated in cyclic runs under the identical conditions.The stability test for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 to CO for Ag-NPs-loaded TiO 2 NWs catalyst is presented in Fig. 10(a).After each cycle, the reactor was purged with helium for one hour before starting the next run.Noticeably, the CO yield was decreased gradually over the irradiation time in cyclic runs under UV-light irradiation.However, photoactivity of Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs was very stable under visible light irradiation (20 mW/cm 2 ).This has confirmed prolonged photoactivity of Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs for continuous CO production under visible light.Recently, Qi et al. 46 reported a gradual decrease in photoactivity of Ag-AgCl/TiO 2 NWs for methyl orange degradation.However, the extended stability of Ag-NPs/TiO 2 in the current study was apparently due to gas-solid heterogeneous system under low energy irradiation. The stability analysis of Ag-NPs loaded TiO 2 NWs for CH 4 production in each cyclic run is illustrated in Fig. 10(b).Compared to the first cyclic run, in the second cyclic run, the CH 4 production increased significantly at the start of the run and then gradually decreased.The higher CH 4 production could be attributed to conversion of carbon with hydrogen deposited over the catalyst surface to CH 4 .However, in third cyclic run, CH 4 yield increased and then decreased over the irradiation time.Seemingly, the intermediate species deposited over the catalyst surface could have been converted to CH 4 47.However, Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs catalyst found to be very stable for continuous production of CH 4 in cyclic runs. The reaction mechanism of CO 2 reduction over semiconductor photocatalyst involves multiple stages during which electrons and protons are transferred.Generally, the production and separation of charges over the photocatalysts is ascribed to the types of light irradiation, band gap energy of semiconductor and characteristics of metals used for doping of semiconductors.The visible light can provide an energy transfer channel while the light captured by TiO 2 NWs can be reused by Ag-NPs resulting in enhanced LSPR effect.The schematic representation of surface plasmon resonance effect and photo-generated charge transfer process in Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs catalyst under UV and visible light irradiation is illustrated in Fig. 11 and Eqs. ( 3)- (10) 7,34,48. Fig. 2. (a) XRD patterns of TiO 2 NWs and Ag-NPs loaded TiO 2 NW; (b) Raman spectroscopy of TiO 2 NWs and Ag-loaded TiO 2 NWs. 30 m.

Fig. 2(a) shows XRD patterns of the pure TiO 2 NWs and Agloaded TiO 2 NWs with different Ag-contents.The TiO 2 NWs with and without Ag-loading present similar patterns of peaks located at 2u 25.31(101), 2u 37.80 (004), 2u 48.0(200), 2u 53.87(105), 2u 55.08 (211), 2u 62.73 (204), 2u 68.75(116), 2u 70.25 (220), 2u 75.09(215).This illustrates pure anatase phase of TiO 2 with growth axis in (101) directions.The diffraction peaks for Ag-NPs were not detected, which may result from the low-loading content or fine dispersion of Ag-NPs on the surface of TiO 2 crystal.The patterns revealed that the photo-deposition of Ag-NPs did not affect the crystal structure of TiO 2 .Similar observations have been reported previously39.Fig.2(b)depicts Raman spectra of the pure TiO 2 and Ag-loaded TiO 2 NWs samples.The characteristics bands of TiO 2 NPs and TiO 2 NWs samples have similar reflections, and the peaks are relatively sharp and stronger than the Ag-loaded TiO 2 NWs samples.In pure TiO 2 , the intense Raman signals with E g(1) mode appeared at 143 cm A1 followed by low intense modes E g(2) and E g(3) located at 196 cm A1 and 635 cm A1 , respectively.B 1g peak appeared at 394 cm A1 and (A 1g B 1g ) reflected as a single merged peak at 511 cm A1 .All these peaks reveal the characteristics of the pure anatase phase of TiO 221.The Raman spectra of Ag-NPs loaded TiO 2 NWs samples are identical to that of the pure TiO 2 NWs, which clearly indicated that the TiO 2 retained its structure after incorporation of these metals.However, Ag NPs relating signals were not identified because of the relatively low concentrations and due to the weak Raman scattering of these metals.However, changes are obvious in the position and width of the Ag NPs modified TiO 2 peaks.With the loading of Ag NPs, the Raman band E g(1) is slightly shifted towards higher wavenumber, Raman band B 1g and E g(3) was broadened and their intensities were reduced.This indicated that the interaction between Ag-NPs and TiO 2 NWs affected the Raman resonance of the TiO 2 .These observations have confirmed successful deposition of Ag-NPs over the TiO 2 NWs surface without any phase change.The morphology of Ag-NPs-loaded TiO 2 NWs is examined using TEM as illustrated in Fig.3.Fig.3(a-c) show uniform distribution of Ag-NPs over the surface of TiO 2 NWs.The TiO 2 NWs detected were of different size with diameter in the range of 20-50 nm.The particle size distribution of Ag-NPs is depicted in Fig.3(b), which revealed Ag-NPs are very fine, with diameter range of 1.3-14 nm.Two mean diameters were detected with their values of 2 nm and 8 nm, respectively.The amounts of large size plasmonic Ag-NPs existing in the sample are approximately the same as the small size Ag-NPs.More importantly, the small size Ag-NPs presented over the TiO 2 NWs surface can serve as electrons sink to promote the charges separation.Fig.3(d) exhibits the crystal structure of the Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs hybrids measured using a high resolution TEM.The spacing between two adjacent lattice fringes to (101) plane of anatase TiO 2 and (111) plane of Ag-NP were 0.35 nm and 0.24 nm, respectively.The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the pure TiO 2 , TiO 2 NWs and Ag-NPs modified TiO 2 NWs samples are depicted in Fig.4.The isotherms of the pure TiO 2 , TiO 2 NWs and Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs are similar to type IV curve with the hysteresis loops which is the characteristics of mesoporous materials.The BET surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of the TiO 2 , TiO 2 NWs and modified TiO 2 Fig. 4.

Fig. 9(a) depicts the continuous production of CO over Ag-NPs loaded TiO 2 NWs under UV-light and visible-light irradiation at different reaction times.Evidently, different amounts of CO were produced during photo-induced CO 2 -hydrogen reactions under UV-light and visible-light of different intensities.The UV-light irradiation can produce more electron-hole pairs over the TiO 2 surface due to short wavelength Fig. 9.

Upon UV irradiation to photocatalyst, electron-hole pairs are induced in TiO 2 photocatalyst.The photo-generated electrons, have high affinity to be trapped by Ag.In later stages, electrons are supposedly captured by CO 2 in the present of cationic H 2 , results in the reduction of CO 2 to CO.Under visible light, due to localized SPR of Ag-NPs, incident visible light induced the electric field in large size Ag-NPs and electrons could have been injected to TiO 2 CB for its excitation.Simultaneously, electrons could be captured by small size Ag-NPs, thus an effective charge separation can be achieved.This size dependent effect of Ag-NPs has significant contribution in production and separation of charges under visible light irradiations.This resulted in enhanced TiO 2 NWs photoactivity towards CO 2 reduction to CO under visible light irradiation.The electrons on Ag-NPs are then injected to CO 2 for its reduction while holes are consumed for H 2 oxidation.The produced hydrogen radicals together with the electrons reduced CO 2 to CO, CH 3 OH and CH 4 .The production of CO as the main product was due to reverse water gas shift reaction and evidently due to difference in kinetic rates for CO 2 reduction products.Therefore, the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Ag-NPs-promoted TiO 2 NWs core-shell hetero-junction can be attributed to synergistic effect of Ag-NPs toward efficient visible-light absorption and electron sinks for selective photoinduced CO 2 -to-CO conversion."}, {"llm generation": "UV, Visible light", "source": "The Ag-NPs deposited TiO 2 NWs core-shell hetero-junction was successfully investigated for selective CO 2 photoreduction to CO under UV and visible light irradiations.", "context": "The Ag-NPs deposited TiO 2 NWs core-shell hetero-junction was successfully investigated for selective CO 2 photoreduction to CO under UV and visible light irradiations.The photocatalytic CO evolution rates were significantly enhanced in the presence of Ag-NPs as a shell on TiO 2 NWs.The CO production rate is up to 983 mmole g-catal.A1 h A1 at selectivity 98 and apparent quantum yield of 0.15.The other products detected in adequate amounts were CH 4 and CH 3 OH.Stability test confirmed prolonged stability of Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs for selective CO production under visible light irradiations.The improved photocatalytic activity of Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs is ascribed to the synergic effect, charger transfer property and the SPR effect of Ag-NPs."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Mercury", "source": "The solution was photo-irradiated for 15 min using 200 W Hg lamp of light intensity 150 mW/cm 2 at wavelength 252 nm to get gray precipitations.", "context": "The TiO 2 NWs were prepared via a facile synthesis route according to our previous work 38.Typically, 1 g of TiO 2 powder was suspended in 8 M NaOH solution, stirred for 10 min and then transferred into 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave.The solution was stirred continuously at 110 C for 2 h using a stirred tank reactor and then cooled to room temperature.The solids obtained were washed with deionized water and 0.1 M HCl several times to reach pH below 9.After being dried, the products were calcined at 500 C for 5 h.Ag-NPs coated over TiO 2 NWs were prepared by photo-deposition method and the amount of Ag-NPs in each sample was controlled by the concentration of AgNO 3 solution.For the deposition of silver (Ag-NPs) on the TiO 2 NWs, 0.50 g of TiO 2 powder was dispersed in 20 mL of water and then a certain volume of 0.025 M AgNO 3 solution was added into it.The solution was photo-irradiated for 15 min using 200 W Hg lamp of light intensity 150 mW/cm 2 at wavelength 252 nm to get gray precipitations.The precipitates obtained were filtered, dried and calcined at 500 C for 5 h.The different volumes of AgNO 3 solution were used to get Ag loading in TiO 2 of 1, 2, 3 and 5 wt., respectively.The pure TiO 2 NWs were synthesized using the same procedure.The schematic illustrations for fabrication of Ag-NPs loaded TiO 2 NWs is depicted shown in Fig. 1.
