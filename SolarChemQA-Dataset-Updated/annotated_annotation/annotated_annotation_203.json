Concerning crystalline materials, the correlation between the absorption edge and the anatase crystallite-size was revealed.Further the strong dependence of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction on the anatase crystallite-size was also observed. The fact that the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 can take place inside porous structure, even in small pores, can be proved, however, it strongly depends on the morphology of pores. It is worth a mention that despite the fact that gold doping of both parent photocatalysts did not result in enhancement of their photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction, the novel findings in relation to photocatalysts physicochemical and optical prosperties were found.

AuCl 3 was used like noble metal precursor.The appropriate amount of AuCl 3 was dissolved in distilled water under short-term ultrasonication (approximately 2 min).The Au-enriched solution was mixed with the parent photocatalyst in the ratio of 6 ml H 2 O per 1.5 g of the catalyst.The as-prepared mixture was slowly rotary evaporated at 30 C under vacuum 10 Torr.After impregnation the Au-enriched photocatalysts were left on air for 1 h, then dried in the oven at 105 C for 1 h followed by calcination up to 450 C.After re-calcination 0.4 wt. Au/TiO 2 and 0.4 wt. Au/TiO 2 -ZrO 2 photocatalysts were grained to particle size 0.160mm. Commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic. Photocatalysts were characterized by organic elementary analysis (OEA), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS), N 2 physisorption, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy combined with electron diffraction (TEM/SEAD) and UV-vis spectroscopy. The purity (elementary carbon in weight ) of photocatalysts was specified on the Vario EL III apparatus from Elementar.5 mg of photocatalyst was burned in oxygen atmosphere at temperature up to 1200 C. Gaseous products (N 2 , CO 2 , H 2 O and SO 2 ) were purified, separated to individual components and analyzed on TCD detector.For each photocatalyst the analysis was triplicated.The detection limit of the apparatus was 0.1 abs.. Gold in Au-enriched photocatalysts was quantified on the ICP MS instrument Element II.Samples were leached in aqua regia solution, standing at room temperature for 1 h, then refluxing in order to remove nitrogen oxides.Operating conditions of the instruments were set up according to the manufacturer recommendation.The mass calibration was performed using commercial mas-cal solution (Merck).Quantification was done using the isotope 197Au with 115 In internal standard. N 2 physisorption was performed on the ASAP 2020 Micromeritics after sample degassing at 105 C for 24 h under less than 1 Pa vacuum.The adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured by nitrogen at -196 C. The specific surface area, S BET , was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory for the p/p 0 range 0.05-0.25 46.The mesopore surface area, S meso , and the micropore volume, V micro , were evaluated by t-plot method using Lecloux-Pirard standard isotherm with C constant 47,48.The total pore volume, V total , was determined from nitrogen adsorption isotherm at maximum p/p 0 (0.995).Pore size distribution (PSD) was evaluated from adsorption branch of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm using the BJH method 49 via the Roberts algorithm 50, the empirical Lecloux-Pirard standard isotherm and the assumption of the cylindrical pore geometry. The crystalline phases in the photocatalysts were determined by X-ray powder diffraction using Bruker D8 Advance 90 diffractometer in the Bragg-Brentano geometry, equipped with a V ANTEC 1 position-sensitive detector and using Ni-filtered CoK radiation.The crystallite-size was calculated using the Scherrer's equation.The NIST lanthanum 92 hexaboride (LaB 6 ) line profile standard was measured in the same experimental arrangement as investigated samples to characterize instrumental effects.The morphology of photocatalysts was studied by transmission electron microscopy in combination with electron diffraction using EM-201 transmission electron microscope from Philips. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of examined photocatalysts were measured by using GBS CINTRA 303 spectrometer equipped with a Spectralon-coated integrating sphere using a Spectralon coated discs as a standard.The spectra were recorded in the range of the wavelength 190-850 nm (lamps switched at 350 nm).The reflectances were re-calculated to the absorption using the Schuster-Kubelka-Munk equation, where R is the diffuse reflectance from a semi-infinite layer.Obtained spectra were transformed to the dependencies (F(R )h ) 2 against h and assuming that the Tauc's law 51 can be expressed as: , where the 0 -the energy of absorption edge values were determined from obtained plots, h is the Planck constant and is a frequency.The absorption edge was estimated by extrapolating the decreasing portion of the spectrum to the abscissa at zero absorption as it was shown in our other studies 41,43. The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in an apparatus composed of a stirred batch annular reactor with a suspended catalyst illuminated by UV 8 W Hg lamps (254 nm and 365 nm wavelength).The spectra profiles of used lamps are shown in Fig. 1.The gas chromatograph, equipped with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors, was used for the analysis of gaseous reaction products. The details of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction experiment and analytical methods were described in our previous publication 41.As published recently a suitable volume of the liquid phase was set in our annular photoreactor at 100 ml to fullfil the requirement of perfect mixing 40.The 0.2 mol l -1 NaOH was used as the reduction medium. The accuracy of measurements was verified by the series of repeated measurements.Average values mentioned in this article were calculated minimally from 3 times repeated photocatalytic measurement for each catalyst.The maximum relative error was 10.The relative error of the photocatalytic measurement covers the error of analyzing system itself (GC/FID/TCD, commonly acceptable relative error of 5), the error caused by handle taking of gas sample from the reactor by using gastight syringe, handle sampling to the gas chromatograph and the catalyst inhomogeneity (especially in the case of Au supported catalysts)."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Based on the results of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, shown through total amount of all products over each catalyst after 24 h, can be charged that mixed oxide TiO 2 -ZrO 2 exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than pure TiO 2 under the 254 nm UV-lamp.", "context": "Prepared Au supported TiO 2 and TiO 2 -ZrO 2 and their parent counterparts were tested for the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.Au/TiO 2 -ZrO 2 photocatalyst was investigated for this type of reaction for the first time.For preparation of examined photocatalysts the sol-gel process controlled within reverse micelles of non-ionic surfactant Triton X-114 and the impregnation under vacuum were used.

Gold in Au-enriched photocatalysts was quantified on the ICP MS instrument Element II.Samples were leached in aqua regia solution, standing at room temperature for 1 h, then refluxing in order to remove nitrogen oxides.Operating conditions of the instruments were set up according to the manufacturer recommendation.The mass calibration was performed using commercial mas-cal solution (Merck).Quantification was done using the isotope 197Au with 115 In internal standard. N 2 physisorption was performed on the ASAP 2020 Micromeritics after sample degassing at 105 C for 24 h under less than 1 Pa vacuum.The adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured by nitrogen at -196 C.

The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in an apparatus composed of a stirred batch annular reactor with a suspended catalyst illuminated by UV 8 W Hg lamps (254 nm and 365 nm wavelength).The spectra profiles of used lamps are shown in Fig. 1.The gas chromatograph, equipped with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors, was used for the analysis of gaseous reaction products. The details of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction experiment and analytical methods were described in our previous publication 41.As published recently a suitable volume of the liquid phase was set in our annular photoreactor at 100 ml to fullfil the requirement of perfect mixing 40.The 0.2 mol l -1 NaOH was used as the reduction medium. The accuracy of measurements was verified by the series of repeated measurements.Average values mentioned in this article were calculated minimally from 3 times repeated photocatalytic measurement for each catalyst.The maximum relative error was 10.The relative error of the photocatalytic measurement covers the error of analyzing system itself (GC/FID/TCD, commonly acceptable relative error of 5), the error caused by handle taking of gas sample from the reactor by using gastight syringe, handle sampling to the gas chromatograph and the catalyst inhomogeneity (especially in the case of Au supported catalysts)."}], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in an apparatus composed of a stirred batch annular reactor with a suspended catalyst illuminated by UV 8 W Hg lamps (254 nm and 365 nm wavelength).", "context": "Parent TiO 2 photocatalyst and TiO 2 -ZrO 2 photocatalyst (in molar ratio of 50:50) were prepared by the sol-gel method controlled in reverse micelar solution of nonionic surfactant Triton X-114 in cyclohexane in combination with the calcination 44,45.Titanium (IV) isopropoxide and 70 wt.solution of zirconium (IV) propoxide in propan-2-ol were used as metal sources.For synthesis of TiO 2 the molar ratio of cyclohexane:Triton X-114:water:Ti(isop) 4 was kept 11:1:1:1 44.For synthesis of TiO 2 -ZrO 2 the molar ratio of cyclohexane:Triton X-114:water:Ti(isop) 4 :Zr(prop) 4 was set to be 11:1:1:0.5:0.5 45.The prepared sols were poured in thin layer on Petri dishes and left for 48 h on air at ambient temperature and pressure.The sols converted into rigid gels.The titania and titania-zirconia gels were thermally treated at 400 C for 4 h and then up to 450 C for 20 min with heating rate 1 C/min with the aim to produce the powdery form of photocatalysts.Both parent photocatalysts were grained to particle size 0.160mm and a part of each was impregnated by 0.4 wt. of Au. AuCl 3 was used like noble metal precursor.The appropriate amount of AuCl 3 was dissolved in distilled water under short-term ultrasonication (approximately 2 min).The Au-enriched solution was mixed with the parent photocatalyst in the ratio of 6 ml H 2 O per 1.5 g of the catalyst.The as-prepared mixture was slowly rotary evaporated at 30 C under vacuum 10 Torr.After impregnation the Au-enriched photocatalysts were left on air for 1 h, then dried in the oven at 105 C for 1 h followed by calcination up to 450 C.After re-calcination 0.4 wt. Au/TiO 2 and 0.4 wt. Au/TiO 2 -ZrO 2 photocatalysts were grained to particle size 0.160mm. Commercial TiO 2 Evonic P25 was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic. Photocatalysts were characterized by organic elementary analysis (OEA), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS), N 2 physisorption, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy combined with electron diffraction (TEM/SEAD) and UV-vis spectroscopy. The purity (elementary carbon in weight ) of photocatalysts was specified on the Vario EL III apparatus from Elementar.5 mg of photocatalyst was burned in oxygen atmosphere at temperature up to 1200 C. Gaseous products (N 2 , CO 2 , H 2 O and SO 2 ) were purified, separated to individual components and analyzed on TCD detector.For each photocatalyst the analysis was triplicated.The detection limit of the apparatus was 0.1 abs.. Gold in Au-enriched photocatalysts was quantified on the ICP MS instrument Element II.Samples were leached in aqua regia solution, standing at room temperature for 1 h, then refluxing in order to remove nitrogen oxides.Operating conditions of the instruments were set up according to the manufacturer recommendation.The mass calibration was performed using commercial mas-cal solution (Merck).Quantification was done using the isotope 197Au with 115 In internal standard. N 2 physisorption was performed on the ASAP 2020 Micromeritics after sample degassing at 105 C for 24 h under less than 1 Pa vacuum.The adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured by nitrogen at -196 C. The specific surface area, S BET , was calculated according to the classical Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory for the p/p 0 range 0.05-0.25 46.The mesopore surface area, S meso , and the micropore volume, V micro , were evaluated by t-plot method using Lecloux-Pirard standard isotherm with C constant 47,48.The total pore volume, V total , was determined from nitrogen adsorption isotherm at maximum p/p 0 (0.995).Pore size distribution (PSD) was evaluated from adsorption branch of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm using the BJH method 49 via the Roberts algorithm 50, the empirical Lecloux-Pirard standard isotherm and the assumption of the cylindrical pore geometry.
