The crystal phases of synthesized samples were tested by X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation.The surface chemical compositions and valence band (VB) spectra were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250xi, USA) with Al Ka radiation source.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Phillips Model CM200) were employed to detect the surface characteristic of the samples.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area was analyzed by using N 2 adsorptionedesorption analysis at 77K on a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ-AG instrument.Ultraviolet visible diffuse reflection spectra (UV-vis DRS) was conducted at room temperature on a spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-3600, Japan) to measure the optical absorption properties.Photoluminescence (PL) characteristics were investigated with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4600) at an excitation wavelength of 300 nm. The CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activity was conducted in a gas phase flow reactor (Labsolar-6A, Beijing Perfect Light Company, China) and a 300 W Xenon-arc lamp was used as the light source.Firstly, 50 mg sample was dissolved in 100 mL deionized water at room temperature with uniform stirring.The reaction tank was vacuum treated and filled with 101 kPa pure CO 2 (99.99) to achieve the adsorptionedesorption equilibrium before the illumination and the reactor temperature was sustained at 25 C with a coolant system.The reaction products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-2010 Plus, SHIMADZU, Japan) for 6 h (analyze per hour). Photoelectrochemical measurements including Mott-Schottky, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photo-current responses analysis were carried out on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, ShanghaiChenhua Instrument Co., Ltd., China).A standard three-electrode system was immersed in a 0.5 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution, the Pt and Ag/ AgCl plate electrodes were used as the counter and reference electrode, and the working electrode was prepared by the following steps: 20 mg photocatalyst was dissolved in 2 mL ethanol, then the solution was dropped on the FTO glass (1 cm A 1 cm) with a small dropper.The EIS and photocurrent tests were tested with Xe arc lamp (300 W).The Mott-Schottky measurement was taken at two frequencies of 1000 and 500 Hz, respectively."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2", "source": "The crystalline quality and the crystallite sizes of pristine TiO 2 and Sm-TiO 2 were examined using XRD (Fig. 1).", "context": "The crystalline quality and the crystallite sizes of pristine TiO 2 and Sm-TiO 2 were examined using XRD (Fig. 1).As presented in Fig. 1, all the photocatalysts show crystalline phases of anatase. 32hree peaks at 2q 14 25.3 , 37.7 and 48.1 were detected, which are corresponding to the TiO 2 diffraction planes (JCPDS 21e1272) of (101) (004) and ( 200) respectively.Only the anatase phase is observed in all photocatalyst samples, and no characteristic diffraction peak of Sm 2 O 3 is observed, which indicates that Sm can enter the lattice of TiO 2 . 31,33It is also found that the diffraction peak of the anatase phase in all the TiO 2 (Sm-doped) becomes broader and weaker as the amount of Sm increases, compared with the pristine TiO 2 , suggesting that the Sm dopant has an inhibitory effect on the growth of anatase particles. 34The Debye-Scherrer equation was used to calculate the crystal parameters of all samples, 35 and the results are listed in Table 1.Obviously, the particle size of Smdoped TiO 2 is smaller than that of pure TiO 2 , and decreases with increasing Sm content.This may be due to the distortion of the TiO 2 lattice after Sm incorporation, leading to an accumulation of strain energy.In addition, the Sm ions that have not entered the crystal lattice could form other compounds at the crystal interface and in the lattice gap, preventing the occurrence of phase transitions and grain growth. 36e XPS test was used to investigate the chemical state of constituent elements in pure TiO 2 and Sm-TiO 2 .The results of pure TiO 2 and 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 2 the existence of Ti 4 .The binding energy positions of Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 in Sm-TiO 2 show a small shift to higher binding energy (about 0.1 eV) compared with pure TiO 2 , which may be attributed to the lower Fermi level of Sm than TiO 2 , so the electrons on the CB of TiO 2 may transfer to Sm species on its surface, resulting in a decrease in electron density around the titanium atom. 37As exhibited in Fig. 2(c), the peak at 529.7 eV belongs to lattice oxygen (O 2A ), and the peak at around 531.5 eV corresponds to surface hydroxyl oxygen. 38The C 1s XPS spectra of TiO 2 and 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 2(d), the main peaks at 284.7, 285.9 and 288.8 eV should be attributed to CeC/CC, CeOeC and CO bonds, respectively. 39,40ccording to Fig. 2(e), three peaks are observed at 1083.5 eV (Sm 3d 5/2 ) and 1110.6 eV (Sm 3d 3/2 ), respectively, which are corresponding to Sm 3 and Sm 2 .41e45 As well known, the empty orbit of Sm 3 can capture photo-generated electrons and become Sm 2 , but Sm 2 is unstable and the electrons are very easy to transfer and captured by O 2 on the catalyst surface. 45,46This approach hinders the recombination of photogenerated electronehole pairs, which improves photocatalytic performance. 47he microstructure of 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 sample were investigated by TEM.Fig. 3(a) exhibits that the quasi-spherical nanoparticles are relatively uniform with an average particle size of about 11 nm, which is well consistent with the crystal size calculated by the Scherrer equation (Table 1).But there is a serious aggregation phenomenon in 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 sample.As shown in Fig. 3(b), the lattice fringe spacings of 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 are 0.251 and 0.343 nm, corresponding to (001) and (101) planes of TiO 2 (anatase).Meanwhile, the mappings of all elements were used to determine the elements in 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 (Fig. 3(c)).The corresponding mapping images reveal the existence of C, O, Ti and Sm elements, which suggests the elements of 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 are uniformly distributed on the surface. The textural properties of pure TiO 2 and Sm-TiO 2 were tested with nitrogen adsorptionedesorption method.As exhibited in Fig. 4, the isotherms of all catalysts exhibit typical Type IV adsorption behaviors of mesoporous materials.The BET analysis results of the prepared samples are listed in Table 1.It can be clearly seen that the specific surface area of TiO 2 is greatly enhanced after Sm doping, which increases to 84.01 m 2 /g (for 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 ) from 35.91 m 2 /g (for pure TiO 2 ).However, as the Sm content further increases, the specific surface area would decrease, which may be ascribed to the blocking effect of Sm on the pores of TiO 2 . 48The BJH pore size distribution (insert in Fig. 4) of all photocatalyst samples is in the range of 3.3e5.6nm. The optical absorption features of all photocatalyst samples were tested in the region of 250e650 nm.The absorption capacities of all Sm-TiO 2 samples are greatly enhanced in UV and visible regions (400 nm) as exhibited in Fig. 5(a), and a significant red shift of the absorption spectra is detected at the threshold wavelength.This might be due to defect level in the band gap created by Sm dopant, 23,49 which can act as traps for trapping electrons.To our knowledge, the defect levels located between the conduction band and the valence band could capture photo-generated electrons in the valence band.Therefore, the electrons in the valence band only need to absorb photons with less energy to jump to these defect levels, and then absorb the photons with less energy and transfer to the conduction band for indirect conversion.This means that the introduction of defect levels shortens the distance between the valence band and the conduction band, narrowing the energy band and causing a red shift in the wavelength. 50,51The optical band gap energies of all catalysts were calculated by function of K-M with linear extrapolation (Fig. 5(b)).The E g values of all samples were calculated and are demonstrated in Table 1 pristine TiO 2 , the Sm-TiO 2 samples show a smaller band gap energies ranging from 2.95 to 3.03 eV. The PL spectra were recorded to figure out the electronic properties of all the catalysts under the excitation of 325 nm.As shown in Fig. 6, all the catalysts demonstrate the similar shapes with a strong and wide luminescence signal.This means that the introduction of Sm in the sample does not cause new luminescence but affect the intensity of the spectrum.The three main characteristic peaks appear at about 416, 451 and 467 nm, which belong to excitation emission of TiO 2 nanoparticles.Compared with the pure TiO 2 , the PL spectrum intensities of the Sm-TiO 2 samples are obviously weakened due to the shallow traps caused by the introduction of new defect levels and lattice defects after Sm doping, which could trap photo-generated electrons and promote the separation of electrons and holes.Therefore, the proper amount of Sm ions can effectively inhibit the recombination of electronehole pairs.The weakest PL intensity is found on 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 catalyst, indicating that this catalyst has the lowest electrons and holes recombination probability, which is in good accordance with the photocatalytic performance. To further understand the Sm doping effect on charge transfer in TiO 2 catalyst, the photocurrent responses of TiO 2 and sample 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 were tested.Fig. 7(a) exhibits the transient photocurrent responses of in six on-off cycles.The photocurrent responses of pure TiO 2 and 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 in the light is reversible and stable.The max photocurrent of the 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 is 0.67 mA/cm 2 , which is nearly 2 times that of pure TiO 2 (0.32 mA/cm 2 ).The EIS was studied to obtain charge separation efficiency, as exhibited in Fig. 7(b).Obviously, 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 demonstrates smaller semicircles than pure TiO 2 , suggesting it has high efficient charge separation.These results indicate the doping of Sm could improve the transfer rate of electrons in 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 sample. The CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activities were tested under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe arc lamp for 6 h.Three kinds of restrained experiments were investigated: (1) photocatalyst without the light source, (2) under light irradiation without photocatalyst and (3) under light source without CO 2 .No products were detected in comparative experiment, suggesting that the photocatalytic process could not go on without photocatalysts, sunlight or CO 2 .Fig. 8(a,b) demonstrate the CO and CH 4 yields of samples along with the time of irradiation.The CO and CH 4 yields increase with increasing exposure time, and the biggest yield is reached after the exposure for 6 h.The biggest yields of CO and CH 4 (0.5 Sm-TiO 2 ) are 55.47 and 3.82 mmol/gcat, respectively, which are probably 5.02 and 2.67 times higher than that of pristine TiO 2 .All the Sm-doped TiO 2 samples exhibit better photocatalytic performace than pure TiO 2 in Fig. 8(c), which could be attributed to the improved absorption of visible light, lower charge recombination rate and narrowed band gap.In addition, the presence of Sm 2 ions in the sample could capture photoelectrons, thereby suppress the recombination of electronehole pairs and improving the photocatalytic properties of TiO 2 .Obviously, the efficiency of photoreduction of CO 2 firstly increases and then decreases with the increase of Sm doping amount, which may be attributed to the fact that part of Sm ions act as a new recombination center.In addition, the Sm ions in the crystal lattice are deposited on the TiO 2 surface due to saturation, which hinders the photocatalytic reaction, resulting in a decrease in photoactivity. In addition to efficiency, stability is also a significant aspect that needs to be studied.The 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 sample was investigated for 3 cycles (6 h each cycle) to assess its stability in photocatalytic reaction.Its activity has no significant change after irradiation for 18 h in Fig. 9, and this result indicates that the 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 sample is relatively stable during the process of irradiation. Possible mechanism.To further consider the possible mechanism of photo-generated carriers, the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) positions of pristine TiO 2 need to be figured out.The pristine TiO 2 flat-band potential was calculated by Mott-Schottky equation and is demonstrated in Fig. 10(a).The TiO 2 flat potential is evaluated to be A0.55 V versus the electrode of Ag/AgCl (pH 14 7), which is equal to A0.35 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, pH 14 7).It is obvious that the slope of the plot is positive, reflecting that TiO 2 is an n-type semiconductor, which is consistent with the description of the literature. 52,53It is known that the value of the flat potential is approximately equal to that of the Fermi level, 54e57 so the Fermi level of TiO 2 is equal to the flat potential (A0.35 V).In addition, the VB-XPS of TiO 2 is exhibited in Fig. 10(b).Obviously, the value of pure TiO 2 between Fermi level and VB is 2.66 eV.Consequently, the VB potential for TiO 2 is about 2.31 eV.Hence, the TiO 2 CB edge is found to be A0.8V due to the band gap obtained from the test of UV (3.11 eV).The reduction potentials for CO and CH 4 are A0.52 and A0.24 V, respectively, 58 which suggest that the TiO 2 photo-generated holes and electrons could reduce CO 2 with H 2 O under irradiation. To better figure out the process of CO 2 photocatalytic, we propose the CO 2 photo-reduction mechanism on Sm/TiO 2 samples based on the characterization results.The feasible reaction pathways in the process of CO 2 reduction can be written as follows. As exhibited in Fig. 11, a large amount of holes and electrons are produced in VB and CB as the absorption of photon energy is greater or equal to the TiO 2 band gap energy (hv !E bg ) (reactions (1)).The CB edge that formed mainly by the Ti 3d state has a higher energy level than that of the CO 2 /CH 4 and CO 2 /CO, so the electrons on the CB are transferred to the absorbed CO 2 to produce CO and CH 4 (Eqs.( 3) and ( 4)).While the VB of TiO 2 with a lower energy level than the O 2 /H 2 O potential, mainly formed by the O 2p states, is sufficient to oxidize water (Eq.( 2)).As can be seen from Fig. 8(c), the individual TiO 2 nanoparticles (without doping Sm) could absorb light and reduce CO 2 to CO and CH 4 with a relatively low efficiency due to the fast recombination of electronehole pairs.Compared with pure TiO 2 , the photo-generated electrons in TiO 2 tend to migrate to shallow defect levels caused by Sm doping, while a part of them may be trapped by the valence change from Sm 3 to Sm 2 (Eq.( 5)), which promotes the separation of photoelectron and holes.The improved electron transfer process is very favorable for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion, resulting in a greatly increased reduction product formation rate.Besides, these trapped electrons are easily transferred and absorbed by O 2 on the surface of the catalyst (reactions (6))."}, {"llm generation": "Sm-TiO2",

pristine TiO 2 and Sm-TiO 2 were examined using XRD (Fig. 1).As presented in Fig. 1, all the photocatalysts show crystalline phases of anatase. 32hree peaks at 2q 14 25.3 , 37.7 and 48.1 were detected, which are corresponding to the TiO 2 diffraction planes (JCPDS 21e1272) of (101) (004) and ( 200) respectively.Only the anatase phase is observed in all photocatalyst samples, and no characteristic diffraction peak of Sm 2 O 3 is observed, which indicates that Sm can enter the lattice of TiO 2 . 31,33It is also found that the diffraction peak of the anatase phase in all the TiO 2 (Sm-doped) becomes broader and weaker as the amount of Sm increases, compared with the pristine TiO 2 , suggesting that the Sm dopant has an inhibitory effect on the growth of anatase particles. 34The Debye-Scherrer equation was used to calculate the crystal parameters of all samples, 35 and the results are listed in Table 1.Obviously, the particle size of Smdoped TiO 2 is smaller than that of pure TiO 2 , and decreases with increasing Sm content.This may be due to the distortion of the TiO 2 lattice after Sm incorporation, leading to an accumulation of strain energy.In addition, the Sm ions that have not entered the crystal lattice could form other compounds at the crystal interface and in the lattice gap, preventing the occurrence of phase transitions and grain growth. 36e XPS test was used to investigate the chemical state of constituent elements in pure TiO 2 and Sm-TiO 2 .The results of pure TiO 2 and 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 2 the existence of Ti 4 .The binding energy positions of Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 in Sm-TiO 2 show a small shift to higher binding energy (about 0.1 eV) compared with pure TiO 2 , which may be attributed to the lower Fermi level of Sm than TiO 2 , so the electrons on the CB of TiO 2 may transfer to Sm species on its surface, resulting in a decrease in electron density around the titanium atom. 37As exhibited in Fig. 2(c), the peak at 529.7 eV belongs to lattice oxygen (O 2A ), and the peak at around 531.5 eV corresponds to surface hydroxyl oxygen. 38The C 1s XPS spectra of TiO 2 and 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 2(d), the main peaks at 284.7, 285.9 and 288.8 eV should be attributed to CeC/CC, CeOeC and CO bonds, respectively. 39,40ccording to Fig. 2(e), three peaks are observed at 1083.5 eV (Sm 3d 5/2 ) and 1110.6 eV (Sm 3d 3/2 ), respectively, which are corresponding to Sm 3 and Sm 2 .41e45 As well known, the empty orbit of Sm 3 can capture photo-generated electrons and become Sm 2 , but Sm 2 is unstable and the electrons are very easy to transfer and captured by O 2 on the catalyst surface. 45,46This approach hinders the recombination of photogenerated electronehole pairs, which improves photocatalytic performance. 47he microstructure of 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 sample were investigated by TEM.Fig. 3(a) exhibits that the quasi-spherical nanoparticles are relatively uniform with an average particle size of about 11 nm, which is well consistent with the crystal size calculated by the Scherrer equation (Table 1).But there is a serious aggregation phenomenon in 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 sample.As shown in Fig. 3(b), the lattice fringe spacings of 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 are 0.251 and 0.343 nm, corresponding to (001) and (101) planes of TiO 2 (anatase).Meanwhile, the mappings of all elements were used to determine the elements in 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 (Fig. 3(c)).The corresponding mapping images reveal the existence of C, O, Ti and Sm elements, which suggests the elements of 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 are uniformly distributed on the surface.

The optical absorption features of all photocatalyst samples were tested in the region of 250e650 nm.The absorption capacities of all Sm-TiO 2 samples are greatly enhanced in UV and visible regions (400 nm) as exhibited in Fig. 5(a), and a significant red shift of the absorption spectra is detected at the threshold wavelength.This might be due to defect level in the band gap created by Sm dopant, 23,49 which can act as traps for trapping electrons.To our knowledge, the defect levels located between the conduction band and the valence band could capture photo-generated electrons in the valence band.Therefore, the electrons in the valence band only need to absorb photons with less energy to jump to these defect levels, and then absorb the photons with less energy and transfer to the conduction band for indirect conversion.This means that the introduction of defect levels shortens the distance between the valence band and the conduction band, narrowing the energy band and causing a red shift in the wavelength. 50,51The optical band gap energies of all catalysts were calculated by function of K-M with linear extrapolation (Fig. 5(b)).The E g values of all samples were calculated and are demonstrated in Table 1 pristine TiO 2 , the Sm-TiO 2 samples show a smaller band gap energies ranging from 2.95 to 3.03 eV. The PL spectra were recorded to figure out the electronic properties of all the catalysts under the excitation of 325 nm.As shown in Fig. 6, all the catalysts demonstrate the similar shapes with a strong and wide luminescence signal.This means that the introduction of Sm in the sample does not cause new luminescence but affect the intensity of the spectrum.The three main characteristic peaks appear at about 416, 451 and 467 nm, which belong to excitation emission of TiO 2 nanoparticles.Compared with the pure TiO 2 , the PL spectrum intensities of the Sm-TiO 2 samples are obviously weakened due to the shallow traps caused by the introduction of new defect levels and lattice defects after Sm doping, which could trap photo-generated electrons and promote the separation of electrons and holes.Therefore, the proper amount of Sm ions can effectively inhibit the recombination of electronehole pairs.The weakest PL intensity is found on 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 catalyst, indicating that this catalyst has the lowest electrons and holes recombination probability, which is in good accordance with the photocatalytic performance. To further understand the Sm doping effect on charge transfer in TiO 2 catalyst, the photocurrent responses of TiO 2 and sample 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 were tested.Fig. 7(a) exhibits the transient photocurrent responses of in six on-off cycles.The photocurrent responses of pure TiO 2 and 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 in the light is reversible and stable.The max photocurrent of the 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 is 0.67 mA/cm 2 , which is nearly 2 times that of pure TiO 2 (0.32 mA/cm 2 ).The EIS was studied to obtain charge separation efficiency, as exhibited in Fig. 7(b).Obviously, 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 demonstrates smaller semicircles than pure TiO 2 , suggesting it has high efficient charge separation.These results indicate the doping of Sm could improve the transfer rate of electrons in 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 sample. The CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activities were tested under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe arc lamp for 6 h.Three kinds of restrained experiments were investigated: (1) photocatalyst without the light source, (2) under light irradiation without photocatalyst and (3) under light source without CO 2 .No products were detected in comparative experiment, suggesting that the photocatalytic process could not go on without photocatalysts, sunlight or CO 2 .Fig. 8(a,b) demonstrate the CO and CH 4 yields of samples along with the time of irradiation.The CO and CH 4 yields increase with increasing exposure time, and the biggest yield is reached after the exposure for 6 h.The biggest yields of CO and CH 4 (0.5 Sm-TiO 2 ) are 55.47 and 3.82 mmol/gcat, respectively, which are probably 5.02 and 2.67 times higher than that of pristine TiO 2 .All the Sm-doped TiO 2 samples exhibit better photocatalytic performace than pure TiO 2 in Fig. 8(c), which could be attributed to the improved absorption of visible light, lower charge recombination rate and narrowed band gap.In addition, the presence of Sm 2 ions in the sample could capture photoelectrons, thereby suppress the recombination of electronehole pairs and improving the photocatalytic properties of TiO 2 .Obviously, the efficiency of photoreduction of CO 2 firstly increases and then decreases with the increase of Sm doping amount, which may be attributed to the fact that part of Sm ions act as a new recombination center.In addition, the Sm ions in the crystal lattice are deposited on the TiO 2 surface due to saturation, which hinders the photocatalytic reaction, resulting in a decrease in photoactivity. In addition to efficiency, stability is also a significant aspect that needs to be studied.The 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 sample was investigated for 3 cycles (6 h each cycle) to assess its stability in photocatalytic reaction.Its activity has no significant change after irradiation for 18 h in Fig. 9, and this result indicates that the 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 sample is relatively stable during the process of irradiation. Possible mechanism.To further consider the possible mechanism of photo-generated carriers, the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) positions of pristine TiO 2 need to be figured out.The pristine TiO 2 flat-band potential was calculated by Mott-Schottky equation and is demonstrated in Fig. 10(a).The TiO 2 flat potential is evaluated to be A0.55 V versus the electrode of Ag/AgCl (pH 14 7), which is equal to A0.35 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, pH 14 7).It is obvious that the slope of the plot is positive, reflecting that TiO 2 is an n-type semiconductor, which is consistent with the description of the literature. 52,53It is known that the value of the flat potential is approximately equal to that of the Fermi level, 54e57 so the Fermi level of TiO 2 is equal to the flat potential (A0.35 V).In addition, the VB-XPS of TiO 2 is exhibited in Fig. 10(b).Obviously, the value of pure TiO 2 between Fermi level and VB is 2.66 eV.Consequently, the VB potential for TiO 2 is about 2.31 eV.Hence, the TiO 2 CB edge is found to be A0.8V due to the band gap obtained from the test of UV (3.11 eV).The reduction potentials for CO and CH 4 are A0.52 and A0.24 V, respectively, 58 which suggest that the TiO 2 photo-generated holes and electrons could reduce CO 2 with H 2 O under irradiation. To better figure out the process of CO 2 photocatalytic, we propose the CO 2 photo-reduction mechanism on Sm/TiO 2 samples based on the characterization results.The feasible reaction pathways in the process of CO 2 reduction can be written as follows. As exhibited in Fig. 11, a large amount of holes and electrons are produced in VB and CB as the absorption of photon energy is greater or equal to the TiO 2 band gap energy (hv !E bg ) (reactions (1)).The CB edge that formed mainly by the Ti 3d state has a higher energy level than that of the CO 2 /CH 4 and CO 2 /CO, so the electrons on the CB are transferred to the absorbed CO 2 to produce CO and CH 4 (Eqs.( 3) and ( 4)).While the VB of TiO 2 with a lower energy level than the O 2 /H 2 O potential, mainly formed by the O 2p states, is sufficient to oxidize water (Eq.( 2)).As can be seen from Fig. 8(c), the individual TiO 2 nanoparticles (without doping Sm) could absorb light and reduce CO 2 to CO and CH 4 with a relatively low efficiency due to the fast recombination of electronehole pairs.Compared with pure TiO 2 , the photo-generated electrons in TiO 2 tend to migrate to shallow defect levels caused by Sm doping, while a part of them may be trapped by the valence change from Sm 3 to Sm 2 (Eq.( 5)), which promotes the separation of photoelectron and holes.The improved electron transfer process is very favorable for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion, resulting in a greatly increased reduction product formation rate.Besides, these trapped electrons are easily transferred and absorbed by O 2 on the surface of the catalyst (reactions (6))."}, {"llm generation": "Sm-TiO2, TiO2", "source": "Fig. 1.XRD patterns of the pure and Sm-TiO 2 photocatalysts.", "context": "In conclusion, the Sm-TiO 2 nanoparticles are simply prepared by sol-gel process and investigated for CO 2 photocatalytic performance.The maximum CO and CH 4 yields (0.5 Sm-TiO 2 ) are 55.47 and 3.82 mmol/gcat, which are 5.02 and 2.67 times the yield of that pristine TiO 2 .The improved photocatalytic performance of 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 could be ascribed to the low recombination rate of photogenerated electron holes, high response of visible light and high specific surface area.Based on the reaction mechanism above, a part of the photoelectrons are absorbed by O 2 on the surface of the catalyst to form superoxide radicals ( O A 2 ) in the process of mutual transformation between Sm 3 and Sm 2 (reactions (5e6)).Although this process accelerates the separation of electron and holes, it also consumes part of the photo-generated electrons, which is not conducive to the formation of CH 4 .This study shows that the modification of TiO 2 photocatalyst with rare earth mental has a good application prospect.

The textural properties of pure TiO 2 and Sm-TiO 2 were tested with nitrogen adsorptionedesorption method.As exhibited in Fig. 4, the isotherms of all catalysts exhibit typical Type IV adsorption behaviors of mesoporous materials.The BET analysis results of the prepared samples are listed in Table 1.It can be clearly seen that the specific surface area of TiO 2 is greatly enhanced after Sm doping, which increases to 84.01 m 2 /g (for 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 ) from 35.91 m 2 /g (for pure TiO 2 ).However, as the Sm content further increases, the specific surface area would decrease, which may be ascribed to the blocking effect of Sm on the pores of TiO 2 . 48The BJH pore size distribution (insert in Fig. 4) of all photocatalyst samples is in the range of 3.3e5.6nm. The optical absorption features of all photocatalyst samples were tested in the region of 250e650 nm.The absorption capacities of all Sm-TiO 2 samples are greatly enhanced in UV and visible regions (400 nm) as exhibited in Fig. 5(a), and a significant red shift of the absorption spectra is detected at the threshold wavelength.This might be due to defect level in the band gap created by Sm dopant, 23,49 which can act as traps for trapping electrons.To our knowledge, the defect levels located between the conduction band and the valence band could capture photo-generated electrons in the valence band.Therefore, the electrons in the valence band only need to absorb photons with less energy to jump to these defect levels, and then absorb the photons with less energy and transfer to the conduction band for indirect conversion.This means that the introduction of defect levels shortens the distance between the valence band and the conduction band, narrowing the energy band and causing a red shift in the wavelength. 50,51The optical band gap energies of all catalysts were calculated by function of K-M with linear extrapolation (Fig. 5(b)).The E g values of all samples were calculated and are demonstrated in Table 1 pristine TiO 2 , the Sm-TiO 2 samples show a smaller band gap energies ranging from 2.95 to 3.03 eV. The PL spectra were recorded to figure out the electronic properties of all the catalysts under the excitation of 325 nm.As shown in Fig. 6, all the catalysts demonstrate the similar shapes with a strong and wide luminescence signal.This means that the introduction of Sm in the sample does not cause new luminescence but affect the intensity of the spectrum.The three main characteristic peaks appear at about 416, 451 and 467 nm, which belong to excitation emission of TiO 2 nanoparticles.Compared with the pure TiO 2 , the PL spectrum intensities of the Sm-TiO 2 samples are obviously weakened due to the shallow traps caused by the introduction of new defect levels and lattice defects after Sm doping, which could trap photo-generated electrons and promote the separation of electrons and holes.Therefore, the proper amount of Sm ions can effectively inhibit the recombination of electronehole pairs.The weakest PL intensity is found on 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 catalyst, indicating that this catalyst has the lowest electrons and holes recombination probability, which is in good accordance with the photocatalytic performance. To further understand the Sm doping effect on charge transfer in TiO 2 catalyst, the photocurrent responses of TiO 2 and sample 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 were tested.Fig. 7(a) exhibits the transient photocurrent responses of in six on-off cycles.The photocurrent responses of pure TiO 2 and 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 in the light is reversible and stable.The max photocurrent of the 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 is 0.67 mA/cm 2 , which is nearly 2 times that of pure TiO 2 (0.32 mA/cm 2 ).The EIS was studied to obtain charge separation efficiency, as exhibited in Fig. 7(b).Obviously, 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 demonstrates smaller semicircles than pure TiO 2 , suggesting it has high efficient charge separation.These results indicate the doping of Sm could improve the transfer rate of electrons in 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 sample. The CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activities were tested under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe arc lamp for 6 h.Three kinds of restrained experiments were investigated: (1) photocatalyst without the light source, (2) under light irradiation without photocatalyst and (3) under light source without CO 2 .No products were detected in comparative experiment, suggesting that the photocatalytic process could not go on without photocatalysts, sunlight or CO 2 .Fig. 8(a,b) demonstrate the CO and CH 4 yields of samples along with the time of irradiation.The CO and CH 4 yields increase with increasing exposure time, and the biggest yield is reached after the exposure for 6 h.The biggest yields of CO and CH 4 (0.5 Sm-TiO 2 ) are 55.47 and 3.82 mmol/gcat, respectively, which are probably 5.02 and 2.67 times higher than that of pristine TiO 2 .All the Sm-doped TiO 2 samples exhibit better photocatalytic performace than pure TiO 2 in Fig. 8(c), which could be attributed to the improved absorption of visible light, lower charge recombination rate and narrowed band gap.In addition, the presence of Sm 2 ions in the sample could capture photoelectrons, thereby suppress the recombination of electronehole pairs and improving the photocatalytic properties of TiO 2 .Obviously, the efficiency of photoreduction of CO 2 firstly increases and then decreases with the increase of Sm doping amount, which may be attributed to the fact that part of Sm ions act as a new recombination center.In addition, the Sm ions in the crystal lattice are deposited on the TiO 2 surface due to saturation, which hinders the photocatalytic reaction, resulting in a decrease in photoactivity. In addition to efficiency, stability is also a significant aspect that needs to be studied.The 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 sample was investigated for 3 cycles (6 h each cycle) to assess its stability in photocatalytic reaction.Its activity has no significant change after irradiation for 18 h in Fig. 9, and this result indicates that the 0.5 Sm-TiO 2 sample is relatively stable during the process of irradiation. Possible mechanism.To further consider the possible mechanism of photo-generated carriers, the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) positions of pristine TiO 2 need to be figured out.The pristine TiO 2 flat-band potential was calculated by Mott-Schottky equation and is demonstrated in Fig. 10(a).The TiO 2 flat potential is evaluated to be A0.55 V versus the electrode of Ag/AgCl (pH 14 7), which is equal to A0.35 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, pH 14 7).It is obvious that the slope of the plot is positive, reflecting that TiO 2 is an n-type semiconductor, which is consistent with the description of the literature. 52,53It is known that the value of the flat potential is approximately equal to that of the Fermi level, 54e57 so the Fermi level of TiO 2 is equal to the flat potential (A0.35 V).In addition, the VB-XPS of TiO 2 is exhibited in Fig. 10(b).Obviously, the value of pure TiO 2 between Fermi level and VB is 2.66 eV.Consequently, the VB potential for TiO 2 is about 2.31 eV.Hence, the TiO 2 CB edge is found to be A0.8V due to the band gap obtained from the test of UV (3.11 eV).The reduction potentials for CO and CH 4 are A0.52 and A0.24 V, respectively, 58 which suggest that the TiO 2 photo-generated holes and electrons could reduce CO 2 with H 2 O under irradiation. To better figure out the process of CO 2 photocatalytic, we propose the CO 2 photo-reduction mechanism on Sm/TiO 2 samples based on the characterization results.The feasible reaction pathways in the process of CO 2 reduction can be written as follows. As exhibited in Fig. 11, a large amount of holes and electrons are produced in VB and CB as the absorption of photon energy is greater or equal to the TiO 2 band gap energy (hv !E bg ) (reactions (1)).The CB edge that formed mainly by the Ti 3d state has a higher energy level than that of the CO 2 /CH 4 and CO 2 /CO, so the electrons on the CB are transferred to the absorbed CO 2 to produce CO and CH 4 (Eqs.( 3) and ( 4)).While the VB of TiO 2 with a lower energy level than the O 2 /H 2 O potential, mainly formed by the O 2p states, is sufficient to oxidize water (Eq.( 2)).As can be seen from Fig. 8(c), the individual TiO 2 nanoparticles (without doping Sm) could absorb light and reduce CO 2 to CO and CH 4 with a relatively low efficiency due to the fast recombination of electronehole pairs.Compared with pure TiO 2 , the photo-generated electrons in TiO 2 tend to migrate to shallow defect levels caused by Sm doping, while a part of them may be trapped by the valence change from Sm 3 to Sm 2 (Eq.( 5)), which promotes the separation of photoelectron and holes.The improved electron transfer process is very favorable for photocatalytic CO 2 conversion, resulting in a greatly increased reduction product formation rate.Besides, these trapped electrons are easily transferred and absorbed by O 2 on the surface of the catalyst (reactions (6))."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The CO 2 photocatalytic reduction activity was conducted in a gas phase flow reactor (Labsolar-6A, Beijing Perfect Light Company, China) and a 300 W Xenon-arc lamp was used as the light source.", "context": "Firstly, 10 mL tetrabutyl titanate was dissolved in 20 mL anhydrous ethanol under the water bath of 60 C, then 10 mL acetic acid was dissolved into the solution under 2 h magnetic stirring, the obtained solution was marked solution A.
