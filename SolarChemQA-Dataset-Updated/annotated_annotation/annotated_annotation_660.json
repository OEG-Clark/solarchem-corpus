The SEM observation for Ni3Ru-UiO-67 and Ru-UiO-67 shows that the loading of the Ni(II) complex does not affect the MOF morphology, and the MOF crystals remain intact in the composites (Fig. S9 online).The detailed nanostructure of the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 was further investigated by TEM.As shown in Fig. 2e, the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 shows an octahedral morphology, which is in good agreement with SEM observations.The elemental mapping analysis of Ni, S, Ru and Zr performed on an extended area of a solid sample of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 revealed that the elements were uniformly distributed inside the Ru-UiO-67, further attesting to the Ni(II) complex that was homogeneously encapsulated in the pores of the Ru-UiO-67.In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the UiO-67, Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 were conducted in an N 2 atmosphere (Fig. S10 online).Similar to the pristine Ru-UiO-67, the Ni1Ru-UiO-67, Ni2Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 also exhibited two decomposition steps at 50 to 400 C and 400 C, respectively.The weight loss decreases between 50 and 250 C, indicating that the Ni(II) complex replaces part of solvent molecules in the cage of the Ru-UiO-67. XPS was carried out to analyze the chemical compositions and binding environments of the samples.Note that the electron binding energy not only depends on the element itself but also the chemical state in samples 32.The XPS spectrum of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 in Fig. 3a displays the signatures of C, O, N, S, Ru and Ni.As shown in Fig. 3b, the high-resolution S 2p XPS spectrum displays two broad peaks at 164.0 and 168.8 eV pertaining to S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 , respectively 33.The S 2p peaks were attributed to the bound nickel-thiol species 34.A high-resolution XPS Ni 2p spectrum shows the peaks at 856.7 eV (Ni 2p 3/2 ) and 873.8 eV (Ni 2p 1/2 ) (Fig. 3c) 35, which corresponds to the peak position of Ni-S 36.As shown in Fig. 3a andd, the peaks at 484.7 eV (Ru 3p 3/2 ) and 462.6 eV (Ru 3p 1/2 ) in both Ru-UiO-67 and NiRu-UiO-67 are in agreement with the pattern of Ru 2 .All the above results demonstrate that Ni(II) complex was successfully encapsulated into the robust Ru-UiO-67., UV-vis spectra (c) and PL emission spectra (d) of UiO-67, Ru-UiO-67, Ni1Ru-UiO-67, Ni2Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 (k ex 446 nm, refer to its UV-vis spectrum).(e) TEM image of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 and elemental mapping of the various elements (Ni, S, Ru, and Zr) contained in Ni3Ru-UiO-67. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of NiRu-UiO-67 composites were performed in a closed gas circulation and evacuation system.Each of the catalyst (20 mg) was independently suspended in a mixture of DMF (27 mL), deionized water (3 mL), BIH (0.1 mol/L), and TEOA (0.5 mol/L), which was deoxygenated by CO 2 and irradiated with a LED light (82 W).BIH as a sacrificial reductant can efficiently quench the excited state of photosensitizer, whereas TEOA mainly functions as a proton acceptor for BIH 37.As shown in Fig. 4a, the generation of CO increases almost linearly with irradiation time upon 10 h.Ni3Ru-UiO-67 exhibits the CO evolution rate of 426.05 mmol/(g h) (85.21 mmol) with a catalytic turnover number (TON) of 510.0 (defined as n(CO)/n(Ni(bpet)(H 2 O) 2 ), which holds a high catalytic performance among reported MOF catalysts (Table S4 online) 38,39.Notably, only a negligible amount of H 2 could be detected (Fig. S11 online), and no formate was detected by HPLC analysis and 1 H NMR spectroscopy (Figs.S12 and S13 online).The CO evolution rates of 55.25 mmol/(mg h) (yield: 11.05 mmol, TON: 136.7) and 196.80 mmol/(g h) (yield: 39.36 mmol, TON: 317.5) were obtained for Ni1Ru-UiO-67 and Ni2Ru-UiO-67, respectively.After 20 h irradiation, the TON of CO production of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 was reached 581 with CO selectivity of 99 (calculated as TON (CO)/TON(CO H 2 )), indicating that Ni3Ru-UiO-67 can photo-reduce CO 2 to CO selectively.Control experiments only with BIH or TEOA of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 showed the TON for CO were 216.1 and 60.7, respectively (Fig. 4b), suggesting that TEOA is advantageous for reduction of CO 2 .As previously reported 40, BIH can dramatically enhanced TON in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction because of its high reductive ability, fast deprotonation of the oxidized BIH species (BIH ), and twoelectron donating ability.On the other hand, to demonstrate the unique advantage of the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 composite, we compared the photocatalytic activities of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 to that of homogeneous Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 /Ru-H 2 L (the Ni(II) complex with the same Ni loading as that in Ni3Ru-UiO-67) as control.As shown in Fig. 4a, the activity of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 is similar with that of Ni3Ru-UIO-67 at the first 5 h.With increasing the reaction time, the activities of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 decrease because of the selfaggregation and oxidative self-degradation, while the activities of Ni3Ru-UIO-67 can be stabilized up to 10 h.The results demonstrate that encapsulating molecular catalyst into photoactive MOF is a promising approach to design efficient, stable and recyclable photocatalysts.It should be noted, compared with the reported photocatalytic activity of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 18, the TON value of 280 of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 in this work is higher than the reported experimental value (ca.180) at the first 5 h, but the stability in this work is lower.The reason may be attributed to the higher power light source in this work (a 82 W LED for this work and a 6 W LED for reported experiment).In addition, the Confirmation of the carbon source is essential for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in heterogeneous systems.Isotopic labeling experiment was performed with 13 CO 2 , and the gaseous product was detected by GC-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) to investigate the carbon source of the produced CO.After 6 h of visible-light irradiation, GC-MS analysis showed clearly the signals of 13 CO (m/z 29).In contrast, the signal was absent in the GC-MS spectra when 12 CO 2 was used as the reactant (Fig. S14 online), unambiguously confirming that CO was generated from CO 2 photoreduction. In order to evaluate the stability of NiRu-UiO-67 composite, the catalyst durability tests were carried out under the optimized conditions taking into account the relatively high CO evolution rate.The recycling tests were explored by collecting catalyst after each 5 h illumination via centrifugation and dispersal in a fresh catalysis solution.Fig. 4c shows TON of CO and H 2 for Ni3Ru-UiO-67 as a function of time in consecutive five reaction cycles.Although the CO evolution dependence on time deviates from linearity gradually after 10 h, the initial rate in every run can be evaluated from the slope of straight line portion at the first 5 h.The highest rate of 10.19 lmol/h appears in the first run, and there is only a slight decrease in the fifth run (Fig. S15 online).PXRD analyses of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 after photocatalytic reaction showed no significant change in the diffraction patterns, suggesting its structural stability (Fig. 4d).Furthermore, after the fifth run, the concen-tration of Ni in the supernatant solution before and after catalysis were measured by ICP-MS to examine the possibility of Ni leaching, indicated that less than 0.5 of Ni was leached into the solution during catalysis process.The high activity and good durability of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 demonstrate the great potential in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. In order to uncover the photocatalytic mechanism of NiRu-UiO-67 system, the electrochemical properties of Ni(II) complex were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a solution of DMF/H 2 O (9:1, v:v) under N 2 atmosphere.As described in Fig. 5a, two irreversible reductive waves are attributable to step-by-step reduction and changes of octahedral Ni II to tetrahedral Ni 0 complexes.The first wave of Ni(II) complex at A0.60 V (vs.NHE) can be assigned to be the reduction of the Ni center from Ni II to Ni I and the second cathodic wave at -0.79 V (vs.NHE) was corresponded to a metal-centered Ni I /Ni 0 redox process.Moreover, the oxidative peak observed at around 0.5 V is likely due to the ligand-centred oxidation of tetrahedral Ni 0 complexes 41.This result reflects that the excellent activity of NiRu-UiO-67 composite is correlated with the reduction of the Ni(II) complex. To confirm the thermodynamic feasibility of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and the driving force for the reduction of CO 2 , the free energy change (DG 0 ) was introduced which can be used to estimate a PET process from Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) complex.The DG 0 is calculated by the Rehm-Weller equation (Eq.( 1)) 42: C 14 where, E ox is the oxidative potential of the species donating an electron (Ru-H 2 L), E red is the reductive potential of the species accepting an electron (Ni(II) complex), E 00 is the energy difference between the ground and excited states of the photosensitizer and C is the sum of the solvation effect that accounts for the change in coulombic interactions due to the charge shift in solution.As the dielectric constants of the polar solvents DMF are quite high, the term C could be negligible (Eq.( 2)) 43.As shown in Fig. 5, CVs of Ni(II) complex and Ru-H 2 L show that the first oxidation E ox of Ru-H 2 L is 1.20 V (vs.NHE) and the first reduction E red of Ni(II) complex is A0.60 V (vs.NHE).The E 00 value of 2.10 V can be calculated from the luminescence emission peak at 590 nm of Ru-H 2 L at room temperature (Fig. S8a online).Fitting of the above data to Eq. ( 1), a negative DG 0 of A0.30 V was obtained, suggesting the PET progress from Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) is thermodynamically favourable.In order to investigate the excited state (ES) and electron transfer (ET) dynamics in NiRu-UiO-67 composite, we also carried out the optical transient absorption (TA) measurements.Fig. 6a shows the ultrafast TA spectra of Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 at the selected delay times after the excitation at 450 nm.The TA spectra of Ru-UiO-67 was used as a control to illustrate the intrinsic ES dynamics of Ru-moiety in MOF framework without Ni(II) molecular catalyst.The spectra of Ru-UiO-67 exhibits two instantaneously formed spectral features, a negative band centered at 530 nm and a broad photoinduced positive absorption features between 620 and 770 nm, which can be attributed to the ground state bleach (GSB) and excited state absorption (ESA) of Ru-moiety, respectively.Such transient absorption profile of Ru-UiO-67 is similar with those of reported in literatures containing Ru-moiety complex 44.Similar to the spectra of Ru-UiO-67, the TA spectra of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 also show two main spectral features, a GSB band centred at 520 nm and a broad ESA band in 570-770 nm region.The whole spectra of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 shift to shorter wavelengths with respect to that of Ru-UiO-67 because of the formation of a ET state between Ru-moiety and Ni(II) complex, which is consistent with their steady-state spectrum 45.Furthermore, the amplitude of GSB at 520 nm increases within 7 ns, distinctly different to that of Ru-UiO-67.These spectroscopic features indicate that the excited state of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 turned into the reduced state due to electron transfer processes, but rather than relaxing to ground state as in the neat Ru-UiO-67.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the ESA kinetics in Ni3Ru-UiO-67 decays faster than that in Ru-UiO-67, further supporting the ET process from excited Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) complex in Ni3Ru-UiO-67. To further investigate the catalytic mechanism of Ni(bpet) (H 2 O) 2 , we carried out the DFT calculations (see the Supporting Information online) 46, which can probe the active site of Ni(II) complex and the adsorption energy and charge difference density of Based on the above experimental results and theoretical calculations, we propose the following reaction mechanism for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in NiRu-UiO-67 system.As shown in Fig. 8, under the visible-light irradiation, the ligand Ru(dcbpy) (bpy) 2 2 will be excited forming the triplet MLCT excited state, 3 Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 , which is subjected to a reductive quenching by one electron from BIH (indicated by Stern-Volmer experiment, Fig. S17 online), then afforded Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 and oxidized BIH (BIH ).However, BIH is easily deprotonated, the deprotonated BI can supply one more electron to reduce another 3 Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 producing 2 equiv. of Ru(dcbpy) (bpy) 2 in the overall photoinduced process.Then Ni(II) complex was reduced by two Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 to afford a Ni 0 (bpet) intermediate and two Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 with a two-electrons process.Finally, CO 2 binds to the reduced Ni 0 through the carbon atom forming a Ni-CO 2 adduct, after which protonation gives CO and regenerates the catalyst, completing the catalytic cycle.On the other hand, the formation of H 2 could result from the reduction of the existing protons in the reaction system by the light-induced electrons.Noteworthy, in the reduction process TEOA works as a base for BIH , which should suppress back electron transfer from Ni(bpet) to BIH as one of the obstruction processes of the photocatalytic reduction (Fig. S18 online) 47."}, {"llm generation": "LED (82 W)", "source": "The reason may be attributed to the higher power light source in this work (a 82 W LED for this work and a 6 W LED for reported experiment).", "context": "As illustrated in Fig. 1, a series of photoactive MOF-based composites with simultaneously incorporated Ru-photosensitizer and Ni(II) molecular catalyst were synthesized via a ''ship-in-abottle\" synthetic strategy.The as-synthesized Ru-UiO-67 and NiRu-UiO-67 composites were fully characterized.As shown in Fig. 2a, XRD patterns of the three catalysts and Ru-UiO-67 samples match well with the prototype UiO-67 peaks, clearly demonstrating that the crystallinity of the Ru-UiO-67 host is maintained upon encapsulation of the Ni(II) complex.BET surface area measurements at 77 K calculated from the N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms show BET surface area of 2,135, 1,210, 1,150, 1,040, 890 m 2 /g were observed, respectively, for UiO-67, Ru-UiO-67, Ni1Ru-UiO-67, Ni2Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 (Fig. 2b).The decrease in the BET surface area of the Ru-UiO-67 compared with pristine UiO-67, which is owing to the introduction of Ru (bpy) 2 groups in Ru-UiO-67.On the other hand, the decreased N 2 sorption of the composites indicate that the Ni(II) complex was indeed located in the Ru-UiO-67.Among them, the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 exhibits the lowest BET surface area, revealing the highest loading of Ni(II) complex, which is in good agreement with the ICP-MS analysis indicated above.Infrared spectra of Ni3Ru-UiO-67, ligands and Ni(II) complex were comparable with that of undoped Ru-UiO-67 (Fig. S7 online).Considerable similarities were observed between Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 with minor differences in band position and shape.However, an increased band between 2,950-2,920 cm A1 assigned to typical of S-CH 2 -stretching vibrations in Ni3Ru-UiO-67 was observed, due to the encapsulation of the Ni(II) complex.As shown in Fig. 2c, the additional broad absorption in the range of 370-650 nm in NiRu-UiO-67 and Ru-UiO-67 is attributed to the Ru(d p (II) complex in Ru-UIO-67.On the other hand, further evidence for the successful encapsulation of Ni(II) complex into Ru-UiO-67 was afforded by photoluminescence emission spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 2d, the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy of NiRu-UiO-67 composites are descending compared with that of Ru-UiO-67, not only attribute to the weaker absorption but also due to the electron transfer from the photoexcited state of the Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 units to the encapsulated neighbouring Ni(II) complex 31.This is further supported by timeresolved photoluminescence measurements.As shown in Fig. S8 (online), the Ru-UiO-67 exhibits a lifetime of 385 ns, while Ni1Ru-UIO-67, Ni2Ru-UIO-67 and Ni3Ru-UIO-67 show lifetime 156, 127 and 109 ns, respectively.Lifetime decreases and enhanced quenching effect of NiRu-MOFs indicated that the facile electron transfer from the excited Ru-MOFs to encapsulated Ni(II) complex due to their proximity.Furthermore, the PL of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 is much weaker than that of others, indicating the PL of Ru-UiO-67 is quenched by more Ni(II) complex.The efficient PL quenching reflected that electron transfer process was remarkably enhanced through the unique one-cage-one-guest encapsulation pattern.These results indicate that Ni3Ru-UiO-67 will possess superior photocatalytic activity compared with Ni1Ru-UiO-67 and Ni2Ru-UiO-67. The SEM observation for Ni3Ru-UiO-67 and Ru-UiO-67 shows that the loading of the Ni(II) complex does not affect the MOF morphology, and the MOF crystals remain intact in the composites (Fig. S9 online).The detailed nanostructure of the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 was further investigated by TEM.As shown in Fig. 2e, the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 shows an octahedral morphology, which is in good agreement with SEM observations.The elemental mapping analysis of Ni, S, Ru and Zr performed on an extended area of a solid sample of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 revealed that the elements were uniformly distributed inside the Ru-UiO-67, further attesting to the Ni(II) complex that was homogeneously encapsulated in the pores of the Ru-UiO-67.In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the UiO-67, Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 were conducted in an N 2 atmosphere (Fig. S10 online).Similar to the pristine Ru-UiO-67, the Ni1Ru-UiO-67, Ni2Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 also exhibited two decomposition steps at 50 to 400 C and 400 C, respectively.The weight loss decreases between 50 and 250 C, indicating that the Ni(II) complex replaces part of solvent molecules in the cage of the Ru-UiO-67. XPS was carried out to analyze the chemical compositions and binding environments of the samples.Note that the electron binding energy not only depends on the element itself but also the chemical state in samples 32.The XPS spectrum of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 in Fig. 3a displays the signatures of C, O, N, S, Ru and Ni.As shown in Fig. 3b, the high-resolution S 2p XPS spectrum displays two broad peaks at 164.0 and 168.8 eV pertaining to S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 , respectively 33.The S 2p peaks were attributed to the bound nickel-thiol species 34.A high-resolution XPS Ni 2p spectrum shows the peaks at 856.7 eV (Ni 2p 3/2 ) and 873.8 eV (Ni 2p 1/2 ) (Fig. 3c) 35, which corresponds to the peak position of Ni-S 36.As shown in Fig. 3a andd, the peaks at 484.7 eV (Ru 3p 3/2 ) and 462.6 eV (Ru 3p 1/2 ) in both Ru-UiO-67 and NiRu-UiO-67 are in agreement with the pattern of Ru 2 .All the above results demonstrate that Ni(II) complex was successfully encapsulated into the robust Ru-UiO-67., UV-vis spectra (c) and PL emission spectra (d) of UiO-67, Ru-UiO-67, Ni1Ru-UiO-67, Ni2Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 (k ex 446 nm, refer to its UV-vis spectrum).(e) TEM image of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 and elemental mapping of the various elements (Ni, S, Ru, and Zr) contained in Ni3Ru-UiO-67. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of NiRu-UiO-67 composites were performed in a closed gas circulation and evacuation system.Each of the catalyst (20 mg) was independently suspended in a mixture of DMF (27 mL), deionized water (3 mL), BIH (0.1 mol/L), and TEOA (0.5 mol/L), which was deoxygenated by CO 2 and irradiated with a LED light (82 W).BIH as a sacrificial reductant can efficiently quench the excited state of photosensitizer, whereas TEOA mainly functions as a proton acceptor for BIH 37.As shown in Fig. 4a, the generation of CO increases almost linearly with irradiation time upon 10 h.Ni3Ru-UiO-67 exhibits the CO evolution rate of 426.05 mmol/(g h) (85.21 mmol) with a catalytic turnover number (TON) of 510.0 (defined as n(CO)/n(Ni(bpet)(H 2 O) 2 ), which holds a high catalytic performance among reported MOF catalysts (Table S4 online) 38,39.Notably, only a negligible amount of H 2 could be detected (Fig. S11 online), and no formate was detected by HPLC analysis and 1 H NMR spectroscopy (Figs.S12 and S13 online).The CO evolution rates of 55.25 mmol/(mg h) (yield: 11.05 mmol, TON: 136.7) and 196.80 mmol/(g h) (yield: 39.36 mmol, TON: 317.5) were obtained for Ni1Ru-UiO-67 and Ni2Ru-UiO-67, respectively.After 20 h irradiation, the TON of CO production of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 was reached 581 with CO selectivity of 99 (calculated as TON (CO)/TON(CO H 2 )), indicating that Ni3Ru-UiO-67 can photo-reduce CO 2 to CO selectively.Control experiments only with BIH or TEOA of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 showed the TON for CO were 216.1 and 60.7, respectively (Fig. 4b), suggesting that TEOA is advantageous for reduction of CO 2 .As previously reported 40, BIH can dramatically enhanced TON in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction because of its high reductive ability, fast deprotonation of the oxidized BIH species (BIH ), and twoelectron donating ability.On the other hand, to demonstrate the unique advantage of the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 composite, we compared the photocatalytic activities of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 to that of homogeneous Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 /Ru-H 2 L (the Ni(II) complex with the same Ni loading as that in Ni3Ru-UiO-67) as control.As shown in Fig. 4a, the activity of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 is similar with that of Ni3Ru-UIO-67 at the first 5 h.With increasing the reaction time, the activities of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 decrease because of the selfaggregation and oxidative self-degradation, while the activities of Ni3Ru-UIO-67 can be stabilized up to 10 h.The results demonstrate that encapsulating molecular catalyst into photoactive MOF is a promising approach to design efficient, stable and recyclable photocatalysts.It should be noted, compared with the reported photocatalytic activity of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 18, the TON value of 280 of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 in this work is higher than the reported experimental value (ca.180) at the first 5 h, but the stability in this work is lower.The reason may be attributed to the higher power light source in this work (a 82 W LED for this work and a 6 W LED for reported experiment).In addition, the Confirmation of the carbon source is essential for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in heterogeneous systems.Isotopic labeling experiment was performed with 13 CO 2 , and the gaseous product was detected by GC-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) to investigate the carbon source of the produced CO.After 6 h of visible-light irradiation, GC-MS analysis showed clearly the signals of 13 CO (m/z 29).In contrast, the signal was absent in the GC-MS spectra when 12 CO 2 was used as the reactant (Fig. S14 online), unambiguously confirming that CO was generated from CO 2 photoreduction. In order to evaluate the stability of NiRu-UiO-67 composite, the catalyst durability tests were carried out under the optimized conditions taking into account the relatively high CO evolution rate.The recycling tests were explored by collecting catalyst after each 5 h illumination via centrifugation and dispersal in a fresh catalysis solution.Fig. 4c shows TON of CO and H 2 for Ni3Ru-UiO-67 as a function of time in consecutive five reaction cycles.Although the CO evolution dependence on time deviates from linearity gradually after 10 h, the initial rate in every run can be evaluated from the slope of straight line portion at the first 5 h.The highest rate of 10.19 lmol/h appears in the first run, and there is only a slight decrease in the fifth run (Fig. S15 online).PXRD analyses of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 after photocatalytic reaction showed no significant change in the diffraction patterns, suggesting its structural stability (Fig. 4d).Furthermore, after the fifth run, the concen-tration of Ni in the supernatant solution before and after catalysis were measured by ICP-MS to examine the possibility of Ni leaching, indicated that less than 0.5 of Ni was leached into the solution during catalysis process.The high activity and good durability of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 demonstrate the great potential in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. In order to uncover the photocatalytic mechanism of NiRu-UiO-67 system, the electrochemical properties of Ni(II) complex were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a solution of DMF/H 2 O (9:1, v:v) under N 2 atmosphere.As described in Fig. 5a, two irreversible reductive waves are attributable to step-by-step reduction and changes of octahedral Ni II to tetrahedral Ni 0 complexes.The first wave of Ni(II) complex at A0.60 V (vs.NHE) can be assigned to be the reduction of the Ni center from Ni II to Ni I and the second cathodic wave at -0.79 V (vs.NHE) was corresponded to a metal-centered Ni I /Ni 0 redox process.Moreover, the oxidative peak observed at around 0.5 V is likely due to the ligand-centred oxidation of tetrahedral Ni 0 complexes 41.This result reflects that the excellent activity of NiRu-UiO-67 composite is correlated with the reduction of the Ni(II) complex. To confirm the thermodynamic feasibility of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and the driving force for the reduction of CO 2 , the free energy change (DG 0 ) was introduced which can be used to estimate a PET process from Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) complex.The DG 0 is calculated by the Rehm-Weller equation (Eq.( 1)) 42: C 14 where, E ox is the oxidative potential of the species donating an electron (Ru-H 2 L), E red is the reductive potential of the species accepting an electron (Ni(II) complex), E 00 is the energy difference between the ground and excited states of the photosensitizer and C is the sum of the solvation effect that accounts for the change in coulombic interactions due to the charge shift in solution.As the dielectric constants of the polar solvents DMF are quite high, the term C could be negligible (Eq.( 2)) 43.As shown in Fig. 5, CVs of Ni(II) complex and Ru-H 2 L show that the first oxidation E ox of Ru-H 2 L is 1.20 V (vs.NHE) and the first reduction E red of Ni(II) complex is A0.60 V (vs.NHE).The E 00 value of 2.10 V can be calculated from the luminescence emission peak at 590 nm of Ru-H 2 L at room temperature (Fig. S8a online).Fitting of the above data to Eq. ( 1), a negative DG 0 of A0.30 V was obtained, suggesting the PET progress from Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) is thermodynamically favourable.In order to investigate the excited state (ES) and electron transfer (ET) dynamics in NiRu-UiO-67 composite, we also carried out the optical transient absorption (TA) measurements.Fig. 6a shows the ultrafast TA spectra of Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 at the selected delay times after the excitation at 450 nm.The TA spectra of Ru-UiO-67 was used as a control to illustrate the intrinsic ES dynamics of Ru-moiety in MOF framework without Ni(II) molecular catalyst.The spectra of Ru-UiO-67 exhibits two instantaneously formed spectral features, a negative band centered at 530 nm and a broad photoinduced positive absorption features between 620 and 770 nm, which can be attributed to the ground state bleach (GSB) and excited state absorption (ESA) of Ru-moiety, respectively.Such transient absorption profile of Ru-UiO-67 is similar with those of reported in literatures containing Ru-moiety complex 44.Similar to the spectra of Ru-UiO-67, the TA spectra of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 also show two main spectral features, a GSB band centred at 520 nm and a broad ESA band in 570-770 nm region.The whole spectra of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 shift to shorter wavelengths with respect to that of Ru-UiO-67 because of the formation of a ET state between Ru-moiety and Ni(II) complex, which is consistent with their steady-state spectrum 45.Furthermore, the amplitude of GSB at 520 nm increases within 7 ns, distinctly different to that of Ru-UiO-67.These spectroscopic features indicate that the excited state of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 turned into the reduced state due to electron transfer processes, but rather than relaxing to ground state as in the neat Ru-UiO-67.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the ESA kinetics in Ni3Ru-UiO-67 decays faster than that in Ru-UiO-67, further supporting the ET process from excited Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) complex in Ni3Ru-UiO-67. To further investigate the catalytic mechanism of Ni(bpet) (H 2 O) 2 , we carried out the DFT calculations (see the Supporting Information online) 46, which can probe the active site of Ni(II) complex and the adsorption energy and charge difference density of Based on the above experimental results and theoretical calculations, we propose the following reaction mechanism for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in NiRu-UiO-67 system.As shown in Fig. 8, under the visible-light irradiation, the ligand Ru(dcbpy) (bpy) 2 2 will be excited forming the triplet MLCT excited state, 3 Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 , which is subjected to a reductive quenching by one electron from BIH (indicated by Stern-Volmer experiment, Fig. S17 online), then afforded Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 and oxidized BIH (BIH ).However, BIH is easily deprotonated, the deprotonated BI can supply one more electron to reduce another 3 Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 producing 2 equiv. of Ru(dcbpy) (bpy) 2 in the overall photoinduced process.Then Ni(II) complex was reduced by two Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 to afford a Ni 0 (bpet) intermediate and two Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 with a two-electrons process.Finally, CO 2 binds to the reduced Ni 0 through the carbon atom forming a Ni-CO 2 adduct, after which protonation gives CO and regenerates the catalyst, completing the catalytic cycle.On the other hand, the formation of H 2 could result from the reduction of the existing protons in the reaction system by the light-induced electrons.Noteworthy, in the reduction process TEOA works as a base for BIH , which should suppress back electron transfer from Ni(bpet) to BIH as one of the obstruction processes of the photocatalytic reduction (Fig. S18 online) 47."}, {"llm generation": "LED (6 W)", "source": "The reason may be attributed to the higher power light

due to the encapsulation of the Ni(II) complex.As shown in Fig. 2c, the additional broad absorption in the range of 370-650 nm in NiRu-UiO-67 and Ru-UiO-67 is attributed to the Ru(d p (II) complex in Ru-UIO-67.On the other hand, further evidence for the successful encapsulation of Ni(II) complex into Ru-UiO-67 was afforded by photoluminescence emission spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 2d, the

one-cage-one-guest encapsulation pattern.These results indicate that Ni3Ru-UiO-67 will possess superior photocatalytic activity compared with Ni1Ru-UiO-67 and Ni2Ru-UiO-67. The SEM observation for Ni3Ru-UiO-67 and Ru-UiO-67 shows that the loading of the Ni(II) complex does not affect the MOF morphology, and the MOF crystals remain intact in the composites (Fig. S9 online).The detailed nanostructure of the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 was further investigated by TEM.As shown in Fig. 2e, the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 shows an octahedral morphology, which is in good agreement with SEM observations.The elemental mapping analysis of Ni, S, Ru and Zr performed on an extended area of a solid sample of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 revealed that the elements were uniformly distributed inside the Ru-UiO-67, further attesting to the Ni(II) complex that was homogeneously encapsulated in the pores of the Ru-UiO-67.In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the UiO-67, Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 were conducted in an N 2 atmosphere (Fig. S10 online).Similar to the pristine Ru-UiO-67, the Ni1Ru-UiO-67, Ni2Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 also exhibited two decomposition steps at 50 to 400 C and 400 C, respectively.The weight loss decreases between 50 and 250 C, indicating that the Ni(II) complex replaces part of solvent molecules in the cage of the Ru-UiO-67. XPS was carried out to analyze the chemical compositions and binding environments of the samples.Note that the electron binding energy not only depends on the element itself but also the chemical state in samples 32.The XPS spectrum of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 in Fig. 3a displays the signatures of C, O, N, S, Ru and Ni.As shown in Fig. 3b, the high-resolution S 2p XPS spectrum displays two broad peaks at 164.0 and 168.8 eV pertaining to S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 , respectively 33.The S 2p peaks were attributed to the bound nickel-thiol species 34.A high-resolution XPS Ni 2p spectrum shows the peaks at 856.7 eV (Ni 2p 3/2 ) and 873.8 eV (Ni 2p 1/2 ) (Fig. 3c) 35, which corresponds to the peak position of Ni-S 36.As shown in Fig. 3a andd, the peaks at 484.7 eV (Ru 3p 3/2 ) and 462.6 eV (Ru 3p 1/2 ) in both Ru-UiO-67 and NiRu-UiO-67 are in agreement with the pattern of Ru 2 .All the above results demonstrate that Ni(II) complex was successfully encapsulated into the robust Ru-UiO-67., UV-vis spectra (c) and PL emission spectra (d) of UiO-67, Ru-UiO-67, Ni1Ru-UiO-67, Ni2Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 (k ex 446 nm, refer to its UV-vis spectrum).(e) TEM image of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 and elemental mapping of the various elements (Ni, S, Ru, and Zr) contained in Ni3Ru-UiO-67. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of NiRu-UiO-67 composites were performed in a closed gas circulation and evacuation system.Each of the catalyst (20 mg) was independently suspended in a mixture of DMF (27 mL), deionized water (3 mL), BIH (0.1 mol/L), and TEOA (0.5 mol/L), which was deoxygenated by CO 2 and irradiated with a LED light (82 W).BIH as a sacrificial reductant can efficiently quench the excited state of photosensitizer, whereas TEOA mainly functions as a proton acceptor for BIH 37.As shown in Fig. 4a, the generation of CO increases almost linearly with irradiation time upon 10 h.Ni3Ru-UiO-67 exhibits the CO evolution rate of 426.05 mmol/(g h) (85.21 mmol) with a catalytic turnover number (TON) of 510.0 (defined as n(CO)/n(Ni(bpet)(H 2 O) 2 ), which holds a high catalytic performance among reported MOF catalysts (Table S4 online) 38,39.Notably, only a negligible amount of H 2 could be detected (Fig. S11 online), and no formate was detected by HPLC analysis and 1 H NMR spectroscopy (Figs.S12 and S13 online).The CO evolution rates of 55.25 mmol/(mg h) (yield: 11.05 mmol, TON: 136.7) and 196.80 mmol/(g h) (yield: 39.36 mmol, TON: 317.5) were obtained for Ni1Ru-UiO-67 and Ni2Ru-UiO-67, respectively.After 20 h irradiation, the TON of CO production of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 was reached 581 with CO selectivity of 99 (calculated as TON (CO)/TON(CO H 2 )), indicating that Ni3Ru-UiO-67 can photo-reduce CO 2 to CO selectively.Control experiments only with BIH or TEOA of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 showed the TON for CO were 216.1 and 60.7, respectively (Fig. 4b), suggesting that TEOA is advantageous for reduction of CO 2 .As previously reported 40, BIH can dramatically enhanced TON in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction because of its high reductive ability, fast deprotonation of the oxidized BIH species (BIH ), and twoelectron donating ability.On the other hand, to demonstrate the unique advantage of the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 composite, we compared the photocatalytic activities of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 to that of homogeneous Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 /Ru-H 2 L (the Ni(II) complex with the same Ni loading as that in Ni3Ru-UiO-67) as control.As shown in Fig. 4a, the activity of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 is similar with that of Ni3Ru-UIO-67 at the first 5 h.With increasing the reaction time, the activities of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 decrease because of the selfaggregation and oxidative self-degradation, while the activities of Ni3Ru-UIO-67 can be stabilized up to 10 h.The results demonstrate that encapsulating molecular catalyst into photoactive MOF is a promising approach to design efficient, stable and recyclable photocatalysts.It should be noted, compared with the reported photocatalytic activity of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 18, the TON value of 280 of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 in this work is higher than the reported experimental value (ca.180) at the first 5 h, but the stability in this work is lower.The reason may be attributed to the higher power light source in this work (a 82 W LED for this work and a 6 W LED for reported experiment).In addition, the Confirmation of the carbon source is essential for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in heterogeneous systems.Isotopic labeling experiment was performed with 13 CO 2 , and the gaseous product was detected by GC-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) to investigate the carbon source of the produced CO.After 6 h of visible-light irradiation, GC-MS analysis showed clearly the signals of 13 CO (m/z 29).In contrast, the signal was absent in the GC-MS spectra when 12 CO 2 was used as the reactant (Fig. S14 online), unambiguously confirming that CO was generated from CO 2 photoreduction. In order to evaluate the stability of NiRu-UiO-67 composite, the catalyst durability tests were carried out under the optimized conditions taking into account the relatively high CO evolution rate.The recycling tests were explored by collecting catalyst after each 5 h illumination via centrifugation and dispersal in a fresh catalysis solution.Fig. 4c shows TON of CO and H 2 for Ni3Ru-UiO-67 as a function of time in consecutive five reaction cycles.Although the CO evolution dependence on time deviates from linearity gradually after 10 h, the initial rate in every run can be evaluated from the slope of straight line portion at the first 5 h.The highest rate of 10.19 lmol/h appears in the first run, and there is only a slight decrease in the fifth run (Fig. S15 online).PXRD analyses of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 after photocatalytic reaction showed no significant change in the diffraction patterns, suggesting its structural stability (Fig. 4d).Furthermore, after the fifth run, the concen-tration of Ni in the supernatant solution before and after catalysis were measured by ICP-MS to examine the possibility of Ni leaching, indicated that less than 0.5 of Ni was leached into the solution during catalysis process.The high activity and good durability of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 demonstrate the great potential in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. In order to uncover the photocatalytic mechanism of NiRu-UiO-67 system, the electrochemical properties of Ni(II) complex were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a solution of DMF/H 2 O (9:1, v:v) under N 2 atmosphere.As described in Fig. 5a, two irreversible reductive waves are attributable to step-by-step reduction and changes of octahedral Ni II to tetrahedral Ni 0 complexes.The first wave of Ni(II) complex at A0.60 V (vs.NHE) can be assigned to be the reduction of the Ni center from Ni II to Ni I and the second cathodic wave at -0.79 V (vs.NHE) was corresponded to a metal-centered Ni I /Ni 0 redox process.Moreover, the oxidative peak observed at around 0.5 V is likely due to the ligand-centred oxidation of tetrahedral Ni 0 complexes 41.This result reflects that the excellent activity of NiRu-UiO-67 composite is correlated with the reduction of the Ni(II) complex. To confirm the thermodynamic feasibility of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and the driving force for the reduction of CO 2 , the free energy change (DG 0 ) was introduced which can be used to estimate a PET process from Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) complex.The DG 0 is calculated by the Rehm-Weller equation (Eq.( 1)) 42: C 14 where, E ox is the oxidative potential of the species donating an electron (Ru-H 2 L), E red is the reductive potential of the species accepting an electron (Ni(II) complex), E 00 is the energy difference between the ground and excited states of the photosensitizer and C is the sum of the solvation effect that accounts for the change in coulombic interactions due to the charge shift in solution.As the dielectric constants of the polar solvents DMF are quite high, the term C could be negligible (Eq.( 2)) 43.As shown in Fig. 5, CVs of Ni(II) complex and Ru-H 2 L show that the first oxidation E ox of Ru-H 2 L is 1.20 V (vs.NHE) and the first reduction E red of Ni(II) complex is A0.60 V (vs.NHE).The E 00 value of 2.10 V can be calculated from the luminescence emission peak at 590 nm of Ru-H 2 L at room temperature (Fig. S8a online).Fitting of the above data to Eq. ( 1), a negative DG 0 of A0.30 V was obtained, suggesting the PET progress from Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) is thermodynamically favourable.In order to investigate the excited state (ES) and electron transfer (ET) dynamics in NiRu-UiO-67 composite, we also carried out the optical transient absorption (TA) measurements.Fig. 6a shows the ultrafast TA spectra of Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 at the selected delay times after the excitation at 450 nm.The TA spectra of Ru-UiO-67 was used as a control to illustrate the intrinsic ES dynamics of Ru-moiety in MOF framework without Ni(II) molecular catalyst.The spectra of Ru-UiO-67 exhibits two instantaneously formed spectral features, a negative band centered at 530 nm and a broad photoinduced positive absorption features between 620 and 770 nm, which can be attributed to the ground state bleach (GSB) and excited state absorption (ESA) of Ru-moiety, respectively.Such transient absorption profile of Ru-UiO-67 is similar with those of reported in literatures containing Ru-moiety complex 44.Similar to the spectra of Ru-UiO-67, the TA spectra of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 also show two main spectral features, a GSB band centred at 520 nm and a broad ESA band in 570-770 nm region.The whole spectra of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 shift to shorter wavelengths with respect to that of Ru-UiO-67 because of the formation of a ET state between Ru-moiety and Ni(II) complex, which is consistent with their steady-state spectrum 45.Furthermore, the amplitude of GSB at 520 nm increases within 7 ns, distinctly different to that of Ru-UiO-67.These spectroscopic features indicate that the excited state of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 turned into the reduced state due to electron transfer processes, but rather than relaxing to ground state as in the neat Ru-UiO-67.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the ESA kinetics in Ni3Ru-UiO-67 decays faster than that in Ru-UiO-67, further supporting the ET process from excited Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) complex in Ni3Ru-UiO-67. To further investigate the catalytic mechanism of Ni(bpet) (H 2 O) 2 , we carried out the DFT calculations (see the Supporting Information online) 46, which can probe the active site of Ni(II) complex and the adsorption energy and charge difference density of Based on the above experimental results and theoretical calculations, we propose the following reaction mechanism for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in NiRu-UiO-67 system.As shown in Fig. 8, under the visible-light irradiation, the ligand Ru(dcbpy) (bpy) 2 2 will be excited forming the triplet MLCT excited state, 3 Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 , which is subjected to a reductive quenching by one electron from BIH (indicated by Stern-Volmer experiment, Fig. S17 online), then afforded Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 and oxidized BIH (BIH ).However, BIH is easily deprotonated, the deprotonated BI can supply one more electron to reduce another 3 Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 producing 2 equiv. of Ru(dcbpy) (bpy) 2 in the overall photoinduced process.Then Ni(II) complex was reduced by two Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 to afford a Ni 0 (bpet) intermediate and two Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 with a two-electrons process.Finally, CO 2 binds to the reduced Ni 0 through the carbon atom forming a Ni-CO 2 adduct, after which protonation gives CO and regenerates the catalyst, completing the catalytic cycle.On the other hand, the formation of H 2 could result from the reduction of the existing protons in the reaction system by the light-induced electrons.Noteworthy, in the reduction process TEOA works as a base for BIH , which should suppress back electron transfer from Ni(bpet) to BIH as one of the obstruction processes of the photocatalytic reduction (Fig. S18 online) 47."}, {"llm generation": "LED", "source": "Fig. 4.

CO 2 adsorption structure.The relaxed structure feature pseudo-C 2 symmetry with two geometrically equivalent coordinated H 2 O molecules.The optimized configuration reflects that the H 2 O was easy removed, and the desorption free energy was DG A0.90 kcal/mol.Therefore, one Lewis acid catalytic site was exposed on the unsaturated Ni(II) ions after H 2 O were removed under visible light irradiation The unsaturated Ni(II) ions can further adsorb one CO 2 molecule.As shown in Fig. 7, for DFT calculations, two possible activation energy barriers were taken into consideration, one is the CO 2 -binding step to give the Ni-CO 2 intermediate (TS1, DG a 1 ) and the other is the CO-cleavage step to form Ni-CO species (TS2, DG a 2 ).The CO 2 molecule binds to the reduced Ni 0 through the carbon atom forming Ni-CO 2 species (transition state TS1, Fig. S16a online), and the total barrier calculated for TS1 is 14.77 kcal mol A1 .Meanwhile, the CO 2 molecule of TS1 turns to distorted configuration with the angle of O-C-O (158.6) and C-Ni bond length (2.24 A).Then, the Ni-CO 2 species is protonated to form Ni-COOH intermediates, and, the C-OH bond in Ni-COOH species is cleaved at Ni center to generate Ni-CO species (transition state TS2, Fig. S16b online) and OH A with the total energy barrier 10.57 kcal/mol for TS2.Simultaneously, the cleaved OH A further reacts with a proton to form water.After the release of CO, Ni (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 is regenerated and the catalytic cycle restarts.On the other hand, natural charge analysis indicates that CO 2 molecule behaves A0.822e for O, 0.711e for C and A0.777e charge for another O, while Ni ion features 0.100e charge.Obviously, under the light irradiation, CO 2 gets electrons from Ni ions, suggesting that the CO 2 molecule can be activated effectively by the Ni ion.Thus, the unsaturated site of Ni ion serves as active site in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.

In a typical experiment, NiRu-UiO-67 (20 mg) was suspended in a mixed solution of DMF (27 mL), deionized water (3 mL), 1,3dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazole (BIH, 0.1 mol/ L) and triethanolamine (TEOA) (0.5 mol/L), then the suspension was purged with CO 2 gas for 30 min while stirring.The sample was irradiated continuously with a 82 W light-emitting diode (LED) lamp (k 450 nm) at 288 K.After each reaction time, the evolved gaseous phase were determined by a Aulight GC-7920 gas chromatography (GC, N 2 as a carrier gas) using the TCD (a packed column with molecular sieves 5A (3.0 m A 3.0 mm, 60-80 mesh) at 373 K) to detect H 2 and using the FID (a column (TDX-1, 3.0 m A 0.30 mm) at 653 K) to detect CO, respectively.The total amounts of evolved H 2 and CO were quantified by a basis of calibration curves prepared for various concentrations of H 2 and CO."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid (mixture of DMF, deionized water, BIH, and TEOA)", "source": "Each of the catalyst (20 mg) was independently suspended in a mixture of DMF (27 mL), deionized water (3 mL), BIH (0.1 mol/L), and TEOA (0.5 mol/L), which was deoxygenated by CO 2 and irradiated with a LED light (82 W).", "context": "As illustrated in Fig. 1, a series of photoactive MOF-based composites with simultaneously incorporated Ru-photosensitizer and Ni(II) molecular catalyst were synthesized via a ''ship-in-abottle\" synthetic strategy.The as-synthesized Ru-UiO-67 and NiRu-UiO-67 composites were fully characterized.As shown in Fig. 2a, XRD patterns of the three catalysts and Ru-UiO-67 samples match well with the prototype UiO-67 peaks, clearly demonstrating that the crystallinity of the Ru-UiO-67 host is maintained upon encapsulation of the Ni(II) complex.BET surface area measurements at 77 K calculated from the N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms show BET surface area of 2,135, 1,210, 1,150, 1,040, 890 m 2 /g were observed, respectively, for UiO-67, Ru-UiO-67, Ni1Ru-UiO-67, Ni2Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 (Fig. 2b).The decrease in the BET surface area of the Ru-UiO-67 compared with pristine UiO-67, which is owing to the introduction of Ru (bpy) 2 groups in Ru-UiO-67.On the other hand, the decreased N 2 sorption of the composites indicate that the Ni(II) complex was indeed located in the Ru-UiO-67.Among them, the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 exhibits the lowest BET surface area, revealing the highest loading of Ni(II) complex, which is in good agreement with the ICP-MS analysis indicated above.Infrared spectra of Ni3Ru-UiO-67, ligands and Ni(II) complex were comparable with that of undoped Ru-UiO-67 (Fig. S7 online).Considerable similarities were observed between Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 with minor differences in band position and shape.However, an increased band between 2,950-2,920 cm A1 assigned to typical of S-CH 2 -stretching vibrations in Ni3Ru-UiO-67 was observed, due to the encapsulation of the Ni(II) complex.As shown in Fig. 2c, the additional broad absorption in the range of 370-650 nm in NiRu-UiO-67 and Ru-UiO-67 is attributed to the Ru(d p (II) complex in Ru-UIO-67.On the other hand, further evidence for the successful encapsulation of Ni(II) complex into Ru-UiO-67 was afforded by photoluminescence emission spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 2d, the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy of NiRu-UiO-67 composites are descending compared with that of Ru-UiO-67, not only attribute to the weaker absorption but also due to the electron transfer from the photoexcited state of the Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 units to the encapsulated neighbouring Ni(II) complex 31.This is further supported by timeresolved photoluminescence measurements.As shown in Fig. S8 (online), the Ru-UiO-67 exhibits a lifetime of 385 ns, while Ni1Ru-UIO-67, Ni2Ru-UIO-67 and Ni3Ru-UIO-67 show lifetime 156, 127 and 109 ns, respectively.Lifetime decreases and enhanced quenching effect of NiRu-MOFs indicated that the facile electron transfer from the excited Ru-MOFs to encapsulated Ni(II) complex due to their proximity.Furthermore, the PL of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 is much weaker than that of others, indicating the PL of Ru-UiO-67 is quenched by more Ni(II) complex.The efficient PL quenching reflected that electron transfer process was remarkably enhanced through the unique one-cage-one-guest encapsulation pattern.These results indicate that Ni3Ru-UiO-67 will possess superior photocatalytic activity compared with Ni1Ru-UiO-67 and Ni2Ru-UiO-67. The SEM observation for Ni3Ru-UiO-67 and Ru-UiO-67 shows that the loading of the Ni(II) complex does not affect the MOF morphology, and the MOF crystals remain intact in the composites (Fig. S9 online).The detailed nanostructure of the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 was further investigated by TEM.As shown in Fig. 2e, the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 shows an octahedral morphology, which is in good agreement with SEM observations.The elemental mapping analysis of Ni, S, Ru and Zr performed on an extended area of a solid sample of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 revealed that the elements were uniformly distributed inside the Ru-UiO-67, further attesting to the Ni(II) complex that was homogeneously encapsulated in the pores of the Ru-UiO-67.In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the UiO-67, Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 were conducted in an N 2 atmosphere (Fig. S10 online).Similar to the pristine Ru-UiO-67, the Ni1Ru-UiO-67, Ni2Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 also exhibited two decomposition steps at 50 to 400 C and 400 C, respectively.The weight loss decreases between 50 and 250 C, indicating that the Ni(II) complex replaces part of solvent molecules in the cage of the Ru-UiO-67. XPS was carried out to analyze the chemical compositions and binding environments of the samples.Note that the electron binding energy not only depends on the element itself but also the chemical state in samples 32.The XPS spectrum of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 in Fig. 3a displays the signatures of C, O, N, S, Ru and Ni.As shown in Fig. 3b, the high-resolution S 2p XPS spectrum displays two broad peaks at 164.0 and 168.8 eV pertaining to S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 , respectively 33.The S 2p peaks were attributed to the bound nickel-thiol species 34.A high-resolution XPS Ni 2p spectrum shows the peaks at 856.7 eV (Ni 2p 3/2 ) and 873.8 eV (Ni 2p 1/2 ) (Fig. 3c) 35, which corresponds to the peak position of Ni-S 36.As shown in Fig. 3a andd, the peaks at 484.7 eV (Ru 3p 3/2 ) and 462.6 eV (Ru 3p 1/2 ) in both Ru-UiO-67 and NiRu-UiO-67 are in agreement with the pattern of Ru 2 .All the above results demonstrate that Ni(II) complex was successfully encapsulated into the robust Ru-UiO-67., UV-vis spectra (c) and PL emission spectra (d) of UiO-67, Ru-UiO-67, Ni1Ru-UiO-67, Ni2Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 (k ex 446 nm, refer to its UV-vis spectrum).(e) TEM image of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 and elemental mapping of the various elements (Ni, S, Ru, and Zr) contained in Ni3Ru-UiO-67. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of NiRu-UiO-67 composites were performed in a closed gas circulation and evacuation system.Each of the catalyst (20 mg) was independently suspended in a mixture of DMF (27 mL), deionized water (3 mL), BIH (0.1 mol/L), and TEOA (0.5 mol/L), which was deoxygenated by CO 2 and irradiated with a LED light (82 W).BIH as a sacrificial reductant can efficiently quench the excited state of photosensitizer, whereas TEOA mainly functions as a proton acceptor for BIH 37.As shown in Fig. 4a, the generation of CO increases almost linearly with irradiation time upon 10 h.Ni3Ru-UiO-67 exhibits the CO evolution rate of 426.05 mmol/(g h) (85.21 mmol) with a catalytic turnover number (TON) of 510.0 (defined as n(CO)/n(Ni(bpet)(H 2 O) 2 ), which holds a high catalytic performance among reported MOF catalysts (Table S4 online) 38,39.Notably, only a negligible amount of H 2 could be detected (Fig. S11 online), and no formate was detected by HPLC analysis and 1 H NMR spectroscopy (Figs.S12 and S13 online).The CO evolution rates of 55.25 mmol/(mg h) (yield: 11.05 mmol, TON: 136.7) and 196.80 mmol/(g h) (yield: 39.36 mmol, TON: 317.5) were obtained for Ni1Ru-UiO-67 and Ni2Ru-UiO-67, respectively.After 20 h irradiation, the TON of CO production of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 was reached 581 with CO selectivity of 99 (calculated as TON (CO)/TON(CO H 2 )), indicating that Ni3Ru-UiO-67 can photo-reduce CO 2 to CO selectively.Control experiments only with BIH or TEOA of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 showed the TON for CO were 216.1 and 60.7, respectively (Fig. 4b), suggesting that TEOA is advantageous for reduction of CO 2 .As previously reported 40, BIH can dramatically enhanced TON in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction because of its high reductive ability, fast deprotonation of the oxidized BIH species (BIH ), and twoelectron donating ability.On the other hand, to demonstrate the unique advantage of the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 composite, we compared the photocatalytic activities of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 to that of homogeneous Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 /Ru-H 2 L (the Ni(II) complex with the same Ni loading as that in Ni3Ru-UiO-67) as control.As shown in Fig. 4a, the activity of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 is similar with that of Ni3Ru-UIO-67 at the first 5 h.With increasing the reaction time, the activities of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 decrease because of the selfaggregation and oxidative self-degradation, while the activities of Ni3Ru-UIO-67 can be stabilized up to 10 h.The results demonstrate that encapsulating molecular catalyst into photoactive MOF is a promising approach to design efficient, stable and recyclable photocatalysts.It should be noted, compared with the reported photocatalytic activity of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 18, the TON value of 280 of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 in this work is higher than the reported experimental value (ca.180) at the first 5 h, but the stability in this work is lower.The reason may be attributed to the higher power light source in this work (a 82 W LED for this work and a 6 W LED for reported experiment).In addition, the Confirmation of the carbon source is essential for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in heterogeneous systems.Isotopic labeling experiment was performed with 13 CO 2 , and the gaseous product was detected by GC-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) to investigate the carbon source of the produced CO.After 6 h of visible-light irradiation, GC-MS analysis showed clearly the signals of 13 CO (m/z 29).In contrast, the signal was absent in the GC-MS spectra when 12 CO 2 was used as the reactant (Fig. S14 online), unambiguously confirming that CO was generated from CO 2 photoreduction. In order to evaluate the stability of NiRu-UiO-67 composite, the catalyst durability tests were carried out under the optimized conditions taking into account the relatively high CO evolution rate.The recycling tests were explored by collecting catalyst after each 5 h illumination via centrifugation and dispersal in a fresh catalysis solution.Fig. 4c shows TON of CO and H 2 for Ni3Ru-UiO-67 as a function of time in consecutive five reaction cycles.Although the CO evolution dependence on time deviates from linearity gradually after 10 h, the initial rate in every run can be evaluated from the slope of straight line portion at the first 5 h.The highest rate of 10.19 lmol/h appears in the first run, and there is only a slight decrease in the fifth run (Fig. S15 online).PXRD analyses of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 after photocatalytic reaction showed no significant change in the diffraction patterns, suggesting its structural stability (Fig. 4d).Furthermore, after the fifth run, the concen-tration of Ni in the supernatant solution before and after catalysis were measured by ICP-MS to examine the possibility of Ni leaching, indicated that less than 0.5 of Ni was leached into the solution during catalysis process.The high activity and good durability of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 demonstrate the great potential in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. In order to uncover the photocatalytic mechanism of NiRu-UiO-67 system, the electrochemical properties of Ni(II) complex were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a solution of DMF/H 2 O (9:1, v:v) under N 2 atmosphere.As described in Fig. 5a, two irreversible reductive waves are attributable to step-by-step reduction and changes of octahedral Ni II to tetrahedral Ni 0 complexes.The first wave of Ni(II) complex at A0.60 V (vs.NHE) can be assigned to be the reduction of the Ni center from Ni II to Ni I and the second cathodic wave at -0.79 V (vs.NHE) was corresponded to a metal-centered Ni I /Ni 0 redox process.Moreover, the oxidative peak observed at around 0.5 V is likely due to the ligand-centred oxidation of tetrahedral Ni 0 complexes 41.This result reflects that the excellent activity of NiRu-UiO-67 composite is correlated with the reduction of the Ni(II) complex. To confirm the thermodynamic feasibility of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and the driving force for the reduction of CO 2 , the free energy change (DG 0 ) was introduced which can be used to estimate a PET process from Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) complex.The DG 0 is calculated by the Rehm-Weller equation (Eq.( 1)) 42: C 14 where, E ox is the oxidative potential of the species donating an electron (Ru-H 2 L), E red is the reductive potential of the species accepting an electron (Ni(II) complex), E 00 is the energy difference between the ground and excited states of the photosensitizer and C is the sum of the solvation effect that accounts for the change in coulombic interactions due to the charge shift in solution.As the dielectric constants of the polar solvents DMF are quite high, the term C could be negligible (Eq.( 2)) 43.As shown in Fig. 5, CVs of Ni(II) complex and Ru-H 2 L show that the first oxidation E ox of Ru-H 2 L is 1.20 V (vs.NHE) and the first reduction E red of Ni(II) complex is A0.60 V (vs.NHE).The E 00 value of 2.10 V can be calculated from the luminescence emission peak at 590 nm of Ru-H 2 L at room temperature (Fig. S8a online).Fitting of the above data to Eq. ( 1), a negative DG 0 of A0.30 V was obtained, suggesting the PET progress from Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) is thermodynamically favourable.In order to investigate the excited state (ES) and electron transfer (ET) dynamics in NiRu-UiO-67 composite, we also carried out the optical transient absorption (TA) measurements.Fig. 6a shows the ultrafast TA spectra of Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 at the selected delay times after the excitation at 450 nm.The TA spectra of Ru-UiO-67 was used as a control to illustrate the intrinsic ES dynamics of Ru-moiety in MOF framework without Ni(II) molecular catalyst.The spectra of Ru-UiO-67 exhibits two instantaneously formed spectral features, a negative band centered at 530 nm and a broad photoinduced positive absorption features between 620 and 770 nm, which can be attributed to the ground state bleach (GSB) and excited state absorption (ESA) of Ru-moiety, respectively.Such transient absorption profile of Ru-UiO-67 is similar with those of reported in literatures containing Ru-moiety complex 44.Similar to the spectra of Ru-UiO-67, the TA spectra of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 also show two main spectral features, a GSB band centred at 520 nm and a broad ESA band in 570-770 nm region.The whole spectra of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 shift to shorter wavelengths with respect to that of Ru-UiO-67 because of the formation of a ET state between Ru-moiety and Ni(II) complex, which is consistent with their steady-state spectrum 45.Furthermore, the amplitude of GSB at 520 nm increases within 7 ns, distinctly different to that of Ru-UiO-67.These spectroscopic features indicate that the excited state of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 turned into the reduced state due to electron transfer processes, but rather than relaxing to ground state as in the neat Ru-UiO-67.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the ESA kinetics in Ni3Ru-UiO-67 decays faster than that in Ru-UiO-67, further supporting the ET process from excited Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) complex in Ni3Ru-UiO-67. To further investigate the catalytic mechanism of Ni(bpet) (H 2 O) 2 , we carried out the DFT calculations (see the Supporting Information online) 46, which can probe the active site of Ni(II) complex and the adsorption energy and charge difference density of Based on the above experimental results and theoretical calculations, we propose the following reaction mechanism for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in NiRu-UiO-67 system.As shown in Fig. 8, under the visible-light irradiation, the ligand Ru(dcbpy) (bpy) 2 2 will be excited forming the triplet MLCT excited state, 3 Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 , which is subjected to a reductive quenching by one electron from BIH (indicated by Stern-Volmer experiment, Fig. S17 online), then afforded Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 and oxidized BIH (BIH ).However, BIH is easily deprotonated, the deprotonated BI can supply one more electron to reduce another 3 Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 producing 2 equiv. of Ru(dcbpy) (bpy) 2 in the overall photoinduced process.Then Ni(II) complex was reduced by two Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 to afford a Ni 0 (bpet) intermediate and two Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 with a two-electrons process.Finally, CO 2 binds to the reduced Ni 0 through the carbon atom forming a Ni-CO 2 adduct, after which protonation gives CO and regenerates the catalyst, completing the catalytic cycle.On the other hand, the formation of H 2 could result from the reduction of the existing protons in the reaction system by the light-induced electrons.Noteworthy, in the reduction process TEOA works as a base for BIH , which should suppress back electron transfer from Ni(bpet) to BIH as one of the obstruction processes of the photocatalytic reduction (Fig. S18 online) 47."}, {"llm generation": "Liquid (solution of DMF/H2O)", "source": "In order to uncover the photocatalytic

prototype UiO-67 peaks, clearly demonstrating that the crystallinity of the Ru-UiO-67 host is maintained upon encapsulation of the Ni(II) complex.BET surface area measurements at 77 K calculated from the N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms show BET surface area of 2,135, 1,210, 1,150, 1,040, 890 m 2 /g were observed, respectively, for UiO-67, Ru-UiO-67, Ni1Ru-UiO-67, Ni2Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 (Fig. 2b).The decrease in the BET surface area of the Ru-UiO-67 compared with pristine UiO-67, which is owing to the introduction of Ru (bpy) 2 groups in Ru-UiO-67.On the other hand, the decreased N 2 sorption of the composites indicate that the Ni(II) complex was indeed located in the Ru-UiO-67.Among them, the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 exhibits the lowest BET surface area, revealing the highest loading of Ni(II) complex, which is in good agreement with the ICP-MS analysis indicated above.Infrared spectra of Ni3Ru-UiO-67, ligands and Ni(II) complex were comparable with that of undoped Ru-UiO-67 (Fig. S7 online).Considerable similarities were observed between Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 with minor differences in band position and shape.However, an increased band between 2,950-2,920 cm A1 assigned to typical of S-CH 2 -stretching vibrations in Ni3Ru-UiO-67 was observed, due to the encapsulation of the Ni(II) complex.As shown in Fig. 2c, the additional broad absorption in the range of 370-650 nm in NiRu-UiO-67 and Ru-UiO-67 is attributed to the Ru(d p (II) complex in Ru-UIO-67.On the other hand, further evidence for the successful encapsulation of Ni(II) complex into Ru-UiO-67 was afforded by photoluminescence emission spectroscopy.As shown in Fig. 2d, the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy of NiRu-UiO-67 composites are descending compared with that of Ru-UiO-67, not only attribute to the weaker absorption but also due to the electron transfer from the photoexcited state of the Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 units to the encapsulated neighbouring Ni(II) complex 31.This is further supported by timeresolved photoluminescence measurements.As shown in Fig. S8 (online), the Ru-UiO-67 exhibits a lifetime of 385 ns, while Ni1Ru-UIO-67, Ni2Ru-UIO-67 and Ni3Ru-UIO-67 show lifetime 156, 127 and 109 ns, respectively.Lifetime decreases and enhanced quenching effect of NiRu-MOFs indicated that the facile electron transfer from the excited Ru-MOFs to encapsulated Ni(II) complex due to their proximity.Furthermore, the PL of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 is much weaker than that of others, indicating the PL of Ru-UiO-67 is quenched by more Ni(II) complex.The efficient PL quenching reflected that electron transfer process was remarkably enhanced through the unique one-cage-one-guest encapsulation pattern.These results indicate that Ni3Ru-UiO-67 will possess superior photocatalytic activity compared with Ni1Ru-UiO-67 and Ni2Ru-UiO-67. The SEM observation for Ni3Ru-UiO-67 and Ru-UiO-67 shows that the loading of the Ni(II) complex does not affect the MOF morphology, and the MOF crystals remain intact in the composites (Fig. S9 online).The detailed nanostructure of the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 was further investigated by TEM.As shown in Fig. 2e, the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 shows an octahedral morphology, which is in good agreement with SEM observations.The elemental mapping analysis of Ni, S, Ru and Zr performed on an extended area of a solid sample of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 revealed that the elements were uniformly distributed inside the Ru-UiO-67, further attesting to the Ni(II) complex that was homogeneously encapsulated in the pores of the Ru-UiO-67.In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the UiO-67, Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 were conducted in an N 2 atmosphere (Fig. S10 online).Similar to the pristine Ru-UiO-67, the Ni1Ru-UiO-67, Ni2Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 also exhibited two decomposition steps at 50 to 400 C and 400 C, respectively.The weight loss decreases between 50 and 250 C, indicating that the Ni(II) complex replaces part of solvent molecules in the cage of the Ru-UiO-67. XPS was carried out to analyze the chemical compositions and binding environments of the samples.Note that the electron binding energy not only depends on the element itself but also the chemical state in samples 32.The XPS spectrum of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 in Fig. 3a displays the signatures of C, O, N, S, Ru and Ni.As shown in Fig. 3b, the high-resolution S 2p XPS spectrum displays two broad peaks at 164.0 and 168.8 eV pertaining to S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2 , respectively 33.The S 2p peaks were attributed to the bound nickel-thiol species 34.A high-resolution XPS Ni 2p spectrum shows the peaks at 856.7 eV (Ni 2p 3/2 ) and 873.8 eV (Ni 2p 1/2 ) (Fig. 3c) 35, which corresponds to the peak position of Ni-S 36.As shown in Fig. 3a andd, the peaks at 484.7 eV (Ru 3p 3/2 ) and 462.6 eV (Ru 3p 1/2 ) in both Ru-UiO-67 and NiRu-UiO-67 are in agreement with the pattern of Ru 2 .All the above results demonstrate that Ni(II) complex was successfully encapsulated into the robust Ru-UiO-67., UV-vis spectra (c) and PL emission spectra (d) of UiO-67, Ru-UiO-67, Ni1Ru-UiO-67, Ni2Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 (k ex 446 nm, refer to its UV-vis spectrum).(e) TEM image of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 and elemental mapping of the various elements (Ni, S, Ru, and Zr) contained in Ni3Ru-UiO-67. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of NiRu-UiO-67 composites were performed in a closed gas circulation and evacuation system.Each of the catalyst (20 mg) was independently suspended in a mixture of DMF (27 mL), deionized water (3 mL), BIH (0.1 mol/L), and TEOA (0.5 mol/L), which was deoxygenated by CO 2 and irradiated with a LED light (82 W).BIH as a sacrificial reductant can efficiently quench the excited state of photosensitizer, whereas TEOA mainly functions as a proton acceptor for BIH 37.As shown in Fig. 4a, the generation of CO increases almost linearly with irradiation time upon 10 h.Ni3Ru-UiO-67 exhibits the CO evolution rate of 426.05 mmol/(g h) (85.21 mmol) with a catalytic turnover number (TON) of 510.0 (defined as n(CO)/n(Ni(bpet)(H 2 O) 2 ), which holds a high catalytic performance among reported MOF catalysts (Table S4 online) 38,39.Notably, only a negligible amount of H 2 could be detected (Fig. S11 online), and no formate was detected by HPLC analysis and 1 H NMR spectroscopy (Figs.S12 and S13 online).The CO evolution rates of 55.25 mmol/(mg h) (yield: 11.05 mmol, TON: 136.7) and 196.80 mmol/(g h) (yield: 39.36 mmol, TON: 317.5) were obtained for Ni1Ru-UiO-67 and Ni2Ru-UiO-67, respectively.After 20 h irradiation, the TON of CO production of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 was reached 581 with CO selectivity of 99 (calculated as TON (CO)/TON(CO H 2 )), indicating that Ni3Ru-UiO-67 can photo-reduce CO 2 to CO selectively.Control experiments only with BIH or TEOA of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 showed the TON for CO were 216.1 and 60.7, respectively (Fig. 4b), suggesting that TEOA is advantageous for reduction of CO 2 .As previously reported 40, BIH can dramatically enhanced TON in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction because of its high reductive ability, fast deprotonation of the oxidized BIH species (BIH ), and twoelectron donating ability.On the other hand, to demonstrate the unique advantage of the Ni3Ru-UiO-67 composite, we compared the photocatalytic activities of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 to that of homogeneous Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 /Ru-H 2 L (the Ni(II) complex with the same Ni loading as that in Ni3Ru-UiO-67) as control.As shown in Fig. 4a, the activity of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 is similar with that of Ni3Ru-UIO-67 at the first 5 h.With increasing the reaction time, the activities of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 decrease because of the selfaggregation and oxidative self-degradation, while the activities of Ni3Ru-UIO-67 can be stabilized up to 10 h.The results demonstrate that encapsulating molecular catalyst into photoactive MOF is a promising approach to design efficient, stable and recyclable photocatalysts.It should be noted, compared with the reported photocatalytic activity of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 18, the TON value of 280 of Ni II (bpet)(H 2 O) 2 in this work is higher than the reported experimental value (ca.180) at the first 5 h, but the stability in this work is lower.The reason may be attributed to the higher power light source in this work (a 82 W LED for this work and a 6 W LED for reported experiment).In addition, the Confirmation of the carbon source is essential for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in heterogeneous systems.Isotopic labeling experiment was performed with 13 CO 2 , and the gaseous product was detected by GC-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) to investigate the carbon source of the produced CO.After 6 h of visible-light irradiation, GC-MS analysis showed clearly the signals of 13 CO (m/z 29).In contrast, the signal was absent in the GC-MS spectra when 12 CO 2 was used as the reactant (Fig. S14 online), unambiguously confirming that CO was generated from CO 2 photoreduction. In order to evaluate the stability of NiRu-UiO-67 composite, the catalyst durability tests were carried out under the optimized conditions taking into account the relatively high CO evolution rate.The recycling tests were explored by collecting catalyst after each 5 h illumination via centrifugation and dispersal in a fresh catalysis solution.Fig. 4c shows TON of CO and H 2 for Ni3Ru-UiO-67 as a function of time in consecutive five reaction cycles.Although the CO evolution dependence on time deviates from linearity gradually after 10 h, the initial rate in every run can be evaluated from the slope of straight line portion at the first 5 h.The highest rate of 10.19 lmol/h appears in the first run, and there is only a slight decrease in the fifth run (Fig. S15 online).PXRD analyses of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 after photocatalytic reaction showed no significant change in the diffraction patterns, suggesting its structural stability (Fig. 4d).Furthermore, after the fifth run, the concen-tration of Ni in the supernatant solution before and after catalysis were measured by ICP-MS to examine the possibility of Ni leaching, indicated that less than 0.5 of Ni was leached into the solution during catalysis process.The high activity and good durability of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 demonstrate the great potential in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. In order to uncover the photocatalytic mechanism of NiRu-UiO-67 system, the electrochemical properties of Ni(II) complex were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a solution of DMF/H 2 O (9:1, v:v) under N 2 atmosphere.As described in Fig. 5a, two irreversible reductive waves are attributable to step-by-step reduction and changes of octahedral Ni II to tetrahedral Ni 0 complexes.The first wave of Ni(II) complex at A0.60 V (vs.NHE) can be assigned to be the reduction of the Ni center from Ni II to Ni I and the second cathodic wave at -0.79 V (vs.NHE) was corresponded to a metal-centered Ni I /Ni 0 redox process.Moreover, the oxidative peak observed at around 0.5 V is likely due to the ligand-centred oxidation of tetrahedral Ni 0 complexes 41.This result reflects that the excellent activity of NiRu-UiO-67 composite is correlated with the reduction of the Ni(II) complex. To confirm the thermodynamic feasibility of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and the driving force for the reduction of CO 2 , the free energy change (DG 0 ) was introduced which can be used to estimate a PET process from Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) complex.The DG 0 is calculated by the Rehm-Weller equation (Eq.( 1)) 42: C 14 where, E ox is the oxidative potential of the species donating an electron (Ru-H 2 L), E red is the reductive potential of the species accepting an electron (Ni(II) complex), E 00 is the energy difference between the ground and excited states of the photosensitizer and C is the sum of the solvation effect that accounts for the change in coulombic interactions due to the charge shift in solution.As the dielectric constants of the polar solvents DMF are quite high, the term C could be negligible (Eq.( 2)) 43.As shown in Fig. 5, CVs of Ni(II) complex and Ru-H 2 L show that the first oxidation E ox of Ru-H 2 L is 1.20 V (vs.NHE) and the first reduction E red of Ni(II) complex is A0.60 V (vs.NHE).The E 00 value of 2.10 V can be calculated from the luminescence emission peak at 590 nm of Ru-H 2 L at room temperature (Fig. S8a online).Fitting of the above data to Eq. ( 1), a negative DG 0 of A0.30 V was obtained, suggesting the PET progress from Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) is thermodynamically favourable.In order to investigate the excited state (ES) and electron transfer (ET) dynamics in NiRu-UiO-67 composite, we also carried out the optical transient absorption (TA) measurements.Fig. 6a shows the ultrafast TA spectra of Ru-UiO-67 and Ni3Ru-UiO-67 at the selected delay times after the excitation at 450 nm.The TA spectra of Ru-UiO-67 was used as a control to illustrate the intrinsic ES dynamics of Ru-moiety in MOF framework without Ni(II) molecular catalyst.The spectra of Ru-UiO-67 exhibits two instantaneously formed spectral features, a negative band centered at 530 nm and a broad photoinduced positive absorption features between 620 and 770 nm, which can be attributed to the ground state bleach (GSB) and excited state absorption (ESA) of Ru-moiety, respectively.Such transient absorption profile of Ru-UiO-67 is similar with those of reported in literatures containing Ru-moiety complex 44.Similar to the spectra of Ru-UiO-67, the TA spectra of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 also show two main spectral features, a GSB band centred at 520 nm and a broad ESA band in 570-770 nm region.The whole spectra of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 shift to shorter wavelengths with respect to that of Ru-UiO-67 because of the formation of a ET state between Ru-moiety and Ni(II) complex, which is consistent with their steady-state spectrum 45.Furthermore, the amplitude of GSB at 520 nm increases within 7 ns, distinctly different to that of Ru-UiO-67.These spectroscopic features indicate that the excited state of Ni3Ru-UiO-67 turned into the reduced state due to electron transfer processes, but rather than relaxing to ground state as in the neat Ru-UiO-67.As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the ESA kinetics in Ni3Ru-UiO-67 decays faster than that in Ru-UiO-67, further supporting the ET process from excited Ru-H 2 L to Ni(II) complex in Ni3Ru-UiO-67. To further investigate the catalytic mechanism of Ni(bpet) (H 2 O) 2 , we carried out the DFT calculations (see the Supporting Information online) 46, which can probe the active site of Ni(II) complex and the adsorption energy and charge difference density of Based on the above experimental results and theoretical calculations, we propose the following reaction mechanism for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in NiRu-UiO-67 system.As shown in Fig. 8, under the visible-light irradiation, the ligand Ru(dcbpy) (bpy) 2 2 will be excited forming the triplet MLCT excited state, 3 Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 , which is subjected to a reductive quenching by one electron from BIH (indicated by Stern-Volmer experiment, Fig. S17 online), then afforded Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 and oxidized BIH (BIH ).However, BIH is easily deprotonated, the deprotonated BI can supply one more electron to reduce another 3 Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 producing 2 equiv. of Ru(dcbpy) (bpy) 2 in the overall photoinduced process.Then Ni(II) complex was reduced by two Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 to afford a Ni 0 (bpet) intermediate and two Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 2 with a two-electrons process.Finally, CO 2 binds to the reduced Ni 0 through the carbon atom forming a Ni-CO 2 adduct, after which protonation gives CO and regenerates the catalyst, completing the catalytic cycle.On the other hand, the formation of H 2 could result from the reduction of the existing protons in the reaction system by the light-induced electrons.Noteworthy, in the reduction process TEOA works as a base for BIH , which should suppress back electron transfer from Ni(bpet) to BIH as one of the obstruction processes of the photocatalytic reduction (Fig. S18 online) 47."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "In a typical experiment, NiRu-UiO-67 (20 mg) was suspended in a mixed solution of DMF (27 mL), deionized water (3 mL), 1,3dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazole (BIH, 0.1 mol/ L) and triethanolamine (TEOA) (0.5 mol/L), then the suspension was purged with CO 2 gas for 30 min while stirring.", "context": "Synthesis of Ru(dcbpy)(bpy) 2 Cl 2 (Ru-H 2 L) and bpet: the two ligands were synthesized according to previously published procedures 29,30; synthetic details are provided in the Supporting Information (Figs.S1 and S2 online).
