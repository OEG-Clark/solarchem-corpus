A desired amount of Cu NPs (0, 20, 40 or 80 mg) was dispersed into 3 mL of ethanol containing 0.2 g water and hydrogen chloride (H 2 O/HCl/C 2 H 5 OH, pH 3).Following that, 0.84 g of Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 was dissolved in 3 mL of ethanol and dropwise added into Cu NPs suspension under ultrasonic wave.The mixture was transformed into gel after about 40 min.The gel was heated to 150 C to remove ethanol, butanol and HCl.The above steps carried out under the protection of H 2 flow.Finally, the sample was annealed at 450 C for 2 h under high vacuum.The obtained photocatalysts with specific Cu content were denoted as TiO 2 , 1 CuTiO 2 , 2 CuTiO 2 and 4 CuTiO 2 , respectively.
