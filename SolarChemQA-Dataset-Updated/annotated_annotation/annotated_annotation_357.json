The highest initial energy conversion efficiency obtained was 0.04.However, the efficiency declined with prolonged illumination, suggesting that the observed photoreduction is not a truly photocatalytic reaction."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2", "source": "In table 1, results are presented for the photoassisted production of formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol in suspensions of TiO 2 in aqueous lithium carbonate through which carbon dioxide was bubbled.", "context": "In table 1, results are presented for the photoassisted production of formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol in suspensions of TiO 2 in aqueous lithium carbonate through which carbon dioxide was bubbled.Also, the efficiency () of conversion of optical to chemical energy is given in the last column, calculated as, efficiency 100(heat of combustion of products)/incident light flux. As shown in the table, the production rates and conversion efficiencies after about 48 h of irradiation were always significantly lower than after about 24 hindicating a decay in the photoactivity of the titanium oxide materials.Even further decline in production rates was observed with more prolonged irradiation, carried out in several experiments up to one week.Formic acid was the predominant product in all reactions; an example is shown in Fig. 1, presenting (on a semi-log scale) the amount of products accumulated (in micromoles) as a function of illumination time. In respect to formic acid and formaldehyde production, the best results were with anatase Degussa(a).Methanol production rates were in all cases low, about 0.03 to 0.2 pM h-t.The addition of 0.001 M sodium sulfide, Montedison(f), resulted in a remarkable enhancement of the organic products relative to the experiment carried out in the absence of sulfide ions, Montedison(e), thus raising the initial energy conversion efficiency from 0.01 to 0.02. Since CO2 has no low lying orbitals and therefore cannot be directly excited by visible light, TiO 2 and TiO2-doped materials with noble metals and transition element ions are suitable to adsorb the high energy end of the solar spectrum.This is one of the reasons why Ru, Cr and V-doped TiO2 have been chosen.Also TiO 2 semiconductor powders with suitable loading on their surface have been shown to be active redox catalysts.They may enable the conversion of adsorbed CO 2 to useful products, without going through high energy intermediates which are required for the homogeneous reduction of CO 2. RuO 2 has been chosen as a noble metal redox catalyst, since it has been shown to have reductive as well as oxidative properties 22.High dispersions of the noble metal oxide RuO 2, as chosen in this work, are essential to achieve good yields.RuO 2 promotes the transfer of valence band holes which are involved in the primary step of water oxidation and which must play an important role in the process under study 26.Cr doping on TiO 2 has been chosen, since it is known that it improves the spectral response of TiO2-based photoelectrolysis cells 25.The effect could be due to the induction of a d-type transition Cr Ti 4. The Nb205 additive to TiO 2 may act as an n-dopant, possibly introducing a Schottky barrier at the particle/solution interface, which may assist electron injection into the reactant.Moreover, Nb205 doping causes a slight cathodic shift in the flat band potential of TiO 2 27. V205 on TiO 2 has been reported to increase the magnetic susceptibility of titanium oxide 28.Since CO 2 reduction is expected to take place on active paramagnetic surfaces (and not on all the available surface of titania), this loaded material has been tested as a catalyst. It is interesting to note the enhancement in the yields of CO 2 photoreduction products in the presence of sulfide ions (table 1).The presence of sulfide anions had previously been shown to enhance the yield of hydrated electrons produced by the laser illumination of aqueous colloids.This was explained by a mechanism involving scavenging of positive holes by sulfide anions 29. Since the efficiency of formation of organic products by the above method was only about 0.03-0.04at best and this efficiency further declined after more than one day of irradiation -this method cannot be considered as a practical process.The observed low efficiency may be due to two causes: there could exist a highly efficient reverse reaction, in which a reduced intermediate species such as the radical-anion CO 2- 30 is oxidized by a photogenerated OH radical 31,32.An alternative explanation could be that the TiO z samples contained a small amount of reduced sites, such as Ti 3 , which under illumination, reduced an equivalent amount of CO 2 to organic compounds."}, {"llm generation": "TiO 2 and TiO2-doped materials with noble metals and transition element ions", "source": "Since CO2 has no low lying orbitals and therefore cannot be directly excited by visible light, TiO 2 and TiO2-doped materials with noble metals and transition element ions are suitable to adsorb the high energy end of the solar spectrum.", "context": "In table 1, results are presented for the photoassisted production of formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol in suspensions of TiO 2 in aqueous lithium carbonate through which carbon dioxide was bubbled.Also, the efficiency () of conversion of optical to chemical energy is given in the last column, calculated as, efficiency 100(heat of combustion of products)/incident light flux.

We found that 400C gave the best catalyst. A similar procedure was followed to obtain V2Os-doped TiO 2. A similar procedure, based on the Blumenfeld method, was used to prepare Cr-doped TiO 2. In this case, the calculated amount of K2Cr207 (0.57 mg Cr/g TiO 2) was added to the slurry.The products were mixed, filtered and subsequently annealed at 400C for one hour. We used two procedures to load TiO 2 with RuO 2, according to the nature of the surface of the TiO 2 support.Degussa P25 (used as supplied): RuO 2 was deposited from RuC13 H20 by impregnating the powder with the desired amount of aqueous RuCI 3 solution; the slurry was then dried and calcined in air for 1 h at 300C to form the RuO 2. Montedison: The powder was treated with a calculated amount of a RuC13 solution and neutralized with KOH to pH 6.The product was filtered and dried in vacuo overnight at IO0C. The surface area was measured by low temperature N 2 adsorption with the BET method, using a Sorptomatic apparatus (C.Erba).The adsorption-desorption curve shows the particles to be porous and to have high surface area for the Montedison type TiO2. Carbon dioxide gas was purified by passing it through a series of three wash bottles with chromic sulfuric acid, then through three wash bottles with distilled water.The third of these water washbottles was kept at 0C; samples of this water were periodically checked for the presence of organic impurities.The purified carbon dioxide was then led through a fritted glass disk into the reaction flask, which was the outer chamber of a concentric photochemical reactor made of borosilicate glass.Illumination was provided by a 75 W high pressure mercury immersion lamp (Hanau Q81), which was immersed in a thermostatted jacket (1 cm deep), through which water at 45C was circulated 19.The outgoing gas from the reaction flask was led into a series of three traps cooled to 0C, each containing about 20 ml of distilled water.Samples from the reaction flask and the traps were about once a day sampled for analysis. Methanol, acetaldehyde and ethanol were analysed by gas chromatography on Porapak Q (2 m column) with flame ionization detection.Formaldehyde was determined colorimetrically with acetylacetone 23.Formic acid was determined by its reduction with magnesium and hydrochloric acid to formaldehyde, which was then assayed with acetylacetone 23. Measurement of the light flux incident on the reaction zone was carried out using a YSI Kettering Radiometer (model 55A), indicating an energy input of about 140 W m -2, as well as using a Lambda Instrument Corp. Quantum/radiometer/ photometer (type LI-170), showing a photon flux of about 760 microeinstein m -z S -1. In table 1, results are presented for the photoassisted production of formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol in suspensions of TiO 2 in aqueous lithium carbonate through which carbon dioxide was bubbled.Also, the efficiency () of conversion of optical to chemical energy is given in the last column, calculated as, efficiency 100(heat of combustion of products)/incident light flux. As shown in the table, the production rates and conversion efficiencies after about 48 h of irradiation were always significantly lower than after about 24 hindicating a decay in the photoactivity of the titanium oxide materials.Even further decline in production rates was observed with more prolonged irradiation, carried out in several experiments up to one week.Formic acid was the predominant product in all reactions; an example is shown in Fig. 1, presenting (on a semi-log scale) the amount of products accumulated (in micromoles) as a function of illumination time. In respect to formic acid and formaldehyde production, the best results were with anatase Degussa(a).Methanol production rates were in all cases low, about 0.03 to 0.2 pM h-t.The addition of 0.001 M sodium sulfide, Montedison(f), resulted in a remarkable enhancement of the organic products relative to the experiment carried out in the absence of sulfide ions, Montedison(e), thus raising the initial energy conversion efficiency from 0.01 to 0.02. Since CO2 has no low lying orbitals and therefore cannot be directly excited by visible light, TiO 2 and TiO2-doped materials with noble metals and transition element ions are suitable to adsorb the high energy end of the solar spectrum.This is one of the reasons why Ru, Cr and V-doped TiO2 have been chosen.Also TiO 2 semiconductor powders with suitable loading on their surface have been shown to be active redox catalysts.They may enable the conversion of adsorbed CO 2 to useful products, without going through high energy intermediates which are required for the homogeneous reduction of CO 2. RuO 2 has been chosen as a noble metal redox catalyst, since it has been shown to have reductive as well as oxidative properties 22.High dispersions of the noble metal oxide RuO 2, as chosen in this work, are essential to achieve good yields.RuO 2 promotes the transfer of valence band holes which are involved in the primary step of water oxidation and which must play an important role in the process under study 26.Cr doping on TiO 2 has been chosen, since it is known that it improves the spectral response of TiO2-based photoelectrolysis cells 25.The effect could be due to the induction of a d-type transition Cr Ti 4. The Nb205 additive to TiO 2 may act as an n-dopant, possibly introducing a Schottky barrier at the particle/solution interface, which may assist electron injection into the reactant.Moreover, Nb205 doping causes a slight cathodic shift in the flat band potential of TiO 2 27. V205 on TiO 2 has been reported to increase the magnetic susceptibility of titanium oxide 28.Since CO 2 reduction is expected to take place on active paramagnetic surfaces (and not on all the available surface of titania), this loaded material has been tested as a catalyst.

In the present work, noble metal oxide and transition element doped TiO 2 have been tested in the reduction of aqueous CO 2.

As shown in the table, the production rates and conversion efficiencies after about 48 h of irradiation were always significantly lower than after about 24 hindicating a decay in the photoactivity of the titanium oxide materials.Even further decline in production rates was observed with more prolonged irradiation, carried out in several experiments up to one week.Formic acid was the predominant product in all reactions; an example is shown in Fig. 1, presenting (on a semi-log scale) the amount of products accumulated (in micromoles) as a function of illumination time. In respect to formic acid and formaldehyde production, the best results were with anatase Degussa(a).Methanol production rates were in all cases low, about 0.03 to 0.2 pM h-t.The addition of 0.001 M sodium sulfide, Montedison(f), resulted in a remarkable enhancement of the organic products relative to the experiment carried out in the absence of sulfide ions, Montedison(e), thus raising the initial energy conversion efficiency from 0.01 to 0.02. Since CO2 has no low lying orbitals and therefore cannot be directly excited by visible light, TiO 2 and TiO2-doped materials with noble metals and transition element ions are suitable to adsorb the high energy end of the solar spectrum.This is one of the reasons why Ru, Cr and V-doped TiO2 have been chosen.Also TiO 2 semiconductor powders with suitable loading on their surface have been shown to be active redox catalysts.They may enable the conversion of adsorbed CO 2 to useful products, without going through high energy intermediates which are required for the homogeneous reduction of CO 2. RuO 2 has been chosen as a noble metal redox catalyst, since it has been shown to have reductive as well as oxidative properties 22.High dispersions of the noble metal oxide RuO 2, as chosen in this work, are essential to achieve good yields.RuO 2 promotes the transfer of valence band holes which are involved in the primary step of water oxidation and which must play an important role in the process under study 26.Cr doping on TiO 2 has been chosen, since it is known that it improves the spectral response of TiO2-based photoelectrolysis cells 25.The effect could be due to the induction of a d-type transition Cr Ti 4. The Nb205 additive to TiO 2 may act as an n-dopant, possibly introducing a Schottky barrier at the particle/solution interface, which may assist electron injection into the reactant.Moreover, Nb205 doping causes a slight cathodic shift in the flat band potential of TiO 2 27. V205 on TiO 2 has been reported to increase the magnetic susceptibility of titanium oxide 28.Since CO 2 reduction is expected to take place on active paramagnetic surfaces (and not on all the available surface of titania), this loaded material has been tested as a catalyst. It is interesting to note the enhancement in the yields of CO 2 photoreduction products in the presence of sulfide ions (table 1).The presence of sulfide anions had previously been shown to enhance the yield of hydrated electrons produced by the laser illumination of aqueous colloids.This was explained by a mechanism involving scavenging of positive holes by sulfide anions 29. Since the efficiency of formation of organic products by the above method was only about 0.03-0.04at best and this efficiency further declined after more than one day of irradiation -this method cannot be considered as a practical process.The observed low efficiency may be due to two causes: there could exist a highly efficient reverse reaction, in which a reduced intermediate species such as the radical-anion CO 2- 30 is oxidized by a photogenerated OH radical 31,32.An alternative explanation could be that the TiO z samples contained a small amount of reduced sites, such as Ti 3 , which under illumination, reduced an equivalent amount of CO 2 to organic compounds. In the present work, noble metal oxide and transition element doped TiO 2 have been tested in the reduction of aqueous CO 2. The results observed are based on redox catalysts in aqueous suspensions, which can intervene rapidly in CO z reduction.More specificity must be sought for such materials in future work. Several advantages are evident from the heterogeneous redox catalysis approach to the photofixation of CO 2 as found in the present study: (1) RuO 2 levels used were not prohibitively expensive and (2) catalysts may be reused in continuous processes of this nature.Such reactions may become practical if increased efficiency could be achieved.

We found that 400C gave the best catalyst. A similar procedure was followed to obtain V2Os-doped TiO 2. A similar procedure, based on the Blumenfeld method, was used to prepare Cr-doped TiO 2. In this case, the calculated amount of K2Cr207 (0.57 mg Cr/g TiO 2) was added to the slurry.The products were mixed, filtered and subsequently annealed at 400C for one hour. We used two procedures to load TiO 2 with RuO 2, according to the nature of the surface of the TiO 2 support.Degussa P25 (used as supplied): RuO 2 was deposited from RuC13 H20 by impregnating the powder with the desired amount of aqueous RuCI 3 solution; the slurry was then dried and calcined in air for 1 h at 300C to form the RuO 2. Montedison: The powder was treated with a calculated amount of a RuC13 solution and neutralized with KOH to pH 6.The product was filtered and dried in vacuo overnight at IO0C. The surface area was measured by low temperature N 2 adsorption with the BET method, using a Sorptomatic apparatus (C.Erba).The adsorption-desorption curve shows the particles to be porous and to have high surface area for the Montedison type TiO2. Carbon dioxide gas was purified by passing it through a series of three wash bottles with chromic sulfuric acid, then through three wash bottles with distilled water.The third of these water washbottles was kept at 0C; samples of this water were periodically checked for the presence of organic impurities.The purified carbon dioxide was then led through a fritted glass disk into the reaction flask, which was the outer chamber of a concentric photochemical reactor made of borosilicate glass.Illumination was provided by a 75 W high pressure mercury immersion lamp (Hanau Q81), which was immersed in a thermostatted jacket (1 cm deep), through which water at 45C was circulated 19.The outgoing gas from the reaction flask was led into a series of three traps cooled to 0C, each containing about 20 ml of distilled water.Samples from the reaction flask and the traps were about once a day sampled for analysis. Methanol, acetaldehyde and ethanol were analysed by gas chromatography on Porapak Q (2 m column) with flame ionization detection.Formaldehyde was determined colorimetrically with acetylacetone 23.Formic acid was determined by its reduction with magnesium and hydrochloric acid to formaldehyde, which was then assayed with acetylacetone 23.

We found that 400C gave the best catalyst. A similar procedure was followed to obtain V2Os-doped TiO 2. A similar procedure, based on the Blumenfeld method, was used to prepare Cr-doped TiO 2. In this case, the calculated amount of K2Cr207 (0.57 mg Cr/g TiO 2) was added to the slurry.The products were mixed, filtered and subsequently annealed at 400C for one hour. We used two procedures to load TiO 2 with RuO 2, according to the nature of the surface of the TiO 2 support.Degussa P25 (used as supplied): RuO 2 was deposited from RuC13 H20 by impregnating the powder with the desired amount of aqueous RuCI 3 solution; the slurry was then dried and calcined in air for 1 h at 300C to form the RuO 2. Montedison: The powder was treated with a calculated amount of a RuC13 solution and neutralized with KOH to pH 6.The product was filtered and dried in vacuo overnight at IO0C. The surface area was measured by low temperature N 2 adsorption with the BET method, using a Sorptomatic apparatus (C.Erba).The adsorption-desorption curve shows the particles to be porous and to have high surface area for the Montedison type TiO2. Carbon dioxide gas was purified by passing it through a series of three wash bottles with chromic sulfuric acid, then through three wash bottles with distilled water.The third of these water washbottles was kept at 0C; samples of this water were periodically checked for the presence of organic impurities.The purified carbon dioxide was then led through a fritted glass disk into the reaction flask, which was the outer chamber of a concentric photochemical reactor made of borosilicate glass.Illumination was provided by a 75 W high pressure mercury immersion lamp (Hanau Q81), which was immersed in a thermostatted jacket (1 cm deep), through which water at 45C was circulated 19.The outgoing gas from the reaction flask was led into a series of three traps cooled to 0C, each containing about 20 ml of distilled water.Samples from the reaction flask and the traps were about once a day sampled for analysis. Methanol, acetaldehyde and ethanol were analysed by gas chromatography on Porapak Q (2 m column) with flame ionization detection.Formaldehyde was determined colorimetrically with acetylacetone 23.Formic acid was determined by its reduction with magnesium and hydrochloric acid to formaldehyde, which was then assayed with acetylacetone 23. Measurement of the light flux incident on the reaction zone was carried out using a YSI Kettering Radiometer (model 55A), indicating an energy input of about 140 W m -2, as well as using a Lambda Instrument Corp. Quantum/radiometer/ photometer (type LI-170), showing a photon flux of about 760 microeinstein m -z S -1. In table 1, results are presented for the photoassisted production of formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol in suspensions of TiO 2 in aqueous lithium carbonate through which carbon dioxide was bubbled.Also, the efficiency () of conversion of optical to chemical energy is given in the last column, calculated as, efficiency 100(heat of combustion of products)/incident light flux. As shown in the table, the production rates and conversion efficiencies after about 48 h of irradiation were always significantly lower than after about 24 hindicating a decay in the photoactivity of the titanium oxide materials.Even further decline in production rates was observed with more prolonged irradiation, carried out in several experiments up to one week.Formic acid was the predominant product in all reactions; an example is shown in Fig. 1, presenting (on a semi-log scale) the amount of products accumulated (in micromoles) as a function of illumination time. In respect to formic acid and formaldehyde production, the best results were with anatase Degussa(a).Methanol production rates were in all cases low, about 0.03 to 0.2 pM h-t.The addition of 0.001 M sodium sulfide, Montedison(f), resulted in a remarkable enhancement of the organic products relative to the experiment carried out in the absence of sulfide ions, Montedison(e), thus raising the initial energy conversion efficiency from 0.01 to 0.02. Since CO2 has no low lying orbitals and therefore cannot be directly excited by visible light, TiO 2 and TiO2-doped materials with noble metals and transition element ions are suitable to adsorb the high energy end of the solar spectrum.This is one of the reasons why Ru, Cr and V-doped TiO2 have been chosen.Also TiO 2 semiconductor powders with suitable loading on their surface have been shown to be active redox catalysts.They may enable the conversion of adsorbed CO 2 to useful products, without going through high energy intermediates which are required for the homogeneous reduction of CO 2. RuO 2 has been chosen as a noble metal redox catalyst, since it has been shown to have reductive as well as oxidative properties 22.High dispersions of the noble metal oxide RuO 2, as chosen in this work, are essential to achieve good yields.RuO 2 promotes the transfer of valence band holes which are involved in the primary step of water oxidation and which must play an important role in the process under study 26.Cr doping on TiO 2 has been chosen, since it is known that it improves the spectral response of TiO2-based photoelectrolysis cells 25.The effect could be due to the induction of a d-type transition Cr Ti 4. The Nb205 additive to TiO 2 may act as an n-dopant, possibly introducing a Schottky barrier at the particle/solution interface, which may assist electron injection into the reactant.Moreover, Nb205 doping causes a slight cathodic shift in the flat band potential of TiO 2 27. V205 on TiO 2 has been reported to increase the magnetic susceptibility of titanium oxide 28.Since CO 2 reduction is expected to take place on active paramagnetic surfaces (and not on all the available surface of titania), this loaded material has been tested as a catalyst. It is interesting to note the enhancement in the yields of CO 2 photoreduction products in the presence of sulfide ions (table 1).The presence of sulfide anions had previously been shown to enhance the yield of hydrated electrons produced by the laser illumination of aqueous colloids.This was explained by a mechanism involving scavenging of positive holes by sulfide anions 29. Since the efficiency of formation of organic products by the above method was only about 0.03-0.04at best and this efficiency further declined after more than one day of irradiation -this method cannot be considered as a practical process.The observed low efficiency may be due to two causes: there could exist a highly efficient reverse reaction, in which a reduced intermediate species such as the radical-anion CO 2- 30 is oxidized by a photogenerated OH radical 31,32.An alternative explanation could be that the TiO z samples contained a small amount of reduced sites, such as Ti 3 , which under illumination, reduced an equivalent amount of CO 2 to organic compounds. In the present work, noble metal oxide and transition element doped TiO 2 have been tested in the reduction of aqueous CO 2. The results observed are based on redox catalysts in aqueous suspensions, which can intervene rapidly in CO z reduction.More specificity must be sought for such materials in future work. Several advantages are evident from the heterogeneous redox catalysis approach to the photofixation of CO 2 as found in the present study: (1) RuO 2 levels used were not prohibitively expensive and (2) catalysts may be reused in continuous processes of this nature.Such reactions may become practical if increased efficiency could be achieved.
