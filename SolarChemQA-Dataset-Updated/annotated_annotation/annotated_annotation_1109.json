Y. Dou et al. framework NFs template-directed method (Fig. 1a).Firstly, the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) NFs (Fig. S1) was fabricated as a substrate for the insitu growth of ZnCu-MOF nanosheet with different Zn : Cu molar ratio (9:1, 7:3, and 5:4) with similar morphology (Fig. S2).It should be noted that further decrease the ratio of Zn: Cu to 5:5 will lead to the poor integration of ZnCu-MOF and PAN NFs (Fig. S3).Then, the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs were obtained by the pyrolysis of the ZnCu-MOFPAN NFs under Ar/H 2 atmosphere.Before the confirmation of the components of catalyst (Fig. 2), the morphology characterization (Fig. 1b-j) was firstly carried out to prove the fabrication process (Fig. 1a).As shown in Fig. 1b,c, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a well preserved hierarchical structure of ZnCu-MOFPAN derivative.The derived ZnO/CuO x -C nanosheet on carbon nanofibers exhibited a rough and wrinkled surface.The corresponding Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy showed the weight fraction ratio for C : O : Cu : Zn is 20.4 : 14.2 : 19.8: 45.6 (Fig. S4).Compared with the Zn-MOFPAN derived ZnO-C CNFs with a relatively smooth surface (Fig. S5), some small humps observed on the ZnO/CuO x -C nanosheet could be attributed to the introduced Cu ion in the precursor ZnCu-MOF (Fig. 1d).The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image combined with energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping (Fig. 1e,f) indicated highly distribution of Zn, Cu and O on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, which is different from that of the ZnO-C CNFs shown in Fig. S6.Moreover, the ZnO/CuO x heterojunction displayed small particle size (Fig. 1g-j).The CuO x sites are highly distributed on the ZnO nanoparticle with size of 10 nm (Fig. 1i).The ZnO was confirmed by the fringes with lattice space of 0.247 nm that indexed to the (101) plane of ZnO phase by high resolution (HR) TEM characterization (Fig. 1h).Furthermore, the HR-TEM of CuO x (Fig. 1j) demonstrated abundant Cu domains bound to Cu 2 O, which were confirmed by the fringes with lattice spaces of 0.245 and 0.211 nm that indexed to the (111) and (200) plane of Cu 2 O phase and lattice space of 0.205 nm that indexed to the (111) plane of Cu phase (Fig. 1j).26,28,31,32 In order to systemically illustrate the structure characterization of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalyst, ZnO-C and ZnO CNFs derived from the In order to reveal the detailed structure properties of ZnO/CuO x -C, the derivatives from MOF powder, instead of MOFPAN NFs were investigated to exclude the influence of PAN derived CNFs.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was first performed to illustrate the interaction of components in ZnO/CuO x -C.Compared with those of ZnO-C, a negetive shift that 0.6 and 0.8 eV for Zn 2p 3/2 (1021.3eV) and Zn 2p 1/2 (1044.3eV) peaks for ZnO/CuO x -C were observed (Fig. 2b).The result thus indicated the electron transfer from ZnO to CuO x , owing to the electronic coupling at the interface 33,34.Besides, the spectrum in the Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 region showed two sharp and symmetric peaks at 933.1 and 952.7 eV, respectively, indicating the existence of Cu(0) and Cu() in ZnO/CuO x -C (Fig. 2c) 28,35.In the contrast, the two satellite peaks of ZnO/CuO observed at 964.2 and 942.7 eV confirmed the Cu() in ZnO/CuO, being consistent with above XRD results (Figs. 2a andS7) 36.It should be noted that the electronic interaction of ZnO/CuO x -C is favorable for electron transfer at the interface.In addition, the optical absorption characterization of ZnO/CuO x -C revealed an evident increasing absorption intensity in the ultraviolet (UV)-visible (Vis) light.It should be noted that ZnO/CuO x -C showed similar profile with the Cu 2 O as control sample 29.We speculated the CuO x has similar band structure with Cu 2 O, because ZnO is only responsive to UV light compared with that of bare ZnO and Cu 2 O (Fig. 2d).The enhanced absorption intensity was probably attributed to the black carbon that could absorb solar light, which has a negligible effect on light penetration into the ZnO/CuO x because of its porous structure. The Raman spectrum was then performed to confirm the existence of carbon in ZnO/CuO x -C nanosheet.As shown in Fig. 2e, the two bands at 1342 (D-band) and 1594 cm -1 (G-band) are ascribed to the disordered/ defect carbon and graphitic sp2 carbon for ZnO/CuO x -C 34.It should be noted the carbon absorption character was observed on the derived ZnO/CuO as well, which was even obtained by air pyrolysis.The result indicated the organic ligands were not fully converted into a gas product even in the air atmosphere, remained as partial carbon owing to a mild pyrolysis temperature.Even so, further increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 550 C would lead to the break of the hierarchical structure (Fig. S8).No absorbing bands for inorganic components of ZnO/CuO x -C compared with ZnO/CuO indicated relative high mass fraction of derived carbon coated on ZnO/CuO x , which influences the detection of metal oxide.In the comparison that of ZnO/CuO, the Ar/H 2 atmosphere resulted in a higher degree of graphitization of carbon (I G /I D ) for ZnO/CuO x -C.Owing to the existence of carbon, the result in Fig. 2f showed ZnO/CuO x -C and ZnO-C contributed to largely improved CO 2 uptake capability among various control samples.Moreover, the higher CO 2 uptake of ZnO/CuO x -C compared with that of ZnO-C indicated that CuO x also served as active sites for CO 2 absorption. The photocatalytic CO 2 RR under full-light irradiation ( 200 nm) over ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs was firstly evaluated without the addition of any sacrificial reagents.CH 4 , CO and H 2 were the main detected products.First, we carried out a study on the CO 2 conversion performance of different ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalysts that are synthesized from various ratios of ZnO : CuO x .The ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs with the ZnO : CuO x ratio of 7:3 shows the best performance with the CH 4 generation rate of 12.08 mol h -1 and the CO and H 2 generation rate of only 0.07 and 0.04 mol h -1 , respectively (Figs. 3a andS9).It should be noted that a lower amount of products was detected during the first hour of the first run, indicating that CO 2 RR, OER and HER were depressed.After 1 h, the performance of CO 2 RR and OER improved (Figs. 3a andS10).The reason is that the occurrence of surface reconstruction (formation of the hydroxyl groups on ZnO) after 1 h improved the catalytic activity.We will explain this phenomenon detail in the next discussion section.Afterwards, the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalyst showed a slight decrease in CH 4 generation rate after five cycles.The performance is because of its stable structure and morphology, which is proved by the characterization of the catalyst before (Figs. 1 and2) and after (Fig. S11) photocatalytic reaction.Then, the 13 C-labelled isotropic experiment was conducted (Fig. 3b).The result confirmed that the CO and CH 4 are derived from CO 2 , not from the decomposition of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalyst.In addition, the photocatalytic reduction carried out under the N 2 instead of CO 2 showed a trace amount of CO and CH 4 product, further confirming the carbon in CH 4 is generated from CO 2 . The photocatalytic CO 2 RR over various photocatalysts derived from MOFPAN NFs was then evaluated.The conversion of primary product CH 4 as the function of reaction time is shown in Fig. 3c.The ZnO and ZnO-C CNFs showed a low CH 4 generation rate of 0.44 and 1.88 mol h -1 , respectively.It should be noted the CuO x CNFs cannot be used as a reference for the comparison because of the pure Cu-MOF cannot be formed as a template to obtain CuO x .Although the heterostructured ZnO/CuO CNFs could improve the electro-hole separation, the CH 4 generation rate was only achieved to 4.01 mol h -1 .In comparison, the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs display the highest CH 4 generation rate of 24.16 mol h -1 .The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is 0.205 , of which 0.195 is for CH 4 and 0.01 is for CO at 420 nm (Fig. S12).Meanwhile, the selectivity of CH 4 production is 96 for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, which is remarkably higher than those of derivatives ZnO (28.0 ), ZnO-C (57.3 ), and ZnO/CuO (70.2 ) CNFs (Fig. 3d).The result thus indicated that the formed carbon layer and well-integrated ZnO/CuO x heterojunction play a crucial role in improving conversion rate and selectivity. To investigate the impacts of particle size and uniformity on CO 2 RR performance, we synthesized and evaluated four reference catalysts: ZnOCu 2 O (50 nm) and Cu 2 OZnO (410 nm) synthesized by the bottom-up method, and Cu 2 O/ZnO (250 nm) and Cu 2 O/ZnO mixture (50 nm) synthesized by the top-down method 26272829.It was expected that a very low CH 4 generation rate over Cu 2 O/ZnO mixture (50 nm) was observed because of the particle agglomeration (Fig. 3e).Moreover, both conversion rate and selectivity of the other three reference catalysts, i.e., ZnOCu 2 O (50 nm), Cu 2 OZnO (410 nm) and Cu 2 O/ZnO (250 nm), are not enhanced remarkably, although the electro-hole separation rates were improved to some degree because of the heterostructure.For Cu 2 O/ZnO (250 nm), the relatively low performance is due to the weak combination between Cu 2 O and ZnO that slows charge transfer and the agglomeration that lowers the active site density.ZnOCu 2 O (50 nm) and Cu 2 OZnO (410 nm) synthesized by the bottom-down method offer uniform morphology, but the particle size is relatively large after the multi-step synthesis process.As a result, the interface integration area between ZnO and CuO 2 is low.The separated electron and hole are prone to combine in the bulk phase of ZnO or CuO 2 , leading to a weak synergistic effect.Moreover, the result (Fig. 3f) showed low CH 4 selectivity for all reference catalysts.The comparison results thus illustrated that the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, obtained by using MOF NFs template, could efficiently depress the H 2 generation and provide rich electrons to be transferred for CH 4 generation with high selectivity. Additional experiments were carried out to illustrate the high CO 2 conversion rate of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalyst.Firstly, the amperometric I-t curves measurement under chopped-light illumination was carried out (Fig. 4a).The high current density of ZnO-C compared with ZnO indicated that the derived carbon could improve transient photocurrent response.The current density of ZnO/CuO CNFs is lower than that of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, because the bandgap of Cu 2 O (2.4 eV) with a conduction band edge energy (-1.4 V vs. NHE) is higher than that of CuO (-0.8 V vs. NHE) 27.As a result, the ZnO/CuO x -C displayed wide light-harvesting absorption range and high mobility of the charge carriers, thus contributed to high activity for CO 2 RR among various MOF NFs derivatives.To illustrate that the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs with heterostructure is favorable for boosting the charge separation and transfer to activate CO 2 , we used the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy to characterize various heterojunction system.As shown in Fig. 4b, ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs exhibited the longest PL lifetime.The results indicated that the small size of heterojunction not only maximize the integration area to promote charge transfer between ZnO and CuO x , but also allow charge carriers to migrate rapidly from the interior to the surface, thus suppressing the electron-hole recombination. The photocatalytic mechanism of hetero-structured ZnO-Cu 2 O system has been widely investigated, which are normally belongs to either double-charge transfer or Z-scheme mechanism 26272837,38.To verify our hypothesis, we tested the photocatalytic performance of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs under visible light irradiation to exclude the influence of UV active ZnO component.A trace amount of O 2 , CH 4 , and H 2 production was detected during the reaction, indicating the double-charge transfer mechanism is not suitable for the ZnO/CuO x -C system because the h on the VB of Cu 2 O is incapable of oxidizing water.Besides, negligible CH 4 production of ZnO-C, as shown in Fig. 4c, implied CuO x is the main active site for the activation of CO 2 .The results demonstrated that only the hole on the VB of ZnO is suitable for the oxidation due to its positive valence band (VB) (E (VB) 2.39 V) 27.The charge on the CB of CuO x is more suitable for the reduction.If the double-charge transfer mechanism fitted the ZnO/CuO x -C system, the ZnO should have been the reactive site for the reduction reaction.Based on our analysis, we conclude that ZnO/CuO x -C system belongs to Z-scheme mechanism.Under light irradiation, electrons on the CB of ZnO can transfer to and combine with holes on the VB of CuO x .As a result, the electrons on CB of Cu 2 O can be efficiently separated and transferred to the more conductive Cu for the reduction reaction.Under such conditions, the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs system is capable of exhibiting high catalytic activity. Furthermore, the characterization of hydroxyl radicals (DMPO- OH) using 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a free-radical spintrapping agent detected by the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum could support the Z-scheme mechanism (Fig. 4d) 39,40.There were no prominent characteristic peaks under visible light irradiation.The relative higher peaks under UV light irradiation of DMPO- OH indicated that the holes from the VB of UV light-responsive ZnO mainly oxidized water to generate hydroxyl radicals , instead of visible light-responsive CuO x .In addition, the strongest signal peaks were observed for ZnO/-CuO x -C CNFs under full light irradiation, indicating there are more separated holes transferring to the ZnO surface instead of Cu 2 O surface.Therefore, the photoexcited electrons in the CB of ZnO would transfer to the VB of Cu 2 O and recombine with the holes therein.Subsequently, the rich accumulated electrons from the CB of Cu 2 O was trapped by the Cu site for the CO 2 RR (Fig. 4c). The surface reconstruction on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs catalyst affecting the photocatalytic performance was then discussed.The occurrence of surface reconstruction on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs was happened in the photocatalytic process, especially the first hour of the reaction (Fig. 3a).Then, the variation of surface wetting property was firstly investigated.As shown in Fig. 4e, compared with ZnO/CuO CNFs with a contact angle of 68 , the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalyst showed hydrophobic property with a high contact angle of 122 , indicating the derived carbon network could inhibit the access of H 2 O to bind the encapsulated ZnO/CuO x nanoparticles.After the photocatalytic reaction of 1 h, the contact angle for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs decreased dramatically to 57 and then became more stable when prolonging the irradiation time to 5 h.In comparison, the contact angle of ZnO/CuO CNFs without the protection of carbon gradually decreased to 24 after 5 h.Coincidentally, the low photocatalytic efficiency was found during the first hour (Fig. 3a), indicating the hydrophobic surface could inhibit water-absorbing on the sites of ZnO/CuO x nanoparticles.Without the participation of H 2 O, all the reactions included CO 2 RR, HER and OER were depressed.After light irradiation for 1 h, the CH 4 generation rate was obviously improved (Fig. 3a), implying the H 2 O get easy access to the surface of ZnO/CuO x -C nanoparticles.Despite the above results, the surface reconstruction based on the variation of surface wetting property was insufficient to explain the remaining depressed HER for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs. Considering the surface reconstruction is related to the functional groups of the material surface, the XPS spectrum of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs as the function of photocatalytic time under a mixture of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor was investigated.As for the Zn 2p, the binding energy gradually shifted to 0.6 eV with light irradiation, while no noticeable variation of Cu 2p was observed during the whole irradiation process under a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor (Fig. 4f andg, the bottom of dash line).Typically, the copper oxide is more active, and the corresponding binding energy was prone to change more easily 26,29.Then, the variation of the binding energy for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs irradiated under the pure water vapor atmosphere was compared.The obvious Cu 2p and O 1s variation illustrated that CuO species was formed (Fig. 4g andh, up of dash line).Considering the high CO 2 absorption capability of CuO x (Fig. 2f), we thus conclude the CO 2 absorbed on the CuO x surface and the hydrophobic carbon could inhibit the formation of the hydroxyl group on CuO x surface.On the contrary, the hole transferred to the surface of ZnO could interact with H 2 O.As a result, the surface reconstruction occurred mainly on the ZnO surface occupied by H 2 O instead of CuO x surface.The formed hydroxyl group was confirmed by the variation of surface oxygen state.As shown in Fig. 4h, the oxygen states featured with hydroxyl oxygen at 532.2 eV is becoming more evident via light irradiation under mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor, illustrating more hydroxyl group formed on the surface of ZnO/CuO x .The formed hydroxyl groups on the surface of ZnO promoting the surface hole to activate H 2 O and enhancing electron-hole separation was further confirmed by the ESR signal.As shown in Fig. 4i, the intensity of isotropic peak for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, attributed to the electron trapped around the Zn-O site, increased after 5 h irradiation, indicating that more separated electrons and holes were generated 41.As a result, the surface reconstructed ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs is favorable for promoting OER occurred on the ZnO surface, while inhibiting HER occurred on the CuO x surface. As for the high selectivity of CH 4 to CO, the generated CH 4 mainly depends on competing processes between the desorption of CO and further hydrogenation of CO into the formyl radical 42,43.The Cu sites on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs have strong binding strength for adsorbed intermediates and could facilitate the hydrogenation.Most importantly, the small size of ZnO/CuO x with Z-scheme affords abundant photoexcited electrons for generating CH 4 , which requires 8H /8e -.Meanwhile, the Cu as electron traps renders high local electron densities around them 20, which may prefer the multiple electron transfer process for CH 4 generation.Considering the current work focuses on the comparison of HER and CO 2 RR, the detailed investigation on the selectivity of CH 4 to CO is not provided in this work. Based on the above discussion, we present the whole photocatalysis process on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs system (Fig. 4j).At the initial reacting stage, the OER, HER and CO 2 RR are all depressed because of carbon network as barrier inhibited H 2 O molecule binding with active sites for reaction.As the photocatalytic reaction progressed, the accumulated holes on the ZnO surface-induced the formation of an electrical field 27, which could absorb H 2 O.With consistently attacking by H 2 O and releasing hydroxyl radicals, the ZnO surface formed hydroxyl group promoted OER.Meanwhile, the surface of CuO x was absorbed by CO 2 molecule, while the water was still inhibited by the hydrophobic carbon to attack CuO x site for the formation of the hydroxyl group.Thus, the CuO x surface with high CO 2 binding affinity can promote the CO 2 activation to boost CO 2 RR, and reduce the undesired HER byproduct.Owing to the Z-scheme structure, the fast electrons transferred to the surface of CuO x could activate the absorbed CO 2 and form intermediate such as carboxyl radical HCOO.Moreover, the rich electrons accumulation could be achieved on the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs system to promote the multiple 8H /8e electron transfer process for CH 4 generation."}, {"llm generation": "ZnOCu 2 O, Cu 2 OZnO, Cu 2 O/ZnO, Cu 2 O/ZnO mixture", "source": "To investigate the impacts of particle size and uniformity on CO 2 RR performance, we synthesized and evaluated four reference catalysts: ZnOCu 2 O (50 nm) and Cu 2 OZnO (410 nm) synthesized by the bottom-up method, and Cu 2 O/ZnO (250 nm) and Cu 2 O/ZnO mixture (50 nm) synthesized by the top-down method 26272829.", "context": "To improve active site density, a hierarchically structured ZnO/ CuO x -C CNFs photocatalyst was fabricated by using a metal-organic Scheme 1.(a) The hierarchical structure that ZnO/CuO x heterojunction embedded in porous carbon nanosheet array supported by CNFs.(b) The particle size of ZnO/CuO x is smaller than previously reported heterojunction photocatalysts synthesized by top-down and bottom-up methods, being favorable for improving conversion.(c) The surface reconstruction induced by solar light irradiation leads to rich accumulated electrons for CO 2 RR towards CH 4 , while inhibits the H 2 and CO generation, thus contributing to high selectivity.

The photocatalytic CO 2 RR over various photocatalysts derived from MOFPAN NFs was then evaluated.The conversion of primary product CH 4 as the function of reaction time is shown in Fig. 3c.The ZnO and ZnO-C CNFs showed a low CH 4 generation rate of 0.44 and 1.88 mol h -1 , respectively.It should be noted the CuO x CNFs cannot be used as a reference for the comparison because of the pure Cu-MOF cannot be formed as a template to obtain CuO x .Although the heterostructured ZnO/CuO CNFs could improve the electro-hole separation, the CH 4 generation rate was only achieved to 4.01 mol h -1 .In comparison, the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs display the highest CH 4 generation rate of 24.16 mol h -1 .The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is 0.205 , of which 0.195 is for CH 4 and 0.01 is for CO at 420 nm (Fig. S12).Meanwhile, the selectivity of CH 4 production is 96 for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, which is remarkably higher than those of derivatives ZnO (28.0 ), ZnO-C (57.3 ), and ZnO/CuO (70.2 ) CNFs (Fig. 3d).The result thus indicated that the formed carbon layer and well-integrated ZnO/CuO x heterojunction play a crucial role in improving conversion rate and selectivity. To investigate the impacts of particle size and uniformity on CO 2 RR performance, we synthesized and evaluated four reference catalysts: ZnOCu 2 O (50 nm) and Cu 2 OZnO (410 nm) synthesized by the bottom-up method, and Cu 2 O/ZnO (250 nm) and Cu 2 O/ZnO mixture (50 nm) synthesized by the top-down method 26272829.It was expected that a very low CH 4 generation rate over Cu 2 O/ZnO mixture (50 nm) was observed because of the particle agglomeration (Fig. 3e).Moreover, both conversion rate and selectivity of the other three reference catalysts, i.e., ZnOCu 2 O (50 nm), Cu 2 OZnO (410 nm) and Cu 2 O/ZnO (250 nm), are not enhanced remarkably, although the electro-hole separation rates were improved to some degree because of the heterostructure.For Cu 2 O/ZnO (250 nm), the relatively low performance is due to the weak combination between Cu 2 O and ZnO that slows charge transfer and the agglomeration that lowers the active site density.ZnOCu 2 O (50 nm) and Cu 2 OZnO (410 nm) synthesized by the bottom-down method offer uniform morphology, but the particle size is relatively large after the multi-step synthesis process.As a result, the interface integration area between ZnO and CuO 2 is low.The separated electron and hole are prone to combine in the bulk phase of ZnO or CuO 2 , leading to a weak synergistic effect.Moreover, the result (Fig. 3f) showed low CH 4 selectivity for all reference catalysts.The comparison results thus illustrated that the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, obtained by using MOF NFs template, could efficiently depress the H 2 generation and provide rich electrons to be transferred for CH 4 generation with high selectivity. Additional experiments were carried out to illustrate the high CO 2 conversion rate of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalyst.Firstly, the amperometric I-t curves measurement under chopped-light illumination was carried out (Fig. 4a).The high current density of ZnO-C compared with ZnO indicated that the derived carbon could improve transient photocurrent response.The current density of ZnO/CuO CNFs is lower than that of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, because the bandgap of Cu 2 O (2.4 eV) with a conduction band edge energy (-1.4 V vs. NHE) is higher than that of CuO (-0.8 V vs. NHE) 27.As a result, the ZnO/CuO x -C displayed wide light-harvesting absorption range and high mobility of the charge carriers, thus contributed to high activity for CO 2 RR among various MOF NFs derivatives.To illustrate that the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs with heterostructure is favorable for boosting the charge separation and transfer to activate CO 2 , we used the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy to characterize various heterojunction system.As shown in Fig. 4b, ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs exhibited the longest PL lifetime.The results indicated that the small size of heterojunction not only maximize the integration area to promote charge transfer between ZnO and CuO x , but also allow charge carriers to migrate rapidly from the interior to the surface, thus suppressing the electron-hole recombination. The photocatalytic mechanism of hetero-structured ZnO-Cu 2 O system has been widely investigated, which are normally belongs to either double-charge transfer or Z-scheme mechanism 26272837,38.To verify our hypothesis, we tested the photocatalytic performance of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs under visible light irradiation to exclude the influence of UV active ZnO component.A trace amount of O 2 , CH 4 , and H 2 production was detected during the reaction, indicating the double-charge transfer mechanism is not suitable for the ZnO/CuO x -C system because the h on the VB of Cu 2 O is incapable of oxidizing water.Besides, negligible CH 4 production of ZnO-C, as shown in Fig. 4c, implied CuO x is the main active site for the activation of CO 2 .The results demonstrated that only the hole on the VB of ZnO is suitable for the oxidation due to its positive valence band (VB) (E (VB) 2.39 V) 27.The charge on the CB of CuO x is more suitable for the reduction.If the double-charge transfer mechanism fitted the ZnO/CuO x -C system, the ZnO should have been the reactive site for the reduction reaction.Based on our analysis, we conclude that ZnO/CuO x -C system belongs to Z-scheme mechanism.Under light irradiation, electrons on the CB of ZnO can transfer to and combine with holes on the VB of CuO x .As a result, the electrons on CB of Cu 2 O can be efficiently separated and transferred to the more conductive Cu for the reduction reaction.Under such conditions, the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs system is capable of exhibiting high catalytic activity. Furthermore, the characterization of hydroxyl radicals (DMPO- OH) using 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a free-radical spintrapping agent detected by the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum could support the Z-scheme mechanism (Fig. 4d) 39,40.There were no prominent characteristic peaks under visible light irradiation.The relative higher peaks under UV light irradiation of DMPO- OH indicated that the holes from the VB of UV light-responsive ZnO mainly oxidized water to generate hydroxyl radicals , instead of visible light-responsive CuO x .In addition, the strongest signal peaks were observed for ZnO/-CuO x -C CNFs under full light irradiation, indicating there are more separated holes transferring to the ZnO surface instead of Cu 2 O surface.Therefore, the photoexcited electrons in the CB of ZnO would transfer to the VB of Cu 2 O and recombine with the holes therein.Subsequently, the rich accumulated electrons from the CB of Cu 2 O was trapped by the Cu site for the CO 2 RR (Fig. 4c). The surface reconstruction on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs catalyst affecting the photocatalytic performance was then discussed.The occurrence of surface reconstruction on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs was happened in the photocatalytic process, especially the first hour of the reaction (Fig. 3a).Then, the variation of surface wetting property was firstly investigated.As shown in Fig. 4e, compared with ZnO/CuO CNFs with a contact angle of 68 , the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalyst showed hydrophobic property with a high contact angle of 122 , indicating the derived carbon network could inhibit the access of H 2 O to bind the encapsulated ZnO/CuO x nanoparticles.After the photocatalytic reaction of 1 h, the contact angle for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs decreased dramatically to 57 and then became more stable when prolonging the irradiation time to 5 h.In comparison, the contact angle of ZnO/CuO CNFs without the protection of carbon gradually decreased to 24 after 5 h.Coincidentally, the low photocatalytic efficiency was found during the first hour (Fig. 3a), indicating the hydrophobic surface could inhibit water-absorbing on the sites of ZnO/CuO x nanoparticles.Without the participation of H 2 O, all the reactions included CO 2 RR, HER and OER were depressed.After light irradiation for 1 h, the CH 4 generation rate was obviously improved (Fig. 3a), implying the H 2 O get easy access to the surface of ZnO/CuO x -C nanoparticles.Despite the above results, the surface reconstruction based on the variation of surface wetting property was insufficient to explain the remaining depressed HER for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs. Considering the surface reconstruction is related to the functional groups of the material surface, the XPS spectrum of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs as the function of photocatalytic time under a mixture of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor was investigated.As for the Zn 2p, the binding energy gradually shifted to 0.6 eV with light irradiation, while no noticeable variation of Cu 2p was observed during the whole irradiation process under a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor (Fig. 4f andg, the bottom of dash line).Typically, the copper oxide is more active, and the corresponding binding energy was prone to change more easily 26,29.Then, the variation of the binding energy for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs irradiated under the pure water vapor atmosphere was compared.The obvious Cu 2p and O 1s variation illustrated that CuO species was formed (Fig. 4g andh, up of dash line).Considering the high CO 2 absorption capability of CuO x (Fig. 2f), we thus conclude the CO 2 absorbed on the CuO x surface and the hydrophobic carbon could inhibit the formation of the hydroxyl group on CuO x surface.On the contrary, the hole transferred to the surface of ZnO could interact with H 2 O.As a result, the surface reconstruction occurred mainly on the ZnO surface occupied by H 2 O instead of CuO x surface.The formed hydroxyl group was confirmed by the variation of surface oxygen state.As shown in Fig. 4h, the oxygen states featured with hydroxyl oxygen at 532.2 eV is becoming more evident via light irradiation under mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor, illustrating more hydroxyl group formed on the surface of ZnO/CuO x .The formed hydroxyl groups on the surface of ZnO promoting the surface hole to activate H 2 O and enhancing electron-hole separation was further confirmed by the ESR signal.As shown in Fig. 4i, the intensity of isotropic peak for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, attributed to the electron trapped around the Zn-O site, increased after 5 h irradiation, indicating that more separated electrons and holes were generated 41.As a result, the surface reconstructed ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs is favorable for promoting OER occurred on the ZnO surface, while inhibiting HER occurred on the CuO x surface. As for the high selectivity of CH 4 to CO, the generated CH 4 mainly depends on competing processes between the desorption of CO and further hydrogenation of CO into the formyl radical 42,43.The Cu sites on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs have strong binding strength for adsorbed intermediates and could facilitate the hydrogenation.Most importantly, the small size of ZnO/CuO x with Z-scheme affords abundant photoexcited electrons for generating CH 4 , which requires 8H /8e -.Meanwhile, the Cu as electron traps renders high local electron densities around them 20, which may prefer the multiple electron transfer process for CH 4 generation.Considering the current work focuses on the comparison of HER and CO 2 RR, the detailed investigation on the selectivity of CH 4 to CO is not provided in this work. Based on the above discussion, we present the whole photocatalysis process on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs system (Fig. 4j).At the initial reacting stage, the OER, HER and CO 2 RR are all depressed because of carbon network as barrier inhibited H 2 O molecule binding with active sites for reaction.As the photocatalytic reaction progressed, the accumulated holes on the ZnO surface-induced the formation of an electrical field 27, which could absorb H 2 O.With consistently attacking by H 2 O and releasing hydroxyl radicals, the ZnO surface formed hydroxyl group promoted OER.Meanwhile, the surface of CuO x was absorbed by CO 2 molecule, while the water was still inhibited by the hydrophobic carbon to attack CuO x site for the formation of the hydroxyl group.Thus, the CuO x surface with high CO 2 binding affinity can promote the CO 2 activation to boost CO 2 RR, and reduce the undesired HER byproduct.Owing to the Z-scheme structure, the fast electrons transferred to the surface of CuO x could activate the absorbed CO 2 and form intermediate such as carboxyl radical HCOO.Moreover, the rich electrons accumulation could be achieved on the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs system to promote the multiple 8H /8e electron transfer process for CH 4 generation."}, {"llm generation": "ZnO/ CuO x -C CNFs", "source": "The developed strategy endows the derived ZnO/ CuO x -C CNFs with a maximum interface of components and strong integration, compared with previously reported methods.", "context": "In summary, we demonstrate particle size controlling and surface reconstructing heterojunction photocatalyst to improve photocatalytic CO 2 RR performance.The developed strategy endows the derived ZnO/ CuO x -C CNFs with a maximum interface of components and strong integration, compared with previously reported methods.The corresponding abundant active species and electronic coupling enables its significantly enhanced electron-hole separation and transfer for CO 2 RR.Most importantly, the surface reconstruction and suitable band matching structure promote the CO 2 RR towards CH 4 and OER, while depressed competing HER.This work offers an efficient strategy into modifying nanostructure and surface properties of heterojunction photocatalyst, which provides an insight into optimizing the photocatalytic activity and the selectivity towards the desired products.

Y. Dou et al. framework NFs template-directed method (Fig. 1a).Firstly, the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) NFs (Fig. S1) was fabricated as a substrate for the insitu growth of ZnCu-MOF nanosheet with different Zn : Cu molar ratio (9:1, 7:3, and 5:4) with similar morphology (Fig. S2).It should be noted that further decrease the ratio of Zn: Cu to 5:5 will lead to the poor integration of ZnCu-MOF and PAN NFs (Fig. S3).Then, the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs were obtained by the pyrolysis of the ZnCu-MOFPAN NFs under Ar/H 2 atmosphere.Before the confirmation of the components of catalyst (Fig. 2), the morphology characterization (Fig. 1b-j) was firstly carried out to prove the fabrication process (Fig. 1a).As shown in Fig. 1b,c, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a well preserved hierarchical structure of ZnCu-MOFPAN derivative.The derived ZnO/CuO x -C nanosheet on carbon nanofibers exhibited a rough and wrinkled surface.The corresponding Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy showed the weight fraction ratio for C : O : Cu : Zn is 20.4 : 14.2 : 19.8: 45.6 (Fig. S4).Compared with the Zn-MOFPAN derived ZnO-C CNFs with a relatively smooth surface (Fig. S5), some small humps observed on the ZnO/CuO x -C nanosheet could be attributed to the introduced Cu ion in the precursor ZnCu-MOF (Fig. 1d).The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image combined with energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping (Fig. 1e,f) indicated highly distribution of Zn, Cu and O on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, which is different from that of the ZnO-C CNFs shown in Fig. S6.Moreover, the ZnO/CuO x heterojunction displayed small particle size (Fig. 1g-j).The CuO x sites are highly distributed on the ZnO nanoparticle with size of 10 nm (Fig. 1i).The ZnO was confirmed by the fringes with lattice space of 0.247 nm that indexed to the (101) plane of ZnO phase by high resolution (HR) TEM characterization (Fig. 1h).Furthermore, the HR-TEM of CuO x (Fig. 1j) demonstrated abundant Cu domains bound to Cu 2 O, which were confirmed by the fringes with lattice spaces of 0.245 and 0.211 nm that indexed to the (111) and (200) plane of Cu 2 O phase and lattice space of 0.205 nm that indexed to the (111) plane of Cu phase (Fig. 1j).26,28,31,32 In order to systemically illustrate the structure characterization of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalyst, ZnO-C and ZnO CNFs derived from the In order to reveal the detailed structure properties of ZnO/CuO x -C, the derivatives from MOF powder, instead of MOFPAN NFs were investigated to exclude the influence of PAN derived CNFs.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was first performed to illustrate the interaction of components in ZnO/CuO x -C.Compared with those of ZnO-C, a negetive shift that 0.6 and 0.8 eV for Zn 2p 3/2 (1021.3eV) and Zn 2p 1/2 (1044.3eV) peaks for ZnO/CuO x -C were observed (Fig. 2b).The result thus indicated the electron transfer from ZnO to CuO x , owing to the electronic coupling at the interface 33,34.Besides, the spectrum in the Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 region showed two sharp and symmetric peaks at 933.1 and 952.7 eV, respectively, indicating the existence of Cu(0) and Cu() in ZnO/CuO x -C (Fig. 2c) 28,35.In the contrast, the two satellite peaks of ZnO/CuO observed at 964.2 and 942.7 eV confirmed the Cu() in ZnO/CuO, being consistent with above XRD results (Figs. 2a andS7) 36.It should be noted that the electronic interaction of ZnO/CuO x -C is favorable for electron transfer at the interface.In addition, the optical absorption characterization of ZnO/CuO x -C revealed an evident increasing absorption intensity in the ultraviolet (UV)-visible (Vis) light.It should be noted that ZnO/CuO x -C showed similar profile with the Cu 2 O as control sample 29.We speculated the CuO x has similar band structure with Cu 2 O, because ZnO is only responsive to UV light compared with that of bare ZnO and Cu 2 O (Fig. 2d).The enhanced absorption intensity was probably attributed to the black carbon that could absorb solar light, which has a negligible effect on light penetration into the ZnO/CuO x because of its porous structure. The Raman spectrum was then performed to confirm the existence of carbon in ZnO/CuO x -C nanosheet.As shown in Fig. 2e, the two bands at 1342 (D-band) and 1594 cm -1 (G-band) are ascribed to the disordered/ defect carbon and graphitic sp2 carbon for ZnO/CuO x -C 34.It should be noted the carbon absorption character was observed on the derived ZnO/CuO as well, which was even obtained by air pyrolysis.The result indicated the organic ligands were not fully converted into a gas product even in the air atmosphere, remained as partial carbon owing to a mild pyrolysis temperature.Even so, further increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 550 C would lead to the break of the hierarchical structure (Fig. S8).No absorbing bands for inorganic components of ZnO/CuO x -C compared with ZnO/CuO indicated relative high mass fraction of derived carbon coated on ZnO/CuO x , which influences the detection of metal oxide.In the comparison that of ZnO/CuO, the Ar/H 2 atmosphere resulted in a higher degree of graphitization of carbon (I G /I D ) for ZnO/CuO x -C.Owing to the existence of carbon, the result in Fig. 2f showed ZnO/CuO x -C and ZnO-C contributed to largely improved CO 2 uptake capability among various control samples.Moreover, the higher CO 2 uptake of ZnO/CuO x -C compared with that of ZnO-C indicated that CuO x also served as active sites for CO 2 absorption. The photocatalytic CO 2 RR under full-light irradiation ( 200 nm) over ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs was firstly evaluated without the addition of any sacrificial reagents.CH 4 , CO and H 2 were the main detected products.First, we carried out a study on the CO 2 conversion performance of different ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalysts that are synthesized from various ratios of ZnO : CuO x .The ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs with the ZnO : CuO x ratio of 7:3 shows the best performance with the CH 4 generation rate of 12.08 mol h -1 and the CO and H 2 generation rate of only 0.07 and 0.04 mol h -1 , respectively (Figs. 3a andS9).It should be noted that a lower amount of products was detected during the first hour of the first run, indicating that CO 2 RR, OER and HER were depressed.After 1 h, the performance of CO 2 RR and OER improved (Figs. 3a andS10).The reason is that the occurrence of surface reconstruction (formation of the hydroxyl groups on ZnO) after 1 h improved the catalytic activity.We will explain this phenomenon detail in the next discussion section.Afterwards, the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalyst showed a slight decrease in CH 4 generation rate after five cycles.The performance is because of its stable structure and morphology, which is proved by the characterization of the catalyst before (Figs. 1 and2) and after (Fig. S11) photocatalytic reaction.Then, the 13 C-labelled isotropic experiment was conducted (Fig. 3b).The result confirmed that the CO and CH 4 are derived from CO 2 , not from the decomposition of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalyst.In addition, the photocatalytic reduction carried out under the N 2 instead of CO 2 showed a trace amount of CO and CH 4 product, further confirming the carbon in CH 4 is generated from CO 2 . The photocatalytic CO 2 RR over various photocatalysts derived from MOFPAN NFs was then evaluated.The conversion of primary product CH 4 as the function of reaction time is shown in Fig. 3c.The ZnO and ZnO-C CNFs showed a low CH 4 generation rate of 0.44 and 1.88 mol h -1 , respectively.It should be noted the CuO x CNFs cannot be used as a reference for the comparison because of the pure Cu-MOF cannot be formed as a template to obtain CuO x .Although the heterostructured ZnO/CuO CNFs could improve the electro-hole separation, the CH 4 generation rate was only achieved to 4.01 mol h -1 .In comparison, the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs display the highest CH 4 generation rate of 24.16 mol h -1 .The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is 0.205 , of which 0.195 is for CH 4 and 0.01 is for CO at 420 nm (Fig. S12).Meanwhile, the selectivity of CH 4 production is 96 for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, which is remarkably higher than those of derivatives ZnO (28.0 ), ZnO-C (57.3 ), and ZnO/CuO (70.2 ) CNFs (Fig. 3d).The result thus indicated that the formed carbon layer and well-integrated ZnO/CuO x heterojunction play a crucial role in improving conversion rate and selectivity. To investigate the impacts of particle size and uniformity on CO 2 RR performance, we synthesized and evaluated four reference catalysts: ZnOCu 2 O (50 nm) and Cu 2 OZnO (410 nm) synthesized by the bottom-up method, and Cu 2 O/ZnO (250 nm) and Cu 2 O/ZnO mixture (50 nm) synthesized by the top-down method 26272829.It was expected that a very low CH 4 generation rate over Cu 2 O/ZnO mixture (50 nm) was observed because of the particle agglomeration (Fig. 3e).Moreover, both conversion rate and selectivity of the other three reference catalysts, i.e., ZnOCu 2 O (50 nm), Cu 2 OZnO (410 nm) and Cu 2 O/ZnO (250 nm), are not enhanced remarkably, although the electro-hole separation rates were improved to some degree because of the heterostructure.For Cu 2 O/ZnO (250 nm), the relatively low performance is due to the weak combination between Cu 2 O and ZnO that slows charge transfer and the agglomeration that lowers the active site density.ZnOCu 2 O (50 nm) and Cu 2 OZnO (410 nm) synthesized by the bottom-down method offer uniform morphology, but the particle size is relatively large after the multi-step synthesis process.As a result, the interface integration area between ZnO and CuO 2 is low.The separated electron and hole are prone to combine in the bulk phase of ZnO or CuO 2 , leading to a weak synergistic effect.Moreover, the result (Fig. 3f) showed low CH 4 selectivity for all reference catalysts.The comparison results thus illustrated that the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, obtained by using MOF NFs template, could efficiently depress the H 2 generation and provide rich electrons to be transferred for CH 4 generation with high selectivity. Additional experiments were carried out to illustrate the high CO 2 conversion rate of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalyst.Firstly, the amperometric I-t curves measurement under chopped-light illumination was carried out (Fig. 4a).The high current density of ZnO-C compared with ZnO indicated that the derived carbon could improve transient photocurrent response.The current density of ZnO/CuO CNFs is lower than that of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, because the bandgap of Cu 2 O (2.4 eV) with a conduction band edge energy (-1.4 V vs. NHE) is higher than that of CuO (-0.8 V vs. NHE) 27.As a result, the ZnO/CuO x -C displayed wide light-harvesting absorption range and high mobility of the charge carriers, thus contributed to high activity for CO 2 RR among various MOF NFs derivatives.To illustrate that the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs with heterostructure is favorable for boosting the charge separation and transfer to activate CO 2 , we used the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy to characterize various heterojunction system.As shown in Fig. 4b, ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs exhibited the longest PL lifetime.The results indicated that the small size of heterojunction not only maximize the integration area to promote charge transfer between ZnO and CuO x , but also allow charge carriers to migrate rapidly from the interior to the surface, thus suppressing the electron-hole recombination. The photocatalytic mechanism of hetero-structured ZnO-Cu 2 O system has been widely investigated, which are normally belongs to either double-charge transfer or Z-scheme mechanism 26272837,38.To verify our hypothesis, we tested the photocatalytic performance of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs under visible light irradiation to exclude the influence of UV active ZnO component.A trace amount of O 2 , CH 4 , and H 2 production was detected during the reaction, indicating the double-charge transfer mechanism is not suitable for the ZnO/CuO x -C system because the h on the VB of Cu 2 O is incapable of oxidizing water.Besides, negligible CH 4 production of ZnO-C, as shown in Fig. 4c, implied CuO x is the main active site for the activation of CO 2 .The results demonstrated that only the hole on the VB of ZnO is suitable for the oxidation due to its positive valence band (VB) (E (VB) 2.39 V) 27.The charge on the CB of CuO x is more suitable for the reduction.If the double-charge transfer mechanism fitted the ZnO/CuO x -C system, the ZnO should have been the reactive site for the reduction reaction.Based on our analysis, we conclude that ZnO/CuO x -C system belongs to Z-scheme mechanism.Under light irradiation, electrons on the CB of ZnO can transfer to and combine with holes on the VB of CuO x .As a result, the electrons on CB of Cu 2 O can be efficiently separated and transferred to the more conductive Cu for the reduction reaction.Under such conditions, the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs system is capable of exhibiting high catalytic activity. Furthermore, the characterization of hydroxyl radicals (DMPO- OH) using 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a free-radical spintrapping agent detected by the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum could support the Z-scheme mechanism (Fig. 4d) 39,40.There were no prominent characteristic peaks under visible light irradiation.The relative higher peaks under UV light irradiation of DMPO- OH indicated that the holes from the VB of UV light-responsive ZnO mainly oxidized water to generate hydroxyl radicals , instead of visible light-responsive CuO x .In addition, the strongest signal peaks were observed for ZnO/-CuO x -C CNFs under full light irradiation, indicating there are more separated holes transferring to the ZnO surface instead of Cu 2 O surface.Therefore, the photoexcited electrons in the CB of ZnO would transfer to the VB of Cu 2 O and recombine with the holes therein.Subsequently, the rich accumulated electrons from the CB of Cu 2 O was trapped by the Cu site for the CO 2 RR (Fig. 4c). The surface reconstruction on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs catalyst affecting the photocatalytic performance was then discussed.The occurrence of surface reconstruction on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs was happened in the photocatalytic process, especially the first hour of the reaction (Fig. 3a).Then, the variation of surface wetting property was firstly investigated.As shown in Fig. 4e, compared with ZnO/CuO CNFs with a contact angle of 68 , the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs photocatalyst showed hydrophobic property with a high contact angle of 122 , indicating the derived carbon network could inhibit the access of H 2 O to bind the encapsulated ZnO/CuO x nanoparticles.After the photocatalytic reaction of 1 h, the contact angle for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs decreased dramatically to 57 and then became more stable when prolonging the irradiation time to 5 h.In comparison, the contact angle of ZnO/CuO CNFs without the protection of carbon gradually decreased to 24 after 5 h.Coincidentally, the low photocatalytic efficiency was found during the first hour (Fig. 3a), indicating the hydrophobic surface could inhibit water-absorbing on the sites of ZnO/CuO x nanoparticles.Without the participation of H 2 O, all the reactions included CO 2 RR, HER and OER were depressed.After light irradiation for 1 h, the CH 4 generation rate was obviously improved (Fig. 3a), implying the H 2 O get easy access to the surface of ZnO/CuO x -C nanoparticles.Despite the above results, the surface reconstruction based on the variation of surface wetting property was insufficient to explain the remaining depressed HER for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs. Considering the surface reconstruction is related to the functional groups of the material surface, the XPS spectrum of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs as the function of photocatalytic time under a mixture of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor was investigated.As for the Zn 2p, the binding energy gradually shifted to 0.6 eV with light irradiation, while no noticeable variation of Cu 2p was observed during the whole irradiation process under a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor (Fig. 4f andg, the bottom of dash line).Typically, the copper oxide is more active, and the corresponding binding energy was prone to change more easily 26,29.Then, the variation of the binding energy for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs irradiated under the pure water vapor atmosphere was compared.The obvious Cu 2p and O 1s variation illustrated that CuO species was formed (Fig. 4g andh, up of dash line).Considering the high CO 2 absorption capability of CuO x (Fig. 2f), we thus conclude the CO 2 absorbed on the CuO x surface and the hydrophobic carbon could inhibit the formation of the hydroxyl group on CuO x surface.On the contrary, the hole transferred to the surface of ZnO could interact with H 2 O.As a result, the surface reconstruction occurred mainly on the ZnO surface occupied by H 2 O instead of CuO x surface.The formed hydroxyl group was confirmed by the variation of surface oxygen state.As shown in Fig. 4h, the oxygen states featured with hydroxyl oxygen at 532.2 eV is becoming more evident via light irradiation under mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor, illustrating more hydroxyl group formed on the surface of ZnO/CuO x .The formed hydroxyl groups on the surface of ZnO promoting the surface hole to activate H 2 O and enhancing electron-hole separation was further confirmed by the ESR signal.As shown in Fig. 4i, the intensity of isotropic peak for ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs, attributed to the electron trapped around the Zn-O site, increased after 5 h irradiation, indicating that more separated electrons and holes were generated 41.As a result, the surface reconstructed ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs is favorable for promoting OER occurred on the ZnO surface, while inhibiting HER occurred on the CuO x surface. As for the high selectivity of CH 4 to CO, the generated CH 4 mainly depends on competing processes between the desorption of CO and further hydrogenation of CO into the formyl radical 42,43.The Cu sites on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs have strong binding strength for adsorbed intermediates and could facilitate the hydrogenation.Most importantly, the small size of ZnO/CuO x with Z-scheme affords abundant photoexcited electrons for generating CH 4 , which requires 8H /8e -.Meanwhile, the Cu as electron traps renders high local electron densities around them 20, which may prefer the multiple electron transfer process for CH 4 generation.Considering the current work focuses on the comparison of HER and CO 2 RR, the detailed investigation on the selectivity of CH 4 to CO is not provided in this work. Based on the above discussion, we present the whole photocatalysis process on ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs system (Fig. 4j).At the initial reacting stage, the OER, HER and CO 2 RR are all depressed because of carbon network as barrier inhibited H 2 O molecule binding with active sites for reaction.As the photocatalytic reaction progressed, the accumulated holes on the ZnO surface-induced the formation of an electrical field 27, which could absorb H 2 O.With consistently attacking by H 2 O and releasing hydroxyl radicals, the ZnO surface formed hydroxyl group promoted OER.Meanwhile, the surface of CuO x was absorbed by CO 2 molecule, while the water was still inhibited by the hydrophobic carbon to attack CuO x site for the formation of the hydroxyl group.Thus, the CuO x surface with high CO 2 binding affinity can promote the CO 2 activation to boost CO 2 RR, and reduce the undesired HER byproduct.Owing to the Z-scheme structure, the fast electrons transferred to the surface of CuO x could activate the absorbed CO 2 and form intermediate such as carboxyl radical HCOO.Moreover, the rich electrons accumulation could be achieved on the ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs system to promote the multiple 8H /8e electron transfer process for CH 4 generation."}, {"llm generation": "visible", "source": "ESR spectra of ZnO/CuO x -C CNFs under the visible, UV and full light irradiation.", "context": "In summary, we demonstrate particle size controlling and surface reconstructing heterojunction photocatalyst to improve photocatalytic CO 2 RR performance.The developed strategy endows the derived ZnO/ CuO x -C CNFs with a maximum interface of components and strong integration, compared with previously reported methods.The corresponding abundant active species and electronic coupling enables its significantly enhanced electron-hole separation and transfer for CO 2 RR.Most importantly, the surface reconstruction and suitable band matching structure promote the CO 2 RR towards CH 4 and OER, while depressed competing HER.This work offers an efficient strategy into modifying nanostructure and surface properties of heterojunction photocatalyst, which provides an insight into optimizing the photocatalytic activity and the selectivity towards the desired products.
