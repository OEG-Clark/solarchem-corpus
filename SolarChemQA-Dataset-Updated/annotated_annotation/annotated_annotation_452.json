Compared to molecular catalysts, semiconductor photocatalysts are relatively stable and inexpensive.However, multi-electron processes, including CO 2reduction catalysis, on TiO 2 surfaces are extremely inefficient due to recombination of photoexcited charge carriers (electrons and holes) 333435363738.Instead, efficient solar energy conversion has been achieved by surface functionalization of TiO 2 nanomaterials with coordination complexes such as Ru(II)-based dye molecules.In dye-sensitized solar cells 3940414243 and photosynthesis cells 444546474849, TiO 2 serves to accept photoexcited electrons from the surface coordination complexes upon interfacial electron transfer.The success of surface dye sensitization has inspired design of hybrid photocatalysts consisting of TiO 2 and surface molecular catalysts 24,25,50,51.In this study, we utilize TiO 2 as a solidstate photosensitizer for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl, which is as a molecular CO 2 -reduction catalyst based on an earth-abundant metal.This Co(III) complex demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity in reducing CO 2 to CO in the presence of molecular photosensitizers, including p-terphenyl, under UV irradiation 52,53. The three hybrid photocatalysts, Co III (cyclam)X/P25, Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile, were evaluated in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor.Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase exhibited very good activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, while negligible CO production was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 3).Hydrogen gas (CO/H 2 1) as a byproduct was produced using the hybrid photocatalysts. In our study, products in the gas phase were analyzed with a GC.Product detection in the solution phase by NMR indicated no significant production of formate after photocatalysis.In order to rule out the possibility of CO generation from carbon residues on the synthesized samples, products in the gas phase were also analyzed with FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotope labeling.Fig. 4 displays the FTIR spectrum of the head-space gases above a reaction solution after photocatalytic reduction of 13 CO 2 by Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under UV irradiation.In the spectrum, the rotational-vibrational band of gaseous 13 CO centered at 2096 cm -1 clearly confirms the production of CO from CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalyst. Under the experimental conditions employed in this study (TEOA, CO 2 atmosphere, and UV irradiation), no CO was produced by any of the following: (i) P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles, (i) Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl and P25, or (iii) Co III (cyclam)X/SiO 2 prepared by depositing the Co(III) complex on a fumed silica follow- ing the microwave synthesis.In addition, no CO formation was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm) which cannot activate P25 TiO 2 .Therefore, in this hybrid Co III (cyclam)X/TiO 2 system the surface Co(III) complex is the catalyst for CO 2 reduction while TiO 2 nanoparticles function as the light-harvesting support (Fig. 1). Further surface chemistry studies also indicate that CO 2 reduction occurs on the surface Co(III) sites.In the surface chemistry studies, a hybrid photocatalyst in the powder form was placed in a diffuse reflectance accessory and exposed to an atmosphere of CO 2 .Photocatalysis at the gas-surface interface was carried out in the absence of any solvent or TEOA.The photocatalyst surface was monitored with in situ infrared detection 54,55.At various stages during photocatalysis, difference FTIR spectra were obtained by subtracting spectra acquired prior to photocatalysis from corresponding spectra collected after UV irradiation.Therefore, the difference spectra provide information regarding changes on the photocatalyst surface upon light irradiation.The formation of CO was observed on surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, as indicated by the infrared bands at 2193 cm -1 in the spectra shown in Fig. 5 (a andb) 56.The formation of surface carbonate species (1720 cm -1 ) was also observed on these two samples.Negligible changes were observed on Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile during photocatalysis (Fig. 5c).The comparison shown in Fig. 5 is in excellent agreement with photocatalysis in the solution phase (Fig. 3).Under the same experimental conditions, surface CO species was not observed on bare P25 TiO 2 21, further confirming the key role of surface Co(III) sites in mediating CO 2 -reduction catalysis. These photocatalysis results clearly indicate photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band to the surface Co(III) catalyst for CO 2 reduction in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor.In our previous studies, reduction potentials of the Co III /Co II and Co II /Co I redox couples for Co III (cyclam)X were measured to be -0.21V and -0.93 V vs NHE, respectively 21.Therefore, photoexcited electrons in the TiO 2 conduction band (potential -0.6 V vs NHE at pH 7) 57 are not energetic enough to reduce Co(II) to Co(I) needed to catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion (-0.53 V vs. NHE).The exact driving force for the photoexcited electron transfer is unclear.However, we note that the reduction potential of Co II /Co I is largely dependent of coordination ligands.For example, the reduction potential of Co II /Co I for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl was -1.39 V vs NHE, in comparison to -0.93 V vs NHE for Co III (cyclam)X 21.The Ti O Co linkage in our hybrid photocatalysts (Fig. 1) and the presence of excess TEOA in reaction solutions could further alter the redox properties of the Co III (cyclam) unit on TiO 2 surfaces under photochemical conditions.The importance of such surface Ti O Co linkage is further described in the following spectroscopic and microscopic studies. As shown in Fig. 3, the hybrid photocatalyst prepared on the Rutile nanopowder demonstrated much lower activity than Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.In many photocatalytic applications using bare TiO 2 materials, the rutile phase is generally considered less active than the anatase phase due to more significant charge recombination in rutile 29.However, the particular Rutile nanopowder employed in our study is more active than the Anatase nanopowder in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (Fig. S3), despite its lower surface area.Therefore, the difference in charge carrier dynamics is not responsible for the observed difference in photocatalytic activity shown in Fig. 3. In the UV-vis spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, two broad absorptions are seen at 450 nm and 600 nm, indicating the presence of macrocyclic Co(III) complex (Fig. 6a andb) 21.However, these features are not distinguishable in the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 6c).Therefore, the state of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material is different from that on P25 and Anatase.Such difference might account for the observed photocatalytic activity displayed in Fig. 3. Furthermore, there is no significant amount of cobalt oxides, which would exhibit distinguishable peaks at 530, 595, and 655 nm 27, in the synthesized photocatalysts. In combination with UV-vis spectroscopic studies, microscopic investigation of the hybrid photocatalysts indicates that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Only TiO 2 nanoparticles are observed in the TEM images of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase (Fig. 7a andb).Close inspection of the TEM images indicates that no separate phase is present in either of these two samples.In comparison, amorphous, nano-sized particles are seen in the TEM image of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 7c).These particles are either attached to the Rutile nanoparticles (Fig. 7d) or form large aggregates (Fig. 8).Further comparison with the TEM image of bare Rutile confirms that these amorphous particles are Co III (cyclam)X in the solid state that formed during the synthesis of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile. Previously we have found that surface Ti OH groups are important for successful deposition of active Co(III) catalysts on TiO 2 nanoparticles via a reflux method 21.Similar results were obtained for the three hybrid photocatalysts prepared by the microwave method in this study.Infrared studies of the hybrid photocatalysts show that the Rutile surface lacks terminal Ti OH groups associated with a band at 3632 cm -1 (Fig. S4) for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X.According to the UV-vis and TEM results (Figs. 678), Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces but forms aggregates on Rutile.In the study by Petsi and co-workers 58, both bridging and terminal OH groups were found to be important for the deposition of Co(H 2 O) 6 2 on TiO 2 nanoparticles.In our study, the presence of terminal OH group associated with the infrared absorption at 3632 cm -1 is essential for the molecular deposition of catalytically active Co III (cyclam)X on P25 and Anatase surfaces via Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). Based on the specific surface areas of the TiO 2 nanomaterials and elemental analysis results, surface catalyst densities are estimated to be 6-7 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and 26 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile.These numbers further support our conclusion that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited on P25 and Anatase surfaces.The absence of terminal OH groups for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material resulted in the formation of Co III (cyclam)X in the aggregated form as observed in Figs.7 and8.The lack of sufficient Ti O Co linkages in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile can be used to explain inefficient photoexcited electron transfer from Rutile to surface Co III (cyclam)X, which led to its poor activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Fig. 3). An infrared band at 3670 cm -1 , associated with bridging Ti OH groups, is also present in the spectra of the three TiO 2 samples (Fig. S4).This infrared band disappeared in the spectra of the three hybrid photocatalysts, indicating that deposition of Co III (cyclam)X also occurred through reacting with the bridging Ti OH groups.However, comparison shown in Figs.4567suggests that catalyst deposition through these bridging Ti OH groups didn't allow photoexcited electron transfer from TiO 2 to surface Co III (cyclam)X. Characterization with EPR spectroscopy further supports the fact that surface cobalt sites exist in different states on Rutile than on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Although the Co(III) compound itself is EPR silent, some paramagnetic Co(II) species and radicals are present in the synthesized hybrid photocatalysts, as indicated by the following EPR results.This is similar to the study by Kohno and co-workers 59, in which paramagnetic Co(II) species were found to be trapped in single crystals of a Co(III) compound.The presence of paramagnetic Co(II) species is likely a consequence of the use of triethylamine in the synthesis of our hybrid photocatalysts. The EPR spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase are almost identical, except for a dark signal in the latter due to trace metal impurity in the Anatase nanopowder (Fig. S5).Therefore, the spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are chosen for comparison in this section.In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under N 2 (Fig. 9a, gray trace), resonances corresponding to mononuclear high-spin Co(II) (S 3/2) centers are observed at g x 5.89, g y 3.40, and g z 2.22 (not labeled).The same spectrum also contains resonances near g 2 (not labeled) that are associated with trapped electrons and holes 33,34 in P25 upon exposure to ambient light (Fig. S6).In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b, gray trace), however, a very different EPR spectrum is observed in the high-spin However the hyperfine splitting in this region of the spectrum is much smaller (86 G).The hyperfine splitting of Co(II) is usually in the range between 150 G and 300 G in the low-field region.The small hyperfine coupling and different saturation properties of the signal around g 2 from the one of high spin Co are consistent with the existence of surface radicals whose EPR transitions split into eight lines due to the presence of 59 Co in close proximity.Since the g value is 2, these transitions are mostly likely associated with oxygen-centered radicals.Close inspection of the spectra shows existence of three sets of eight-line splitting, suggesting the existence of three sets of oxygen-centered radicals with g 2.141, 2.028, and 2.019 (Fig. S7). Therefore, the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are in a broad range of coordination geometries different than those in Co III (cyclam)X/P25.Likely, oxygen molecules are coordinated to Co centers in the large aggregates of Co III (cyclam)X deposited on Rutile (Figs. 7 c andd and8), but not in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 or Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase where the Co sites are molecularly deposited on TiO 2 surfaces through Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). The adsorption of CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalysts was carried out by exposing the samples to CO 2 at room temperature and then freezing the samples at liquid He temperature prior to collecting EPR spectra.Binding of CO 2 to the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 shifted the high-spin signal from g x 5.89 to g x 5.67 (Fig. 9a).The comparison between the Co(II) resonances observed for Co III (cyclam)X/P25 is very similar to that between Co(II) sites in zeolite frameworks without and with calcinations at elevated temperatures 60,61.In particular, a Co(II) signal around g x 5.80 was observed in the EPR spectrum of a cobalt-containing microporous aluminophosphate.The Co(II) signal shifted to g x 5.44 upon calcination of the microporous material, which induced changes in the coordination geometry of the Co(II) accompanied with shortening of Co O bond 60.Therefore, our observation indicates that CO 2 upon adsorption on Co III (cyclam)X/P25 took electron density away from the Co(II) centers, either directly or indirectly by interacting with neighboring Ti(IV) sites shifting the g value towards higher fields.In Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b), binding of CO 2 did not change the high-spin Co(II) signal at g x 5.35.Instead, the hyperfine splitting of the oxygen radicals vanished and an anisotropic signal appeared near g 2 (not labeled).This observation implies that the electron density on the oxygen radicals adjacent to Co(II) was preferentially transferred to CO 2 and adsorption of CO 2 , in fact, removed electron exchange of Co(II) with oxygen atoms on the Rutile surface. The results shown in Fig. 8 provide important insights regarding the coordination geometry of Co(II) centers as well as interaction of CO 2 with the surface Co(II) sites.Most likely, the coordination geometry of surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile is also different than that in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.Further studies are underway to probe CO 2 reduction under photochemical conditions with EPR spectroscopy."}, {"llm generation": "hybrid photocatalysts consisting of TiO2 and surface molecular catalysts", "source": "The success of surface dye sensitization has inspired design of hybrid photocatalysts consisting of TiO 2 and surface molecular catalysts 24,25,50,51.", "context": "Heterogeneous photocatalysts based on TiO 2 materials have been extensively investigated in CO 2 reduction since the early work by Inoue and co-workers 2829303132. Compared to molecular catalysts, semiconductor photocatalysts are relatively stable and inexpensive.However, multi-electron processes, including CO 2reduction catalysis, on TiO 2 surfaces are extremely inefficient due to recombination of photoexcited charge carriers (electrons and holes) 333435363738.Instead, efficient solar energy conversion has been achieved by surface functionalization of TiO 2 nanomaterials with coordination complexes such as Ru(II)-based dye molecules.In dye-sensitized solar cells 3940414243 and photosynthesis cells 444546474849, TiO 2 serves to accept photoexcited electrons from the surface coordination complexes upon interfacial electron transfer.The success of surface dye sensitization has inspired design of hybrid photocatalysts consisting of TiO 2 and surface molecular catalysts 24,25,50,51.In this study, we utilize TiO 2 as a solidstate photosensitizer for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl, which is as a molecular CO 2 -reduction catalyst based on an earth-abundant metal.This Co(III) complex demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity in reducing CO 2 to CO in the presence of molecular photosensitizers, including p-terphenyl, under UV irradiation 52,53. The three hybrid photocatalysts, Co III (cyclam)X/P25, Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile, were evaluated in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor.Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase exhibited very good activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, while negligible CO production was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 3).Hydrogen gas (CO/H 2 1) as a byproduct was produced using the hybrid photocatalysts. In our study, products in the gas phase were analyzed with a GC.Product detection in the solution phase by NMR indicated no significant production of formate after photocatalysis.In order to rule out the possibility of CO generation from carbon residues on the synthesized samples, products in the gas phase were also analyzed with FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotope labeling.Fig. 4 displays the FTIR spectrum of the head-space gases above a reaction solution after photocatalytic reduction of 13 CO 2 by Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under UV irradiation.In the spectrum, the rotational-vibrational band of gaseous 13 CO centered at 2096 cm -1 clearly confirms the production of CO from CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalyst. Under the experimental conditions employed in this study (TEOA, CO 2 atmosphere, and UV irradiation), no CO was produced by any of the following: (i) P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles, (i) Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl and P25, or (iii) Co III (cyclam)X/SiO 2 prepared by depositing the Co(III) complex on a fumed silica follow- ing the microwave synthesis.In addition, no CO formation was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm) which cannot activate P25 TiO 2 .Therefore, in this hybrid Co III (cyclam)X/TiO 2 system the surface Co(III) complex is the catalyst for CO 2 reduction while TiO 2 nanoparticles function as the light-harvesting support (Fig. 1). Further surface chemistry studies also indicate that CO 2 reduction occurs on the surface Co(III) sites.In the surface chemistry studies, a hybrid photocatalyst in the powder form was placed in a diffuse reflectance accessory and exposed to an atmosphere of CO 2 .Photocatalysis at the gas-surface interface was carried out in the absence of any solvent or TEOA.The photocatalyst surface was monitored with in situ infrared detection 54,55.At various stages during photocatalysis, difference FTIR spectra were obtained by subtracting spectra acquired prior to photocatalysis from corresponding spectra collected after UV irradiation.Therefore, the difference spectra provide information regarding changes on the photocatalyst surface upon light irradiation.The formation of CO was observed on surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, as indicated by the infrared bands at 2193 cm -1 in the spectra shown in Fig. 5 (a andb) 56.The formation of surface carbonate species (1720 cm -1 ) was also observed on these two samples.Negligible changes were observed on Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile during photocatalysis (Fig. 5c).The comparison shown in Fig. 5 is in excellent agreement with photocatalysis in the solution phase (Fig. 3).Under the same experimental conditions, surface CO species was not observed on bare P25 TiO 2 21, further confirming the key role of surface Co(III) sites in mediating CO 2 -reduction catalysis. These photocatalysis results clearly indicate photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band to the surface Co(III) catalyst for CO 2 reduction in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor.In our previous studies, reduction potentials of the Co III /Co II and Co II /Co I redox couples for Co III (cyclam)X were measured to be -0.21V and -0.93 V vs NHE, respectively 21.Therefore, photoexcited electrons in the TiO 2 conduction band (potential -0.6 V vs NHE at pH 7) 57 are not energetic enough to reduce Co(II) to Co(I) needed to catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion (-0.53 V vs. NHE).The exact driving force for the photoexcited electron transfer is unclear.However, we note that the reduction potential of Co II /Co I is largely dependent of coordination ligands.For example, the reduction potential of Co II /Co I for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl was -1.39 V vs NHE, in comparison to -0.93 V vs NHE for Co III (cyclam)X 21.The Ti O Co linkage in our hybrid photocatalysts (Fig. 1) and the presence of excess TEOA in reaction solutions could further alter the redox properties of the Co III (cyclam) unit on TiO 2 surfaces under photochemical conditions.The importance of such surface Ti O Co linkage is further described in the following spectroscopic and microscopic studies. As shown in Fig. 3, the hybrid photocatalyst prepared on the Rutile nanopowder demonstrated much lower activity than Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.In many photocatalytic applications using bare TiO 2 materials, the rutile phase is generally considered less active than the anatase phase due to more significant charge recombination in rutile 29.However, the particular Rutile nanopowder employed in our study is more active than the Anatase nanopowder in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (Fig. S3), despite its lower surface area.Therefore, the difference in charge carrier dynamics is not responsible for the observed difference in photocatalytic activity shown in Fig. 3. In the UV-vis spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, two broad absorptions are seen at 450 nm and 600 nm, indicating the presence of macrocyclic Co(III) complex (Fig. 6a andb) 21.However, these features are not distinguishable in the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 6c).Therefore, the state of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material is different from that on P25 and Anatase.Such difference might account for the observed photocatalytic activity displayed in Fig. 3. Furthermore, there is no significant amount of cobalt oxides, which would exhibit distinguishable peaks at 530, 595, and 655 nm 27, in the synthesized photocatalysts. In combination with UV-vis spectroscopic studies, microscopic investigation of the hybrid photocatalysts indicates that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Only TiO 2 nanoparticles are observed in the TEM images of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase (Fig. 7a andb).Close inspection of the TEM images indicates that no separate phase is present in either of these two samples.In comparison, amorphous, nano-sized particles are seen in the TEM image of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 7c).These particles are either attached to the Rutile nanoparticles (Fig. 7d) or form large aggregates (Fig. 8).Further comparison with the TEM image of bare Rutile confirms that these amorphous particles are Co III (cyclam)X in the solid state that formed during the synthesis of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile. Previously we have found that surface Ti OH groups are important for successful deposition of active Co(III) catalysts on TiO 2 nanoparticles via a reflux method 21.Similar results were obtained for the three hybrid photocatalysts prepared by the microwave method in this study.Infrared studies of the hybrid photocatalysts show that the Rutile surface lacks terminal Ti OH groups associated with a band at 3632 cm -1 (Fig. S4) for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X.According to the UV-vis and TEM results (Figs. 678), Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces but forms aggregates on Rutile.In the study by Petsi and co-workers 58, both bridging and terminal OH groups were found to be important for the deposition of Co(H 2 O) 6 2 on TiO 2 nanoparticles.In our study, the presence of terminal OH group associated with the infrared absorption at 3632 cm -1 is essential for the molecular deposition of catalytically active Co III (cyclam)X on P25 and Anatase surfaces via Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). Based on the specific surface areas of the TiO 2 nanomaterials and elemental analysis results, surface catalyst densities are estimated to be 6-7 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and 26 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile.These numbers further support our conclusion that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited on P25 and Anatase surfaces.The absence of terminal OH groups for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material resulted in the formation of Co III (cyclam)X in the aggregated form as observed in Figs.7 and8.The lack of sufficient Ti O Co linkages in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile can be used to explain inefficient photoexcited electron transfer from Rutile to surface Co III (cyclam)X, which led to its poor activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Fig. 3). An infrared band at 3670 cm -1 , associated with bridging Ti OH groups, is also present in the spectra of the three TiO 2 samples (Fig. S4).This infrared band disappeared in the spectra of the three hybrid photocatalysts, indicating that deposition of Co III (cyclam)X also occurred through reacting with the bridging Ti OH groups.However, comparison shown in Figs.4567suggests that catalyst deposition through these bridging Ti OH groups didn't allow photoexcited electron transfer from TiO 2 to surface Co III (cyclam)X.

Therefore, the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are in a broad range of coordination geometries different than those in Co III (cyclam)X/P25.Likely, oxygen molecules are coordinated to Co centers in the large aggregates of Co III (cyclam)X deposited on Rutile (Figs. 7 c andd and8), but not in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 or Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase where the Co sites are molecularly deposited on TiO 2 surfaces through Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1).

The results shown in Fig. 8 provide important insights regarding the coordination geometry of Co(II) centers as well as interaction of CO 2 with the surface Co(II) sites.Most likely, the coordination geometry of surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile is also different than that in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.Further studies are underway to probe CO 2 reduction under photochemical conditions with EPR spectroscopy."}, {"llm generation": "Co(cyclam)Cl2Cl", "source": "In this study, we utilize TiO 2 as a solidstate photosensitizer for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl, which is as a molecular CO 2 -reduction catalyst based on an earth-abundant metal.", "context": "Heterogeneous photocatalysts based on TiO 2 materials have been extensively investigated in CO 2 reduction since the early work by Inoue and co-workers 2829303132.

The EPR spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase are almost identical, except for a dark signal in the latter due to trace metal impurity in the Anatase nanopowder (Fig. S5).Therefore, the spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are chosen for comparison in this section.In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under N 2 (Fig. 9a, gray trace), resonances corresponding to mononuclear high-spin Co(II) (S 3/2) centers are observed at g x 5.89, g y 3.40, and g z 2.22 (not labeled).The same spectrum also contains resonances near g 2 (not labeled) that are associated with trapped electrons and holes 33,34 in P25 upon exposure to ambient light (Fig. S6).In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b, gray trace), however, a very different EPR spectrum is observed in the high-spin However the hyperfine splitting in this region of the spectrum is much smaller (86 G).The hyperfine splitting of Co(II) is usually in the range between 150 G and 300 G in the low-field region.The small hyperfine coupling and different saturation properties of the signal around g 2 from the one of high spin Co are consistent with the existence of surface radicals whose EPR transitions split into eight lines due to the presence of 59 Co in close proximity.Since the g value is 2, these transitions are mostly likely associated with oxygen-centered radicals.Close inspection of the spectra shows existence of three sets of eight-line splitting, suggesting the existence of three sets of oxygen-centered radicals with g 2.141, 2.028, and 2.019 (Fig. S7). Therefore, the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are in a broad range of coordination geometries different than those in Co III (cyclam)X/P25.Likely, oxygen molecules are coordinated to Co centers in the large aggregates of Co III (cyclam)X deposited on Rutile (Figs. 7 c andd and8), but not in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 or Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase where the Co sites are molecularly deposited on TiO 2 surfaces through Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). The adsorption of CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalysts was carried out by exposing the samples to CO 2 at room temperature and then freezing the samples at liquid He temperature prior to collecting EPR spectra.Binding of CO 2 to the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 shifted the high-spin signal from g x 5.89 to g x 5.67 (Fig. 9a).The comparison between the Co(II) resonances observed for Co III (cyclam)X/P25 is very similar to that between Co(II) sites in zeolite frameworks without and with calcinations at elevated temperatures 60,61.In particular, a Co(II) signal around g x 5.80 was observed in the EPR spectrum of a cobalt-containing microporous aluminophosphate.The Co(II) signal shifted to g x 5.44 upon calcination of the microporous material, which induced changes in the coordination geometry of the Co(II) accompanied with shortening of Co O bond 60.Therefore, our observation indicates that CO 2 upon adsorption on Co III (cyclam)X/P25 took electron density away from the Co(II) centers, either directly or indirectly by interacting with neighboring Ti(IV) sites shifting the g value towards higher fields.In Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b), binding of CO 2 did not change the high-spin Co(II) signal at g x 5.35.Instead, the hyperfine splitting of the oxygen radicals vanished and an anisotropic signal appeared near g 2 (not labeled).This observation implies that the electron density on the oxygen radicals adjacent to Co(II) was preferentially transferred to CO 2 and adsorption of CO 2 , in fact, removed electron exchange of Co(II) with oxygen atoms on the Rutile surface. The results shown in Fig. 8 provide important insights regarding the coordination geometry of Co(II) centers as well as interaction of CO 2 with the surface Co(II) sites.Most likely, the coordination geometry of surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile is also different than that in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.Further studies are underway to probe CO 2 reduction under photochemical conditions with EPR spectroscopy."}, {"llm generation": "Co III (cyclam)X/P25", "source": "The three hybrid photocatalysts, Co III (cyclam)X/P25, Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile, were evaluated in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor.", "context": "Heterogeneous photocatalysts based on TiO 2 materials have been extensively investigated in CO 2 reduction since the early work by Inoue and co-workers 2829303132. Compared to molecular catalysts, semiconductor photocatalysts are relatively stable and inexpensive.However, multi-electron processes, including CO 2reduction catalysis, on TiO 2 surfaces are extremely inefficient due to recombination of photoexcited charge carriers (electrons and holes) 333435363738.Instead, efficient solar energy conversion has been achieved by surface functionalization of TiO 2 nanomaterials with coordination complexes such as Ru(II)-based dye molecules.In dye-sensitized solar cells 3940414243 and photosynthesis cells 444546474849, TiO 2 serves to accept photoexcited electrons from the surface coordination complexes upon interfacial electron transfer.The success of surface dye sensitization has inspired design of hybrid photocatalysts consisting of TiO 2 and surface molecular catalysts 24,25,50,51.In this study, we utilize TiO 2 as a solidstate photosensitizer for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl, which is as a molecular CO 2 -reduction catalyst based on an earth-abundant metal.This Co(III) complex demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity in reducing CO 2 to CO in the presence of molecular photosensitizers, including p-terphenyl, under UV irradiation 52,53. The three hybrid photocatalysts, Co III (cyclam)X/P25, Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile, were evaluated in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor.Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase exhibited very good activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, while negligible CO production was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 3).Hydrogen gas (CO/H 2 1) as a byproduct was produced using the hybrid photocatalysts. In our study, products in the gas phase were analyzed with a GC.Product detection in the solution phase by NMR indicated no significant production of formate after photocatalysis.In order to rule out the possibility of CO generation from carbon residues on the synthesized samples, products in the gas phase were also analyzed with FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotope labeling.Fig. 4 displays the FTIR spectrum of the head-space gases above a reaction solution after photocatalytic reduction of 13 CO 2 by Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under UV irradiation.In the spectrum, the rotational-vibrational band of gaseous 13 CO centered at 2096 cm -1 clearly confirms the production of CO from CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalyst. Under the experimental conditions employed in this study (TEOA, CO 2 atmosphere, and UV irradiation), no CO was produced by any of the following: (i) P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles, (i) Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl and P25, or (iii) Co III (cyclam)X/SiO 2 prepared by depositing the Co(III) complex on a fumed silica follow- ing the microwave synthesis.In addition, no CO formation was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm) which cannot activate P25 TiO 2 .Therefore, in this hybrid Co III (cyclam)X/TiO 2 system the surface Co(III) complex is the catalyst for CO 2 reduction while TiO 2 nanoparticles function as the light-harvesting support (Fig. 1). Further surface chemistry studies also indicate that CO 2 reduction occurs on the surface Co(III) sites.In the surface chemistry studies, a hybrid photocatalyst in the powder form was placed in a diffuse reflectance accessory and exposed to an atmosphere of CO 2 .Photocatalysis at the gas-surface interface was carried out in the absence of any solvent or TEOA.The photocatalyst surface was monitored with in situ infrared detection 54,55.At various stages during photocatalysis, difference FTIR spectra were obtained by subtracting spectra acquired prior to photocatalysis from corresponding spectra collected after UV irradiation.Therefore, the difference spectra provide information regarding changes on the photocatalyst surface upon light irradiation.The formation of CO was observed on surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, as indicated by the infrared bands at 2193 cm -1 in the spectra shown in Fig. 5 (a andb) 56.The formation of surface carbonate species (1720 cm -1 ) was also observed on these two samples.Negligible changes were observed on Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile during photocatalysis (Fig. 5c).The comparison shown in Fig. 5 is in excellent agreement with photocatalysis in the solution phase (Fig. 3).Under the same experimental conditions, surface CO species was not observed on bare P25 TiO 2 21, further confirming the key role of surface Co(III) sites in mediating CO 2 -reduction catalysis. These photocatalysis results clearly indicate photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band to the surface Co(III) catalyst for CO 2 reduction in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor.In our previous studies, reduction potentials of the Co III /Co II and Co II /Co I redox couples for Co III (cyclam)X were measured to be -0.21V and -0.93 V vs NHE, respectively 21.Therefore, photoexcited electrons in the TiO 2 conduction band (potential -0.6 V vs NHE at pH 7) 57 are not energetic enough to reduce Co(II) to Co(I) needed to catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion (-0.53 V vs. NHE).The exact driving force for the photoexcited electron transfer is unclear.However, we note that the reduction potential of Co II /Co I is largely dependent of coordination ligands.For example, the reduction potential of Co II /Co I for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl was -1.39 V vs NHE, in comparison to -0.93 V vs NHE for Co III (cyclam)X 21.The Ti O Co linkage in our hybrid photocatalysts (Fig. 1) and the presence of excess TEOA in reaction solutions could further alter the redox properties of the Co III (cyclam) unit on TiO 2 surfaces under photochemical conditions.The importance of such surface Ti O Co linkage is further described in the following spectroscopic and microscopic studies. As shown in Fig. 3, the hybrid photocatalyst prepared on the Rutile nanopowder demonstrated much lower activity than Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.In many photocatalytic applications using bare TiO 2 materials, the rutile phase is generally considered less active than the anatase phase due to more significant charge recombination in rutile 29.However, the particular Rutile nanopowder employed in our study is more active than the Anatase nanopowder in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (Fig. S3), despite its lower surface area.Therefore, the difference in charge carrier dynamics is not responsible for the observed difference in photocatalytic activity shown in Fig. 3. In the UV-vis spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, two broad absorptions are seen at 450 nm and 600 nm, indicating the presence of macrocyclic Co(III) complex (Fig. 6a andb) 21.However, these features are not distinguishable in the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 6c).Therefore, the state of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material is different from that on P25 and Anatase.Such difference might account for the observed photocatalytic activity displayed in Fig. 3. Furthermore, there is no significant amount of cobalt oxides, which would exhibit distinguishable peaks at 530, 595, and 655 nm 27, in the synthesized photocatalysts. In combination with UV-vis spectroscopic studies, microscopic investigation of the hybrid photocatalysts indicates that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Only TiO 2 nanoparticles are observed in the TEM images of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase (Fig. 7a andb).Close inspection of the TEM images indicates that no separate phase is present in either of these two samples.In comparison, amorphous, nano-sized particles are seen in the TEM image of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 7c).These particles are either attached to the Rutile nanoparticles (Fig. 7d) or form large aggregates (Fig. 8).Further comparison with the TEM image of bare Rutile confirms that these amorphous particles are Co III (cyclam)X in the solid state that formed during the synthesis of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile. Previously we have found that surface Ti OH groups are important for successful deposition of active Co(III) catalysts on TiO 2 nanoparticles via a reflux method 21.Similar results were obtained for the three hybrid photocatalysts prepared by the microwave method in this study.Infrared studies of the hybrid photocatalysts show that the Rutile surface lacks terminal Ti OH groups associated with a band at 3632 cm -1 (Fig. S4) for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X.According to the UV-vis and TEM results (Figs. 678), Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces but forms aggregates on Rutile.In the study by Petsi and co-workers 58, both bridging and terminal OH groups were found to be important for the deposition of Co(H 2 O) 6 2 on TiO 2 nanoparticles.In our study, the presence of terminal OH group associated with the infrared absorption at 3632 cm -1 is essential for the molecular deposition of catalytically active Co III (cyclam)X on P25 and Anatase surfaces via Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). Based on the specific surface areas of the TiO 2 nanomaterials and elemental analysis results, surface catalyst densities are estimated to be 6-7 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and 26 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile.These numbers further support our conclusion that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited on P25 and Anatase surfaces.The absence of terminal OH groups for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material resulted in the formation of Co III (cyclam)X in the aggregated form as observed in Figs.7 and8.The lack of sufficient Ti O Co linkages in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile can be used to explain inefficient photoexcited electron transfer from Rutile to surface Co III (cyclam)X, which led to its poor activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Fig. 3). An infrared band at 3670 cm -1 , associated with bridging Ti OH groups, is also present in the spectra of the three TiO 2 samples (Fig. S4).This infrared band disappeared in the spectra of the three hybrid photocatalysts, indicating that deposition of Co III (cyclam)X also occurred through reacting with the bridging Ti OH groups.However, comparison shown in Figs.4567suggests that catalyst deposition through these bridging Ti OH groups didn't allow photoexcited electron transfer from TiO 2 to surface Co III (cyclam)X.

The EPR spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase are almost identical, except for a dark signal in the latter due to trace metal impurity in the Anatase nanopowder (Fig. S5).Therefore, the spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are chosen for comparison in this section.In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under N 2 (Fig. 9a, gray trace), resonances corresponding to mononuclear high-spin Co(II) (S 3/2) centers are observed at g x 5.89, g y 3.40, and g z 2.22 (not labeled).The same spectrum also contains resonances near g 2 (not labeled) that are associated with trapped electrons and holes 33,34 in P25 upon exposure to ambient light (Fig. S6).In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b, gray trace), however, a very different EPR spectrum is observed in the high-spin However the hyperfine splitting in this region of the spectrum is much smaller (86 G).The hyperfine splitting of Co(II) is usually in the range between 150 G and 300 G in the low-field region.The small hyperfine coupling and different saturation properties of the signal around g 2 from the one of high spin Co are consistent with the existence of surface radicals whose EPR transitions split into eight lines due to the presence of 59 Co in close proximity.Since the g value is 2, these transitions are mostly likely associated with oxygen-centered radicals.Close inspection of the spectra shows existence of three sets of eight-line splitting, suggesting the existence of three sets of oxygen-centered radicals with g 2.141, 2.028, and 2.019 (Fig. S7). Therefore, the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are in a broad range of coordination geometries different than those in Co III (cyclam)X/P25.Likely, oxygen molecules are coordinated to Co centers in the large aggregates of Co III (cyclam)X deposited on Rutile (Figs. 7 c andd and8), but not in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 or Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase where the Co sites are molecularly deposited on TiO 2 surfaces through Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1).

These photocatalysis results clearly indicate photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band to the surface Co(III) catalyst for CO 2 reduction in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor.In our previous studies, reduction potentials of the Co III /Co II and Co II /Co I redox couples for Co III (cyclam)X were measured to be -0.21V and -0.93 V vs NHE, respectively 21.Therefore, photoexcited electrons in the TiO 2 conduction band (potential -0.6 V vs NHE at pH 7) 57 are not energetic enough to reduce Co(II) to Co(I) needed to catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion (-0.53 V vs. NHE).The exact driving force for the photoexcited electron transfer is unclear.However, we note that the reduction potential of Co II /Co I is largely dependent of coordination ligands.For example, the reduction potential of Co II /Co I for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl was -1.39 V vs NHE, in comparison to -0.93 V vs NHE for Co III (cyclam)X 21.The Ti O Co linkage in our hybrid photocatalysts (Fig. 1) and the presence of excess TEOA in reaction solutions could further alter the redox properties of the Co III (cyclam) unit on TiO 2 surfaces under photochemical conditions.The importance of such surface Ti O Co linkage is further described in the following spectroscopic and microscopic studies. As shown in Fig. 3, the hybrid photocatalyst prepared on the Rutile nanopowder demonstrated much lower activity than Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.In many photocatalytic applications using bare TiO 2 materials, the rutile phase is generally considered less active than the anatase phase due to more significant charge recombination in rutile 29.However, the particular Rutile nanopowder employed in our study is more active than the Anatase nanopowder in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (Fig. S3), despite its lower surface area.Therefore, the difference in charge carrier dynamics is not responsible for the observed difference in photocatalytic activity shown in Fig. 3. In the UV-vis spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, two broad absorptions are seen at 450 nm and 600 nm, indicating the presence of macrocyclic Co(III) complex (Fig. 6a andb) 21.However, these features are not distinguishable in the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 6c).Therefore, the state of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material is different from that on P25 and Anatase.Such difference might account for the observed photocatalytic activity displayed in Fig. 3.

Characterization with EPR spectroscopy further supports the fact that surface cobalt sites exist in different states on Rutile than on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Although the Co(III) compound itself is EPR silent, some paramagnetic Co(II) species and radicals are present in the synthesized hybrid photocatalysts, as indicated by the following EPR results.This is similar to the study by Kohno and co-workers 59, in which paramagnetic Co(II) species were found to be trapped in single crystals of a Co(III) compound.The presence of paramagnetic Co(II) species is likely a consequence of the use of triethylamine in the synthesis of our hybrid photocatalysts. The EPR spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase are almost identical, except for a dark signal in the latter due to trace metal impurity in the Anatase nanopowder (Fig. S5).Therefore, the spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are chosen for comparison in this section.In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under N 2 (Fig. 9a, gray trace), resonances corresponding to mononuclear high-spin Co(II) (S 3/2) centers are observed at g x 5.89, g y 3.40, and g z 2.22 (not labeled).The same spectrum also contains resonances near g 2 (not labeled) that are associated with trapped electrons and holes 33,34 in P25 upon exposure to ambient light (Fig. S6).In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b, gray trace), however, a very different EPR spectrum is observed in the high-spin However the hyperfine splitting in this region of the spectrum is much smaller (86 G).The hyperfine splitting of Co(II) is usually in the range between 150 G and 300 G in the low-field region.The small hyperfine coupling and different saturation properties of the signal around g 2 from the one of high spin Co are consistent with the existence of surface radicals whose EPR transitions split into eight lines due to the presence of 59 Co in close proximity.Since the g value is 2, these transitions are mostly likely associated with oxygen-centered radicals.Close inspection of the spectra shows existence of three sets of eight-line splitting, suggesting the existence of three sets of oxygen-centered radicals with g 2.141, 2.028, and 2.019 (Fig. S7). Therefore, the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are in a broad range of coordination geometries different than those in Co III (cyclam)X/P25.Likely, oxygen molecules are coordinated to Co centers in the large aggregates of Co III (cyclam)X deposited on Rutile (Figs. 7 c andd and8), but not in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 or Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase where the Co sites are molecularly deposited on TiO 2 surfaces through Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). The adsorption of CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalysts was carried out by exposing the samples to CO 2 at room temperature and then freezing the samples at liquid He temperature prior to collecting EPR spectra.Binding of CO 2 to the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 shifted the high-spin signal from g x 5.89 to g x 5.67 (Fig. 9a).The comparison between the Co(II) resonances observed for Co III (cyclam)X/P25 is very similar to that between Co(II) sites in zeolite frameworks without and with calcinations at elevated temperatures 60,61.In particular, a Co(II) signal around g x 5.80 was observed in the EPR spectrum of a cobalt-containing microporous aluminophosphate.The Co(II) signal shifted to g x 5.44 upon calcination of the microporous material, which induced changes in the coordination geometry of the Co(II) accompanied with shortening of Co O bond 60.Therefore, our observation indicates that CO 2 upon adsorption on Co III (cyclam)X/P25 took electron density away from the Co(II) centers, either directly or indirectly by interacting with neighboring Ti(IV) sites shifting the g value towards higher fields.In Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b), binding of CO 2 did not change the high-spin Co(II) signal at g x 5.35.Instead, the hyperfine splitting of the oxygen radicals vanished and an anisotropic signal appeared near g 2 (not labeled).This observation implies that the electron density on the oxygen radicals adjacent to Co(II) was preferentially transferred to CO 2 and adsorption of CO 2 , in fact, removed electron exchange of Co(II) with oxygen atoms on the Rutile surface. The results shown in Fig. 8 provide important insights regarding the coordination geometry of Co(II) centers as well as interaction of CO 2 with the surface Co(II) sites.Most likely, the coordination geometry of surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile is also different than that in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.Further studies are underway to probe CO 2 reduction under photochemical conditions with EPR spectroscopy."}, {"llm generation": "Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile", "source": "The three hybrid photocatalysts, Co III (cyclam)X/P25, Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile, were evaluated in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor.", "context": "Heterogeneous photocatalysts based on TiO 2 materials have been extensively investigated in CO 2 reduction since the early work by Inoue and co-workers 2829303132. Compared to molecular catalysts, semiconductor photocatalysts are relatively stable and inexpensive.However, multi-electron processes, including CO 2reduction catalysis, on TiO 2 surfaces are extremely inefficient due to recombination of photoexcited charge carriers (electrons and holes) 333435363738.Instead, efficient solar energy conversion has been achieved by surface functionalization of TiO 2 nanomaterials with coordination complexes such as Ru(II)-based dye molecules.In dye-sensitized solar cells 3940414243 and photosynthesis cells 444546474849, TiO 2 serves to accept photoexcited electrons from the surface coordination complexes upon interfacial electron transfer.The success of surface dye sensitization has inspired design of hybrid photocatalysts consisting of TiO 2 and surface molecular catalysts 24,25,50,51.In this study, we utilize TiO 2 as a solidstate photosensitizer for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl, which is as a molecular CO 2 -reduction catalyst based on an earth-abundant metal.This Co(III) complex demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity in reducing CO 2 to CO in the presence of molecular photosensitizers, including p-terphenyl, under UV irradiation 52,53. The three hybrid photocatalysts, Co III (cyclam)X/P25, Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile, were evaluated in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor.Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase exhibited very good activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, while negligible CO production was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 3).Hydrogen gas (CO/H 2 1) as a byproduct was produced using the hybrid photocatalysts. In our study, products in the gas phase were analyzed with a GC.Product detection in the solution phase by NMR indicated no significant production of formate after photocatalysis.In order to rule out the possibility of CO generation from carbon residues on the synthesized samples, products in the gas phase were also analyzed with FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotope labeling.Fig. 4 displays the FTIR spectrum of the head-space gases above a reaction solution after photocatalytic reduction of 13 CO 2 by Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under UV irradiation.In the spectrum, the rotational-vibrational band of gaseous 13 CO centered at 2096 cm -1 clearly confirms the production of CO from CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalyst. Under the experimental conditions employed in this study (TEOA, CO 2 atmosphere, and UV irradiation), no CO was produced by any of the following: (i) P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles, (i) Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl and P25, or (iii) Co III (cyclam)X/SiO 2 prepared by depositing the Co(III) complex on a fumed silica follow- ing the microwave synthesis.In addition, no CO formation was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm) which cannot activate P25 TiO 2 .Therefore, in this hybrid Co III (cyclam)X/TiO 2 system the surface Co(III) complex is the catalyst for CO 2 reduction while TiO 2 nanoparticles function as the light-harvesting support (Fig. 1). Further surface chemistry studies also indicate that CO 2 reduction occurs on the surface Co(III) sites.In the surface chemistry studies, a hybrid photocatalyst in the powder form was placed in a diffuse reflectance accessory and exposed to an atmosphere of CO 2 .Photocatalysis at the gas-surface interface was carried out in the absence of any solvent or TEOA.The photocatalyst surface was monitored with in situ infrared detection 54,55.At various stages during photocatalysis, difference FTIR spectra were obtained by subtracting spectra acquired prior to photocatalysis from corresponding spectra collected after UV irradiation.Therefore, the difference spectra provide information regarding changes on the photocatalyst surface upon light irradiation.The formation of CO was observed on surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, as indicated by the infrared bands at 2193 cm -1 in the spectra shown in Fig. 5 (a andb) 56.The formation of surface carbonate species (1720 cm -1 ) was also observed on these two samples.Negligible changes were observed on Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile during photocatalysis (Fig. 5c).The comparison shown in Fig. 5 is in excellent agreement with photocatalysis in the solution phase (Fig. 3).Under the same experimental conditions, surface CO species was not observed on bare P25 TiO 2 21, further confirming the key role of surface Co(III) sites in mediating CO 2 -reduction catalysis. These photocatalysis results clearly indicate photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band to the surface Co(III) catalyst for CO 2 reduction in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor.In our previous studies, reduction potentials of the Co III /Co II and Co II /Co I redox couples for Co III (cyclam)X were measured to be -0.21V and -0.93 V vs NHE, respectively 21.Therefore, photoexcited electrons in the TiO 2 conduction band (potential -0.6 V vs NHE at pH 7) 57 are not energetic enough to reduce Co(II) to Co(I) needed to catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion (-0.53 V vs. NHE).The exact driving force for the photoexcited electron transfer is unclear.However, we note that the reduction potential of Co II /Co I is largely dependent of coordination ligands.For example, the reduction potential of Co II /Co I for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl was -1.39 V vs NHE, in comparison to -0.93 V vs NHE for Co III (cyclam)X 21.The Ti O Co linkage in our hybrid photocatalysts (Fig. 1) and the presence of excess TEOA in reaction solutions could further alter the redox properties of the Co III (cyclam) unit on TiO 2 surfaces under photochemical conditions.The importance of such surface Ti O Co linkage is further described in the following spectroscopic and microscopic studies. As shown in Fig. 3, the hybrid photocatalyst prepared on the Rutile nanopowder demonstrated much lower activity than Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.In many photocatalytic applications using bare TiO 2 materials, the rutile phase is generally considered less active than the anatase phase due to more significant charge recombination in rutile 29.However, the particular Rutile nanopowder employed in our study is more active than the Anatase nanopowder in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (Fig. S3), despite its lower surface area.Therefore, the difference in charge carrier dynamics is not responsible for the observed difference in photocatalytic activity shown in Fig. 3. In the UV-vis spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, two broad absorptions are seen at 450 nm and 600 nm, indicating the presence of macrocyclic Co(III) complex (Fig. 6a andb) 21.However, these features are not distinguishable in the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 6c).Therefore, the state of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material is different from that on P25 and Anatase.Such difference might account for the observed photocatalytic activity displayed in Fig. 3. Furthermore, there is no significant amount of cobalt oxides, which would exhibit distinguishable peaks at 530, 595, and 655 nm 27, in the synthesized photocatalysts. In combination with UV-vis spectroscopic studies, microscopic investigation of the hybrid photocatalysts indicates that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Only TiO 2 nanoparticles are observed in the TEM images of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase (Fig. 7a andb).Close inspection of the TEM images indicates that no separate phase is present in either of these two samples.In comparison, amorphous, nano-sized particles are seen in the TEM image of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 7c).These particles are either attached to the Rutile nanoparticles (Fig. 7d) or form large aggregates (Fig. 8).Further comparison with the TEM image of bare Rutile confirms that these amorphous particles are Co III (cyclam)X in the solid state that formed during the synthesis of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile. Previously we have found that surface Ti OH groups are important for successful deposition of active Co(III) catalysts on TiO 2 nanoparticles via a reflux method 21.Similar results were obtained for the three hybrid photocatalysts prepared by the microwave method in this study.Infrared studies of the hybrid photocatalysts show that the Rutile surface lacks terminal Ti OH groups associated with a band at 3632 cm -1 (Fig. S4) for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X.According to the UV-vis and TEM results (Figs. 678), Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces but forms aggregates on Rutile.In the study by Petsi and co-workers 58, both bridging and terminal OH groups were found to be important for the deposition of Co(H 2 O) 6 2 on TiO 2 nanoparticles.In our study, the presence of terminal OH group associated with the infrared absorption at 3632 cm -1 is essential for the molecular deposition of catalytically active Co III (cyclam)X on P25 and Anatase surfaces via Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). Based on the specific surface areas of the TiO 2 nanomaterials and elemental analysis results, surface catalyst densities are estimated to be 6-7 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and 26 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile.These numbers further support our conclusion that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited on P25 and Anatase surfaces.The absence of terminal OH groups for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material resulted in the formation of Co III (cyclam)X in the aggregated form as observed in Figs.7 and8.The lack of sufficient Ti O Co linkages in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile can be used to explain inefficient photoexcited electron transfer from Rutile to surface Co III (cyclam)X, which led to its poor activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Fig. 3).

These photocatalysis results clearly indicate photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band to the surface Co(III) catalyst for CO 2 reduction in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor.In our previous studies, reduction potentials of the Co III /Co II and Co II /Co I redox couples for Co III (cyclam)X were measured to be -0.21V and -0.93 V vs NHE, respectively 21.Therefore, photoexcited electrons in the TiO 2 conduction band (potential -0.6 V vs NHE at pH 7) 57 are not energetic enough to reduce Co(II) to Co(I) needed to catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion (-0.53 V vs. NHE).The exact driving force for the photoexcited electron transfer is unclear.However, we note that the reduction potential of Co II /Co I is largely dependent of coordination ligands.For example, the reduction potential of Co II /Co I for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl was -1.39 V vs NHE, in comparison to -0.93 V vs NHE for Co III (cyclam)X 21.The Ti O Co linkage in our hybrid photocatalysts (Fig. 1) and the presence of excess TEOA in reaction solutions could further alter the redox properties of the Co III (cyclam) unit on TiO 2 surfaces under photochemical conditions.The importance of such surface Ti O Co linkage is further described in the following spectroscopic and microscopic studies. As shown in Fig. 3, the hybrid photocatalyst prepared on the Rutile nanopowder demonstrated much lower activity than Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.In many photocatalytic applications using bare TiO 2 materials, the rutile phase is generally considered less active than the anatase phase due to more significant charge recombination in rutile 29.However, the particular Rutile nanopowder employed in our study is more active than the Anatase nanopowder in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (Fig. S3), despite its lower surface area.Therefore, the difference in charge carrier dynamics is not responsible for the observed difference in photocatalytic activity shown in Fig. 3. In the UV-vis spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, two broad absorptions are seen at 450 nm and 600 nm, indicating the presence of macrocyclic Co(III) complex (Fig. 6a andb) 21.However, these features are not distinguishable in the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 6c).Therefore, the state of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material is different from that on P25 and Anatase.Such difference might account for the observed photocatalytic activity displayed in Fig. 3.

Based on the specific surface areas of the TiO 2 nanomaterials and elemental analysis results, surface catalyst densities are estimated to be 6-7 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and 26 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile.These numbers further support our conclusion that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited on P25 and Anatase surfaces.The absence of terminal OH groups for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material resulted in the formation of Co III (cyclam)X in the aggregated form as observed in Figs.7 and8.The lack of sufficient Ti O Co linkages in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile can be used to explain inefficient photoexcited electron transfer from Rutile to surface Co III (cyclam)X, which led to its poor activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Fig. 3). An infrared band at 3670 cm -1 , associated with bridging Ti OH groups, is also present in the spectra of the three TiO 2 samples (Fig. S4).This infrared band disappeared in the spectra of the three hybrid photocatalysts, indicating that deposition of Co III (cyclam)X also occurred through reacting with the bridging Ti OH groups.However, comparison shown in Figs.4567suggests that catalyst deposition through these bridging Ti OH groups didn't allow photoexcited electron transfer from TiO 2 to surface Co III (cyclam)X. Characterization with EPR spectroscopy further supports the fact that surface cobalt sites exist in different states on Rutile than on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Although the Co(III) compound itself is EPR silent, some paramagnetic Co(II) species and radicals are present in the synthesized hybrid photocatalysts, as indicated by the following EPR results.This is similar to the study by Kohno and co-workers 59, in which paramagnetic Co(II) species were found to be trapped in single crystals of a Co(III) compound.The presence of paramagnetic Co(II) species is likely a consequence of the use of triethylamine in the synthesis of our hybrid photocatalysts. The EPR spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase are almost identical, except for a dark signal in the latter due to trace metal impurity in the Anatase nanopowder (Fig. S5).Therefore, the spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are chosen for comparison in this section.In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under N 2 (Fig. 9a, gray trace), resonances corresponding to mononuclear high-spin Co(II) (S 3/2) centers are observed at g x 5.89, g y 3.40, and g z 2.22 (not labeled).The same spectrum also contains resonances near g 2 (not labeled) that are associated with trapped electrons and holes 33,34 in P25 upon exposure to ambient light (Fig. S6).In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b, gray trace), however, a very different EPR spectrum is observed in the high-spin However the hyperfine splitting in this region of the spectrum is much smaller (86 G).The hyperfine splitting of Co(II) is usually in the range between 150 G and 300 G in the low-field region.The small hyperfine coupling and different saturation properties of the signal around g 2 from the one of high spin Co are consistent with the existence of surface radicals whose EPR transitions split into eight lines due to the presence of 59 Co in close proximity.Since the g value is 2, these transitions are mostly likely associated with oxygen-centered radicals.Close inspection of the spectra shows existence of three sets of eight-line splitting, suggesting the existence of three sets of oxygen-centered radicals with g 2.141, 2.028, and 2.019 (Fig. S7). Therefore, the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are in a broad range of coordination geometries different than those in Co III (cyclam)X/P25.Likely, oxygen molecules are coordinated to Co centers in the large aggregates of Co III (cyclam)X deposited on Rutile (Figs. 7 c andd and8), but not in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 or Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase where the Co sites are molecularly deposited on TiO 2 surfaces through Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). The adsorption of CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalysts was carried out by exposing the samples to CO 2 at room temperature and then freezing the samples at liquid He temperature prior to collecting EPR spectra.Binding of CO 2 to the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 shifted the high-spin signal from g x 5.89 to g x 5.67 (Fig. 9a).The comparison between the Co(II) resonances observed for Co III (cyclam)X/P25 is very similar to that between Co(II) sites in zeolite frameworks without and with calcinations at elevated temperatures 60,61.In particular, a Co(II) signal around g x 5.80 was observed in the EPR spectrum of a cobalt-containing microporous aluminophosphate.The Co(II) signal shifted to g x 5.44 upon calcination of the microporous material, which induced changes in the coordination geometry of the Co(II) accompanied with shortening of Co O bond 60.Therefore, our observation indicates that CO 2 upon adsorption on Co III (cyclam)X/P25 took electron density away from the Co(II) centers, either directly or indirectly by interacting with neighboring Ti(IV) sites shifting the g value towards higher fields.In Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b), binding of CO 2 did not change the high-spin Co(II) signal at g x 5.35.Instead, the hyperfine splitting of the oxygen radicals vanished and an anisotropic signal appeared near g 2 (not labeled).This observation implies that the electron density on the oxygen radicals adjacent to Co(II) was preferentially transferred to CO 2 and adsorption of CO 2 , in fact, removed electron exchange of Co(II) with oxygen atoms on the Rutile surface. The results shown in Fig. 8 provide important insights regarding the coordination geometry of Co(II) centers as well as interaction of CO 2 with the surface Co(II) sites.Most likely, the coordination geometry of surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile is also different than that in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.Further studies are underway to probe CO 2 reduction under photochemical conditions with EPR spectroscopy."}, {"llm generation": "Co(cyclam)Cl2Cl and P25", "source": "Under the experimental conditions employed in this study (TEOA, CO 2 atmosphere, and UV irradiation), no CO was produced by any of the following: (i) P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles, (i) Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl and P25, or (iii) Co III (cyclam)X/SiO 2 prepared by depositing the Co(III) complex on a fumed silica follow- ing the microwave synthesis.", "context": "Heterogeneous photocatalysts based on TiO 2 materials have been extensively investigated in CO 2 reduction since the early work by Inoue and co-workers 2829303132. Compared to molecular catalysts, semiconductor photocatalysts are relatively stable and inexpensive.However, multi-electron processes, including CO 2reduction catalysis, on TiO 2 surfaces are extremely inefficient due to recombination of photoexcited charge carriers (electrons and holes) 333435363738.Instead, efficient solar energy conversion has been achieved by surface functionalization of TiO 2 nanomaterials with coordination complexes such as Ru(II)-based dye molecules.In dye-sensitized solar cells 3940414243 and photosynthesis cells 444546474849, TiO 2 serves to accept photoexcited electrons from the surface coordination complexes upon interfacial electron transfer.The success of surface dye sensitization has inspired design of hybrid photocatalysts consisting of TiO 2 and surface molecular catalysts 24,25,50,51.In this study, we utilize TiO 2 as a solidstate photosensitizer for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl, which is as a molecular CO 2 -reduction catalyst based on an earth-abundant metal.This Co(III) complex demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity in reducing CO 2 to CO in the presence of molecular photosensitizers, including p-terphenyl, under UV irradiation 52,53. The three hybrid photocatalysts, Co III (cyclam)X/P25, Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile, were evaluated in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor.Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase exhibited very good activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, while negligible CO production was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 3).Hydrogen gas (CO/H 2 1) as a byproduct was produced using the hybrid photocatalysts. In our study, products in the gas phase were analyzed with a GC.Product detection in the solution phase by NMR indicated no significant production of formate after photocatalysis.In order to rule out the possibility of CO generation from carbon residues on the synthesized samples, products in the gas phase were also analyzed with FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotope labeling.Fig. 4 displays the FTIR spectrum of the head-space gases above a reaction solution after photocatalytic reduction of 13 CO 2 by Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under UV irradiation.In the spectrum, the rotational-vibrational band of gaseous 13 CO centered at 2096 cm -1 clearly confirms the production of CO from CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalyst. Under the experimental conditions employed in this study (TEOA, CO 2 atmosphere, and UV irradiation), no CO was produced by any of the following: (i) P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles, (i) Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl and P25, or (iii) Co III (cyclam)X/SiO 2 prepared by depositing the Co(III) complex on a fumed silica follow- ing the microwave synthesis.In addition, no CO formation was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm) which cannot activate P25 TiO 2 .Therefore, in this hybrid Co III (cyclam)X/TiO 2 system the surface Co(III) complex is the catalyst for CO 2 reduction while TiO 2 nanoparticles function as the light-harvesting support (Fig. 1). Further surface chemistry studies also indicate that CO 2 reduction occurs on the surface Co(III) sites.In the surface chemistry studies, a hybrid photocatalyst in the powder form was placed in a diffuse reflectance accessory and exposed to an atmosphere of CO 2 .Photocatalysis at the gas-surface interface was carried out in the absence of any solvent or TEOA.The photocatalyst surface was monitored with in situ infrared detection 54,55.At various stages during photocatalysis, difference FTIR spectra were obtained by subtracting spectra acquired prior to photocatalysis from corresponding spectra collected after UV irradiation.Therefore, the difference spectra provide information regarding changes on the photocatalyst surface upon light irradiation.The formation of CO was observed on surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, as indicated by the infrared bands at 2193 cm -1 in the spectra shown in Fig. 5 (a andb) 56.The formation of surface carbonate species (1720 cm -1 ) was also observed on these two samples.Negligible changes were observed on Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile during photocatalysis (Fig. 5c).The comparison shown in Fig. 5 is in excellent agreement with photocatalysis in the solution phase (Fig. 3).Under the same experimental conditions, surface CO species was not observed on bare P25 TiO 2 21, further confirming the key role of surface Co(III) sites in mediating CO 2 -reduction catalysis. These photocatalysis results clearly indicate photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band to the surface Co(III) catalyst for CO 2 reduction in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor.In our previous studies, reduction potentials of the Co III /Co II and Co II /Co I redox couples for Co III (cyclam)X were measured to be -0.21V and -0.93 V vs NHE, respectively 21.Therefore, photoexcited electrons in the TiO 2 conduction band (potential -0.6 V vs NHE at pH 7) 57 are not energetic enough to reduce Co(II) to Co(I) needed to catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion (-0.53 V vs. NHE).The exact driving force for the photoexcited electron transfer is unclear.However, we note that the reduction potential of Co II /Co I is largely dependent of coordination ligands.For example, the reduction potential of Co II /Co I for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl was -1.39 V vs NHE, in comparison to -0.93 V vs NHE for Co III (cyclam)X 21.The Ti O Co linkage in our hybrid photocatalysts (Fig. 1) and the presence of excess TEOA in reaction solutions could further alter the redox properties of the Co III (cyclam) unit on TiO 2 surfaces under photochemical conditions.The importance of such surface Ti O Co linkage is further described in the following spectroscopic and microscopic studies. As shown in Fig. 3, the hybrid photocatalyst prepared on the Rutile nanopowder demonstrated much lower activity than Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.In many photocatalytic applications using bare TiO 2 materials, the rutile phase is generally considered less active than the anatase phase due to more significant charge recombination in rutile 29.However, the particular Rutile nanopowder employed in our study is more active than the Anatase nanopowder in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (Fig. S3), despite its lower surface area.Therefore, the difference in charge carrier dynamics is not responsible for the observed difference in photocatalytic activity shown in Fig. 3. In the UV-vis spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, two broad absorptions are seen at 450 nm and 600 nm, indicating the presence of macrocyclic Co(III) complex (Fig. 6a andb) 21.However, these features are not distinguishable in the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 6c).Therefore, the state of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material is different from that on P25 and Anatase.Such difference might account for the observed photocatalytic activity displayed in Fig. 3. Furthermore, there is no significant amount of cobalt oxides, which would exhibit distinguishable peaks at 530, 595, and 655 nm 27, in the synthesized photocatalysts. In combination with UV-vis spectroscopic studies, microscopic investigation of the hybrid photocatalysts indicates that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Only TiO 2 nanoparticles are observed in the TEM images of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase (Fig. 7a andb).Close inspection of the TEM images indicates that no separate phase is present in either of these two samples.In comparison, amorphous, nano-sized particles are seen in the TEM image of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 7c).These particles are either attached to the Rutile nanoparticles (Fig. 7d) or form large aggregates (Fig. 8).Further comparison with the TEM image of bare Rutile confirms that these amorphous particles are Co III (cyclam)X in the solid state that formed during the synthesis of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile. Previously we have found that surface Ti OH groups are important for successful deposition of active Co(III) catalysts on TiO 2 nanoparticles via a reflux method 21.Similar results were obtained for the three hybrid photocatalysts prepared by the microwave method in this study.Infrared studies of the hybrid photocatalysts show that the Rutile surface lacks terminal Ti OH groups associated with a band at 3632 cm -1 (Fig. S4) for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X.According to the UV-vis and TEM results (Figs. 678), Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces but forms aggregates on Rutile.In the study by Petsi and co-workers 58, both bridging and terminal OH groups were found to be important for the deposition of Co(H 2 O) 6 2 on TiO 2 nanoparticles.In our study, the presence of terminal OH group associated with the infrared absorption at 3632 cm -1 is essential for the molecular deposition of catalytically active Co III (cyclam)X on P25 and Anatase surfaces via Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1).

Further surface chemistry studies also indicate that CO 2 reduction occurs on the surface Co(III) sites.In the surface chemistry studies, a hybrid photocatalyst in the powder form was placed in a diffuse reflectance accessory and exposed to an atmosphere of CO 2 .Photocatalysis at the gas-surface interface was carried out in the absence of any solvent or TEOA.The photocatalyst surface was monitored with in situ infrared detection 54,55.At various stages during photocatalysis, difference FTIR spectra were obtained by subtracting spectra acquired prior to photocatalysis from corresponding spectra collected after UV irradiation.Therefore, the difference spectra provide information regarding changes on the photocatalyst surface upon light irradiation.The formation of CO was observed on surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, as indicated by the infrared bands at 2193 cm -1 in the spectra shown in Fig. 5 (a andb) 56.The formation of surface carbonate species (1720 cm -1 ) was also observed on these two samples.Negligible changes were observed on Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile during photocatalysis (Fig. 5c).The comparison shown in Fig. 5 is in excellent agreement with photocatalysis in the solution phase (Fig. 3).Under the same experimental conditions, surface CO species was not observed on bare P25 TiO 2 21, further confirming the key role of surface Co(III) sites in mediating CO 2 -reduction catalysis. These photocatalysis results clearly indicate photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band to the surface Co(III) catalyst for CO 2 reduction in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor.In our previous studies, reduction potentials of the Co III /Co II and Co II /Co I redox couples for Co III (cyclam)X were measured to be -0.21V and -0.93 V vs NHE, respectively 21.Therefore, photoexcited electrons in the TiO 2 conduction band (potential -0.6 V vs NHE at pH 7) 57 are not energetic enough to reduce Co(II) to Co(I) needed to catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion (-0.53 V vs. NHE).The exact driving force for the photoexcited electron transfer is unclear.However, we note that the reduction potential of Co II /Co I is largely dependent of coordination ligands.For example, the reduction potential of Co II /Co I for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl was -1.39 V vs NHE, in comparison to -0.93 V vs NHE for Co III (cyclam)X 21.The Ti O Co linkage in our hybrid photocatalysts (Fig. 1) and the presence of excess TEOA in reaction solutions could further alter the redox properties of the Co III (cyclam) unit on TiO 2 surfaces under photochemical conditions.The importance of such surface Ti O Co linkage is further described in the following spectroscopic and microscopic studies. As shown in Fig. 3, the hybrid photocatalyst prepared on the Rutile nanopowder demonstrated much lower activity than Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.In many photocatalytic applications using bare TiO 2 materials, the rutile phase is generally considered less active than the anatase phase due to more significant charge recombination in rutile 29.However, the particular Rutile nanopowder employed in our study is more active than the Anatase nanopowder in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (Fig. S3), despite its lower surface area.Therefore, the difference in charge carrier dynamics is not responsible for the observed difference in photocatalytic activity shown in Fig. 3. In the UV-vis spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, two broad absorptions are seen at 450 nm and 600 nm, indicating the presence of macrocyclic Co(III) complex (Fig. 6a andb) 21.However, these features are not distinguishable in the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 6c).Therefore, the state of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material is different from that on P25 and Anatase.Such difference might account for the observed photocatalytic activity displayed in Fig. 3. Furthermore, there is no significant amount of cobalt oxides, which would exhibit distinguishable peaks at 530, 595, and 655 nm 27, in the synthesized photocatalysts. In combination with UV-vis spectroscopic studies, microscopic investigation of the hybrid photocatalysts indicates that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Only TiO 2 nanoparticles are observed in the TEM images of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase (Fig. 7a andb).Close inspection of the TEM images indicates that no separate phase is present in either of these two samples.In comparison, amorphous, nano-sized particles are seen in the TEM image of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 7c).These particles are either attached to the Rutile nanoparticles (Fig. 7d) or form large aggregates (Fig. 8).Further comparison with the TEM image of bare Rutile confirms that these amorphous particles are Co III (cyclam)X in the solid state that formed during the synthesis of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile. Previously we have found that surface Ti OH groups are important for successful deposition of active Co(III) catalysts on TiO 2 nanoparticles via a reflux method 21.Similar results were obtained for the three hybrid photocatalysts prepared by the microwave method in this study.Infrared studies of the hybrid photocatalysts show that the Rutile surface lacks terminal Ti OH groups associated with a band at 3632 cm -1 (Fig. S4) for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X.According to the UV-vis and TEM results (Figs. 678), Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces but forms aggregates on Rutile.In the study by Petsi and co-workers 58, both bridging and terminal OH groups were found to be important for the deposition of Co(H 2 O) 6 2 on TiO 2 nanoparticles.In our study, the presence of terminal OH group associated with the infrared absorption at 3632 cm -1 is essential for the molecular deposition of catalytically active Co III (cyclam)X on P25 and Anatase surfaces via Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). Based on the specific surface areas of the TiO 2 nanomaterials and elemental analysis results, surface catalyst densities are estimated to be 6-7 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and 26 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile.These numbers further support our conclusion that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited on P25 and Anatase surfaces.The absence of terminal OH groups for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material resulted in the formation of Co III (cyclam)X in the aggregated form as observed in Figs.7 and8.The lack of sufficient Ti O Co linkages in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile can be used to explain inefficient photoexcited electron transfer from Rutile to surface Co III (cyclam)X, which led to its poor activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Fig. 3). An infrared band at 3670 cm -1 , associated with bridging Ti OH groups, is also present in the spectra of the three TiO 2 samples (Fig. S4).This infrared band disappeared in the spectra of the three hybrid photocatalysts, indicating that deposition of Co III (cyclam)X also occurred through reacting with the bridging Ti OH groups.However, comparison shown in Figs.4567suggests that catalyst deposition through these bridging Ti OH groups didn't allow photoexcited electron transfer from TiO 2 to surface Co III (cyclam)X. Characterization with EPR spectroscopy further supports the fact that surface cobalt sites exist in different states on Rutile than on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Although the Co(III) compound itself is EPR silent, some paramagnetic Co(II) species and radicals are present in the synthesized hybrid photocatalysts, as indicated by the following EPR results.This is similar to the study by Kohno and co-workers 59, in which paramagnetic Co(II) species were found to be trapped in single crystals of a Co(III) compound.The presence of paramagnetic Co(II) species is likely a consequence of the use of triethylamine in the synthesis of our hybrid photocatalysts. The EPR spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase are almost identical, except for a dark signal in the latter due to trace metal impurity in the Anatase nanopowder (Fig. S5).Therefore, the spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are chosen for comparison in this section.In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under N 2 (Fig. 9a, gray trace), resonances corresponding to mononuclear high-spin Co(II) (S 3/2) centers are observed at g x 5.89, g y 3.40, and g z 2.22 (not labeled).The same spectrum also contains resonances near g 2 (not labeled) that are associated with trapped electrons and holes 33,34 in P25 upon exposure to ambient light (Fig. S6).In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b, gray trace), however, a very different EPR spectrum is observed in the high-spin However the hyperfine splitting in this region of the spectrum is much smaller (86 G).The hyperfine splitting of Co(II) is usually in the range between 150 G and 300 G in the low-field region.The small hyperfine coupling and different saturation properties of the signal around g 2 from the one of high spin Co are consistent with the existence of surface radicals whose EPR transitions split into eight lines due to the presence of 59 Co in close proximity.Since the g value is 2, these transitions are mostly likely associated with oxygen-centered radicals.Close inspection of the spectra shows existence of three sets of eight-line splitting, suggesting the existence of three sets of oxygen-centered radicals with g 2.141, 2.028, and 2.019 (Fig. S7). Therefore, the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are in a broad range of coordination geometries different than those in Co III (cyclam)X/P25.Likely, oxygen molecules are coordinated to Co centers in the large aggregates of Co III (cyclam)X deposited on Rutile (Figs. 7 c andd and8), but not in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 or Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase where the Co sites are molecularly deposited on TiO 2 surfaces through Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). The adsorption of CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalysts was carried out by exposing the samples to CO 2 at room temperature and then freezing the samples at liquid He temperature prior to collecting EPR spectra.Binding of CO 2 to the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 shifted the high-spin signal from g x 5.89 to g x 5.67 (Fig. 9a).The comparison between the Co(II) resonances observed for Co III (cyclam)X/P25 is very similar to that between Co(II) sites in zeolite frameworks without and with calcinations at elevated temperatures 60,61.In particular, a Co(II) signal around g x 5.80 was observed in the EPR spectrum of a cobalt-containing microporous aluminophosphate.The Co(II) signal shifted to g x 5.44 upon calcination of the microporous material, which induced changes in the coordination geometry of the Co(II) accompanied with shortening of Co O bond 60.Therefore, our observation indicates that CO 2 upon adsorption on Co III (cyclam)X/P25 took electron density away from the Co(II) centers, either directly or indirectly by interacting with neighboring Ti(IV) sites shifting the g value towards higher fields.In Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b), binding of CO 2 did not change the high-spin Co(II) signal at g x 5.35.Instead, the hyperfine splitting of the oxygen radicals vanished and an anisotropic signal appeared near g 2 (not labeled).This observation implies that the electron density on the oxygen radicals adjacent to Co(II) was preferentially transferred to CO 2 and adsorption of CO 2 , in fact, removed electron exchange of Co(II) with oxygen atoms on the Rutile surface. The results shown in Fig. 8 provide important insights regarding the coordination geometry of Co(II) centers as well as interaction of CO 2 with the surface Co(II) sites.Most likely, the coordination geometry of surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile is also different than that in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.Further studies are underway to probe CO 2 reduction under photochemical conditions with EPR spectroscopy."}, {"llm generation": "surface Co(III) complex", "source": "Therefore, in this hybrid Co III (cyclam)X/TiO 2 system the surface Co(III) complex is the catalyst for CO 2 reduction while TiO 2 nanoparticles function as the light-harvesting support (Fig. 1).", "context": "Heterogeneous photocatalysts based on TiO 2 materials have been extensively investigated in CO 2 reduction since the early work by Inoue and co-workers 2829303132. Compared to molecular catalysts, semiconductor photocatalysts are relatively stable and inexpensive.However, multi-electron processes, including CO 2reduction catalysis, on TiO 2 surfaces are extremely inefficient due to recombination of photoexcited charge carriers (electrons and holes) 333435363738.Instead, efficient solar energy conversion has been achieved by surface functionalization of TiO 2 nanomaterials with coordination complexes such as Ru(II)-based dye molecules.In dye-sensitized solar cells 3940414243 and photosynthesis cells 444546474849, TiO 2 serves to accept photoexcited electrons from the surface coordination complexes upon interfacial electron transfer.The success of surface dye sensitization has inspired design of hybrid photocatalysts consisting of TiO 2 and surface molecular catalysts 24,25,50,51.In this study, we utilize TiO 2 as a solidstate photosensitizer for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl, which is as a molecular CO 2 -reduction catalyst based on an earth-abundant metal.This Co(III) complex demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity in reducing CO 2 to CO in the presence of molecular photosensitizers, including p-terphenyl, under UV irradiation 52,53. The three hybrid photocatalysts, Co III (cyclam)X/P25, Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile, were evaluated in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor.Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase exhibited very good activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, while negligible CO production was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 3).Hydrogen gas (CO/H 2 1) as a byproduct was produced using the hybrid photocatalysts. In our study, products in the gas phase were analyzed with a GC.Product detection in the solution phase by NMR indicated no significant production of formate after photocatalysis.In order to rule out the possibility of CO generation from carbon residues on the synthesized samples, products in the gas phase were also analyzed with FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotope labeling.Fig. 4 displays the FTIR spectrum of the head-space gases above a reaction solution after photocatalytic reduction of 13 CO 2 by Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under UV irradiation.In the spectrum, the rotational-vibrational band of gaseous 13 CO centered at 2096 cm -1 clearly confirms the production of CO from CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalyst. Under the experimental conditions employed in this study (TEOA, CO 2 atmosphere, and UV irradiation), no CO was produced by any of the following: (i) P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles, (i) Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl and P25, or (iii) Co III (cyclam)X/SiO 2 prepared by depositing the Co(III) complex on a fumed silica follow- ing the microwave synthesis.In addition, no CO formation was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm) which cannot activate P25 TiO 2 .Therefore, in this hybrid Co III (cyclam)X/TiO 2 system the surface Co(III) complex is the catalyst for CO 2 reduction while TiO 2 nanoparticles function as the light-harvesting support (Fig. 1). Further surface chemistry studies also indicate that CO 2 reduction occurs on the surface Co(III) sites.In the surface chemistry studies, a hybrid photocatalyst in the powder form was placed in a diffuse reflectance accessory and exposed to an atmosphere of CO 2 .Photocatalysis at the gas-surface interface was carried out in the absence of any solvent or TEOA.The photocatalyst surface was monitored with in situ infrared detection 54,55.At various stages during photocatalysis, difference FTIR spectra were obtained by subtracting spectra acquired prior to photocatalysis from corresponding spectra collected after UV irradiation.Therefore, the difference spectra provide information regarding changes on the photocatalyst surface upon light irradiation.The formation of CO was observed on surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, as indicated by the infrared bands at 2193 cm -1 in the spectra shown in Fig. 5 (a andb) 56.The formation of surface carbonate species (1720 cm -1 ) was also observed on these two samples.Negligible changes were observed on Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile during photocatalysis (Fig. 5c).The comparison shown in Fig. 5 is in excellent agreement with photocatalysis in the solution phase (Fig. 3).Under the same experimental conditions, surface CO species was not observed on bare P25 TiO 2 21, further confirming the key role of surface Co(III) sites in mediating CO 2 -reduction catalysis. These photocatalysis results clearly indicate photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band to the surface Co(III) catalyst for CO 2 reduction in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor.In our previous studies, reduction potentials of the Co III /Co II and Co II /Co I redox couples for Co III (cyclam)X were measured to be -0.21V and -0.93 V vs NHE, respectively 21.Therefore, photoexcited electrons in the TiO 2 conduction band (potential -0.6 V vs NHE at pH 7) 57 are not energetic enough to reduce Co(II) to Co(I) needed to catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion (-0.53 V vs. NHE).The exact driving force for the photoexcited electron transfer is unclear.However, we note that the reduction potential of Co II /Co I is largely dependent of coordination ligands.For example, the reduction potential of Co II /Co I for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl was -1.39 V vs NHE, in comparison to -0.93 V vs NHE for Co III (cyclam)X 21.The Ti O Co linkage in our hybrid photocatalysts (Fig. 1) and the presence of excess TEOA in reaction solutions could further alter the redox properties of the Co III (cyclam) unit on TiO 2 surfaces under photochemical conditions.The importance of such surface Ti O Co linkage is further described in the following spectroscopic and microscopic studies. As shown in Fig. 3, the hybrid photocatalyst prepared on the Rutile nanopowder demonstrated much lower activity than Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.In many photocatalytic applications using bare TiO 2 materials, the rutile phase is generally considered less active than the anatase phase due to more significant charge recombination in rutile 29.However, the particular Rutile nanopowder employed in our study is more active than the Anatase nanopowder in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (Fig. S3), despite its lower surface area.Therefore, the difference in charge carrier dynamics is not responsible for the observed difference in photocatalytic activity shown in Fig. 3. In the UV-vis spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, two broad absorptions are seen at 450 nm and 600 nm, indicating the presence of macrocyclic Co(III) complex (Fig. 6a andb) 21.However, these features are not distinguishable in the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 6c).Therefore, the state of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material is different from that on P25 and Anatase.Such difference might account for the observed photocatalytic activity displayed in Fig. 3. Furthermore, there is no significant amount of cobalt oxides, which would exhibit distinguishable peaks at 530, 595, and 655 nm 27, in the synthesized photocatalysts. In combination with UV-vis spectroscopic studies, microscopic investigation of the hybrid photocatalysts indicates that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Only TiO 2 nanoparticles are observed in the TEM images of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase (Fig. 7a andb).Close inspection of the TEM images indicates that no separate phase is present in either of these two samples.In comparison, amorphous, nano-sized particles are seen in the TEM image of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 7c).These particles are either attached to the Rutile nanoparticles (Fig. 7d) or form large aggregates (Fig. 8).Further comparison with the TEM image of bare Rutile confirms that these amorphous particles are Co III (cyclam)X in the solid state that formed during the synthesis of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile.

Hybrid photocatalysts were synthesized by a microwave method (Fig. 2).In a typical synthesis, 100 mg TiO 2 was mixed with 10 mg Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl and 65 l triethylamine in 15 ml acetonitrile.The presence of triethylamine was found to be essential for the successful deposition of the Co(III) catalyst on TiO 2 via reacting with surface Ti OH groups.The mixture in a capped reaction vessel was placed in a CEM Discover single-mode microwave reactor and underwent reaction for 120 min at 80 C.After the microwave reaction, the resulting brownish precipitate was recovered by centrifugation, and washed twice with chloroform and twice with ethanol.After drying at room temperature, the hybrid photocatalyst was obtained as a light brownish powder.Our previous results 21 clearly indicated that the molecular structure of Co III (cyclam) was retained upon deposition on TiO 2 surfaces, with some of the Cl ligands replaced by OH groups (Fig. 2).

In photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, 1 mg of photocatalyst in the powder form was dispersed in a 4.0-ml acetonitrile solution containing TEOA (acetonitrile: TEOA 3:1 v/v) in a Pyrex test tube.Prior to photocatalytic testing, the reaction solution was bubbled with CO 2 (99.999,Airgas) in the dark for 20 min.The reaction solution was then irradiated with a 200-W Hg lamp equipped with a water filter.Light intensity on the reaction solution was fixed at 100 mW/cm 2 .The head space above the reaction solution was sampled with a gas-tight syringe at different time intervals for product analysis using an Agilent 7820 GC equipped with a TCD detector.Production of formic acid in reaction solutions was monitored by NMR."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "The reaction solution was then irradiated with a 200-W Hg lamp equipped with a water filter.", "context": "Triethylamine (TEA, 99), triethanolamine (TEOA, 99), acetonitrile (99.999), hydrochloric acid (37), and 1,4,8,11tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam, 98) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.Methanol (99.9) was purchased from Fisher Scientific.Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate was obtained from J.T.

Hybrid photocatalysts were synthesized by a microwave method (Fig. 2).In a typical synthesis, 100 mg TiO 2 was mixed with 10 mg Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl and 65 l triethylamine in 15 ml acetonitrile.The presence of triethylamine was found to be essential for the successful deposition of the Co(III) catalyst on TiO 2 via reacting with surface Ti OH groups.The mixture in a capped reaction vessel was placed in a CEM Discover single-mode microwave reactor and underwent reaction for 120 min at 80 C.After the microwave reaction, the resulting brownish precipitate was recovered by centrifugation, and washed twice with chloroform and twice with ethanol.After drying at room temperature, the hybrid photocatalyst was obtained as a light brownish powder.Our previous results 21 clearly indicated that the molecular structure of Co III (cyclam) was retained upon deposition on TiO 2 surfaces, with some of the Cl ligands replaced by OH groups (Fig. 2). Following this microwave synthesis, three hybrid photocatalysts were prepared in the presence of P25, Anatase and Rutile TiO 2 nanomaterials.The three hybrid photocatalysts are denoted as Co III (cyclam)X/P25, Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile.Catalyst loadings were determined by elemental analysis to be 59, 63, and 88 mol Co per gram of Co III (cyclam)X/P25, Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile, respectively.The loadings were used to calculate turnover numbers (TONs) in photocatalysis.

Compared to molecular catalysts, semiconductor photocatalysts are relatively stable and inexpensive.However, multi-electron processes, including CO 2reduction catalysis, on TiO 2 surfaces are extremely inefficient due to recombination of photoexcited charge carriers (electrons and holes) 333435363738.Instead, efficient solar energy conversion has been achieved by surface functionalization of TiO 2 nanomaterials with coordination complexes such as Ru(II)-based dye molecules.In dye-sensitized solar cells 3940414243 and photosynthesis cells 444546474849, TiO 2 serves to accept photoexcited electrons from the surface coordination complexes upon interfacial electron transfer.The success of surface dye sensitization has inspired design of hybrid photocatalysts consisting of TiO 2 and surface molecular catalysts 24,25,50,51.In this study, we utilize TiO 2 as a solidstate photosensitizer for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl, which is as a molecular CO 2 -reduction catalyst based on an earth-abundant metal.This Co(III) complex demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity in reducing CO 2 to CO in the presence of molecular photosensitizers, including p-terphenyl, under UV irradiation 52,53. The three hybrid photocatalysts, Co III (cyclam)X/P25, Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile, were evaluated in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor.Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase exhibited very good activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, while negligible CO production was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 3).Hydrogen gas (CO/H 2 1) as a byproduct was produced using the hybrid photocatalysts. In our study, products in the gas phase were analyzed with a GC.Product detection in the solution phase by NMR indicated no significant production of formate after photocatalysis.In order to rule out the possibility of CO generation from carbon residues on the synthesized samples, products in the gas phase were also analyzed with FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotope labeling.Fig. 4 displays the FTIR spectrum of the head-space gases above a reaction solution after photocatalytic reduction of 13 CO 2 by Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under UV irradiation.In the spectrum, the rotational-vibrational band of gaseous 13 CO centered at 2096 cm -1 clearly confirms the production of CO from CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalyst. Under the experimental conditions employed in this study (TEOA, CO 2 atmosphere, and UV irradiation), no CO was produced by any of the following: (i) P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles, (i) Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl and P25, or (iii) Co III (cyclam)X/SiO 2 prepared by depositing the Co(III) complex on a fumed silica follow- ing the microwave synthesis.In addition, no CO formation was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm) which cannot activate P25 TiO 2 .Therefore, in this hybrid Co III (cyclam)X/TiO 2 system the surface Co(III) complex is the catalyst for CO 2 reduction while TiO 2 nanoparticles function as the light-harvesting support (Fig. 1). Further surface chemistry studies also indicate that CO 2 reduction occurs on the surface Co(III) sites.In the surface chemistry studies, a hybrid photocatalyst in the powder form was placed in a diffuse reflectance accessory and exposed to an atmosphere of CO 2 .Photocatalysis at the gas-surface interface was carried out in the absence of any solvent or TEOA.The photocatalyst surface was monitored with in situ infrared detection 54,55.At various stages during photocatalysis, difference FTIR spectra were obtained by subtracting spectra acquired prior to photocatalysis from corresponding spectra collected after UV irradiation.Therefore, the difference spectra provide information regarding changes on the photocatalyst surface upon light irradiation.The formation of CO was observed on surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, as indicated by the infrared bands at 2193 cm -1 in the spectra shown in Fig. 5 (a andb) 56.The formation of surface carbonate species (1720 cm -1 ) was also observed on these two samples.Negligible changes were observed on Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile during photocatalysis (Fig. 5c).The comparison shown in Fig. 5 is in excellent agreement with photocatalysis in the solution phase (Fig. 3).Under the same experimental conditions, surface CO species was not observed on bare P25 TiO 2 21, further confirming the key role of surface Co(III) sites in mediating CO 2 -reduction catalysis. These photocatalysis results clearly indicate photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band to the surface Co(III) catalyst for CO 2 reduction in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor.In our previous studies, reduction potentials of the Co III /Co II and Co II /Co I redox couples for Co III (cyclam)X were measured to be -0.21V and -0.93 V vs NHE, respectively 21.Therefore, photoexcited electrons in the TiO 2 conduction band (potential -0.6 V vs NHE at pH 7) 57 are not energetic enough to reduce Co(II) to Co(I) needed to catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion (-0.53 V vs. NHE).The exact driving force for the photoexcited electron transfer is unclear.However, we note that the reduction potential of Co II /Co I is largely dependent of coordination ligands.For example, the reduction potential of Co II /Co I for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl was -1.39 V vs NHE, in comparison to -0.93 V vs NHE for Co III (cyclam)X 21.The Ti O Co linkage in our hybrid photocatalysts (Fig. 1) and the presence of excess TEOA in reaction solutions could further alter the redox properties of the Co III (cyclam) unit on TiO 2 surfaces under photochemical conditions.The importance of such surface Ti O Co linkage is further described in the following spectroscopic and microscopic studies. As shown in Fig. 3, the hybrid photocatalyst prepared on the Rutile nanopowder demonstrated much lower activity than Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.In many photocatalytic applications using bare TiO 2 materials, the rutile phase is generally considered less active than the anatase phase due to more significant charge recombination in rutile 29.However, the particular Rutile nanopowder employed in our study is more active than the Anatase nanopowder in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (Fig. S3), despite its lower surface area.Therefore, the difference in charge carrier dynamics is not responsible for the observed difference in photocatalytic activity shown in Fig. 3. In the UV-vis spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, two broad absorptions are seen at 450 nm and 600 nm, indicating the presence of macrocyclic Co(III) complex (Fig. 6a andb) 21.However, these features are not distinguishable in the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 6c).Therefore, the state of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material is different from that on P25 and Anatase.Such difference might account for the observed photocatalytic activity displayed in Fig. 3. Furthermore, there is no significant amount of cobalt oxides, which would exhibit distinguishable peaks at 530, 595, and 655 nm 27, in the synthesized photocatalysts. In combination with UV-vis spectroscopic studies, microscopic investigation of the hybrid photocatalysts indicates that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Only TiO 2 nanoparticles are observed in the TEM images of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase (Fig. 7a andb).Close inspection of the TEM images indicates that no separate phase is present in either of these two samples.In comparison, amorphous, nano-sized particles are seen in the TEM image of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 7c).These particles are either attached to the Rutile nanoparticles (Fig. 7d) or form large aggregates (Fig. 8).Further comparison with the TEM image of bare Rutile confirms that these amorphous particles are Co III (cyclam)X in the solid state that formed during the synthesis of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile. Previously we have found that surface Ti OH groups are important for successful deposition of active Co(III) catalysts on TiO 2 nanoparticles via a reflux method 21.Similar results were obtained for the three hybrid photocatalysts prepared by the microwave method in this study.Infrared studies of the hybrid photocatalysts show that the Rutile surface lacks terminal Ti OH groups associated with a band at 3632 cm -1 (Fig. S4) for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X.According to the UV-vis and TEM results (Figs. 678), Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces but forms aggregates on Rutile.In the study by Petsi and co-workers 58, both bridging and terminal OH groups were found to be important for the deposition of Co(H 2 O) 6 2 on TiO 2 nanoparticles.In our study, the presence of terminal OH group associated with the infrared absorption at 3632 cm -1 is essential for the molecular deposition of catalytically active Co III (cyclam)X on P25 and Anatase surfaces via Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). Based on the specific surface areas of the TiO 2 nanomaterials and elemental analysis results, surface catalyst densities are estimated to be 6-7 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and 26 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile.These numbers further support our conclusion that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited on P25 and Anatase surfaces.The absence of terminal OH groups for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material resulted in the formation of Co III (cyclam)X in the aggregated form as observed in Figs.7 and8.The lack of sufficient Ti O Co linkages in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile can be used to explain inefficient photoexcited electron transfer from Rutile to surface Co III (cyclam)X, which led to its poor activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Fig. 3). An infrared band at 3670 cm -1 , associated with bridging Ti OH groups, is also present in the spectra of the three TiO 2 samples (Fig. S4).This infrared band disappeared in the spectra of the three hybrid photocatalysts, indicating that deposition of Co III (cyclam)X also occurred through reacting with the bridging Ti OH groups.However, comparison shown in Figs.4567suggests that catalyst deposition through these bridging Ti OH groups didn't allow photoexcited electron transfer from TiO 2 to surface Co III (cyclam)X. Characterization with EPR spectroscopy further supports the fact that surface cobalt sites exist in different states on Rutile than on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Although the Co(III) compound itself is EPR silent, some paramagnetic Co(II) species and radicals are present in the synthesized hybrid photocatalysts, as indicated by the following EPR results.This is similar to the study by Kohno and co-workers 59, in which paramagnetic Co(II) species were found to be trapped in single crystals of a Co(III) compound.The presence of paramagnetic Co(II) species is likely a consequence of the use of triethylamine in the synthesis of our hybrid photocatalysts. The EPR spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase are almost identical, except for a dark signal in the latter due to trace metal impurity in the Anatase nanopowder (Fig. S5).Therefore, the spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are chosen for comparison in this section.In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under N 2 (Fig. 9a, gray trace), resonances corresponding to mononuclear high-spin Co(II) (S 3/2) centers are observed at g x 5.89, g y 3.40, and g z 2.22 (not labeled).The same spectrum also contains resonances near g 2 (not labeled) that are associated with trapped electrons and holes 33,34 in P25 upon exposure to ambient light (Fig. S6).In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b, gray trace), however, a very different EPR spectrum is observed in the high-spin However the hyperfine splitting in this region of the spectrum is much smaller (86 G).The hyperfine splitting of Co(II) is usually in the range between 150 G and 300 G in the low-field region.The small hyperfine coupling and different saturation properties of the signal around g 2 from the one of high spin Co are consistent with the existence of surface radicals whose EPR transitions split into eight lines due to the presence of 59 Co in close proximity.Since the g value is 2, these transitions are mostly likely associated with oxygen-centered radicals.Close inspection of the spectra shows existence of three sets of eight-line splitting, suggesting the existence of three sets of oxygen-centered radicals with g 2.141, 2.028, and 2.019 (Fig. S7). Therefore, the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are in a broad range of coordination geometries different than those in Co III (cyclam)X/P25.Likely, oxygen molecules are coordinated to Co centers in the large aggregates of Co III (cyclam)X deposited on Rutile (Figs. 7 c andd and8), but not in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 or Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase where the Co sites are molecularly deposited on TiO 2 surfaces through Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). The adsorption of CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalysts was carried out by exposing the samples to CO 2 at room temperature and then freezing the samples at liquid He temperature prior to collecting EPR spectra.Binding of CO 2 to the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 shifted the high-spin signal from g x 5.89 to g x 5.67 (Fig. 9a).The comparison between the Co(II) resonances observed for Co III (cyclam)X/P25 is very similar to that between Co(II) sites in zeolite frameworks without and with calcinations at elevated temperatures 60,61.In particular, a Co(II) signal around g x 5.80 was observed in the EPR spectrum of a cobalt-containing microporous aluminophosphate.The Co(II) signal shifted to g x 5.44 upon calcination of the microporous material, which induced changes in the coordination geometry of the Co(II) accompanied with shortening of Co O bond 60.Therefore, our observation indicates that CO 2 upon adsorption on Co III (cyclam)X/P25 took electron density away from the Co(II) centers, either directly or indirectly by interacting with neighboring Ti(IV) sites shifting the g value towards higher fields.In Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b), binding of CO 2 did not change the high-spin Co(II) signal at g x 5.35.Instead, the hyperfine splitting of the oxygen radicals vanished and an anisotropic signal appeared near g 2 (not labeled).This observation implies that the electron density on the oxygen radicals adjacent to Co(II) was preferentially transferred to CO 2 and adsorption of CO 2 , in fact, removed electron exchange of Co(II) with oxygen atoms on the Rutile surface. The results shown in Fig. 8 provide important insights regarding the coordination geometry of Co(II) centers as well as interaction of CO 2 with the surface Co(II) sites.Most likely, the coordination geometry of surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile is also different than that in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.Further studies are underway to probe CO 2 reduction under photochemical conditions with EPR spectroscopy."}, {"llm generation": "ambient light", "source": "The same spectrum also contains resonances near g 2 (not labeled) that are associated with trapped electrons and holes 33,34 in P25 upon exposure to ambient light (Fig. S6).", "context": "Heterogeneous photocatalysts based on TiO 2 materials have been extensively investigated in CO 2 reduction since the early work by Inoue and co-workers 2829303132.

These photocatalysis results clearly indicate photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band to the surface Co(III) catalyst for CO 2 reduction in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor.In our previous studies, reduction potentials of the Co III /Co II and Co II /Co I redox couples for Co III (cyclam)X were measured to be -0.21V and -0.93 V vs NHE, respectively 21.Therefore, photoexcited electrons in the TiO 2 conduction band (potential -0.6 V vs NHE at pH 7) 57 are not energetic enough to reduce Co(II) to Co(I) needed to catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion (-0.53 V vs. NHE).The exact driving force for the photoexcited electron transfer is unclear.However, we note that the reduction potential of Co II /Co I is largely dependent of coordination ligands.For example, the reduction potential of Co II /Co I for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl was -1.39 V vs NHE, in comparison to -0.93 V vs NHE for Co III (cyclam)X 21.The Ti O Co linkage in our hybrid photocatalysts (Fig. 1) and the presence of excess TEOA in reaction solutions could further alter the redox properties of the Co III (cyclam) unit on TiO 2 surfaces under photochemical conditions.The importance of such surface Ti O Co linkage is further described in the following spectroscopic and microscopic studies. As shown in Fig. 3, the hybrid photocatalyst prepared on the Rutile nanopowder demonstrated much lower activity than Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.In many photocatalytic applications using bare TiO 2 materials, the rutile phase is generally considered less active than the anatase phase due to more significant charge recombination in rutile 29.However, the particular Rutile nanopowder employed in our study is more active than the Anatase nanopowder in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (Fig. S3), despite its lower surface area.Therefore, the difference in charge carrier dynamics is not responsible for the observed difference in photocatalytic activity shown in Fig. 3.

Based on the specific surface areas of the TiO 2 nanomaterials and elemental analysis results, surface catalyst densities are estimated to be 6-7 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and 26 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile.These numbers further support our conclusion that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited on P25 and Anatase surfaces.The absence of terminal OH groups for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material resulted in the formation of Co III (cyclam)X in the aggregated form as observed in Figs.7 and8.The lack of sufficient Ti O Co linkages in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile can be used to explain inefficient photoexcited electron transfer from Rutile to surface Co III (cyclam)X, which led to its poor activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Fig. 3). An infrared band at 3670 cm -1 , associated with bridging Ti OH groups, is also present in the spectra of the three TiO 2 samples (Fig. S4).This infrared band disappeared in the spectra of the three hybrid photocatalysts, indicating that deposition of Co III (cyclam)X also occurred through reacting with the bridging Ti OH groups.However, comparison shown in Figs.4567suggests that catalyst deposition through these bridging Ti OH groups didn't allow photoexcited electron transfer from TiO 2 to surface Co III (cyclam)X. Characterization with EPR spectroscopy further supports the fact that surface cobalt sites exist in different states on Rutile than on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Although the Co(III) compound itself is EPR silent, some paramagnetic Co(II) species and radicals are present in the synthesized hybrid photocatalysts, as indicated by the following EPR results.This is similar to the study by Kohno and co-workers 59, in which paramagnetic Co(II) species were found to be trapped in single crystals of a Co(III) compound.The presence of paramagnetic Co(II) species is likely a consequence of the use of triethylamine in the synthesis of our hybrid photocatalysts. The EPR spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase are almost identical, except for a dark signal in the latter due to trace metal impurity in the Anatase nanopowder (Fig. S5).Therefore, the spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are chosen for comparison in this section.In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under N 2 (Fig. 9a, gray trace), resonances corresponding to mononuclear high-spin Co(II) (S 3/2) centers are observed at g x 5.89, g y 3.40, and g z 2.22 (not labeled).The same spectrum also contains resonances near g 2 (not labeled) that are associated with trapped electrons and holes 33,34 in P25 upon exposure to ambient light (Fig. S6).In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b, gray trace), however, a very different EPR spectrum is observed in the high-spin However the hyperfine splitting in this region of the spectrum is much smaller (86 G).The hyperfine splitting of Co(II) is usually in the range between 150 G and 300 G in the low-field region.The small hyperfine coupling and different saturation properties of the signal around g 2 from the one of high spin Co are consistent with the existence of surface radicals whose EPR transitions split into eight lines due to the presence of 59 Co in close proximity.Since the g value is 2, these transitions are mostly likely associated with oxygen-centered radicals.Close inspection of the spectra shows existence of three sets of eight-line splitting, suggesting the existence of three sets of oxygen-centered radicals with g 2.141, 2.028, and 2.019 (Fig. S7). Therefore, the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are in a broad range of coordination geometries different than those in Co III (cyclam)X/P25.Likely, oxygen molecules are coordinated to Co centers in the large aggregates of Co III (cyclam)X deposited on Rutile (Figs. 7 c andd and8), but not in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 or Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase where the Co sites are molecularly deposited on TiO 2 surfaces through Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). The adsorption of CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalysts was carried out by exposing the samples to CO 2 at room temperature and then freezing the samples at liquid He temperature prior to collecting EPR spectra.Binding of CO 2 to the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 shifted the high-spin signal from g x 5.89 to g x 5.67 (Fig. 9a).The comparison between the Co(II) resonances observed for Co III (cyclam)X/P25 is very similar to that between Co(II) sites in zeolite frameworks without and with calcinations at elevated temperatures 60,61.In particular, a Co(II) signal around g x 5.80 was observed in the EPR spectrum of a cobalt-containing microporous aluminophosphate.The Co(II) signal shifted to g x 5.44 upon calcination of the microporous material, which induced changes in the coordination geometry of the Co(II) accompanied with shortening of Co O bond 60.Therefore, our observation indicates that CO 2 upon adsorption on Co III (cyclam)X/P25 took electron density away from the Co(II) centers, either directly or indirectly by interacting with neighboring Ti(IV) sites shifting the g value towards higher fields.In Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b), binding of CO 2 did not change the high-spin Co(II) signal at g x 5.35.Instead, the hyperfine splitting of the oxygen radicals vanished and an anisotropic signal appeared near g 2 (not labeled).This observation implies that the electron density on the oxygen radicals adjacent to Co(II) was preferentially transferred to CO 2 and adsorption of CO 2 , in fact, removed electron exchange of Co(II) with oxygen atoms on the Rutile surface. The results shown in Fig. 8 provide important insights regarding the coordination geometry of Co(II) centers as well as interaction of CO 2 with the surface Co(II) sites.Most likely, the coordination geometry of surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile is also different than that in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.Further studies are underway to probe CO 2 reduction under photochemical conditions with EPR spectroscopy."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Mercury", "source": "The reaction solution was then irradiated with a 200-W Hg lamp equipped with a water filter.", "context": "Triethylamine (TEA, 99), triethanolamine (TEOA, 99), acetonitrile (99.999), hydrochloric acid (37), and 1,4,8,11tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam, 98) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.Methanol (99.9) was purchased from Fisher Scientific.Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate was obtained from J.T.

Compared to molecular catalysts, semiconductor photocatalysts are relatively stable and inexpensive.However, multi-electron processes, including CO 2reduction catalysis, on TiO 2 surfaces are extremely inefficient due to recombination of photoexcited charge carriers (electrons and holes) 333435363738.Instead, efficient solar energy conversion has been achieved by surface functionalization of TiO 2 nanomaterials with coordination complexes such as Ru(II)-based dye molecules.In dye-sensitized solar cells 3940414243 and photosynthesis cells 444546474849, TiO 2 serves to accept photoexcited electrons from the surface coordination complexes upon interfacial electron transfer.The success of surface dye sensitization has inspired design of hybrid photocatalysts consisting of TiO 2 and surface molecular catalysts 24,25,50,51.In this study, we utilize TiO 2 as a solidstate photosensitizer for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl, which is as a molecular CO 2 -reduction catalyst based on an earth-abundant metal.This Co(III) complex demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity in reducing CO 2 to CO in the presence of molecular photosensitizers, including p-terphenyl, under UV irradiation 52,53. The three hybrid photocatalysts, Co III (cyclam)X/P25, Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile, were evaluated in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor.Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase exhibited very good activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, while negligible CO production was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 3).Hydrogen gas (CO/H 2 1) as a byproduct was produced using the hybrid photocatalysts. In our study, products in the gas phase were analyzed with a GC.Product detection in the solution phase by NMR indicated no significant production of formate after photocatalysis.In order to rule out the possibility of CO generation from carbon residues on the synthesized samples, products in the gas phase were also analyzed with FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotope labeling.Fig. 4 displays the FTIR spectrum of the head-space gases above a reaction solution after photocatalytic reduction of 13 CO 2 by Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under UV irradiation.In the spectrum, the rotational-vibrational band of gaseous 13 CO centered at 2096 cm -1 clearly confirms the production of CO from CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalyst. Under the experimental conditions employed in this study (TEOA, CO 2 atmosphere, and UV irradiation), no CO was produced by any of the following: (i) P25 TiO 2 nanoparticles, (i) Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl and P25, or (iii) Co III (cyclam)X/SiO 2 prepared by depositing the Co(III) complex on a fumed silica follow- ing the microwave synthesis.In addition, no CO formation was observed using Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under visible-light irradiation ( 420 nm) which cannot activate P25 TiO 2 .Therefore, in this hybrid Co III (cyclam)X/TiO 2 system the surface Co(III) complex is the catalyst for CO 2 reduction while TiO 2 nanoparticles function as the light-harvesting support (Fig. 1). Further surface chemistry studies also indicate that CO 2 reduction occurs on the surface Co(III) sites.In the surface chemistry studies, a hybrid photocatalyst in the powder form was placed in a diffuse reflectance accessory and exposed to an atmosphere of CO 2 .Photocatalysis at the gas-surface interface was carried out in the absence of any solvent or TEOA.The photocatalyst surface was monitored with in situ infrared detection 54,55.At various stages during photocatalysis, difference FTIR spectra were obtained by subtracting spectra acquired prior to photocatalysis from corresponding spectra collected after UV irradiation.Therefore, the difference spectra provide information regarding changes on the photocatalyst surface upon light irradiation.The formation of CO was observed on surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, as indicated by the infrared bands at 2193 cm -1 in the spectra shown in Fig. 5 (a andb) 56.The formation of surface carbonate species (1720 cm -1 ) was also observed on these two samples.Negligible changes were observed on Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile during photocatalysis (Fig. 5c).The comparison shown in Fig. 5 is in excellent agreement with photocatalysis in the solution phase (Fig. 3).Under the same experimental conditions, surface CO species was not observed on bare P25 TiO 2 21, further confirming the key role of surface Co(III) sites in mediating CO 2 -reduction catalysis. These photocatalysis results clearly indicate photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band to the surface Co(III) catalyst for CO 2 reduction in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor.In our previous studies, reduction potentials of the Co III /Co II and Co II /Co I redox couples for Co III (cyclam)X were measured to be -0.21V and -0.93 V vs NHE, respectively 21.Therefore, photoexcited electrons in the TiO 2 conduction band (potential -0.6 V vs NHE at pH 7) 57 are not energetic enough to reduce Co(II) to Co(I) needed to catalyze CO 2 -to-CO conversion (-0.53 V vs. NHE).The exact driving force for the photoexcited electron transfer is unclear.However, we note that the reduction potential of Co II /Co I is largely dependent of coordination ligands.For example, the reduction potential of Co II /Co I for Co(cyclam)Cl 2 Cl was -1.39 V vs NHE, in comparison to -0.93 V vs NHE for Co III (cyclam)X 21.The Ti O Co linkage in our hybrid photocatalysts (Fig. 1) and the presence of excess TEOA in reaction solutions could further alter the redox properties of the Co III (cyclam) unit on TiO 2 surfaces under photochemical conditions.The importance of such surface Ti O Co linkage is further described in the following spectroscopic and microscopic studies. As shown in Fig. 3, the hybrid photocatalyst prepared on the Rutile nanopowder demonstrated much lower activity than Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.In many photocatalytic applications using bare TiO 2 materials, the rutile phase is generally considered less active than the anatase phase due to more significant charge recombination in rutile 29.However, the particular Rutile nanopowder employed in our study is more active than the Anatase nanopowder in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (Fig. S3), despite its lower surface area.Therefore, the difference in charge carrier dynamics is not responsible for the observed difference in photocatalytic activity shown in Fig. 3. In the UV-vis spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, two broad absorptions are seen at 450 nm and 600 nm, indicating the presence of macrocyclic Co(III) complex (Fig. 6a andb) 21.However, these features are not distinguishable in the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 6c).Therefore, the state of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material is different from that on P25 and Anatase.Such difference might account for the observed photocatalytic activity displayed in Fig. 3. Furthermore, there is no significant amount of cobalt oxides, which would exhibit distinguishable peaks at 530, 595, and 655 nm 27, in the synthesized photocatalysts. In combination with UV-vis spectroscopic studies, microscopic investigation of the hybrid photocatalysts indicates that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Only TiO 2 nanoparticles are observed in the TEM images of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase (Fig. 7a andb).Close inspection of the TEM images indicates that no separate phase is present in either of these two samples.In comparison, amorphous, nano-sized particles are seen in the TEM image of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 7c).These particles are either attached to the Rutile nanoparticles (Fig. 7d) or form large aggregates (Fig. 8).Further comparison with the TEM image of bare Rutile confirms that these amorphous particles are Co III (cyclam)X in the solid state that formed during the synthesis of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile. Previously we have found that surface Ti OH groups are important for successful deposition of active Co(III) catalysts on TiO 2 nanoparticles via a reflux method 21.Similar results were obtained for the three hybrid photocatalysts prepared by the microwave method in this study.Infrared studies of the hybrid photocatalysts show that the Rutile surface lacks terminal Ti OH groups associated with a band at 3632 cm -1 (Fig. S4) for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X.According to the UV-vis and TEM results (Figs. 678), Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited as a thin layer on P25 and Anatase surfaces but forms aggregates on Rutile.In the study by Petsi and co-workers 58, both bridging and terminal OH groups were found to be important for the deposition of Co(H 2 O) 6 2 on TiO 2 nanoparticles.In our study, the presence of terminal OH group associated with the infrared absorption at 3632 cm -1 is essential for the molecular deposition of catalytically active Co III (cyclam)X on P25 and Anatase surfaces via Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). Based on the specific surface areas of the TiO 2 nanomaterials and elemental analysis results, surface catalyst densities are estimated to be 6-7 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase, and 26 Co per nm 2 surface area in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile.These numbers further support our conclusion that Co III (cyclam)X is molecularly deposited on P25 and Anatase surfaces.The absence of terminal OH groups for effective deposition of Co III (cyclam)X on the Rutile material resulted in the formation of Co III (cyclam)X in the aggregated form as observed in Figs.7 and8.The lack of sufficient Ti O Co linkages in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile can be used to explain inefficient photoexcited electron transfer from Rutile to surface Co III (cyclam)X, which led to its poor activity in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (Fig. 3). An infrared band at 3670 cm -1 , associated with bridging Ti OH groups, is also present in the spectra of the three TiO 2 samples (Fig. S4).This infrared band disappeared in the spectra of the three hybrid photocatalysts, indicating that deposition of Co III (cyclam)X also occurred through reacting with the bridging Ti OH groups.However, comparison shown in Figs.4567suggests that catalyst deposition through these bridging Ti OH groups didn't allow photoexcited electron transfer from TiO 2 to surface Co III (cyclam)X. Characterization with EPR spectroscopy further supports the fact that surface cobalt sites exist in different states on Rutile than on P25 and Anatase surfaces.Although the Co(III) compound itself is EPR silent, some paramagnetic Co(II) species and radicals are present in the synthesized hybrid photocatalysts, as indicated by the following EPR results.This is similar to the study by Kohno and co-workers 59, in which paramagnetic Co(II) species were found to be trapped in single crystals of a Co(III) compound.The presence of paramagnetic Co(II) species is likely a consequence of the use of triethylamine in the synthesis of our hybrid photocatalysts. The EPR spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase are almost identical, except for a dark signal in the latter due to trace metal impurity in the Anatase nanopowder (Fig. S5).Therefore, the spectra of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are chosen for comparison in this section.In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/P25 under N 2 (Fig. 9a, gray trace), resonances corresponding to mononuclear high-spin Co(II) (S 3/2) centers are observed at g x 5.89, g y 3.40, and g z 2.22 (not labeled).The same spectrum also contains resonances near g 2 (not labeled) that are associated with trapped electrons and holes 33,34 in P25 upon exposure to ambient light (Fig. S6).In the spectrum of Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b, gray trace), however, a very different EPR spectrum is observed in the high-spin However the hyperfine splitting in this region of the spectrum is much smaller (86 G).The hyperfine splitting of Co(II) is usually in the range between 150 G and 300 G in the low-field region.The small hyperfine coupling and different saturation properties of the signal around g 2 from the one of high spin Co are consistent with the existence of surface radicals whose EPR transitions split into eight lines due to the presence of 59 Co in close proximity.Since the g value is 2, these transitions are mostly likely associated with oxygen-centered radicals.Close inspection of the spectra shows existence of three sets of eight-line splitting, suggesting the existence of three sets of oxygen-centered radicals with g 2.141, 2.028, and 2.019 (Fig. S7). Therefore, the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile are in a broad range of coordination geometries different than those in Co III (cyclam)X/P25.Likely, oxygen molecules are coordinated to Co centers in the large aggregates of Co III (cyclam)X deposited on Rutile (Figs. 7 c andd and8), but not in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 or Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase where the Co sites are molecularly deposited on TiO 2 surfaces through Ti O Co linkages (Fig. 1). The adsorption of CO 2 on the hybrid photocatalysts was carried out by exposing the samples to CO 2 at room temperature and then freezing the samples at liquid He temperature prior to collecting EPR spectra.Binding of CO 2 to the Co(II) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 shifted the high-spin signal from g x 5.89 to g x 5.67 (Fig. 9a).The comparison between the Co(II) resonances observed for Co III (cyclam)X/P25 is very similar to that between Co(II) sites in zeolite frameworks without and with calcinations at elevated temperatures 60,61.In particular, a Co(II) signal around g x 5.80 was observed in the EPR spectrum of a cobalt-containing microporous aluminophosphate.The Co(II) signal shifted to g x 5.44 upon calcination of the microporous material, which induced changes in the coordination geometry of the Co(II) accompanied with shortening of Co O bond 60.Therefore, our observation indicates that CO 2 upon adsorption on Co III (cyclam)X/P25 took electron density away from the Co(II) centers, either directly or indirectly by interacting with neighboring Ti(IV) sites shifting the g value towards higher fields.In Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile (Fig. 9b), binding of CO 2 did not change the high-spin Co(II) signal at g x 5.35.Instead, the hyperfine splitting of the oxygen radicals vanished and an anisotropic signal appeared near g 2 (not labeled).This observation implies that the electron density on the oxygen radicals adjacent to Co(II) was preferentially transferred to CO 2 and adsorption of CO 2 , in fact, removed electron exchange of Co(II) with oxygen atoms on the Rutile surface. The results shown in Fig. 8 provide important insights regarding the coordination geometry of Co(II) centers as well as interaction of CO 2 with the surface Co(II) sites.Most likely, the coordination geometry of surface Co(III) sites in Co III (cyclam)X/Rutile is also different than that in Co III (cyclam)X/P25 and Co III (cyclam)X/Anatase.Further studies are underway to probe CO 2 reduction under photochemical conditions with EPR spectroscopy."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "In photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, 1 mg of photocatalyst in the powder form was dispersed in a 4.0-ml acetonitrile solution containing TEOA (acetonitrile: TEOA 3:1 v/v) in a Pyrex test tube.", "context": "Triethylamine (TEA, 99), triethanolamine (TEOA, 99), acetonitrile (99.999), hydrochloric acid (37), and 1,4,8,11tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam, 98) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.Methanol (99.9) was purchased from Fisher Scientific.Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate was obtained from J.T.
