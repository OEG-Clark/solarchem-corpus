Immobilization of ZnO particles on stainless steel meshes was done using a simple and efficient method which is ideal for industrial applications.This technique was originally developed by scientists at Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECN) for deposition of TiO 2 on quartz slides to prepare solar cells 38.Previously stainless steel has been reported to be used as a support for TiO 2 nanoparticles 34,39,40, which was selected here because of its large surface area, good ventilation for gases passing and its resistance to various corrosions.For coating support with zinc oxide, different amount of ZnO powder (5, 6.5 and 8 g) was added to 60 mL ethanol and stirred for 1 h.Ethanol was selected as solvent due to good dispersion of ZnO in a cloud-shape manner.Then, 20 mL of dilute nitric acid with a pH of 3.5 was added drop wise to slurry in order to supply a suitable acidity media in which the slurry becomes uniform and stable. The meshes were earlier shaped in cylindrical form and cleaned with hydrochloric acid (0.01 M), acetone and distilled water to remove any organic and inorganic attached materials or adsorbed on surface and dried under atmospheric conditions.To coat ZnO on stainless steel meshes with area of 415 cm 2 , the meshes were immersed for 1 min in 80 mL well dispersed slurry that was prepared by stirring for at least 60 min.Then the mesh was dried for 12 h at 120 1C.Finally, ZnO coated mesh was calcinated at 350 1C for 30 min.Amounts of coated ZnO which are directly dependent on slurry concentration in immersion step were 0.37, 0.7 and 1.1 g, when 5, 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO were used in slurry preparation, respectively. The XRD patterns of samples were recorded using EQUINOX diffractometer (Inel Company) operating with a Cu anode and a sealed X-ray tube.Also, in order to probe ZnO coated on the surface of stainless steel meshes, scanning electron microscope (SEM, Philips, XL30, Netherland) was utilized.A Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode-array UV-vis spectrophotometer equipped with a 1.0 mm path length quartz micro-cell.In addition, quantitative determination of photocatalyst products was determined by using on-line commercial gas chromatograph GC-CGCA-1 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was recorded using MB160 FTIR spectrometer (ABB Bomem Inc., Canada) with a special designed cell to characterize photoreduction products in gas phase. In order to assess the photoreduction ability of the prepared catalysts, conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 , under UV illumination was carried out in a self-designed photocatalytic reactor.The photoreactor was constructed from glossy stainless steel with an effective volume of about 1000 mL.Usage of glossy stainless steel metal inhibit the gas and carbonaceous residues adsorption into the reactor.Also, to ensure removal of adsorbing CO 2 and other surface species, before each experiment, a cycle of heating to 85 1C and then flushing with hydrogen are used 41.The schematic of experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1.The stainless steel mesh coated with ZnO (mesh substrate area of 450 cm 2 ) was located in the reactor and UV lamp was placed in center of reactor to direct irradiation on the catalyst surface.The photoreactor, comprised of coated titanium dioxide over the mesh was assembled to transmit and spread light uniformly.In order to reduce water interference, the reactor was vacuumed and He was passed before entering CO 2 and CH 4 to the photoreactor, and then the photoreactor was filled by gaseous feed (CO 2 , CH 4 and He).Following that, it is illuminated by UV lamp for maximum 5 h continuously and products were analyzed through on-line GC.The photocatalytic activity was calculated on the basis of CO 2 and CH 4 conversions, formulated as follows: where (CO 2 i and CH 4 i ) and (CO 2 and CH 4 ) are the concentration of CO 2 and CH 4 in the beginning and different time of the reaction, respectively. In the present study D-optimal, which is a widely used form of RSM was applied for optimization and comparison of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and CH 4 .The MODDE 8.02 software from Umetric (Ume a, Sweden) was employed to fit the polynomial model to the independent variables and optimization of it using RSM.Subsequently, the adequacy of the model was tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA).Calculated factors correctly recognize significance of main effects, interactions between factors and the produced model.The significance level was identified by F-test method.The calculated F-values are compared with critical values of F 0 at 95 confidence limit that presented in statistical tables."}, {"llm generation": "ZnO", "source": "It can be concluded that the calcinated ZnO photocatalyst had a broad absorption band from ultraviolet to visible region and the maximum absorption peak was found at 387 nm.", "context": "The ZnO particles were coated on mesh by a simple and inexpensive method.For suitable immobilization and increasing durability of ZnO on the support, particles were calcinated after coating on the mesh surface.The optimum calcination temperature (350 1C) was selected from literature 42,43.It is reported that size of the particles were reduced by calcination method 42, which can increase surface area of catalyst.The calcination leads to decreasing agglomeration and uniform distribution of particles and therefore, increases the active surface of catalysts 36. The catalyst coated mesh showed a very good mechanical stability.Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the calcinated ZnO and commercial ZnO at room temperature.The absorption of UV-vis light is an important factor for the evolution of photocatalyst properties 37.It can be seen that calcination leads to improvement of UV-visible absorption intensity of the calcinated photocatalysts.Also, calcinations cause a little shifting of absorption peak to visible area.It can be concluded that the calcinated ZnO photocatalyst had a broad absorption band from ultraviolet to visible region and the maximum absorption peak was found at 387 nm.However, before calcinations, the commercial ZnO showed weaker absorption in the whole region.Also, the SEM images of surface structure of the commercial and calcinated ZnO is shown in Fig. 3.The comparison of calcinated ZnO structure (Fig. 3(a)) with commercial ZnO (Fig. 3(b)) shows that no significant differences were observed in agglomeration and particle size by calcination technique. On the basis of the maximum absorption wave, the band gap of the prepared calcinated ZnO photocatalyst can be estimated to 3.204 eV (Eq.( 3)), where E bg is the band-gap energy of the photocatalyst and l is the maximum wavelength in nanometer 36. For investigating the quality of coatings from the structural aspect, i.e. whether or not ZnO crystals have found obvious changes in structural properties and crystallite size during the calcination process, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the coated samples were assessed.The coated samples have been removed from mesh surface and grinded into fine powder before introducing to the XRD analyzer.Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of ZnO photocatalysts before and after calcination.The XRD results did not show any significant changes in the structure of ZnO as a consequence of the calcination and coating processes.It was concluded that calcination process did not have significant influence on crystalline morphologies of ZnO particles.No perceptible impurities can be recognized in the graphs.This is important for the stainless steel mesh coating, since iron impurities caused by heating the steel could have a negative effect on the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst.Fe 3 ions have been reported to be present in TiO 2 coated steel plates heated at 600 1C and more, but not at lower temperatures 44.As shown in Fig. 4, no new peak related to impurities was observed, indicating that the selected calcination temperature (350 1C) did not affect the crystal phase of ZnO and used iron alloy as support. Morphology of the prepared catalysts and stainless steel mesh were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The images were used to show how photocatalysts were coated on/in mesh network.As shown in Fig. 5, ZnO particles were immobilized in a uniform state between woven fabrics of mesh when zinc oxide slurry was containing 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO particles.However, amount of coating is low and insufficient at 5 g ZnO.Amount of immobilized ZnO on the surface of support was 0.37, 0.7 and 1.1 g when 5, 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO were used in slurry preparation, respectively. In order to evaluate the influence of operating parameters on the photocatalytic reduction efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 , totally 22 experiments with four main factors were performed.Amount of ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes (g/cm 2 ) (X 1 ), total pressure of feed (psi) (X 2 ), CO 2 :CH 4 :He feed ratio () (X 3 ) and UV light power (W) (X 4 ) were chosen as the experimental parameters, while the responses were CO 2 and CH 4 conversion.The experimental ranges and levels of the independent variables for photoreduction of CO 2 and CH 4 are given in Table 1.The UV-lamp power parameter was defined as a multilevel due to only available commercial UV lamp (was with power of 80, 125 and 250 W).Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the extreme values of the variables. Statistical combinations of the independent variables with the measured and predicted yield (after 5 h of irradiation) are described in Table 2.The following second-order polynomial response equation was used to correlate the dependent and independent variables: where Y shows the response variable of conversion efficiency.The b i presents regression coefficient for linear effects; b ij is the regression coefficients for interaction terms between x i and x j , b ii is coefficient for quadratic effects, and x i is the symbol of coded experimental levels of the variables.After fitting the obtained data for each parameter with the above experiments to full second-order models, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the models were performed and the models significance were examined 45.Since the full second-order models (models containing all two parameter interactions) were not accepted by the required tests, they were improved by elimination of the models terms until the determined conditions were fulfilled. While using the obtained results, an empirical relationship between the response and independent variables was achieved and expressed by the following second-order polynomial Experimental ranges and levels of the independent test variables. Ranges and levels Predicted photocatalytic conversion efficiencies by Eqs. ( 5) and ( 6) are presented in Table 2.The obtained results show well agreements between the experimental and predicted values of photocatalytic conversion efficiency.Comparison of the experimental results and the predicted values obtained from the model (Eqs.( 5) and ( 6)) showed that the predicted values reasonably well matched the experimental values with R 2 140.99 and R 2 140.984 for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion, respectively.This indicates that 99 and 98.4 of the variations for CO 2 and CH 4 percent, conversion efficiencies are described by the models.R 2 Adj is also a measure of goodness of a fit, but it is more appropriate for comparing models with different numbers of independent variables.If there are some additional terms in the model, Adj-R 2 may be visibly smaller than R 2 46,47.In this case, Adj-R 2 values for CO 2 and CH 4 (0.973, 0.972) were close to the related R 2 value (Table 3). Table 3 shows the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the obtained models.The F-value obtained for CO2 and CH 4 are 58.68 and 82.38 respectively, which is clearly greater than the tabulated F (5.94 at 99 significance for CO 2 and 4.41 at 99 significance for CH 4 ) confirming the adequacy of the model fits.The P-values of CO 2 and CH 4 conversion efficiency model parameters are given in Table 4.As can be seen, all of the considered parameters are significant and should be contained in the model.Also, the good agreement between the predicted and actual experimental values indicates that the models can predict the phenomena well (Table 4). The most significant parameters for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion is feed ratio (X 3 ) followed by total pressure (X 2 ).Whereas UV light power (X 4 ) and catalyst (X 1 ) have less importance among the four single parameters.On the other hand, CO 2 conversion efficiency is affected by quadratic (X 4 A X 4 , X 3 A X 3 , X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions While, CH 4 conversion is affected by quadratic (X 3 A X 3 and X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions (X 1 A X 2 , X 1 A X 4 , and X 2 A X 4 ). The response surface plot of photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 are shown in Figs. 6 and7, respectively.The maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.Also, the maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh. The photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO 2 slightly increases with increasing the UV light power (Fig. 6(a)).Higher light intensity provides higher energy for more ZnO particles to produce electron-hole pairs 48.As shown in Fig. 2 related to UV-visible spectra of calcinated zinc oxide, band gap of ZnO is high and needs high intensity light for excitation of electrons.CO 2 conversion efficiency increased by decreasing total pressure and feed ratio (Fig. 6(b)).At the higher pressure, conversion efficiency reduced due to high concentration of target molecules to react with the photocatalytic produced radicals.In addition, amount of conversion reduced in high ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 .It can be attributed to more stability of CO 2 related to CH 4 in reaction with active radicals.Also, CO 2 photocatalytic conversion increased with increasing ZnO due to increase in active surface of the photocatalyst (Fig. 6(c)).However, more increasing of coated ZnO from 8 g does not affect the conversion efficiency because of nonincreasing of photocatalyst surface and overlapping of formed catalyst layer. The maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh (Fig. 7).Conversion of methane increases by decreasing the pressure and increasing UV intensity (Fig. 7(a)).However, amount of CH 4 conversion is higher than CO 2 due to low stability and direct conversion of CH 4 as well as reductant role of it, in the presence of carbon dioxide.By increasing the CO 2 amount, conversion efficiency of CH 4 improves (Fig. 7(b)).High concentration of carbon dioxide prompts the reaction rate and leads to the decrease in CH 4 concentration, which acts as a reductant.Amount of conversion of both CO 2 and CH 4 is high in low pressure.The photogenerated radicals are not able to convert high concentration of the gasses to new products due to reduction of effective strike and interaction among photogenerated radicals and components.Increasing the amount of coated ZnO on mesh causes improvement in conversion efficiency due to increasing active sites (Fig. 7(c)).Also, CH 4 conversion was improved by decreasing pressure. The requested aim in terms of conversion efficiency was defined as ''maximize'' to attain highest treatment performance.As presented in Table 5, optimum condition of parameter values were predicted by the model with 8 g ZnO (2.65 mg/cm 2 ), 30 psi, (10 CO 2 :80 CH 4 :10 He) and 250 W. Also, the optimum values of the process variables for the maximum CH 4 conversion efficiency were 2.65 mg/cm 2 , 80 psi, (10:80:10) and 250 power light.At these optimum values, the predicted and observed conversion efficiency () were 12.5 and 11.9 for CO 2 and 15.7, and 15.2 for CH 4 , respectively.It implies that the strategy to optimize the conversion conditions and obtaining the maximal conversion efficiency by RSM for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 in this study is successful. Direct conversion of methane and carbon dioxide to oxygenated compounds was carried out over immobilized ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes.The conversion products were characterized using FTIR to identify photoconversion products in gas phase (Fig. 8).For gas feed, only three distinct peaks were observed.The peaks at 1303 cm A 1 (Fig. 8(a)) and 3016 cm A 1 correspond to the C-H stretch in methane 8, and 2360 cm A 1 peak (Fig. 8(b)) correspond to the OQCQO stretch in carbon dioxide 49.No other peaks were observed, indicating that no reaction occurred between CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of ZnO without irradiation.However, some spectral changes were detected after photoirradiation of coated ZnO in the presence of CO 2 and CH 4 .These results are very close to those observed for CO 2 adsorption and strong C-H peaks appeared on Cu-Co based catalysts 8.Also, the IR spectra of methane and carbon dioxide absorbed on Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 samples showed that the methane absorbed on the coupled semiconductor formed two absorption bonds at 3020 and 1300 cm A 1 , which indicate weak interaction between methane and coupled semiconductor.Moreover, the CO 2 absorbed generates some surface species, at 1389 and 1530 cm A 1 , indicating the formation of surface formate species 7. The intensity of the peaks was increased by time passing, showing more production of the related compounds.New bands in the region of 2600-3000 and 1200-2000 cm A 1 were observed as depicted in Table 6.In the range of 2600-3000 cm A 1 , six bands at 2958, 2927, 2885, 2825, 2806, and 2738 cm A 1 were observed (Fig. 8(c)).These peaks can be assigned to characteristic absorption band of methyl symmetric C-H stretching (2958 cm A 1 ), methyl asymmetric C-H stretching (2885 cm A 1 ), and bands between 2700 and 2900 cm A 1 can be attributed to aldehyde and ketone C-H stretching or methylene symmetric and asymmetric C-H stretching 31,50,51.Similar results are reported by Teramura et al. in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of CH 4 as a reductant over MgO 31.In the range of 2900-2700 cm A 1 , they observed that seven bands were assigned to W as (CH 3 ) (2962 cm A 1 ), W s (CH 3 ) (2935 cm A 1 ), and W(CH) (2874, 2831, 2804, 2753, and 2733 cm A 1 ). In the range of 1200-2000 cm A 1 , new bands appeared at 1754, 1716, 1683, 1652, 1616, 1575, 1558, 1541, 1458, 1436, 1396, 1365, 1355, and 1342 cm A 1 (Fig. 8 reported that bands at 1661, 1631, 1346, and 1313 cm A 1 are assigned to surface bidentate carbonates 31.In our case, appearance of these various peaks can be attributed to different compound groups such as aldehyde, ketone and carboxylic acid.However, with attention to presented mechanisms in literature 7,2829303132 for conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 on the semiconductor photocatalysts, the peaks can be assigned to production of formic and acetic acid derivatives.Also, the bands at 1616, 1541, 1458, 1396, 1355 cm A 1 are assigned to W as (O-C-O), s(CH), s(CH), and W s (O-C-O), respectively, indicate the formation of formate species 7,53,54.The band of 1683 cm A 1 can be assigned to stretching of HCO 3 55,56. In contrast, it was anticipated that the other bands were derived from acetate.The spectra related to acetic acid were observed at 1558 cm A 1 and 1436 cm A 1 .The acetic acid is expected to be dissociated form of acetate group 575859.The band at 1558 cm A 1 can be correlated to a C-O symmetric vibration mode 57.The bands at 1436, 1365, and 1342 cm A 1 are assigned to a C-H deformation vibration mode: s as (CH 3 ), s(CH), and s s (CH 3 ), respectively 58,59.In this regards, Shi et al. suggested a mechanism for photocatalytic conversion of CH 4 and CO 2 over Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 catalyst to ethane, acetone and acetic acid products 7."}, {"llm generation": "ZnO", "source": "On the basis of the maximum absorption wave, the band gap of the prepared calcinated ZnO photocatalyst can be estimated to 3.204 eV (Eq.( 3)), where E bg is the band-gap energy of the photocatalyst and l is the maximum wavelength in nanometer 36.", "context": "The ZnO particles were coated on mesh by a simple and inexpensive method.For suitable immobilization and increasing durability of ZnO on the support, particles were calcinated after coating on the mesh surface.The optimum calcination temperature (350 1C) was selected from literature 42,43.It is reported that size of the particles were reduced by calcination method 42, which can increase surface area of catalyst.The calcination leads to decreasing agglomeration and uniform distribution of particles and therefore, increases the active surface of catalysts 36. The catalyst coated mesh showed a very good mechanical stability.Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the calcinated ZnO and commercial ZnO at room temperature.The absorption of UV-vis light is an important factor for the evolution of photocatalyst properties 37.It can be seen that calcination leads to improvement of UV-visible absorption intensity of the calcinated photocatalysts.Also, calcinations cause a little shifting of absorption peak to visible area.It can be concluded that the calcinated ZnO photocatalyst had a broad absorption band from ultraviolet to visible region and the maximum absorption peak was found at 387 nm.However, before calcinations, the commercial ZnO showed weaker absorption in the whole region.Also, the SEM images of surface structure of the commercial and calcinated ZnO is shown in Fig. 3.The comparison of calcinated ZnO structure (Fig. 3(a)) with commercial ZnO (Fig. 3(b)) shows that no significant differences were observed in agglomeration and particle size by calcination technique. On the basis of the maximum absorption wave, the band gap of the prepared calcinated ZnO photocatalyst can be estimated to 3.204 eV (Eq.( 3)), where E bg is the band-gap energy of the photocatalyst and l is the maximum wavelength in nanometer 36. For investigating the quality of coatings from the structural aspect, i.e. whether or not ZnO crystals have found obvious changes in structural properties and crystallite size during the calcination process, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the coated samples were assessed.The coated samples have been removed from mesh surface and grinded into fine powder before introducing to the XRD analyzer.Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of ZnO photocatalysts before and after calcination.The XRD results did not show any significant changes in the structure of ZnO as a consequence of the calcination and coating processes.It was concluded that calcination process did not have significant influence on crystalline morphologies of ZnO particles.No perceptible impurities can be recognized in the graphs.This is important for the stainless steel mesh coating, since iron impurities caused by heating the steel could have a negative effect on the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst.Fe 3 ions have been reported to be present in TiO 2 coated steel plates heated at 600 1C and more, but not at lower temperatures 44.As shown in Fig. 4, no new peak related to impurities was observed, indicating that the selected calcination temperature (350 1C) did not affect the crystal phase of ZnO and used iron alloy as support. Morphology of the prepared catalysts and stainless steel mesh were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The images were used to show how photocatalysts were coated on/in mesh network.As shown in Fig. 5, ZnO particles were immobilized in a uniform state between woven fabrics of mesh when zinc oxide slurry was containing 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO particles.However, amount of coating is low and insufficient at 5 g ZnO.Amount of immobilized ZnO on the surface of support was 0.37, 0.7 and 1.1 g when 5, 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO were used in slurry preparation, respectively. In order to evaluate the influence of operating parameters on the photocatalytic reduction efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 , totally 22 experiments with four main factors were performed.Amount of ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes (g/cm 2 ) (X 1 ), total pressure of feed (psi) (X 2 ), CO 2 :CH 4 :He feed ratio () (X 3 ) and UV light power (W) (X 4 ) were chosen as the experimental parameters, while the responses were CO 2 and CH 4 conversion.The experimental ranges and levels of the independent variables for photoreduction of CO 2 and CH 4 are given in Table 1.The UV-lamp power parameter was defined as a multilevel due to only available commercial UV lamp (was with power of 80, 125 and 250 W).Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the extreme values of the variables. Statistical combinations of the independent variables with the measured and predicted yield (after 5 h of irradiation) are described in Table 2.The following second-order polynomial response equation was used to correlate the dependent and independent variables: where Y shows the response variable of conversion efficiency.The b i presents regression coefficient for linear effects; b ij is the regression coefficients for interaction terms between x i and x j , b ii is coefficient for quadratic effects, and x i is the symbol of coded experimental levels of the variables.After fitting the obtained data for each parameter with the above experiments to full second-order models, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the models were performed and the models significance were examined 45.Since the full second-order models (models containing all two parameter interactions) were not accepted by the required tests, they were improved by elimination of the models terms until the determined conditions were fulfilled. While using the obtained results, an empirical relationship between the response and independent variables was achieved and expressed by the following second-order polynomial Experimental ranges and levels of the independent test variables. Ranges and levels Predicted photocatalytic conversion efficiencies by Eqs. ( 5) and ( 6) are presented in Table 2.The obtained results show well agreements between the experimental and predicted values of photocatalytic conversion efficiency.Comparison of the experimental results and the predicted values obtained from the model (Eqs.( 5) and ( 6)) showed that the predicted values reasonably well matched the experimental values with R 2 140.99 and R 2 140.984 for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion, respectively.This indicates that 99 and 98.4 of the variations for CO 2 and CH 4 percent, conversion efficiencies are described by the models.R 2 Adj is also a measure of goodness of a fit, but it is more appropriate for comparing models with different numbers of independent variables.If there are some additional terms in the model, Adj-R 2 may be visibly smaller than R 2 46,47.In this case, Adj-R 2 values for CO 2 and CH 4 (0.973, 0.972) were close to the related R 2 value (Table 3). Table 3 shows the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the obtained models.The F-value obtained for CO2 and CH 4 are 58.68 and 82.38 respectively, which is clearly greater than the tabulated F (5.94 at 99 significance for CO 2 and 4.41 at 99 significance for CH 4 ) confirming the adequacy of the model fits.The P-values of CO 2 and CH 4 conversion efficiency model parameters are given in Table 4.As can be seen, all of the considered parameters are significant and should be contained in the model.Also, the good agreement between the predicted and actual experimental values indicates that the models can predict the phenomena well (Table 4). The most significant parameters for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion is feed ratio (X 3 ) followed by total pressure (X 2 ).Whereas UV light power (X 4 ) and catalyst (X 1 ) have less importance among the four single parameters.On the other hand, CO 2 conversion efficiency is affected by quadratic (X 4 A X 4 , X 3 A X 3 , X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions While, CH 4 conversion is affected by quadratic (X 3 A X 3 and X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions (X 1 A X 2 , X 1 A X 4 , and X 2 A X 4 ). The response surface plot of photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 are shown in Figs. 6 and7, respectively.The maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.Also, the maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh. The photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO 2 slightly increases with increasing the UV light power (Fig. 6(a)).Higher light intensity provides higher energy for more ZnO particles to produce electron-hole pairs 48.As shown in Fig. 2 related to UV-visible spectra of calcinated zinc oxide, band gap of ZnO is high and needs high intensity light for excitation of electrons.CO 2 conversion efficiency increased by decreasing total pressure and feed ratio (Fig. 6(b)).At the higher pressure, conversion efficiency reduced due to high concentration of target molecules to react with the photocatalytic produced radicals.In addition, amount of conversion reduced in high ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 .It can be attributed to more stability of CO 2 related to CH 4 in reaction with active radicals.Also, CO 2 photocatalytic conversion increased with increasing ZnO due to increase in active surface of the photocatalyst (Fig. 6(c)).However, more increasing of coated ZnO from 8 g does not affect the conversion efficiency because of nonincreasing of photocatalyst surface and overlapping of formed catalyst layer. The maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh (Fig. 7).Conversion of methane increases by decreasing the pressure and increasing UV intensity (Fig. 7(a)).However, amount of CH 4 conversion is higher than CO 2 due to low stability and direct conversion of CH 4 as well as reductant role of it, in the presence of carbon dioxide.By increasing the CO 2 amount, conversion efficiency of CH 4 improves (Fig. 7(b)).High concentration of carbon dioxide prompts the reaction rate and leads to the decrease in CH 4 concentration, which acts as a reductant.Amount of conversion of both CO 2 and CH 4 is high in low pressure.The photogenerated radicals are not able to convert high concentration of the gasses to new products due to reduction of effective strike and interaction among photogenerated radicals and components.Increasing the amount of coated ZnO on mesh causes improvement in conversion efficiency due to increasing active sites (Fig. 7(c)).Also, CH 4 conversion was improved by decreasing pressure. The requested aim in terms of conversion efficiency was defined as ''maximize'' to attain highest treatment performance.As presented in Table 5, optimum condition of parameter values were predicted by the model with 8 g ZnO (2.65 mg/cm 2 ), 30 psi, (10 CO 2 :80 CH 4 :10 He) and 250 W. Also, the optimum values of the process variables for the maximum CH 4 conversion efficiency were 2.65 mg/cm 2 , 80 psi, (10:80:10) and 250 power light.At these optimum values, the predicted and observed conversion efficiency () were 12.5 and 11.9 for CO 2 and 15.7, and 15.2 for CH 4 , respectively.It implies that the strategy to optimize the conversion conditions and obtaining the maximal conversion efficiency by RSM for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 in this study is successful. Direct conversion of methane and carbon dioxide to oxygenated compounds was carried out over immobilized ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes.The conversion products were characterized using FTIR to identify photoconversion products in gas phase (Fig. 8).For gas feed, only three distinct peaks were observed.The peaks at 1303 cm A 1 (Fig. 8(a)) and 3016 cm A 1 correspond to the C-H stretch in methane 8, and 2360 cm A 1 peak (Fig. 8(b)) correspond to the OQCQO stretch in carbon dioxide 49.No other peaks were observed, indicating that no reaction occurred between CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of ZnO without irradiation.However, some spectral changes were detected after photoirradiation of coated ZnO in the presence of CO 2 and CH 4 .These results are very close to those observed for CO 2 adsorption and strong C-H peaks appeared on Cu-Co based catalysts 8.Also, the IR spectra of methane and carbon dioxide absorbed on Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 samples showed that the methane absorbed on the coupled semiconductor formed two absorption bonds at 3020 and 1300 cm A 1 , which indicate weak interaction between methane and coupled semiconductor.Moreover, the CO 2 absorbed generates some surface species, at 1389 and 1530 cm A 1 , indicating the formation of surface formate species 7. The intensity of the peaks was increased by time passing, showing more production of the related compounds.New bands in the region of 2600-3000 and 1200-2000 cm A 1 were observed as depicted in Table 6.In the range of 2600-3000 cm A 1 , six bands at 2958, 2927, 2885, 2825, 2806, and 2738 cm A 1 were observed (Fig. 8(c)).These peaks can be assigned to characteristic absorption band of methyl symmetric C-H stretching (2958 cm A 1 ), methyl asymmetric C-H stretching (2885 cm A 1 ), and bands between 2700 and 2900 cm A 1 can be attributed to aldehyde and ketone C-H stretching or methylene symmetric and asymmetric C-H stretching 31,50,51.Similar results are reported by Teramura et al. in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of CH 4 as a reductant over MgO 31.In the range of 2900-2700 cm A 1 , they observed that seven bands were assigned to W as (CH 3 ) (2962 cm A 1 ), W s (CH 3 ) (2935 cm A 1 ), and W(CH) (2874, 2831, 2804, 2753, and 2733 cm A 1 ). In the range of 1200-2000 cm A 1 , new bands appeared at 1754, 1716, 1683, 1652, 1616, 1575, 1558, 1541, 1458, 1436, 1396, 1365, 1355, and 1342 cm A 1 (Fig. 8 reported that bands at 1661, 1631, 1346, and 1313 cm A 1 are assigned to surface bidentate carbonates 31.In our case, appearance of these various peaks can be attributed to different compound groups such as aldehyde, ketone and carboxylic acid.However, with attention to presented mechanisms in literature 7,2829303132 for conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 on the semiconductor photocatalysts, the peaks can be assigned to production of formic and acetic acid derivatives.Also, the bands at 1616, 1541, 1458, 1396, 1355 cm A 1 are assigned to W as (O-C-O), s(CH), s(CH), and W s (O-C-O), respectively, indicate the formation of formate species 7,53,54.The band of 1683 cm A 1 can be assigned to stretching of HCO 3 55,56. In contrast, it was anticipated that the other bands were derived from acetate.The spectra related to acetic acid were observed at 1558 cm A 1 and 1436 cm A 1 .The acetic acid is expected to be dissociated form of acetate group 575859.The band at 1558 cm A 1 can be correlated to a C-O symmetric vibration mode 57.The bands at 1436, 1365, and 1342 cm A 1 are assigned to a C-H deformation vibration mode: s as (CH 3 ), s(CH), and s s (CH 3 ), respectively 58,59.In this regards, Shi et al. suggested a mechanism for photocatalytic conversion of CH 4 and CO 2 over Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 catalyst to ethane, acetone and acetic acid products 7."}, {"llm generation": "ZnO", "source": "Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of ZnO photocatalysts before and after calcination.", "context": "The ZnO particles were coated on mesh by a simple and inexpensive method.For suitable immobilization and increasing durability of ZnO on the support, particles were calcinated after coating on the mesh surface.The optimum calcination temperature (350 1C) was selected from literature 42,43.It is reported that size of the particles were reduced by calcination method 42, which can increase surface area of catalyst.The calcination leads to decreasing agglomeration and uniform distribution of particles and therefore, increases the active surface of catalysts 36. The catalyst coated mesh showed a very good mechanical stability.Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the calcinated ZnO and commercial ZnO at room temperature.The absorption of UV-vis light is an important factor for the evolution of photocatalyst properties 37.It can be seen that calcination leads to improvement of UV-visible absorption intensity of the calcinated photocatalysts.Also, calcinations cause a little shifting of absorption peak to visible area.It can be concluded that the calcinated ZnO photocatalyst had a broad absorption band from ultraviolet to visible region and the maximum absorption peak was found at 387 nm.However, before calcinations, the commercial ZnO showed weaker absorption in the whole region.Also, the SEM images of surface structure of the commercial and calcinated ZnO is shown in Fig. 3.The comparison of calcinated ZnO structure (Fig. 3(a)) with commercial ZnO (Fig. 3(b)) shows that no significant differences were observed in agglomeration and particle size by calcination technique. On the basis of the maximum absorption wave, the band gap of the prepared calcinated ZnO photocatalyst can be estimated to 3.204 eV (Eq.( 3)), where E bg is the band-gap energy of the photocatalyst and l is the maximum wavelength in nanometer 36. For investigating the quality of coatings from the structural aspect, i.e. whether or not ZnO crystals have found obvious changes in structural properties and crystallite size during the calcination process, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the coated samples were assessed.The coated samples have been removed from mesh surface and grinded into fine powder before introducing to the XRD analyzer.Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of ZnO photocatalysts before and after calcination.The XRD results did not show any significant changes in the structure of ZnO as a consequence of the calcination and coating processes.It was concluded that calcination process did not have significant influence on crystalline morphologies of ZnO particles.No perceptible impurities can be recognized in the graphs.This is important for the stainless steel mesh coating, since iron impurities caused by heating the steel could have a negative effect on the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst.Fe 3 ions have been reported to be present in TiO 2 coated steel plates heated at 600 1C and more, but not at lower temperatures 44.As shown in Fig. 4, no new peak related to impurities was observed, indicating that the selected calcination temperature (350 1C) did not affect the crystal phase of ZnO and used iron alloy as support. Morphology of the prepared catalysts and stainless steel mesh were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The images were used to show how photocatalysts were coated on/in mesh network.As shown in Fig. 5, ZnO particles were immobilized in a uniform state between woven fabrics of mesh when zinc oxide slurry was containing 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO particles.However, amount of coating is low and insufficient at 5 g ZnO.Amount of immobilized ZnO on the surface of support was 0.37, 0.7 and 1.1 g when 5, 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO were used in slurry preparation, respectively. In order to evaluate the influence of operating parameters on the photocatalytic reduction efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 , totally 22 experiments with four main factors were performed.Amount of ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes (g/cm 2 ) (X 1 ), total pressure of feed (psi) (X 2 ), CO 2 :CH 4 :He feed ratio () (X 3 ) and UV light power (W) (X 4 ) were chosen as the experimental parameters, while the responses were CO 2 and CH 4 conversion.The experimental ranges and levels of the independent variables for photoreduction of CO 2 and CH 4 are given in Table 1.The UV-lamp power parameter was defined as a multilevel due to only available commercial UV lamp (was with power of 80, 125 and 250 W).Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the extreme values of the variables. Statistical combinations of the independent variables with the measured and predicted yield (after 5 h of irradiation) are described in Table 2.The following second-order polynomial response equation was used to correlate the dependent and independent variables: where Y shows the response variable of conversion efficiency.The b i presents regression coefficient for linear effects; b ij is the regression coefficients for interaction terms between x i and x j , b ii is coefficient for quadratic effects, and x i is the symbol of coded experimental levels of the variables.After fitting the obtained data for each parameter with the above experiments to full second-order models, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the models were performed and the models significance were examined 45.Since the full second-order models (models containing all two parameter interactions) were not accepted by the required tests, they were improved by elimination of the models terms until the determined conditions were fulfilled. While using the obtained results, an empirical relationship between the response and independent variables was achieved and expressed by the following second-order polynomial Experimental ranges and levels of the independent test variables. Ranges and levels Predicted photocatalytic conversion efficiencies by Eqs. ( 5) and ( 6) are presented in Table 2.The obtained results show well agreements between the experimental and predicted values of photocatalytic conversion efficiency.Comparison of the experimental results and the predicted values obtained from the model (Eqs.( 5) and ( 6)) showed that the predicted values reasonably well matched the experimental values with R 2 140.99 and R 2 140.984 for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion, respectively.This indicates that 99 and 98.4 of the variations for CO 2 and CH 4 percent, conversion efficiencies are described by the models.R 2 Adj is also a measure of goodness of a fit, but it is more appropriate for comparing models with different numbers of independent variables.If there are some additional terms in the model, Adj-R 2 may be visibly smaller than R 2 46,47.In this case, Adj-R 2 values for CO 2 and CH 4 (0.973, 0.972) were close to the related R 2 value (Table 3). Table 3 shows the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the obtained models.The F-value obtained for CO2 and CH 4 are 58.68 and 82.38 respectively, which is clearly greater than the tabulated F (5.94 at 99 significance for CO 2 and 4.41 at 99 significance for CH 4 ) confirming the adequacy of the model fits.The P-values of CO 2 and CH 4 conversion efficiency model parameters are given in Table 4.As can be seen, all of the considered parameters are significant and should be contained in the model.Also, the good agreement between the predicted and actual experimental values indicates that the models can predict the phenomena well (Table 4). The most significant parameters for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion is feed ratio (X 3 ) followed by total pressure (X 2 ).Whereas UV light power (X 4 ) and catalyst (X 1 ) have less importance among the four single parameters.On the other hand, CO 2 conversion efficiency is affected by quadratic (X 4 A X 4 , X 3 A X 3 , X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions While, CH 4 conversion is affected by quadratic (X 3 A X 3 and X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions (X 1 A X 2 , X 1 A X 4 , and X 2 A X 4 ). The response surface plot of photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 are shown in Figs. 6 and7, respectively.The maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.Also, the maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh. The photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO 2 slightly increases with increasing the UV light power (Fig. 6(a)).Higher light intensity provides higher energy for more ZnO particles to produce electron-hole pairs 48.As shown in Fig. 2 related to UV-visible spectra of calcinated zinc oxide, band gap of ZnO is high and needs high intensity light for excitation of electrons.CO 2 conversion efficiency increased by decreasing total pressure and feed ratio (Fig. 6(b)).At the higher pressure, conversion efficiency reduced due to high concentration of target molecules to react with the photocatalytic produced radicals.In addition, amount of conversion reduced in high ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 .It can be attributed to more stability of CO 2 related to CH 4 in reaction with active radicals.Also, CO 2 photocatalytic conversion increased with increasing ZnO due to increase in active surface of the photocatalyst (Fig. 6(c)).However, more increasing of coated ZnO from 8 g does not affect the conversion efficiency because of nonincreasing of photocatalyst surface and overlapping of formed catalyst layer. The maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh (Fig. 7).Conversion of methane increases by decreasing the pressure and increasing UV intensity (Fig. 7(a)).However, amount of CH 4 conversion is higher than CO 2 due to low stability and direct conversion of CH 4 as well as reductant role of it, in the presence of carbon dioxide.By increasing the CO 2 amount, conversion efficiency of CH 4 improves (Fig. 7(b)).High concentration of carbon dioxide prompts the reaction rate and leads to the decrease in CH 4 concentration, which acts as a reductant.Amount of conversion of both CO 2 and CH 4 is high in low pressure.The photogenerated radicals are not able to convert high concentration of the gasses to new products due to reduction of effective strike and interaction among photogenerated radicals and components.Increasing the amount of coated ZnO on mesh causes improvement in conversion efficiency due to increasing active sites (Fig. 7(c)).Also, CH 4 conversion was improved by decreasing pressure. The requested aim in terms of conversion efficiency was defined as ''maximize'' to attain highest treatment performance.As presented in Table 5, optimum condition of parameter values were predicted by the model with 8 g ZnO (2.65 mg/cm 2 ), 30 psi, (10 CO 2 :80 CH 4 :10 He) and 250 W. Also, the optimum values of the process variables for the maximum CH 4 conversion efficiency were 2.65 mg/cm 2 , 80 psi, (10:80:10) and 250 power light.At these optimum values, the predicted and observed conversion efficiency () were 12.5 and 11.9 for CO 2 and 15.7, and 15.2 for CH 4 , respectively.It implies that the strategy to optimize the conversion conditions and obtaining the maximal conversion efficiency by RSM for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 in this study is successful. Direct conversion of methane and carbon dioxide to oxygenated compounds was carried out over immobilized ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes.The conversion products were characterized using FTIR to identify photoconversion products in gas phase (Fig. 8).For gas feed, only three distinct peaks were observed.The peaks at 1303 cm A 1 (Fig. 8(a)) and 3016 cm A 1 correspond to the C-H stretch in methane 8, and 2360 cm A 1 peak (Fig. 8(b)) correspond to the OQCQO stretch in carbon dioxide 49.No other peaks were observed, indicating that no reaction occurred between CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of ZnO without irradiation.However, some spectral changes were detected after photoirradiation of coated ZnO in the presence of CO 2 and CH 4 .These results are very close to those observed for CO 2 adsorption and strong C-H peaks appeared on Cu-Co based catalysts 8.Also, the IR spectra of methane and carbon dioxide absorbed on Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 samples showed that the methane absorbed on the coupled semiconductor formed two absorption bonds at 3020 and 1300 cm A 1 , which indicate weak interaction between methane and coupled semiconductor.Moreover, the CO 2 absorbed generates some surface species, at 1389 and 1530 cm A 1 , indicating the formation of surface formate species 7. The intensity of the peaks was increased by time passing, showing more production of the related compounds.New bands in the region of 2600-3000 and 1200-2000 cm A 1 were observed as depicted in Table 6.In the range of 2600-3000 cm A 1 , six bands at 2958, 2927, 2885, 2825, 2806, and 2738 cm A 1 were observed (Fig. 8(c)).These peaks can be assigned to characteristic absorption band of methyl symmetric C-H stretching (2958 cm A 1 ), methyl asymmetric C-H stretching (2885 cm A 1 ), and bands between 2700 and 2900 cm A 1 can be attributed to aldehyde and ketone C-H stretching or methylene symmetric and asymmetric C-H stretching 31,50,51.Similar results are reported by Teramura et al. in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of CH 4 as a reductant over MgO 31.In the range of 2900-2700 cm A 1 , they observed that seven bands were assigned to W as (CH 3 ) (2962 cm A 1 ), W s (CH 3 ) (2935 cm A 1 ), and W(CH) (2874, 2831, 2804, 2753, and 2733 cm A 1 ). In the range of 1200-2000 cm A 1 , new bands appeared at 1754, 1716, 1683, 1652, 1616, 1575, 1558, 1541, 1458, 1436, 1396, 1365, 1355, and 1342 cm A 1 (Fig. 8 reported that bands at 1661, 1631, 1346, and 1313 cm A 1 are assigned to surface bidentate carbonates 31.In our case, appearance of these various peaks can be attributed to different compound groups such as aldehyde, ketone and carboxylic acid.However, with attention to presented mechanisms in literature 7,2829303132 for conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 on the semiconductor photocatalysts, the peaks can be assigned to production of formic and acetic acid derivatives.Also, the bands at 1616, 1541, 1458, 1396, 1355 cm A 1 are assigned to W as (O-C-O), s(CH), s(CH), and W s (O-C-O), respectively, indicate the formation of formate species 7,53,54.The band of 1683 cm A 1 can be assigned to stretching of HCO 3 55,56. In contrast, it was anticipated that the other bands were derived from acetate.The spectra related to acetic acid were observed at 1558 cm A 1 and 1436 cm A 1 .The acetic acid is expected to be dissociated form of acetate group 575859.The band at 1558 cm A 1 can be correlated to a C-O symmetric vibration mode 57.The bands at 1436, 1365, and 1342 cm A 1 are assigned to a C-H deformation vibration mode: s as (CH 3 ), s(CH), and s s (CH 3 ), respectively 58,59.In this regards, Shi et al. suggested a mechanism for photocatalytic conversion of CH 4 and CO 2 over Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 catalyst to ethane, acetone and acetic acid products 7."}, {"llm generation": "semiconductor photocatalysts", "source": "However, with attention to presented mechanisms in literature 7,2829303132 for conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 on the semiconductor photocatalysts, the peaks can be assigned to production of formic and acetic acid derivatives.", "context": "The ZnO particles were coated on mesh by a simple and inexpensive method.For suitable immobilization and increasing durability of ZnO on the support, particles were calcinated after coating on the mesh surface.The optimum calcination temperature (350 1C) was selected from literature 42,43.It is reported that size of the particles were reduced by calcination method 42, which can increase surface area of catalyst.The calcination leads to decreasing agglomeration and uniform distribution of particles and therefore, increases the active surface of catalysts 36. The catalyst coated mesh showed a very good mechanical stability.Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the calcinated ZnO and commercial ZnO at room temperature.The absorption of UV-vis light is an important factor for the evolution of photocatalyst properties 37.It can be seen that calcination leads to improvement of UV-visible absorption intensity of the calcinated photocatalysts.Also, calcinations cause a little shifting of absorption peak to visible area.It can be concluded that the calcinated ZnO photocatalyst had a broad absorption band from ultraviolet to visible region and the maximum absorption peak was found at 387 nm.However, before calcinations, the commercial ZnO showed weaker absorption in the whole region.Also, the SEM images of surface structure of the commercial and calcinated ZnO is shown in Fig. 3.The comparison of calcinated ZnO structure (Fig. 3(a)) with commercial ZnO (Fig. 3(b)) shows that no significant differences were observed in agglomeration and particle size by calcination technique. On the basis of the maximum absorption wave, the band gap of the prepared calcinated ZnO photocatalyst can be estimated to 3.204 eV (Eq.( 3)), where E bg is the band-gap energy of the photocatalyst and l is the maximum wavelength in nanometer 36. For investigating the quality of coatings from the structural aspect, i.e. whether or not ZnO crystals have found obvious changes in structural properties and crystallite size during the calcination process, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the coated samples were assessed.The coated samples have been removed from mesh surface and grinded into fine powder before introducing to the XRD analyzer.Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of ZnO photocatalysts before and after calcination.The XRD results did not show any significant changes in the structure of ZnO as a consequence of the calcination and coating processes.It was concluded that calcination process did not have significant influence on crystalline morphologies of ZnO particles.No perceptible impurities can be recognized in the graphs.This is important for the stainless steel mesh coating, since iron impurities caused by heating the steel could have a negative effect on the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst.Fe 3 ions have been reported to be present in TiO 2 coated steel plates heated at 600 1C and more, but not at lower temperatures 44.As shown in Fig. 4, no new peak related to impurities was observed, indicating that the selected calcination temperature (350 1C) did not affect the crystal phase of ZnO and used iron alloy as support. Morphology of the prepared catalysts and stainless steel mesh were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The images were used to show how photocatalysts were coated on/in mesh network.As shown in Fig. 5, ZnO particles were immobilized in a uniform state between woven fabrics of mesh when zinc oxide slurry was containing 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO particles.However, amount of coating is low and insufficient at 5 g ZnO.Amount of immobilized ZnO on the surface of support was 0.37, 0.7 and 1.1 g when 5, 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO were used in slurry preparation, respectively. In order to evaluate the influence of operating parameters on the photocatalytic reduction efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 , totally 22 experiments with four main factors were performed.Amount of ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes (g/cm 2 ) (X 1 ), total pressure of feed (psi) (X 2 ), CO 2 :CH 4 :He feed ratio () (X 3 ) and UV light power (W) (X 4 ) were chosen as the experimental parameters, while the responses were CO 2 and CH 4 conversion.The experimental ranges and levels of the independent variables for photoreduction of CO 2 and CH 4 are given in Table 1.The UV-lamp power parameter was defined as a multilevel due to only available commercial UV lamp (was with power of 80, 125 and 250 W).Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the extreme values of the variables. Statistical combinations of the independent variables with the measured and predicted yield (after 5 h of irradiation) are described in Table 2.The following second-order polynomial response equation was used to correlate the dependent and independent variables: where Y shows the response variable of conversion efficiency.The b i presents regression coefficient for linear effects; b ij is the regression coefficients for interaction terms between x i and x j , b ii is coefficient for quadratic effects, and x i is the symbol of coded experimental levels of the variables.After fitting the obtained data for each parameter with the above experiments to full second-order models, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the models were performed and the models significance were examined 45.Since the full second-order models (models containing all two parameter interactions) were not accepted by the required tests, they were improved by elimination of the models terms until the determined conditions were fulfilled. While using the obtained results, an empirical relationship between the response and independent variables was achieved and expressed by the following second-order polynomial Experimental ranges and levels of the independent test variables. Ranges and levels Predicted photocatalytic conversion efficiencies by Eqs. ( 5) and ( 6) are presented in Table 2.The obtained results show well agreements between the experimental and predicted values of photocatalytic conversion efficiency.Comparison of the experimental results and the predicted values obtained from the model (Eqs.( 5) and ( 6)) showed that the predicted values reasonably well matched the experimental values with R 2 140.99 and R 2 140.984 for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion, respectively.This indicates that 99 and 98.4 of the variations for CO 2 and CH 4 percent, conversion efficiencies are described by the models.R 2 Adj is also a measure of goodness of a fit, but it is more appropriate for comparing models with different numbers of independent variables.If there are some additional terms in the model, Adj-R 2 may be visibly smaller than R 2 46,47.In this case, Adj-R 2 values for CO 2 and CH 4 (0.973, 0.972) were close to the related R 2 value (Table 3). Table 3 shows the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the obtained models.The F-value obtained for CO2 and CH 4 are 58.68 and 82.38 respectively, which is clearly greater than the tabulated F (5.94 at 99 significance for CO 2 and 4.41 at 99 significance for CH 4 ) confirming the adequacy of the model fits.The P-values of CO 2 and CH 4 conversion efficiency model parameters are given in Table 4.As can be seen, all of the considered parameters are significant and should be contained in the model.Also, the good agreement between the predicted and actual experimental values indicates that the models can predict the phenomena well (Table 4). The most significant parameters for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion is feed ratio (X 3 ) followed by total pressure (X 2 ).Whereas UV light power (X 4 ) and catalyst (X 1 ) have less importance among the four single parameters.On the other hand, CO 2 conversion efficiency is affected by quadratic (X 4 A X 4 , X 3 A X 3 , X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions While, CH 4 conversion is affected by quadratic (X 3 A X 3 and X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions (X 1 A X 2 , X 1 A X 4 , and X 2 A X 4 ). The response surface plot of photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 are shown in Figs. 6 and7, respectively.The maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.Also, the maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh. The photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO 2 slightly increases with increasing the UV light power (Fig. 6(a)).Higher light intensity provides higher energy for more ZnO particles to produce electron-hole pairs 48.As shown in Fig. 2 related to UV-visible spectra of calcinated zinc oxide, band gap of ZnO is high and needs high intensity light for excitation of electrons.CO 2 conversion efficiency increased by decreasing total pressure and feed ratio (Fig. 6(b)).At the higher pressure, conversion efficiency reduced due to high concentration of target molecules to react with the photocatalytic produced radicals.In addition, amount of conversion reduced in high ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 .It can be attributed to more stability of CO 2 related to CH 4 in reaction with active radicals.Also, CO 2 photocatalytic conversion increased with increasing ZnO due to increase in active surface of the photocatalyst (Fig. 6(c)).However, more increasing of coated ZnO from 8 g does not affect the conversion efficiency because of nonincreasing of photocatalyst surface and overlapping of formed catalyst layer. The maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh (Fig. 7).Conversion of methane increases by decreasing the pressure and increasing UV intensity (Fig. 7(a)).However, amount of CH 4 conversion is higher than CO 2 due to low stability and direct conversion of CH 4 as well as reductant role of it, in the presence of carbon dioxide.By increasing the CO 2 amount, conversion efficiency of CH 4 improves (Fig. 7(b)).High concentration of carbon dioxide prompts the reaction rate and leads to the decrease in CH 4 concentration, which acts as a reductant.Amount of conversion of both CO 2 and CH 4 is high in low pressure.The photogenerated radicals are not able to convert high concentration of the gasses to new products due to reduction of effective strike and interaction among photogenerated radicals and components.Increasing the amount of coated ZnO on mesh causes improvement in conversion efficiency due to increasing active sites (Fig. 7(c)).Also, CH 4 conversion was improved by decreasing pressure. The requested aim in terms of conversion efficiency was defined as ''maximize'' to attain highest treatment performance.As presented in Table 5, optimum condition of parameter values were predicted by the model with 8 g ZnO (2.65 mg/cm 2 ), 30 psi, (10 CO 2 :80 CH 4 :10 He) and 250 W. Also, the optimum values of the process variables for the maximum CH 4 conversion efficiency were 2.65 mg/cm 2 , 80 psi, (10:80:10) and 250 power light.At these optimum values, the predicted and observed conversion efficiency () were 12.5 and 11.9 for CO 2 and 15.7, and 15.2 for CH 4 , respectively.It implies that the strategy to optimize the conversion conditions and obtaining the maximal conversion efficiency by RSM for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 in this study is successful. Direct conversion of methane and carbon dioxide to oxygenated compounds was carried out over immobilized ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes.The conversion products were characterized using FTIR to identify photoconversion products in gas phase (Fig. 8).For gas feed, only three distinct peaks were observed.The peaks at 1303 cm A 1 (Fig. 8(a)) and 3016 cm A 1 correspond to the C-H stretch in methane 8, and 2360 cm A 1 peak (Fig. 8(b)) correspond to the OQCQO stretch in carbon dioxide 49.No other peaks were observed, indicating that no reaction occurred between CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of ZnO without irradiation.However, some spectral changes were detected after photoirradiation of coated ZnO in the presence of CO 2 and CH 4 .These results are very close to those observed for CO 2 adsorption and strong C-H peaks appeared on Cu-Co based catalysts 8.Also, the IR spectra of methane and carbon dioxide absorbed on Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 samples showed that the methane absorbed on the coupled semiconductor formed two absorption bonds at 3020 and 1300 cm A 1 , which indicate weak interaction between methane and coupled semiconductor.Moreover, the CO 2 absorbed generates some surface species, at 1389 and 1530 cm A 1 , indicating the formation of surface formate species 7. The intensity of the peaks was increased by time passing, showing more production of the related compounds.New bands in the region of 2600-3000 and 1200-2000 cm A 1 were observed as depicted in Table 6.In the range of 2600-3000 cm A 1 , six bands at 2958, 2927, 2885, 2825, 2806, and 2738 cm A 1 were observed (Fig. 8(c)).These peaks can be assigned to characteristic absorption band of methyl symmetric C-H stretching (2958 cm A 1 ), methyl asymmetric C-H stretching (2885 cm A 1 ), and bands between 2700 and 2900 cm A 1 can be attributed to aldehyde and ketone C-H stretching or methylene symmetric and asymmetric C-H stretching 31,50,51.Similar results are reported by Teramura et al. in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of CH 4 as a reductant over MgO 31.In the range of 2900-2700 cm A 1 , they observed that seven bands were assigned to W as (CH 3 ) (2962 cm A 1 ), W s (CH 3 ) (2935 cm A 1 ), and W(CH) (2874, 2831, 2804, 2753, and 2733 cm A 1 ). In the range of 1200-2000 cm A 1 , new bands appeared at 1754, 1716, 1683, 1652, 1616, 1575, 1558, 1541, 1458, 1436, 1396, 1365, 1355, and 1342 cm A 1 (Fig. 8 reported that bands at 1661, 1631, 1346, and 1313 cm A 1 are assigned to surface bidentate carbonates 31.In our case, appearance of these various peaks can be attributed to different compound groups such as aldehyde, ketone and carboxylic acid.However, with attention to presented mechanisms in literature 7,2829303132 for conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 on the semiconductor photocatalysts, the peaks can be assigned to production of formic and acetic acid derivatives.Also, the bands at 1616, 1541, 1458, 1396, 1355 cm A 1 are assigned to W as (O-C-O), s(CH), s(CH), and W s (O-C-O), respectively, indicate the formation of formate species 7,53,54.The band of 1683 cm A 1 can be assigned to stretching of HCO 3 55,56.

The catalyst coated mesh showed a very good mechanical stability.Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the calcinated ZnO and commercial ZnO at room temperature.The absorption of UV-vis light is an important factor for the evolution of photocatalyst properties 37.It can be seen that calcination leads to improvement of UV-visible absorption intensity of the calcinated photocatalysts.Also, calcinations cause a little shifting of absorption peak to visible area.It can be concluded that the calcinated ZnO photocatalyst had a broad absorption band from ultraviolet to visible region and the maximum absorption peak was found at 387 nm.However, before calcinations, the commercial ZnO showed weaker absorption in the whole region.Also, the SEM images of surface structure of the commercial and calcinated ZnO is shown in Fig. 3.The comparison of calcinated ZnO structure (Fig. 3(a)) with commercial ZnO (Fig. 3(b)) shows that no significant differences were observed in agglomeration and particle size by calcination technique. On the basis of the maximum absorption wave, the band gap of the prepared calcinated ZnO photocatalyst can be estimated to 3.204 eV (Eq.( 3)), where E bg is the band-gap energy of the photocatalyst and l is the maximum wavelength in nanometer 36. For investigating the quality of coatings from the structural aspect, i.e. whether or not ZnO crystals have found obvious changes in structural properties and crystallite size during the calcination process, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the coated samples were assessed.The coated samples have been removed from mesh surface and grinded into fine powder before introducing to the XRD analyzer.Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of ZnO photocatalysts before and after calcination.The XRD results did not show any significant changes in the structure of ZnO as a consequence of the calcination and coating processes.It was concluded that calcination process did not have significant influence on crystalline morphologies of ZnO particles.No perceptible impurities can be recognized in the graphs.This is important for the stainless steel mesh coating, since iron impurities caused by heating the steel could have a negative effect on the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst.Fe 3 ions have been reported to be present in TiO 2 coated steel plates heated at 600 1C and more, but not at lower temperatures 44.As shown in Fig. 4, no new peak related to impurities was observed, indicating that the selected calcination temperature (350 1C) did not affect the crystal phase of ZnO and used iron alloy as support. Morphology of the prepared catalysts and stainless steel mesh were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The images were used to show how photocatalysts were coated on/in mesh network.As shown in Fig. 5, ZnO particles were immobilized in a uniform state between woven fabrics of mesh when zinc oxide slurry was containing 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO particles.However, amount of coating is low and insufficient at 5 g ZnO.Amount of immobilized ZnO on the surface of support was 0.37, 0.7 and 1.1 g when 5, 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO were used in slurry preparation, respectively. In order to evaluate the influence of operating parameters on the photocatalytic reduction efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 , totally 22 experiments with four main factors were performed.Amount of ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes (g/cm 2 ) (X 1 ), total pressure of feed (psi) (X 2 ), CO 2 :CH 4 :He feed ratio () (X 3 ) and UV light power (W) (X 4 ) were chosen as the experimental parameters, while the responses were CO 2 and CH 4 conversion.The experimental ranges and levels of the independent variables for photoreduction of CO 2 and CH 4 are given in Table 1.The UV-lamp power parameter was defined as a multilevel due to only available commercial UV lamp (was with power of 80, 125 and 250 W).Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the extreme values of the variables. Statistical combinations of the independent variables with the measured and predicted yield (after 5 h of irradiation) are described in Table 2.The following second-order polynomial response equation was used to correlate the dependent and independent variables: where Y shows the response variable of conversion efficiency.The b i presents regression coefficient for linear effects; b ij is the regression coefficients for interaction terms between x i and x j , b ii is coefficient for quadratic effects, and x i is the symbol of coded experimental levels of the variables.After fitting the obtained data for each parameter with the above experiments to full second-order models, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the models were performed and the models significance were examined 45.Since the full second-order models (models containing all two parameter interactions) were not accepted by the required tests, they were improved by elimination of the models terms until the determined conditions were fulfilled. While using the obtained results, an empirical relationship between the response and independent variables was achieved and expressed by the following second-order polynomial Experimental ranges and levels of the independent test variables. Ranges and levels Predicted photocatalytic conversion efficiencies by Eqs. ( 5) and ( 6) are presented in Table 2.The obtained results show well agreements between the experimental and predicted values of photocatalytic conversion efficiency.Comparison of the experimental results and the predicted values obtained from the model (Eqs.( 5) and ( 6)) showed that the predicted values reasonably well matched the experimental values with R 2 140.99 and R 2 140.984 for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion, respectively.This indicates that 99 and 98.4 of the variations for CO 2 and CH 4 percent, conversion efficiencies are described by the models.R 2 Adj is also a measure of goodness of a fit, but it is more appropriate for comparing models with different numbers of independent variables.If there are some additional terms in the model, Adj-R 2 may be visibly smaller than R 2 46,47.In this case, Adj-R 2 values for CO 2 and CH 4 (0.973, 0.972) were close to the related R 2 value (Table 3). Table 3 shows the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the obtained models.The F-value obtained for CO2 and CH 4 are 58.68 and 82.38 respectively, which is clearly greater than the tabulated F (5.94 at 99 significance for CO 2 and 4.41 at 99 significance for CH 4 ) confirming the adequacy of the model fits.The P-values of CO 2 and CH 4 conversion efficiency model parameters are given in Table 4.As can be seen, all of the considered parameters are significant and should be contained in the model.Also, the good agreement between the predicted and actual experimental values indicates that the models can predict the phenomena well (Table 4). The most significant parameters for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion is feed ratio (X 3 ) followed by total pressure (X 2 ).Whereas UV light power (X 4 ) and catalyst (X 1 ) have less importance among the four single parameters.On the other hand, CO 2 conversion efficiency is affected by quadratic (X 4 A X 4 , X 3 A X 3 , X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions While, CH 4 conversion is affected by quadratic (X 3 A X 3 and X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions (X 1 A X 2 , X 1 A X 4 , and X 2 A X 4 ). The response surface plot of photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 are shown in Figs. 6 and7, respectively.The maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.Also, the maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh. The photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO 2 slightly increases with increasing the UV light power (Fig. 6(a)).Higher light intensity provides higher energy for more ZnO particles to produce electron-hole pairs 48.As shown in Fig. 2 related to UV-visible spectra of calcinated zinc oxide, band gap of ZnO is high and needs high intensity light for excitation of electrons.CO 2 conversion efficiency increased by decreasing total pressure and feed ratio (Fig. 6(b)).At the higher pressure, conversion efficiency reduced due to high concentration of target molecules to react with the photocatalytic produced radicals.In addition, amount of conversion reduced in high ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 .It can be attributed to more stability of CO 2 related to CH 4 in reaction with active radicals.Also, CO 2 photocatalytic conversion increased with increasing ZnO due to increase in active surface of the photocatalyst (Fig. 6(c)).However, more increasing of coated ZnO from 8 g does not affect the conversion efficiency because of nonincreasing of photocatalyst surface and overlapping of formed catalyst layer.

Also, the optimum values of the process variables for the maximum CH 4 conversion efficiency were 2.65 mg/cm 2 , 80 psi, (10:80:10) and 250 power light.At these optimum values, the predicted and observed conversion efficiency () were 12.5 and 11.9 for CO 2 and 15.7, and 15.2 for CH 4 , respectively.It implies that the strategy to optimize the conversion conditions and obtaining the maximal conversion efficiency by RSM for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 in this study is successful.

On the basis of the maximum absorption wave, the band gap of the prepared calcinated ZnO photocatalyst can be estimated to 3.204 eV (Eq.( 3)), where E bg is the band-gap energy of the photocatalyst and l is the maximum wavelength in nanometer 36. For investigating the quality of coatings from the structural aspect, i.e. whether or not ZnO crystals have found obvious changes in structural properties and crystallite size during the calcination process, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the coated samples were assessed.The coated samples have been removed from mesh surface and grinded into fine powder before introducing to the XRD analyzer.Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of ZnO photocatalysts before and after calcination.The XRD results did not show any significant changes in the structure of ZnO as a consequence of the calcination and coating processes.It was concluded that calcination process did not have significant influence on crystalline morphologies of ZnO particles.No perceptible impurities can be recognized in the graphs.This is important for the stainless steel mesh coating, since iron impurities caused by heating the steel could have a negative effect on the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst.Fe 3 ions have been reported to be present in TiO 2 coated steel plates heated at 600 1C and more, but not at lower temperatures 44.As shown in Fig. 4, no new peak related to impurities was observed, indicating that the selected calcination temperature (350 1C) did not affect the crystal phase of ZnO and used iron alloy as support. Morphology of the prepared catalysts and stainless steel mesh were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The images were used to show how photocatalysts were coated on/in mesh network.As shown in Fig. 5, ZnO particles were immobilized in a uniform state between woven fabrics of mesh when zinc oxide slurry was containing 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO particles.However, amount of coating is low and insufficient at 5 g ZnO.Amount of immobilized ZnO on the surface of support was 0.37, 0.7 and 1.1 g when 5, 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO were used in slurry preparation, respectively. In order to evaluate the influence of operating parameters on the photocatalytic reduction efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 , totally 22 experiments with four main factors were performed.Amount of ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes (g/cm 2 ) (X 1 ), total pressure of feed (psi) (X 2 ), CO 2 :CH 4 :He feed ratio () (X 3 ) and UV light power (W) (X 4 ) were chosen as the experimental parameters, while the responses were CO 2 and CH 4 conversion.The experimental ranges and levels of the independent variables for photoreduction of CO 2 and CH 4 are given in Table 1.The UV-lamp power parameter was defined as a multilevel due to only available commercial UV lamp (was with power of 80, 125 and 250 W).Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the extreme values of the variables. Statistical combinations of the independent variables with the measured and predicted yield (after 5 h of irradiation) are described in Table 2.The following second-order polynomial response equation was used to correlate the dependent and independent variables: where Y shows the response variable of conversion efficiency.The b i presents regression coefficient for linear effects; b ij is the regression coefficients for interaction terms between x i and x j , b ii is coefficient for quadratic effects, and x i is the symbol of coded experimental levels of the variables.After fitting the obtained data for each parameter with the above experiments to full second-order models, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the models were performed and the models significance were examined 45.Since the full second-order models (models containing all two parameter interactions) were not accepted by the required tests, they were improved by elimination of the models terms until the determined conditions were fulfilled. While using the obtained results, an empirical relationship between the response and independent variables was achieved and expressed by the following second-order polynomial Experimental ranges and levels of the independent test variables. Ranges and levels Predicted photocatalytic conversion efficiencies by Eqs. ( 5) and ( 6) are presented in Table 2.The obtained results show well agreements between the experimental and predicted values of photocatalytic conversion efficiency.Comparison of the experimental results and the predicted values obtained from the model (Eqs.( 5) and ( 6)) showed that the predicted values reasonably well matched the experimental values with R 2 140.99 and R 2 140.984 for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion, respectively.This indicates that 99 and 98.4 of the variations for CO 2 and CH 4 percent, conversion efficiencies are described by the models.R 2 Adj is also a measure of goodness of a fit, but it is more appropriate for comparing models with different numbers of independent variables.If there are some additional terms in the model, Adj-R 2 may be visibly smaller than R 2 46,47.In this case, Adj-R 2 values for CO 2 and CH 4 (0.973, 0.972) were close to the related R 2 value (Table 3). Table 3 shows the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the obtained models.The F-value obtained for CO2 and CH 4 are 58.68 and 82.38 respectively, which is clearly greater than the tabulated F (5.94 at 99 significance for CO 2 and 4.41 at 99 significance for CH 4 ) confirming the adequacy of the model fits.The P-values of CO 2 and CH 4 conversion efficiency model parameters are given in Table 4.As can be seen, all of the considered parameters are significant and should be contained in the model.Also, the good agreement between the predicted and actual experimental values indicates that the models can predict the phenomena well (Table 4). The most significant parameters for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion is feed ratio (X 3 ) followed by total pressure (X 2 ).Whereas UV light power (X 4 ) and catalyst (X 1 ) have less importance among the four single parameters.On the other hand, CO 2 conversion efficiency is affected by quadratic (X 4 A X 4 , X 3 A X 3 , X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions While, CH 4 conversion is affected by quadratic (X 3 A X 3 and X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions (X 1 A X 2 , X 1 A X 4 , and X 2 A X 4 ). The response surface plot of photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 are shown in Figs. 6 and7, respectively.The maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.Also, the maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh. The photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO 2 slightly increases with increasing the UV light power (Fig. 6(a)).Higher light intensity provides higher energy for more ZnO particles to produce electron-hole pairs 48.As shown in Fig. 2 related to UV-visible spectra of calcinated zinc oxide, band gap of ZnO is high and needs high intensity light for excitation of electrons.CO 2 conversion efficiency increased by decreasing total pressure and feed ratio (Fig. 6(b)).At the higher pressure, conversion efficiency reduced due to high concentration of target molecules to react with the photocatalytic produced radicals.In addition, amount of conversion reduced in high ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 .It can be attributed to more stability of CO 2 related to CH 4 in reaction with active radicals.Also, CO 2 photocatalytic conversion increased with increasing ZnO due to increase in active surface of the photocatalyst (Fig. 6(c)).However, more increasing of coated ZnO from 8 g does not affect the conversion efficiency because of nonincreasing of photocatalyst surface and overlapping of formed catalyst layer. The maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh (Fig. 7).Conversion of methane increases by decreasing the pressure and increasing UV intensity (Fig. 7(a)).However, amount of CH 4 conversion is higher than CO 2 due to low stability and direct conversion of CH 4 as well as reductant role of it, in the presence of carbon dioxide.By increasing the CO 2 amount, conversion efficiency of CH 4 improves (Fig. 7(b)).High concentration of carbon dioxide prompts the reaction rate and leads to the decrease in CH 4 concentration, which acts as a reductant.Amount of conversion of both CO 2 and CH 4 is high in low pressure.The photogenerated radicals are not able to convert high concentration of the gasses to new products due to reduction of effective strike and interaction among photogenerated radicals and components.Increasing the amount of coated ZnO on mesh causes improvement in conversion efficiency due to increasing active sites (Fig. 7(c)).Also, CH 4 conversion was improved by decreasing pressure. The requested aim in terms of conversion efficiency was defined as ''maximize'' to attain highest treatment performance.As presented in Table 5, optimum condition of parameter values were predicted by the model with 8 g ZnO (2.65 mg/cm 2 ), 30 psi, (10 CO 2 :80 CH 4 :10 He) and 250 W. Also, the optimum values of the process variables for the maximum CH 4 conversion efficiency were 2.65 mg/cm 2 , 80 psi, (10:80:10) and 250 power light.At these optimum values, the predicted and observed conversion efficiency () were 12.5 and 11.9 for CO 2 and 15.7, and 15.2 for CH 4 , respectively.It implies that the strategy to optimize the conversion conditions and obtaining the maximal conversion efficiency by RSM for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 in this study is successful. Direct conversion of methane and carbon dioxide to oxygenated compounds was carried out over immobilized ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes.The conversion products were characterized using FTIR to identify photoconversion products in gas phase (Fig. 8).For gas feed, only three distinct peaks were observed.The peaks at 1303 cm A 1 (Fig. 8(a)) and 3016 cm A 1 correspond to the C-H stretch in methane 8, and 2360 cm A 1 peak (Fig. 8(b)) correspond to the OQCQO stretch in carbon dioxide 49.No other peaks were observed, indicating that no reaction occurred between CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of ZnO without irradiation.However, some spectral changes were detected after photoirradiation of coated ZnO in the presence of CO 2 and CH 4 .These results are very close to those observed for CO 2 adsorption and strong C-H peaks appeared on Cu-Co based catalysts 8.Also, the IR spectra of methane and carbon dioxide absorbed on Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 samples showed that the methane absorbed on the coupled semiconductor formed two absorption bonds at 3020 and 1300 cm A 1 , which indicate weak interaction between methane and coupled semiconductor.Moreover, the CO 2 absorbed generates some surface species, at 1389 and 1530 cm A 1 , indicating the formation of surface formate species 7. The intensity of the peaks was increased by time passing, showing more production of the related compounds.New bands in the region of 2600-3000 and 1200-2000 cm A 1 were observed as depicted in Table 6.In the range of 2600-3000 cm A 1 , six bands at 2958, 2927, 2885, 2825, 2806, and 2738 cm A 1 were observed (Fig. 8(c)).These peaks can be assigned to characteristic absorption band of methyl symmetric C-H stretching (2958 cm A 1 ), methyl asymmetric C-H stretching (2885 cm A 1 ), and bands between 2700 and 2900 cm A 1 can be attributed to aldehyde and ketone C-H stretching or methylene symmetric and asymmetric C-H stretching 31,50,51.Similar results are reported by Teramura et al. in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of CH 4 as a reductant over MgO 31.In the range of 2900-2700 cm A 1 , they observed that seven bands were assigned to W as (CH 3 ) (2962 cm A 1 ), W s (CH 3 ) (2935 cm A 1 ), and W(CH) (2874, 2831, 2804, 2753, and 2733 cm A 1 ). In the range of 1200-2000 cm A 1 , new bands appeared at 1754, 1716, 1683, 1652, 1616, 1575, 1558, 1541, 1458, 1436, 1396, 1365, 1355, and 1342 cm A 1 (Fig. 8 reported that bands at 1661, 1631, 1346, and 1313 cm A 1 are assigned to surface bidentate carbonates 31.In our case, appearance of these various peaks can be attributed to different compound groups such as aldehyde, ketone and carboxylic acid.However, with attention to presented mechanisms in literature 7,2829303132 for conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 on the semiconductor photocatalysts, the peaks can be assigned to production of formic and acetic acid derivatives.Also, the bands at 1616, 1541, 1458, 1396, 1355 cm A 1 are assigned to W as (O-C-O), s(CH), s(CH), and W s (O-C-O), respectively, indicate the formation of formate species 7,53,54.The band of 1683 cm A 1 can be assigned to stretching of HCO 3 55,56. In contrast, it was anticipated that the other bands were derived from acetate.The spectra related to acetic acid were observed at 1558 cm A 1 and 1436 cm A 1 .The acetic acid is expected to be dissociated form of acetate group 575859.The band at 1558 cm A 1 can be correlated to a C-O symmetric vibration mode 57.The bands at 1436, 1365, and 1342 cm A 1 are assigned to a C-H deformation vibration mode: s as (CH 3 ), s(CH), and s s (CH 3 ), respectively 58,59.In this regards, Shi et al. suggested a mechanism for photocatalytic conversion of CH 4 and CO 2 over Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 catalyst to ethane, acetone and acetic acid products 7."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "The UV-lamp power parameter was defined as a multilevel due to only available commercial UV lamp (was with power of 80, 125 and 250 W).", "context": "The ZnO particles were coated on mesh by a simple and inexpensive method.For suitable immobilization and increasing durability of ZnO on the support, particles were calcinated after coating on the mesh surface.The optimum calcination temperature (350 1C) was selected from literature 42,43.It is reported that size of the particles were reduced by calcination method 42, which can increase surface area of catalyst.The calcination leads to decreasing agglomeration and uniform distribution of particles and therefore, increases the active surface of catalysts 36.

The response surface plot of photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 are shown in Figs. 6 and7, respectively.The maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.Also, the maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh. The photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO 2 slightly increases with increasing the UV light power (Fig. 6(a)).Higher light intensity provides higher energy for more ZnO particles to produce electron-hole pairs 48.As shown in Fig. 2 related to UV-visible spectra of calcinated zinc oxide, band gap of ZnO is high and needs high intensity light for excitation of electrons.CO 2 conversion efficiency increased by decreasing total pressure and feed ratio (Fig. 6(b)).At the higher pressure, conversion efficiency reduced due to high concentration of target molecules to react with the photocatalytic produced radicals.In addition, amount of conversion reduced in high ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 .It can be attributed to more stability of CO 2 related to CH 4 in reaction with active radicals.Also, CO 2 photocatalytic conversion increased with increasing ZnO due to increase in active surface of the photocatalyst (Fig. 6(c)).However, more increasing of coated ZnO from 8 g does not affect the conversion efficiency because of nonincreasing of photocatalyst surface and overlapping of formed catalyst layer. The maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh (Fig. 7).Conversion of methane increases by decreasing the pressure and increasing UV intensity (Fig. 7(a)).However, amount of CH 4 conversion is higher than CO 2 due to low stability and direct conversion of CH 4 as well as reductant role of it, in the presence of carbon dioxide.By increasing the CO 2 amount, conversion efficiency of CH 4 improves (Fig. 7(b)).High concentration of carbon dioxide prompts the reaction rate and leads to the decrease in CH 4 concentration, which acts as a reductant.Amount of conversion of both CO 2 and CH 4 is high in low pressure.The photogenerated radicals are not able to convert high concentration of the gasses to new products due to reduction of effective strike and interaction among photogenerated radicals and components.Increasing the amount of coated ZnO on mesh causes improvement in conversion efficiency due to increasing active sites (Fig. 7(c)).Also, CH 4 conversion was improved by decreasing pressure. The requested aim in terms of conversion efficiency was defined as ''maximize'' to attain highest treatment performance.As presented in Table 5, optimum condition of parameter values were predicted by the model with 8 g ZnO (2.65 mg/cm 2 ), 30 psi, (10 CO 2 :80 CH 4 :10 He) and 250 W. Also, the optimum values of the process variables for the maximum CH 4 conversion efficiency were 2.65 mg/cm 2 , 80 psi, (10:80:10) and 250 power light.At these optimum values, the predicted and observed conversion efficiency () were 12.5 and 11.9 for CO 2 and 15.7, and 15.2 for CH 4 , respectively.It implies that the strategy to optimize the conversion conditions and obtaining the maximal conversion efficiency by RSM for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 in this study is successful.

In the range of 1200-2000 cm A 1 , new bands appeared at 1754, 1716, 1683, 1652, 1616, 1575, 1558, 1541, 1458, 1436, 1396, 1365, 1355, and 1342 cm A 1 (Fig. 8 reported that bands at 1661, 1631, 1346, and 1313 cm A 1 are assigned to surface bidentate carbonates 31.In our case, appearance of these various peaks can be attributed to different compound groups such as aldehyde, ketone and carboxylic acid.However, with attention to presented mechanisms in literature 7,2829303132 for conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 on the semiconductor photocatalysts, the peaks can be assigned to production of formic and acetic acid derivatives.Also, the bands at 1616, 1541, 1458, 1396, 1355 cm A 1 are assigned to W as (O-C-O), s(CH), s(CH), and W s (O-C-O), respectively, indicate the formation of formate species 7,53,54.The band of 1683 cm A 1 can be assigned to stretching of HCO 3 55,56. In contrast, it was anticipated that the other bands were derived from acetate.The spectra related to acetic acid were observed at 1558 cm A 1 and 1436 cm A 1 .The acetic acid is expected to be dissociated form of acetate group 575859.The band at 1558 cm A 1 can be correlated to a C-O symmetric vibration mode 57.The bands at 1436, 1365, and 1342 cm A 1 are assigned to a C-H deformation vibration mode: s as (CH 3 ), s(CH), and s s (CH 3 ), respectively 58,59.In this regards, Shi et al. suggested a mechanism for photocatalytic conversion of CH 4 and CO 2 over Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 catalyst to ethane, acetone and acetic acid products 7."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "The maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.", "context": "The ZnO particles were coated on mesh by a simple and inexpensive method.For suitable immobilization and increasing durability of ZnO on the support, particles were calcinated after coating on the mesh surface.The optimum calcination temperature (350 1C) was selected from literature 42,43.It is reported that size of the particles were reduced by calcination method 42, which can increase surface area of catalyst.The calcination leads to decreasing agglomeration and uniform distribution of particles and therefore, increases the active surface of catalysts 36. The catalyst coated mesh showed a very good mechanical stability.Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the calcinated ZnO and commercial ZnO at room temperature.The absorption of UV-vis light is an important factor for the evolution of photocatalyst properties 37.It can be seen that calcination leads to improvement of UV-visible absorption intensity of the calcinated photocatalysts.Also, calcinations cause a little shifting of absorption peak to visible area.It can be concluded that the calcinated ZnO photocatalyst had a broad absorption band from ultraviolet to visible region and the maximum absorption peak was found at 387 nm.However, before calcinations, the commercial ZnO showed weaker absorption in the whole region.Also, the SEM images of surface structure of the commercial and calcinated ZnO is shown in Fig. 3.The comparison of calcinated ZnO structure (Fig. 3(a)) with commercial ZnO (Fig. 3(b)) shows that no significant differences were observed in agglomeration and particle size by calcination technique. On the basis of the maximum absorption wave, the band gap of the prepared calcinated ZnO photocatalyst can be estimated to 3.204 eV (Eq.( 3)), where E bg is the band-gap energy of the photocatalyst and l is the maximum wavelength in nanometer 36. For investigating the quality of coatings from the structural aspect, i.e. whether or not ZnO crystals have found obvious changes in structural properties and crystallite size during the calcination process, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the coated samples were assessed.The coated samples have been removed from mesh surface and grinded into fine powder before introducing to the XRD analyzer.Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of ZnO photocatalysts before and after calcination.The XRD results did not show any significant changes in the structure of ZnO as a consequence of the calcination and coating processes.It was concluded that calcination process did not have significant influence on crystalline morphologies of ZnO particles.No perceptible impurities can be recognized in the graphs.This is important for the stainless steel mesh coating, since iron impurities caused by heating the steel could have a negative effect on the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst.Fe 3 ions have been reported to be present in TiO 2 coated steel plates heated at 600 1C and more, but not at lower temperatures 44.As shown in Fig. 4, no new peak related to impurities was observed, indicating that the selected calcination temperature (350 1C) did not affect the crystal phase of ZnO and used iron alloy as support. Morphology of the prepared catalysts and stainless steel mesh were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The images were used to show how photocatalysts were coated on/in mesh network.As shown in Fig. 5, ZnO particles were immobilized in a uniform state between woven fabrics of mesh when zinc oxide slurry was containing 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO particles.However, amount of coating is low and insufficient at 5 g ZnO.Amount of immobilized ZnO on the surface of support was 0.37, 0.7 and 1.1 g when 5, 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO were used in slurry preparation, respectively. In order to evaluate the influence of operating parameters on the photocatalytic reduction efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 , totally 22 experiments with four main factors were performed.Amount of ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes (g/cm 2 ) (X 1 ), total pressure of feed (psi) (X 2 ), CO 2 :CH 4 :He feed ratio () (X 3 ) and UV light power (W) (X 4 ) were chosen as the experimental parameters, while the responses were CO 2 and CH 4 conversion.The experimental ranges and levels of the independent variables for photoreduction of CO 2 and CH 4 are given in Table 1.The UV-lamp power parameter was defined as a multilevel due to only available commercial UV lamp (was with power of 80, 125 and 250 W).Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the extreme values of the variables. Statistical combinations of the independent variables with the measured and predicted yield (after 5 h of irradiation) are described in Table 2.The following second-order polynomial response equation was used to correlate the dependent and independent variables: where Y shows the response variable of conversion efficiency.The b i presents regression coefficient for linear effects; b ij is the regression coefficients for interaction terms between x i and x j , b ii is coefficient for quadratic effects, and x i is the symbol of coded experimental levels of the variables.After fitting the obtained data for each parameter with the above experiments to full second-order models, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the models were performed and the models significance were examined 45.Since the full second-order models (models containing all two parameter interactions) were not accepted by the required tests, they were improved by elimination of the models terms until the determined conditions were fulfilled. While using the obtained results, an empirical relationship between the response and independent variables was achieved and expressed by the following second-order polynomial Experimental ranges and levels of the independent test variables. Ranges and levels Predicted photocatalytic conversion efficiencies by Eqs. ( 5) and ( 6) are presented in Table 2.The obtained results show well agreements between the experimental and predicted values of photocatalytic conversion efficiency.Comparison of the experimental results and the predicted values obtained from the model (Eqs.( 5) and ( 6)) showed that the predicted values reasonably well matched the experimental values with R 2 140.99 and R 2 140.984 for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion, respectively.This indicates that 99 and 98.4 of the variations for CO 2 and CH 4 percent, conversion efficiencies are described by the models.R 2 Adj is also a measure of goodness of a fit, but it is more appropriate for comparing models with different numbers of independent variables.If there are some additional terms in the model, Adj-R 2 may be visibly smaller than R 2 46,47.In this case, Adj-R 2 values for CO 2 and CH 4 (0.973, 0.972) were close to the related R 2 value (Table 3). Table 3 shows the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the obtained models.The F-value obtained for CO2 and CH 4 are 58.68 and 82.38 respectively, which is clearly greater than the tabulated F (5.94 at 99 significance for CO 2 and 4.41 at 99 significance for CH 4 ) confirming the adequacy of the model fits.The P-values of CO 2 and CH 4 conversion efficiency model parameters are given in Table 4.As can be seen, all of the considered parameters are significant and should be contained in the model.Also, the good agreement between the predicted and actual experimental values indicates that the models can predict the phenomena well (Table 4). The most significant parameters for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion is feed ratio (X 3 ) followed by total pressure (X 2 ).Whereas UV light power (X 4 ) and catalyst (X 1 ) have less importance among the four single parameters.On the other hand, CO 2 conversion efficiency is affected by quadratic (X 4 A X 4 , X 3 A X 3 , X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions While, CH 4 conversion is affected by quadratic (X 3 A X 3 and X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions (X 1 A X 2 , X 1 A X 4 , and X 2 A X 4 ). The response surface plot of photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 are shown in Figs. 6 and7, respectively.The maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.Also, the maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh. The photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO 2 slightly increases with increasing the UV light power (Fig. 6(a)).Higher light intensity provides higher energy for more ZnO particles to produce electron-hole pairs 48.As shown in Fig. 2 related to UV-visible spectra of calcinated zinc oxide, band gap of ZnO is high and needs high intensity light for excitation of electrons.CO 2 conversion efficiency increased by decreasing total pressure and feed ratio (Fig. 6(b)).At the higher pressure, conversion efficiency reduced due to high concentration of target molecules to react with the photocatalytic produced radicals.In addition, amount of conversion reduced in high ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 .It can be attributed to more stability of CO 2 related to CH 4 in reaction with active radicals.Also, CO 2 photocatalytic conversion increased with increasing ZnO due to increase in active surface of the photocatalyst (Fig. 6(c)).However, more increasing of coated ZnO from 8 g does not affect the conversion efficiency because of nonincreasing of photocatalyst surface and overlapping of formed catalyst layer. The maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh (Fig. 7).Conversion of methane increases by decreasing the pressure and increasing UV intensity (Fig. 7(a)).However, amount of CH 4 conversion is higher than CO 2 due to low stability and direct conversion of CH 4 as well as reductant role of it, in the presence of carbon dioxide.By increasing the CO 2 amount, conversion efficiency of CH 4 improves (Fig. 7(b)).High concentration of carbon dioxide prompts the reaction rate and leads to the decrease in CH 4 concentration, which acts as a reductant.Amount of conversion of both CO 2 and CH 4 is high in low pressure.The photogenerated radicals are not able to convert high concentration of the gasses to new products due to reduction of effective strike and interaction among photogenerated radicals and components.Increasing the amount of coated ZnO on mesh causes improvement in conversion efficiency due to increasing active sites (Fig. 7(c)).Also, CH 4 conversion was improved by decreasing pressure. The requested aim in terms of conversion efficiency was defined as ''maximize'' to attain highest treatment performance.As presented in Table 5, optimum condition of parameter values were predicted by the model with 8 g ZnO (2.65 mg/cm 2 ), 30 psi, (10 CO 2 :80 CH 4 :10 He) and 250 W. Also, the optimum values of the process variables for the maximum CH 4 conversion efficiency were 2.65 mg/cm 2 , 80 psi, (10:80:10) and 250 power light.At these optimum values, the predicted and observed conversion efficiency () were 12.5 and 11.9 for CO 2 and 15.7, and 15.2 for CH 4 , respectively.It implies that the strategy to optimize the conversion conditions and obtaining the maximal conversion efficiency by RSM for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 in this study is successful. Direct conversion of methane and carbon dioxide to oxygenated compounds was carried out over immobilized ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes.The conversion products were characterized using FTIR to identify photoconversion products in gas phase (Fig. 8).For gas feed, only three distinct peaks were observed.The peaks at 1303 cm A 1 (Fig. 8(a)) and 3016 cm A 1 correspond to the C-H stretch in methane 8, and 2360 cm A 1 peak (Fig. 8(b)) correspond to the OQCQO stretch in carbon dioxide 49.No other peaks were observed, indicating that no reaction occurred between CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of ZnO without irradiation.However, some spectral changes were detected after photoirradiation of coated ZnO in the presence of CO 2 and CH 4 .These results are very close to those observed for CO 2 adsorption and strong C-H peaks appeared on Cu-Co based catalysts 8.Also, the IR spectra of methane and carbon dioxide absorbed on Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 samples showed that the methane absorbed on the coupled semiconductor formed two absorption bonds at 3020 and 1300 cm A 1 , which indicate weak interaction between methane and coupled semiconductor.Moreover, the CO 2 absorbed generates some surface species, at 1389 and 1530 cm A 1 , indicating the formation of surface formate species 7. The intensity of the peaks was increased by time passing, showing more production of the related compounds.New bands in the region of 2600-3000 and 1200-2000 cm A 1 were observed as depicted in Table 6.In the range of 2600-3000 cm A 1 , six bands at 2958, 2927, 2885, 2825, 2806, and 2738 cm A 1 were observed (Fig. 8(c)).These peaks can be assigned to characteristic absorption band of methyl symmetric C-H stretching (2958 cm A 1 ), methyl asymmetric C-H stretching (2885 cm A 1 ), and bands between 2700 and 2900 cm A 1 can be attributed to aldehyde and ketone C-H stretching or methylene symmetric and asymmetric C-H stretching 31,50,51.Similar results are reported by Teramura et al. in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of CH 4 as a reductant over MgO 31.In the range of 2900-2700 cm A 1 , they observed that seven bands were assigned to W as (CH 3 ) (2962 cm A 1 ), W s (CH 3 ) (2935 cm A 1 ), and W(CH) (2874, 2831, 2804, 2753, and 2733 cm A 1 ). In the range of 1200-2000 cm A 1 , new bands appeared at 1754, 1716, 1683, 1652, 1616, 1575, 1558, 1541, 1458, 1436, 1396, 1365, 1355, and 1342 cm A 1 (Fig. 8 reported that bands at 1661, 1631, 1346, and 1313 cm A 1 are assigned to surface bidentate carbonates 31.In our case, appearance of these various peaks can be attributed to different compound groups such as aldehyde, ketone and carboxylic acid.However, with attention to presented mechanisms in literature 7,2829303132 for conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 on the semiconductor photocatalysts, the peaks can be assigned to production of formic and acetic acid derivatives.Also, the bands at 1616, 1541, 1458, 1396, 1355 cm A 1 are assigned to W as (O-C-O), s(CH), s(CH), and W s (O-C-O), respectively, indicate the formation of formate species 7,53,54.The band of 1683 cm A 1 can be assigned to stretching of HCO 3 55,56.

Ranges and levels Predicted photocatalytic conversion efficiencies by Eqs. ( 5) and ( 6) are presented in Table 2.The obtained results show well agreements between the experimental and predicted values of photocatalytic conversion efficiency.Comparison of the experimental results and the predicted values obtained from the model (Eqs.( 5) and ( 6)) showed that the predicted values reasonably well matched the experimental values with R 2 140.99 and R 2 140.984 for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion, respectively.This indicates that 99 and 98.4 of the variations for CO 2 and CH 4 percent, conversion efficiencies are described by the models.R 2 Adj is also a measure of goodness of a fit, but it is more appropriate for comparing models with different numbers of independent variables.If there are some additional terms in the model, Adj-R 2 may be visibly smaller than R 2 46,47.In this case, Adj-R 2 values for CO 2 and CH 4 (0.973, 0.972) were close to the related R 2 value (Table 3). Table 3 shows the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the obtained models.The F-value obtained for CO2 and CH 4 are 58.68 and 82.38 respectively, which is clearly greater than the tabulated F (5.94 at 99 significance for CO 2 and 4.41 at 99 significance for CH 4 ) confirming the adequacy of the model fits.The P-values of CO 2 and CH 4 conversion efficiency model parameters are given in Table 4.As can be seen, all of the considered parameters are significant and should be contained in the model.Also, the good agreement between the predicted and actual experimental values indicates that the models can predict the phenomena well (Table 4). The most significant parameters for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion is feed ratio (X 3 ) followed by total pressure (X 2 ).Whereas UV light power (X 4 ) and catalyst (X 1 ) have less importance among the four single parameters.On the other hand, CO 2 conversion efficiency is affected by quadratic (X 4 A X 4 , X 3 A X 3 , X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions While, CH 4 conversion is affected by quadratic (X 3 A X 3 and X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions (X 1 A X 2 , X 1 A X 4 , and X 2 A X 4 ). The response surface plot of photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 are shown in Figs. 6 and7, respectively.The maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.Also, the maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh. The photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO 2 slightly increases with increasing the UV light power (Fig. 6(a)).Higher light intensity provides higher energy for more ZnO particles to produce electron-hole pairs 48.As shown in Fig. 2 related to UV-visible spectra of calcinated zinc oxide, band gap of ZnO is high and needs high intensity light for excitation of electrons.CO 2 conversion efficiency increased by decreasing total pressure and feed ratio (Fig. 6(b)).At the higher pressure, conversion efficiency reduced due to high concentration of target molecules to react with the photocatalytic produced radicals.In addition, amount of conversion reduced in high ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 .It can be attributed to more stability of CO 2 related to CH 4 in reaction with active radicals.Also, CO 2 photocatalytic conversion increased with increasing ZnO due to increase in active surface of the photocatalyst (Fig. 6(c)).However, more increasing of coated ZnO from 8 g does not affect the conversion efficiency because of nonincreasing of photocatalyst surface and overlapping of formed catalyst layer. The maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh (Fig. 7).Conversion of methane increases by decreasing the pressure and increasing UV intensity (Fig. 7(a)).However, amount of CH 4 conversion is higher than CO 2 due to low stability and direct conversion of CH 4 as well as reductant role of it, in the presence of carbon dioxide.By increasing the CO 2 amount, conversion efficiency of CH 4 improves (Fig. 7(b)).High concentration of carbon dioxide prompts the reaction rate and leads to the decrease in CH 4 concentration, which acts as a reductant.Amount of conversion of both CO 2 and CH 4 is high in low pressure.The photogenerated radicals are not able to convert high concentration of the gasses to new products due to reduction of effective strike and interaction among photogenerated radicals and components.Increasing the amount of coated ZnO on mesh causes improvement in conversion efficiency due to increasing active sites (Fig. 7(c)).Also, CH 4 conversion was improved by decreasing pressure. The requested aim in terms of conversion efficiency was defined as ''maximize'' to attain highest treatment performance.As presented in Table 5, optimum condition of parameter values were predicted by the model with 8 g ZnO (2.65 mg/cm 2 ), 30 psi, (10 CO 2 :80 CH 4 :10 He) and 250 W. Also, the optimum values of the process variables for the maximum CH 4 conversion efficiency were 2.65 mg/cm 2 , 80 psi, (10:80:10) and 250 power light.At these optimum values, the predicted and observed conversion efficiency () were 12.5 and 11.9 for CO 2 and 15.7, and 15.2 for CH 4 , respectively.It implies that the strategy to optimize the conversion conditions and obtaining the maximal conversion efficiency by RSM for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 in this study is successful. Direct conversion of methane and carbon dioxide to oxygenated compounds was carried out over immobilized ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes.The conversion products were characterized using FTIR to identify photoconversion products in gas phase (Fig. 8).For gas feed, only three distinct peaks were observed.The peaks at 1303 cm A 1 (Fig. 8(a)) and 3016 cm A 1 correspond to the C-H stretch in methane 8, and 2360 cm A 1 peak (Fig. 8(b)) correspond to the OQCQO stretch in carbon dioxide 49.No other peaks were observed, indicating that no reaction occurred between CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of ZnO without irradiation.However, some spectral changes were detected after photoirradiation of coated ZnO in the presence of CO 2 and CH 4 .These results are very close to those observed for CO 2 adsorption and strong C-H peaks appeared on Cu-Co based catalysts 8.Also, the IR spectra of methane and carbon dioxide absorbed on Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 samples showed that the methane absorbed on the coupled semiconductor formed two absorption bonds at 3020 and 1300 cm A 1 , which indicate weak interaction between methane and coupled semiconductor.Moreover, the CO 2 absorbed generates some surface species, at 1389 and 1530 cm A 1 , indicating the formation of surface formate species 7. The intensity of the peaks was increased by time passing, showing more production of the related compounds.New bands in the region of 2600-3000 and 1200-2000 cm A 1 were observed as depicted in Table 6.In the range of 2600-3000 cm A 1 , six bands at 2958, 2927, 2885, 2825, 2806, and 2738 cm A 1 were observed (Fig. 8(c)).These peaks can be assigned to characteristic absorption band of methyl symmetric C-H stretching (2958 cm A 1 ), methyl asymmetric C-H stretching (2885 cm A 1 ), and bands between 2700 and 2900 cm A 1 can be attributed to aldehyde and ketone C-H stretching or methylene symmetric and asymmetric C-H stretching 31,50,51.Similar results are reported by Teramura et al. in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of CH 4 as a reductant over MgO 31.In the range of 2900-2700 cm A 1 , they observed that seven bands were assigned to W as (CH 3 ) (2962 cm A 1 ), W s (CH 3 ) (2935 cm A 1 ), and W(CH) (2874, 2831, 2804, 2753, and 2733 cm A 1 ). In the range of 1200-2000 cm A 1 , new bands appeared at 1754, 1716, 1683, 1652, 1616, 1575, 1558, 1541, 1458, 1436, 1396, 1365, 1355, and 1342 cm A 1 (Fig. 8 reported that bands at 1661, 1631, 1346, and 1313 cm A 1 are assigned to surface bidentate carbonates 31.In our case, appearance of these various peaks can be attributed to different compound groups such as aldehyde, ketone and carboxylic acid.However, with attention to presented mechanisms in literature 7,2829303132 for conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 on the semiconductor photocatalysts, the peaks can be assigned to production of formic and acetic acid derivatives.Also, the bands at 1616, 1541, 1458, 1396, 1355 cm A 1 are assigned to W as (O-C-O), s(CH), s(CH), and W s (O-C-O), respectively, indicate the formation of formate species 7,53,54.The band of 1683 cm A 1 can be assigned to stretching of HCO 3 55,56. In contrast, it was anticipated that the other bands were derived from acetate.The spectra related to acetic acid were observed at 1558 cm A 1 and 1436 cm A 1 .The acetic acid is expected to be dissociated form of acetate group 575859.The band at 1558 cm A 1 can be correlated to a C-O symmetric vibration mode 57.The bands at 1436, 1365, and 1342 cm A 1 are assigned to a C-H deformation vibration mode: s as (CH 3 ), s(CH), and s s (CH 3 ), respectively 58,59.In this regards, Shi et al. suggested a mechanism for photocatalytic conversion of CH 4 and CO 2 over Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 catalyst to ethane, acetone and acetic acid products 7."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "Conversion of methane increases by decreasing the pressure and increasing UV intensity (Fig. 7(a)).", "context": "The ZnO particles were coated on mesh by a simple and inexpensive method.For suitable immobilization and increasing durability of ZnO on the support, particles were calcinated after coating on the mesh surface.The optimum calcination temperature (350 1C) was selected from literature 42,43.It is reported that size of the particles were reduced by calcination method 42, which can increase surface area of catalyst.The calcination leads to decreasing agglomeration and uniform distribution of particles and therefore, increases the active surface of catalysts 36. The catalyst coated mesh showed a very good mechanical stability.Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the calcinated ZnO and commercial ZnO at room temperature.The absorption of UV-vis light is an important factor for the evolution of photocatalyst properties 37.It can be seen that calcination leads to improvement of UV-visible absorption intensity of the calcinated photocatalysts.Also, calcinations cause a little shifting of absorption peak to visible area.It can be concluded that the calcinated ZnO photocatalyst had a broad absorption band from ultraviolet to visible region and the maximum absorption peak was found at 387 nm.However, before calcinations, the commercial ZnO showed weaker absorption in the whole region.Also, the SEM images of surface structure of the commercial and calcinated ZnO is shown in Fig. 3.The comparison of calcinated ZnO structure (Fig. 3(a)) with commercial ZnO (Fig. 3(b)) shows that no significant differences were observed in agglomeration and particle size by calcination technique. On the basis of the maximum absorption wave, the band gap of the prepared calcinated ZnO photocatalyst can be estimated to 3.204 eV (Eq.( 3)), where E bg is the band-gap energy of the photocatalyst and l is the maximum wavelength in nanometer 36. For investigating the quality of coatings from the structural aspect, i.e. whether or not ZnO crystals have found obvious changes in structural properties and crystallite size during the calcination process, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the coated samples were assessed.The coated samples have been removed from mesh surface and grinded into fine powder before introducing to the XRD analyzer.Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of ZnO photocatalysts before and after calcination.The XRD results did not show any significant changes in the structure of ZnO as a consequence of the calcination and coating processes.It was concluded that calcination process did not have significant influence on crystalline morphologies of ZnO particles.No perceptible impurities can be recognized in the graphs.This is important for the stainless steel mesh coating, since iron impurities caused by heating the steel could have a negative effect on the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst.Fe 3 ions have been reported to be present in TiO 2 coated steel plates heated at 600 1C and more, but not at lower temperatures 44.As shown in Fig. 4, no new peak related to impurities was observed, indicating that the selected calcination temperature (350 1C) did not affect the crystal phase of ZnO and used iron alloy as support. Morphology of the prepared catalysts and stainless steel mesh were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The images were used to show how photocatalysts were coated on/in mesh network.As shown in Fig. 5, ZnO particles were immobilized in a uniform state between woven fabrics of mesh when zinc oxide slurry was containing 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO particles.However, amount of coating is low and insufficient at 5 g ZnO.Amount of immobilized ZnO on the surface of support was 0.37, 0.7 and 1.1 g when 5, 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO were used in slurry preparation, respectively. In order to evaluate the influence of operating parameters on the photocatalytic reduction efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 , totally 22 experiments with four main factors were performed.Amount of ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes (g/cm 2 ) (X 1 ), total pressure of feed (psi) (X 2 ), CO 2 :CH 4 :He feed ratio () (X 3 ) and UV light power (W) (X 4 ) were chosen as the experimental parameters, while the responses were CO 2 and CH 4 conversion.The experimental ranges and levels of the independent variables for photoreduction of CO 2 and CH 4 are given in Table 1.The UV-lamp power parameter was defined as a multilevel due to only available commercial UV lamp (was with power of 80, 125 and 250 W).Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the extreme values of the variables. Statistical combinations of the independent variables with the measured and predicted yield (after 5 h of irradiation) are described in Table 2.The following second-order polynomial response equation was used to correlate the dependent and independent variables: where Y shows the response variable of conversion efficiency.The b i presents regression coefficient for linear effects; b ij is the regression coefficients for interaction terms between x i and x j , b ii is coefficient for quadratic effects, and x i is the symbol of coded experimental levels of the variables.After fitting the obtained data for each parameter with the above experiments to full second-order models, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the models were performed and the models significance were examined 45.Since the full second-order models (models containing all two parameter interactions) were not accepted by the required tests, they were improved by elimination of the models terms until the determined conditions were fulfilled. While using the obtained results, an empirical relationship between the response and independent variables was achieved and expressed by the following second-order polynomial Experimental ranges and levels of the independent test variables. Ranges and levels Predicted photocatalytic conversion efficiencies by Eqs. ( 5) and ( 6) are presented in Table 2.The obtained results show well agreements between the experimental and predicted values of photocatalytic conversion efficiency.Comparison of the experimental results and the predicted values obtained from the model (Eqs.( 5) and ( 6)) showed that the predicted values reasonably well matched the experimental values with R 2 140.99 and R 2 140.984 for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion, respectively.This indicates that 99 and 98.4 of the variations for CO 2 and CH 4 percent, conversion efficiencies are described by the models.R 2 Adj is also a measure of goodness of a fit, but it is more appropriate for comparing models with different numbers of independent variables.If there are some additional terms in the model, Adj-R 2 may be visibly smaller than R 2 46,47.In this case, Adj-R 2 values for CO 2 and CH 4 (0.973, 0.972) were close to the related R 2 value (Table 3). Table 3 shows the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the obtained models.The F-value obtained for CO2 and CH 4 are 58.68 and 82.38 respectively, which is clearly greater than the tabulated F (5.94 at 99 significance for CO 2 and 4.41 at 99 significance for CH 4 ) confirming the adequacy of the model fits.The P-values of CO 2 and CH 4 conversion efficiency model parameters are given in Table 4.As can be seen, all of the considered parameters are significant and should be contained in the model.Also, the good agreement between the predicted and actual experimental values indicates that the models can predict the phenomena well (Table 4). The most significant parameters for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion is feed ratio (X 3 ) followed by total pressure (X 2 ).Whereas UV light power (X 4 ) and catalyst (X 1 ) have less importance among the four single parameters.On the other hand, CO 2 conversion efficiency is affected by quadratic (X 4 A X 4 , X 3 A X 3 , X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions While, CH 4 conversion is affected by quadratic (X 3 A X 3 and X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions (X 1 A X 2 , X 1 A X 4 , and X 2 A X 4 ). The response surface plot of photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 are shown in Figs. 6 and7, respectively.The maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.Also, the maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh. The photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO 2 slightly increases with increasing the UV light power (Fig. 6(a)).Higher light intensity provides higher energy for more ZnO particles to produce electron-hole pairs 48.As shown in Fig. 2 related to UV-visible spectra of calcinated zinc oxide, band gap of ZnO is high and needs high intensity light for excitation of electrons.CO 2 conversion efficiency increased by decreasing total pressure and feed ratio (Fig. 6(b)).At the higher pressure, conversion efficiency reduced due to high concentration of target molecules to react with the photocatalytic produced radicals.In addition, amount of conversion reduced in high ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 .It can be attributed to more stability of CO 2 related to CH 4 in reaction with active radicals.Also, CO 2 photocatalytic conversion increased with increasing ZnO due to increase in active surface of the photocatalyst (Fig. 6(c)).However, more increasing of coated ZnO from 8 g does not affect the conversion efficiency because of nonincreasing of photocatalyst surface and overlapping of formed catalyst layer. The maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh (Fig. 7).Conversion of methane increases by decreasing the pressure and increasing UV intensity (Fig. 7(a)).However, amount of CH 4 conversion is higher than CO 2 due to low stability and direct conversion of CH 4 as well as reductant role of it, in the presence of carbon dioxide.By increasing the CO 2 amount, conversion efficiency of CH 4 improves (Fig. 7(b)).High concentration of carbon dioxide prompts the reaction rate and leads to the decrease in CH 4 concentration, which acts as a reductant.Amount of conversion of both CO 2 and CH 4 is high in low pressure.The photogenerated radicals are not able to convert high concentration of the gasses to new products due to reduction of effective strike and interaction among photogenerated radicals and components.Increasing the amount of coated ZnO on mesh causes improvement in conversion efficiency due to increasing active sites (Fig. 7(c)).Also, CH 4 conversion was improved by decreasing pressure. The requested aim in terms of conversion efficiency was defined as ''maximize'' to attain highest treatment performance.As presented in Table 5, optimum condition of parameter values were predicted by the model with 8 g ZnO (2.65 mg/cm 2 ), 30 psi, (10 CO 2 :80 CH 4 :10 He) and 250 W. Also, the optimum values of the process variables for the maximum CH 4 conversion efficiency were 2.65 mg/cm 2 , 80 psi, (10:80:10) and 250 power light.At these optimum values, the predicted and observed conversion efficiency () were 12.5 and 11.9 for CO 2 and 15.7, and 15.2 for CH 4 , respectively.It implies that the strategy to optimize the conversion conditions and obtaining the maximal conversion efficiency by RSM for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 in this study is successful. Direct conversion of methane and carbon dioxide to oxygenated compounds was carried out over immobilized ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes.The conversion products were characterized using FTIR to identify photoconversion products in gas phase (Fig. 8).For gas feed, only three distinct peaks were observed.The peaks at 1303 cm A 1 (Fig. 8(a)) and 3016 cm A 1 correspond to the C-H stretch in methane 8, and 2360 cm A 1 peak (Fig. 8(b)) correspond to the OQCQO stretch in carbon dioxide 49.No other peaks were observed, indicating that no reaction occurred between CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of ZnO without irradiation.However, some spectral changes were detected after photoirradiation of coated ZnO in the presence of CO 2 and CH 4 .These results are very close to those observed for CO 2 adsorption and strong C-H peaks appeared on Cu-Co based catalysts 8.Also, the IR spectra of methane and carbon dioxide absorbed on Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 samples showed that the methane absorbed on the coupled semiconductor formed two absorption bonds at 3020 and 1300 cm A 1 , which indicate weak interaction between methane and coupled semiconductor.Moreover, the CO 2 absorbed generates some surface species, at 1389 and 1530 cm A 1 , indicating the formation of surface formate species 7. The intensity of the peaks was increased by time passing, showing more production of the related compounds.New bands in the region of 2600-3000 and 1200-2000 cm A 1 were observed as depicted in Table 6.In the range of 2600-3000 cm A 1 , six bands at 2958, 2927, 2885, 2825, 2806, and 2738 cm A 1 were observed (Fig. 8(c)).These peaks can be assigned to characteristic absorption band of methyl symmetric C-H stretching (2958 cm A 1 ), methyl asymmetric C-H stretching (2885 cm A 1 ), and bands between 2700 and 2900 cm A 1 can be attributed to aldehyde and ketone C-H stretching or methylene symmetric and asymmetric C-H stretching 31,50,51.Similar results are reported by Teramura et al. in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of CH 4 as a reductant over MgO 31.In the range of 2900-2700 cm A 1 , they observed that seven bands were assigned to W as (CH 3 ) (2962 cm A 1 ), W s (CH 3 ) (2935 cm A 1 ), and W(CH) (2874, 2831, 2804, 2753, and 2733 cm A 1 ). In the range of 1200-2000 cm A 1 , new bands appeared at 1754, 1716, 1683, 1652, 1616, 1575, 1558, 1541, 1458, 1436, 1396, 1365, 1355, and 1342 cm A 1 (Fig. 8 reported that bands at 1661, 1631, 1346, and 1313 cm A 1 are assigned to surface bidentate carbonates 31.In our case, appearance of these various peaks can be attributed to different compound groups such as aldehyde, ketone and carboxylic acid.However, with attention to presented mechanisms in literature 7,2829303132 for conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 on the semiconductor photocatalysts, the peaks can be assigned to production of formic and acetic acid derivatives.Also, the bands at 1616, 1541, 1458, 1396, 1355 cm A 1 are assigned to W as (O-C-O), s(CH), s(CH), and W s (O-C-O), respectively, indicate the formation of formate species 7,53,54.The band of 1683 cm A 1 can be assigned to stretching of HCO 3 55,56.

Table 3 shows the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the obtained models.The F-value obtained for CO2 and CH 4 are 58.68 and 82.38 respectively, which is clearly greater than the tabulated F (5.94 at 99 significance for CO 2 and 4.41 at 99 significance for CH 4 ) confirming the adequacy of the model fits.The P-values of CO 2 and CH 4 conversion efficiency model parameters are given in Table 4.As can be seen, all of the considered parameters are significant and should be contained in the model.Also, the good agreement between the predicted and actual experimental values indicates that the models can predict the phenomena well (Table 4). The most significant parameters for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion is feed ratio (X 3 ) followed by total pressure (X 2 ).Whereas UV light power (X 4 ) and catalyst (X 1 ) have less importance among the four single parameters.On the other hand, CO 2 conversion efficiency is affected by quadratic (X 4 A X 4 , X 3 A X 3 , X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions While, CH 4 conversion is affected by quadratic (X 3 A X 3 and X 2 A X 2 ) and two-way interactions (X 1 A X 2 , X 1 A X 4 , and X 2 A X 4 ). The response surface plot of photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 are shown in Figs. 6 and7, respectively.The maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.Also, the maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh. The photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO 2 slightly increases with increasing the UV light power (Fig. 6(a)).Higher light intensity provides higher energy for more ZnO particles to produce electron-hole pairs 48.As shown in Fig. 2 related to UV-visible spectra of calcinated zinc oxide, band gap of ZnO is high and needs high intensity light for excitation of electrons.CO 2 conversion efficiency increased by decreasing total pressure and feed ratio (Fig. 6(b)).At the higher pressure, conversion efficiency reduced due to high concentration of target molecules to react with the photocatalytic produced radicals.In addition, amount of conversion reduced in high ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 .It can be attributed to more stability of CO 2 related to CH 4 in reaction with active radicals.Also, CO 2 photocatalytic conversion increased with increasing ZnO due to increase in active surface of the photocatalyst (Fig. 6(c)).However, more increasing of coated ZnO from 8 g does not affect the conversion efficiency because of nonincreasing of photocatalyst surface and overlapping of formed catalyst layer. The maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh (Fig. 7).Conversion of methane increases by decreasing the pressure and increasing UV intensity (Fig. 7(a)).However, amount of CH 4 conversion is higher than CO 2 due to low stability and direct conversion of CH 4 as well as reductant role of it, in the presence of carbon dioxide.By increasing the CO 2 amount, conversion efficiency of CH 4 improves (Fig. 7(b)).High concentration of carbon dioxide prompts the reaction rate and leads to the decrease in CH 4 concentration, which acts as a reductant.Amount of conversion of both CO 2 and CH 4 is high in low pressure.The photogenerated radicals are not able to convert high concentration of the gasses to new products due to reduction of effective strike and interaction among photogenerated radicals and components.Increasing the amount of coated ZnO on mesh causes improvement in conversion efficiency due to increasing active sites (Fig. 7(c)).Also, CH 4 conversion was improved by decreasing pressure. The requested aim in terms of conversion efficiency was defined as ''maximize'' to attain highest treatment performance.As presented in Table 5, optimum condition of parameter values were predicted by the model with 8 g ZnO (2.65 mg/cm 2 ), 30 psi, (10 CO 2 :80 CH 4 :10 He) and 250 W. Also, the optimum values of the process variables for the maximum CH 4 conversion efficiency were 2.65 mg/cm 2 , 80 psi, (10:80:10) and 250 power light.At these optimum values, the predicted and observed conversion efficiency () were 12.5 and 11.9 for CO 2 and 15.7, and 15.2 for CH 4 , respectively.It implies that the strategy to optimize the conversion conditions and obtaining the maximal conversion efficiency by RSM for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 in this study is successful. Direct conversion of methane and carbon dioxide to oxygenated compounds was carried out over immobilized ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes.The conversion products were characterized using FTIR to identify photoconversion products in gas phase (Fig. 8).For gas feed, only three distinct peaks were observed.The peaks at 1303 cm A 1 (Fig. 8(a)) and 3016 cm A 1 correspond to the C-H stretch in methane 8, and 2360 cm A 1 peak (Fig. 8(b)) correspond to the OQCQO stretch in carbon dioxide 49.No other peaks were observed, indicating that no reaction occurred between CH 4 and CO 2 in the presence of ZnO without irradiation.However, some spectral changes were detected after photoirradiation of coated ZnO in the presence of CO 2 and CH 4 .These results are very close to those observed for CO 2 adsorption and strong C-H peaks appeared on Cu-Co based catalysts 8.Also, the IR spectra of methane and carbon dioxide absorbed on Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 samples showed that the methane absorbed on the coupled semiconductor formed two absorption bonds at 3020 and 1300 cm A 1 , which indicate weak interaction between methane and coupled semiconductor.Moreover, the CO 2 absorbed generates some surface species, at 1389 and 1530 cm A 1 , indicating the formation of surface formate species 7. The intensity of the peaks was increased by time passing, showing more production of the related compounds.New bands in the region of 2600-3000 and 1200-2000 cm A 1 were observed as depicted in Table 6.In the range of 2600-3000 cm A 1 , six bands at 2958, 2927, 2885, 2825, 2806, and 2738 cm A 1 were observed (Fig. 8(c)).These peaks can be assigned to characteristic absorption band of methyl symmetric C-H stretching (2958 cm A 1 ), methyl asymmetric C-H stretching (2885 cm A 1 ), and bands between 2700 and 2900 cm A 1 can be attributed to aldehyde and ketone C-H stretching or methylene symmetric and asymmetric C-H stretching 31,50,51.Similar results are reported by Teramura et al. in photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of CH 4 as a reductant over MgO 31.In the range of 2900-2700 cm A 1 , they observed that seven bands were assigned to W as (CH 3 ) (2962 cm A 1 ), W s (CH 3 ) (2935 cm A 1 ), and W(CH) (2874, 2831, 2804, 2753, and 2733 cm A 1 ). In the range of 1200-2000 cm A 1 , new bands appeared at 1754, 1716, 1683, 1652, 1616, 1575, 1558, 1541, 1458, 1436, 1396, 1365, 1355, and 1342 cm A 1 (Fig. 8 reported that bands at 1661, 1631, 1346, and 1313 cm A 1 are assigned to surface bidentate carbonates 31.In our case, appearance of these various peaks can be attributed to different compound groups such as aldehyde, ketone and carboxylic acid.However, with attention to presented mechanisms in literature 7,2829303132 for conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 on the semiconductor photocatalysts, the peaks can be assigned to production of formic and acetic acid derivatives.Also, the bands at 1616, 1541, 1458, 1396, 1355 cm A 1 are assigned to W as (O-C-O), s(CH), s(CH), and W s (O-C-O), respectively, indicate the formation of formate species 7,53,54.The band of 1683 cm A 1 can be assigned to stretching of HCO 3 55,56. In contrast, it was anticipated that the other bands were derived from acetate.The spectra related to acetic acid were observed at 1558 cm A 1 and 1436 cm A 1 .The acetic acid is expected to be dissociated form of acetate group 575859.The band at 1558 cm A 1 can be correlated to a C-O symmetric vibration mode 57.The bands at 1436, 1365, and 1342 cm A 1 are assigned to a C-H deformation vibration mode: s as (CH 3 ), s(CH), and s s (CH 3 ), respectively 58,59.In this regards, Shi et al. suggested a mechanism for photocatalytic conversion of CH 4 and CO 2 over Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 catalyst to ethane, acetone and acetic acid products 7."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and CH4 using ZnO coated mesh: Effect of operational parameters and optimization", "context": "Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and CH4 using ZnO coated mesh: Effect of operational parameters and optimization"}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Different properties of commercial and calcinated photocatalysts on mesh surface were characterized using XRD, SEM and UV-vis analysis, and photoreduction products were identified using GC-TCD and FTIR in gas medium.", "context": "In this study, immobilized ZnO semiconductor on stainless steel mesh was used in photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ).To determine optimum conditions of photoreduction of CO 2 and CH 4 , one of the experimental design techniques i.e. response surface methodology (RSM) was applied.Different properties of commercial and calcinated photocatalysts on mesh surface were characterized using XRD, SEM and UV-vis analysis, and photoreduction products were identified using GC-TCD and FTIR in gas medium.Calcination of coated ZnO increased the absorption of UV-vis light, reduced the agglomeration and led to uniform structure of photocatalyst.Optimization of experimental conditions indicate that maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.Also, the products of the conversion were characterized to be formate and acetate derivatives."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was recorded using MB160 FTIR spectrometer (ABB Bomem Inc., Canada) with a special designed cell to characterize photoreduction products in gas phase.", "context": "ZnO (Wurtzite hexagonal structure) was purchased from Merck Company, and used to coat on 120 mesh size stainless steel mesh.The ultra-high purity CO 2 , CH 4 and He gases were used as feeds and neutral mediums.Ethanol (96), nitric acid (65), hydrochloric acid (37) and acetone were obtained from Merck.The deionized water was used in catalyst preparation. Immobilization of ZnO particles on stainless steel meshes was done using a simple and efficient method which is ideal for industrial applications.This technique was originally developed by scientists at Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECN) for deposition of TiO 2 on quartz slides to prepare solar cells 38.Previously stainless steel has been reported to be used as a support for TiO 2 nanoparticles 34,39,40, which was selected here because of its large surface area, good ventilation for gases passing and its resistance to various corrosions.For coating support with zinc oxide, different amount of ZnO powder (5, 6.5 and 8 g) was added to 60 mL ethanol and stirred for 1 h.Ethanol was selected as solvent due to good dispersion of ZnO in a cloud-shape manner.Then, 20 mL of dilute nitric acid with a pH of 3.5 was added drop wise to slurry in order to supply a suitable acidity media in which the slurry becomes uniform and stable. The meshes were earlier shaped in cylindrical form and cleaned with hydrochloric acid (0.01 M), acetone and distilled water to remove any organic and inorganic attached materials or adsorbed on surface and dried under atmospheric conditions.To coat ZnO on stainless steel meshes with area of 415 cm 2 , the meshes were immersed for 1 min in 80 mL well dispersed slurry that was prepared by stirring for at least 60 min.Then the mesh was dried for 12 h at 120 1C.Finally, ZnO coated mesh was calcinated at 350 1C for 30 min.Amounts of coated ZnO which are directly dependent on slurry concentration in immersion step were 0.37, 0.7 and 1.1 g, when 5, 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO were used in slurry preparation, respectively. The XRD patterns of samples were recorded using EQUINOX diffractometer (Inel Company) operating with a Cu anode and a sealed X-ray tube.Also, in order to probe ZnO coated on the surface of stainless steel meshes, scanning electron microscope (SEM, Philips, XL30, Netherland) was utilized.A Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode-array UV-vis spectrophotometer equipped with a 1.0 mm path length quartz micro-cell.In addition, quantitative determination of photocatalyst products was determined by using on-line commercial gas chromatograph GC-CGCA-1 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was recorded using MB160 FTIR spectrometer (ABB Bomem Inc., Canada) with a special designed cell to characterize photoreduction products in gas phase. In order to assess the photoreduction ability of the prepared catalysts, conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 , under UV illumination was carried out in a self-designed photocatalytic reactor.The photoreactor was constructed from glossy stainless steel with an effective volume of about 1000 mL.Usage of glossy stainless steel metal inhibit the gas and carbonaceous residues adsorption into the reactor.Also, to ensure removal of adsorbing CO 2 and other surface species, before each experiment, a cycle of heating to 85 1C and then flushing with hydrogen are used 41.The schematic of experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1.The stainless steel mesh coated with ZnO (mesh substrate area of 450 cm 2 ) was located in the reactor and UV lamp was placed in center of reactor to direct irradiation on the catalyst surface.The photoreactor, comprised of coated titanium dioxide over the mesh was assembled to transmit and spread light uniformly.In order to reduce water interference, the reactor was vacuumed and He was passed before entering CO 2 and CH 4 to the photoreactor, and then the photoreactor was filled by gaseous feed (CO 2 , CH 4 and He).Following that, it is illuminated by UV lamp for maximum 5 h continuously and products were analyzed through on-line GC.The photocatalytic activity was calculated on the basis of CO 2 and CH 4 conversions, formulated as follows: where (CO 2 i and CH 4 i ) and (CO 2 and CH 4 ) are the concentration of CO 2 and CH 4 in the beginning and different time of the reaction, respectively. In the present study D-optimal, which is a widely used form of RSM was applied for optimization and comparison of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 and CH 4 .The MODDE 8.02 software from Umetric (Ume a, Sweden) was employed to fit the polynomial model to the independent variables and optimization of it using RSM.Subsequently, the adequacy of the model was tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA).Calculated factors correctly recognize significance of main effects, interactions between factors and the produced model.The significance level was identified by F-test method.The calculated F-values are compared with critical values of F 0 at 95 confidence limit that presented in statistical tables."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The conversion products were characterized using FTIR to identify photoconversion products in gas phase (Fig. 8).", "context": "The ZnO particles were coated on mesh by a simple and inexpensive method.For suitable immobilization and increasing durability of ZnO on the support, particles were calcinated after coating on the mesh surface.The optimum calcination temperature (350 1C) was selected from literature 42,43.It is reported that size of the particles were reduced by calcination method 42, which can increase surface area of catalyst.The calcination leads to decreasing agglomeration and uniform distribution of particles and therefore, increases the active surface of catalysts 36. The catalyst coated mesh showed a very good mechanical stability.Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the calcinated ZnO and commercial ZnO at room temperature.The absorption of UV-vis light is an important factor for the evolution of photocatalyst properties 37.It can be seen that calcination leads to improvement of UV-visible absorption intensity of the calcinated photocatalysts.Also, calcinations cause a little shifting of absorption peak to visible area.It can be concluded that the calcinated ZnO photocatalyst had a broad absorption band from ultraviolet to visible region and the maximum absorption peak was found at 387 nm.However, before calcinations, the commercial ZnO showed weaker absorption in the whole region.Also, the SEM images of surface structure of the commercial and calcinated ZnO is shown in Fig. 3.The comparison of calcinated ZnO structure (Fig. 3(a)) with commercial ZnO (Fig. 3(b)) shows that no significant differences were observed in agglomeration and particle size by calcination technique. On the basis of the maximum absorption wave, the band gap of the prepared calcinated ZnO photocatalyst can be estimated to 3.204 eV (Eq.( 3)), where E bg is the band-gap energy of the photocatalyst and l is the maximum wavelength in nanometer 36. For investigating the quality of coatings from the structural aspect, i.e. whether or not ZnO crystals have found obvious changes in structural properties and crystallite size during the calcination process, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the coated samples were assessed.The coated samples have been removed from mesh surface and grinded into fine powder before introducing to the XRD analyzer.Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of ZnO photocatalysts before and after calcination.The XRD results did not show any significant changes in the structure of ZnO as a consequence of the calcination and coating processes.It was concluded that calcination process did not have significant influence on crystalline morphologies of ZnO particles.No perceptible impurities can be recognized in the graphs.This is important for the stainless steel mesh coating, since iron impurities caused by heating the steel could have a negative effect on the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst.Fe 3 ions have been reported to be present in TiO 2 coated steel plates heated at 600 1C and more, but not at lower temperatures 44.As shown in Fig. 4, no new peak related to impurities was observed, indicating that the selected calcination temperature (350 1C) did not affect the crystal phase of ZnO and used iron alloy as support. Morphology of the prepared catalysts and stainless steel mesh were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The images were used to show how photocatalysts were coated on/in mesh network.As shown in Fig. 5, ZnO particles were immobilized in a uniform state between woven fabrics of mesh when zinc oxide slurry was containing 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO particles.However, amount of coating is low and insufficient at 5 g ZnO.Amount of immobilized ZnO on the surface of support was 0.37, 0.7 and 1.1 g when 5, 6.5 and 8 g of ZnO were used in slurry preparation, respectively. In order to evaluate the influence of operating parameters on the photocatalytic reduction efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 , totally 22 experiments with four main factors were performed.Amount of ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes (g/cm 2 ) (X 1 ), total pressure of feed (psi) (X 2 ), CO 2 :CH 4 :He feed ratio () (X 3 ) and UV light power (W) (X 4 ) were chosen as the experimental parameters, while the responses were CO 2 and CH 4 conversion.The experimental ranges and levels of the independent variables for photoreduction of CO 2 and CH 4 are given in Table 1.The UV-lamp power parameter was defined as a multilevel due to only available commercial UV lamp (was with power of 80, 125 and 250 W).Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the extreme values of the variables. Statistical combinations of the independent variables with the measured and predicted yield (after 5 h of irradiation) are described in Table 2.The following second-order polynomial response equation was used to correlate the dependent and independent variables: where Y shows the response variable of conversion efficiency.The b i presents regression coefficient for linear effects; b ij is the regression coefficients for interaction terms between x i and x j , b ii is coefficient for quadratic effects, and x i is the symbol of coded experimental levels of the variables.After fitting the obtained data for each parameter with the above experiments to full second-order models, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the models were performed and the models significance were examined 45.Since the full second-order models (models containing all two parameter interactions) were not accepted by the required tests, they were improved by elimination of the models terms until the determined conditions were fulfilled. While using the obtained results, an empirical relationship between the response and independent variables was achieved and expressed by the following second-order polynomial Experimental ranges and levels of the independent test variables. Ranges and levels Predicted photocatalytic conversion efficiencies by Eqs. ( 5) and ( 6) are presented in Table 2.The obtained results show well agreements between the experimental and predicted values of photocatalytic conversion efficiency.Comparison of the experimental results and the predicted values obtained from the model (Eqs.( 5) and ( 6)) showed that the predicted values reasonably well matched the experimental values with R 2 140.99 and R 2 140.984 for CO 2 and CH 4 conversion, respectively.This indicates that 99 and 98.4 of the variations for CO 2 and CH 4 percent, conversion efficiencies are described by the models.R 2 Adj is also a measure of goodness of a fit, but it is more appropriate for comparing models with different numbers of independent variables.If there are some additional terms in the model, Adj-R 2 may be visibly smaller than R 2 46,47.In this case, Adj-R 2 values for CO 2 and CH 4 (0.973, 0.972) were close to the related R 2 value (Table 3). Table 3 shows the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the obtained models.The F-value obtained for CO2 and CH 4 are 58.68 and 82.38 respectively, which is clearly greater than the tabulated F (5.94 at 99 significance for CO 2 and 4.41 at 99 significance for CH 4 ) confirming the adequacy of the model fits.The P-values of CO 2 and CH 4 conversion efficiency model parameters are given in Table 4.As can be seen, all of the considered parameters are significant and should be contained in the model.Also, the good agreement between the predicted and actual experimental values indicates that the models can predict the phenomena well (Table 4).

The response surface plot of photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 and CH 4 are shown in Figs. 6 and7, respectively.The maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.Also, the maximum conversion of methane was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 80, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.

Also, the optimum values of the process variables for the maximum CH 4 conversion efficiency were 2.65 mg/cm 2 , 80 psi, (10:80:10) and 250 power light.At these optimum values, the predicted and observed conversion efficiency () were 12.5 and 11.9 for CO 2 and 15.7, and 15.2 for CH 4 , respectively.It implies that the strategy to optimize the conversion conditions and obtaining the maximal conversion efficiency by RSM for photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 in this study is successful.

In contrast, it was anticipated that the other bands were derived from acetate.The spectra related to acetic acid were observed at 1558 cm A 1 and 1436 cm A 1 .The acetic acid is expected to be dissociated form of acetate group 575859.The band at 1558 cm A 1 can be correlated to a C-O symmetric vibration mode 57.The bands at 1436, 1365, and 1342 cm A 1 are assigned to a C-H deformation vibration mode: s as (CH 3 ), s(CH), and s s (CH 3 ), respectively 58,59.In this regards, Shi et al. suggested a mechanism for photocatalytic conversion of CH 4 and CO 2 over Cu/CdS-TiO 2 /SiO 2 catalyst to ethane, acetone and acetic acid products 7."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The products of photoreduction were identified by FTIR in gas medium using Fig. 1.", "context": "This study showed the application of experimental design technique and response surface methodology for determining the optimal operation variables in photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and CH 4 using calcinated immobilized ZnO coated on stainless steel meshes.The results generated from the statistical analysis and model evaluation revealed that the RSM method can be effectively adopted to optimize operation variables and the experimental values agreed with the predicted ones.The significant effective parameters on the conversion efficiency such as amount of coated calcinated ZnO, CO 2 :CH 4 :He feed ratio, reactor initial pressure (total pressure) and UV intensity were investigated.Comparison of calcinated ZnO structure with commercial ZnO shows that agglomeration of particles was reduced by calcination technique.Optimizing experimental conditions indicated that the maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO 2 ratio of 10, UV light power of 250 W, total pressure of 30 psi and 8 g ZnO coated on mesh.The products of photoreduction were identified by FTIR in gas medium using Fig. 1.Schematic diagram of photoreactor and experimental setup.
