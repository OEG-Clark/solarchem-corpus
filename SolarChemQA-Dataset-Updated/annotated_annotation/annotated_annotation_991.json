Raman analysis of WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples have been demonstrated in Fig. 2 (b).Pure WO 3 bands appeared at 132.7, 185.9, 269.5, 325.4,716.5 and 805.7 cm -1 , in which, the stretching vibration of WeO bands appeared at 716.5 and 805.7 cm -1 , whereas, bands appeared at 269.5 and 325.4 cm -1 reflect modes of oxygen in WeOWe 33.The Raman peaks for the g-C 3 N 4 appeared at 322.6, 476.3, 708.1, 763.9, 978.9, 1115.7,1235.9, 1481.5 and 1625.1 cm -1 .The bending modes at 322.6, 476.3, 708.1, 763.9, 978.9, 1115.7 and 1235.8 cm -1 are relating to graphitic carbon nitride with polymeric structure.However, modes at 1481.5 and 1625.1 cm -1 ascribed to the presence of D-band and G-band of carbon in the g-C 3 N 4 .In the characteristic modes of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 , Raman modes appeared at 135.7, 210.8, 476.5, 708.3, 805.7, 978.9 and 1235.9 cm -1 .Obviously, there was a shift in the peaks of WO 3 , confirming good interaction of both the materials to form heterojunction for the proficient transfer of charge carriers. The morphology of g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 was further explored using FESEM as demonstrated in Fig. 3.It can be seen that g-C 3 N 4 synthesized by heating melamine has two-dimensional layered structure as shown in Fig. 3 (a).Fig. 3 (b-c) shows obvious g-C 3 N 4 NS wrapped over WO 3 microspheres to give larger exposed external surface.Some g-C 3 N 4 sheets were also attached with WO 3 .In this way, a g-C 3 N 4 /WO 3 heterojunction with good interaction to construct Z-scheme heterojunction was achieved.More interestingly, g-C 3 N 4 /WO 3 has hollow microspheres with multiple channels to construct a 3D hollow microsphere as demonstrated in Fig. 3 (d-f).This would provide more interaction among the semiconductors with more pathways of light absorption and faster sorption process.Consequently, this combination is more compact and promotes charge carrier separation with superior transmission of electrons.Thus, constructing 3D WO 3 microspheres with hollow structure coupled with 2D g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets would enable penetration of light irradiations with a high sorption process to maximize the photoactivity.The interaction among the semiconductors with elements distribution was further investigated using EDX mapping analysis as demonstrated in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 (a) reveals the interaction of structured WO 3 with g-C 3 N 4 .EDX spectra with obvious peaks of all the elements which include W, C, N and O has been shown in Fig. 4 (b).Fig. 4 (c-d) shows EDX mapping analysis with uniform distribution of all the elements over the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite surface.Thus, WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite would be constructed using single-step hydrothermal approach with good interaction among the semiconductors and would be beneficial to promote photocatalytic activity. The structure and interaction of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 microspheres was further examined using TEM and HRTEM.TEM images in Fig. 5 (a-b) displays large size microspheres with good interaction of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.This was obviously due to controlled growth of WO 3 hollow microspheres in the presence of g-C 3 N 4 through hydrothermal approach.Furthermore, HRTEM analysis was conducted to identify heterojunction formation and lattice fringes of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .HRTEM image in Fig. 5 (c) confirms the successful formation of heterojunction with their good interactions to maximize exposed active surface area.Fig. 5 (d-f) reveals lattice fringes of 0.36 and 0.37 nm for WO 3 and 0.32 nm for g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.All these findings confirm successful fabrication of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction with good interfacial interaction, thus, would be beneficial for interfacial charge transportation and separation. Fig. 6 (a) shows diffuse reflectance spectra for WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Obviously, WO 3 has highest visible light absorption capacity compared to g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.The absorption wavelength for all the samples was observed above 400 nm, confirming their proficient visible light absorption.The energy band gap was calculated according to Tauc plot as demonstrated in Fig. 6 (b).The band gap energies for WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 samples were determined to be 2.80, 2.89 and 2.97 eV, respectively.It could be seen that band gap energy was somewhat increased after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with WO 3 microspheres to construct WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite.Previously, we reported a band gap energy of 2.70 eV for bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which was reduced to 2.63 eV in surface charge modified graphitic carbon nanotubes 34.In general, bulk g-C 3 N 4 has a band gap energy of 2.70 eV, which can be shifted towards higher or lower values depending on structure and surface modification of graphitic carbon nitride.Similarly, commercial WO 3 has a band gap energy of 2.70 eV, which can be increased or decreased by fabricating WO 3 with different structures such as nanorods and microspheres.For example, a band gap energy for commercial WO 3 of 2.70 eV has been reported by Raza and coworkers, which was increased to 2.76 in structured WO 3 35.In another report, a band gap energy of 2.79 eV has been reported for WO 3 nanosheets 36.All these findings confirm that band gap energy of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 can be altered with their structural modification and protonation.Thus, band gap energy of g-C 3 N 4 was increased towards higher value due to surface modification, whereas, WO 3 band gap energy was increased due to developing microspheres.When, g-C 3 N 4 was coupled with WO 3 microspheres, a further band gap energy was increased, possibly due to good interaction of 3D/2D heterojunction with development of hollow microspheres using a single step hydrothermal approach. The production of photogenerated charge carrier and their recombination can be assessed through Photoluminescence (PL) analysis.The higher PL intensity, resulting in more recombination of photogenerated charge carrier.The charges separation efficiency of WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples have been demonstrated in Fig. 6 (c).Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , stronger emission peak was appeared, attributed to faster recombination of photogenerated electron and holes over the catalyst surface 37.Furthermore, g-C 3 N 4 PL intensity was gradually decreased, when it was coupled with WO 3 , obviously due to Z-scheme heterojunction formation, resulting in superior charge carrier separation 38,39.Previously, Pan and coworkers reported the synthesis of Z-scheme WO 3-x /TiO 2 composite and observed higher charges separation efficiency with 10 WO 3 loading to TiO 2 , any WO 3 loading beyond this value (i.e., 5, 15, and 20 wt. WO 3 ) has increased the PL intensity of TiO 2 39.It could be seen that Z-scheme heterojunction formation between g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 accelerates the transfer of electrons and enabling proficient charge carrier separation.This suggests, WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction found very efficient photocatalyst for separation and transfer of electrons and similar findings have been reported in the literature 16.Therefore, constructing a WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction would enabling efficient production and separation of charge carrier and would be beneficial for efficient CO 2 reduction under visible light. XPS analysis of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 was carried out to analyze elemental states in the composite sample.Fig. 7 (a) shows high resolution W 4f spectrum with binding energies 36.1 and 38.1 eV for W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 , respectively, corresponds to W 6 oxidation state of WO 3 40.As shown in Fig. 7 (b), N 1s spectrum shows two peaks with binding energies 399.2 and 400.7 eV, ascribed to SP 2 hybridized NeCN and amino functional group.The XPS peak at 404.9 eV can be assigned to proton present over the g-C 3 N 4 surface because of surface charge modification and similarly reported in literature 41.Fig. 7 (c Furthermore, band positions of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 are very important to understand the direction of charges transfer among the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite.The valence band (E VB ) positions of g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 were calculated using the wide spectra of XPS and results are reported in Fig. 7 (e-f).The VB position of 1.64 eV was obtained for g-C 3 N 4 , whereas, WO 3 presents VB position of 2.55 eV.Thus, CB positions were calculated, based on their band gap energies using Eq. ( 1). here, E VB is the valence band edge, E CB is the conduction band edge, E bg is the band gap energy of a semiconductor.The CB values were obtained to be -1.13eV and -0.25 eV for g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively.Previously, Chen et al., synthesized WO 3 nanosheets and reported CB and VB band positions of -0.42 and 2.37 eV, respectively 36.Similarly, a CB position of -0.32 eV for mesoporous WO 3 has been reported 42.Recently, CB and VB band position of -0.26 and 2.37 eV, respectively, for WO 3 were observed, which were favorable for CH 4 formation 16.In another development, VB positions of 1.585 and 3.275 eV for g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively, while, CB positions of -1.125 and 0.905 eV for g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively, have been reported 43.Thus, the band positions of current work have good agreement with the reported values in the literature.It is obvious that CB of g-C 3 N 4 (-1.13 eV) is more negative than the CB of WO 3 (-0.25 eV), however, CB of WO 3 is not much suitable for CO 2 reduction to CO.Thus, there would be possibility of Z-scheme heterojunction formation with the electrons transfer from CB of WO 3 to VB of g-C 3 N 4 under visible light irradiation.Thus, a good band structure of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 would be possible to maximize photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water/H 2 oxidation process under visible light irradiation. The activity test of photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O for the production of CO and CH 4 was conducted without providing external heat source in a fixed-bed photoreactor system under visible light irradiation.First, quality control experiments were carried out using either the photocatalyst or the feed mixture under light irradiation.In the first case, photocatalyst was immersed inside the photoreactor and the reaction was conducted in the presence of nitrogen gas, but without using CO 2 /H 2 O feed mixture under light irradiation.In the second case, CO 2 /H 2 O feed mixture was supplied to reactor, but in the absent of photocatalyst under light irradiation.In the third case, reaction was conducted in the presence of both the feed mixture (CO 2 /H 2 O) and photocatalyst, but without using light irradiation.In the either case, without using feed mixture or the photocatalyst, no detectable carbonbased products were observed under light irradiation, confirming that all the three components i.e., photocatalyst, feed mixture (CO 2 /H 2 O) and source of irradiation are necessary during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.This indicates that photocatalyst is clean and carbonbased products such as CO and CH 4 were originated during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process under light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite for CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 under visible light has been demonstrated in Fig. 8 (a).Using WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , the CO evolution of 121 and 152 mole g-cat -1 , respectively, were achieved.This reveals CO production over the g-C 3 N 4 was 1.26 times higher than it was produced using WO 3 photocatalyst.Similarly, production of CH 4 (65.8 mole g-cat -1 ) over the g-C 3 N 4 was 1.15 times lower than it was produced using WO 3 .This reveals that g-C 3 N 4 is more capable for stimulating CO 2 reduction to CO because of its more negative conduction band position (CB-1.13eV) compared to WO 3 (CB-0.25eV), in addition of faster charge carrier separation due to protonation with 2D layered structure.It could be seen that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was occurred over WO 3 with small amount of CO and CH 4 production under visible light irradiation.Previously, significantly higher amount of CH 4 production over the WO 3 nanosheets was observed compared to commercial WO 3 powder.This was evidently due to more negative CB position of WO 3 nanosheets (CB-0.42eV) compared to CB position of commercial WO 3 (CB0.05eV) under visible light irradiation 36.A methane formation of 6.03 mol g -1 over pure WO 3 with CB position of -0.26 eV has been reported 16.Similarly, production of CH 3 COOH over WO 3 during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light has been reported 44.Using commercial WO 3 , a lower amount of CH 4 was produced, which was significantly enhanced with mesoporous WO 3 .More importantly, production of CH 3 OH was obviously increased over the mesoporous WO 3 compared to commercial WO 3 photocatalyst.It is noticeable that CB position of mesoporous WO 3 of -0.32 eV has been reported, which is favorable for CH 4 formation only.However, significant amount of methanol formation was due to thermo-catalysis generates unique synergistic photo/thermo-catalytic effect 42.In another development, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O was conducted over WO 3 -TiO 2 /Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 composite catalyst and reported the production of CO and CH 4 under visible light.It was reported that pure WO 3 can work as a photocatalyst and amount of CO and CH 4 evolution rate of 5.39 and 0.34 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, have been reported.Besides, higher photocatalytic activity of WO 3 was observed compared to TiO 2 , whereas, WO 3 promoted more CH 4 formation due to higher visible light absorption.The CH 4 formation was further improved in TiO 2 /WO 3 and WO 3 -TiO 2 /Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 samples 35.Similarly, a photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity over WO 3 (CB 0.4and VB3.10) with CO and CH 4 production rate of 0.6 and 0.15 mol g -1 h -1 has been reported, whereas, CO and CH 4 production rates were further increased in Z-scheme heterojunction of FePc/WO 3 composite 45.Recently, Wang et al., reported that during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, back reactions occur through methane oxidation, resulting in the production of CO and CO 2 46.In the current work, as the CB of WO 3 (-0.25 eV) is favorable for methane formation, thus, initially, CH 4 would be produced over the WO 3 , which possible be converted to CO due to back reaction through methane oxidation.All these findings confirm that WO 3 can be used as a photocatalyst or cocatalyst to promote g-C 3 N 4 photoactivity for stimulating CO 2 reduction process under visible light irradiation. The photoactivity of WO 3 coupled g-C 3 N 4 composite was further conducted, whereas, 25 WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 exhibits highest photoactivity for the production of CO with yield rates 289 mole g-cat -1 , 1.9 and 2.4 times more than employing pristine g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively.Similarly, highest CH 4 production over 25 WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 of 265 mole g-cat -1 was achieved, which is 3.49 and 4.02-fold higher than it was produced over g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively.This considerably enhanced photocatalytic activity was evidently due to Z-scheme heterojunction formation between g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 with proficient charge carrier separation among the semiconductors 47.However, any WO 3 loading above 25 lowers the photoactivity of WO Previously, Mo-doped WO 3 :0.33H 2 O was investigated and reported 5.2-fold higher CH 4 production (5.3 mole g-cat -1 h -1 ) compared to pristine WO 3 under the visible light irradiation 16.Similarly, Cu 2 O decorated WO 3 was tested for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CO as the major product under visible light 20.In another development, Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 composite was tested for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light, whereas, CO and CH 4 production rate of 271.3 and 39.1 mole g-cat -1 h -1 , respectively, were obtained 18.3D/2D Cu 2 O/WO 3 composite tested for CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 with yield rates of 7.04 and 8.42 mole g-cat -1 h -1 , respectively under visible light 27.All these findings confirm that WO 3 is an efficient cocatalyst for maximizing photoinduced CO 2 reduction process under visible light irradiation. Apart from the efficient photocatalysts, the photocatalytic activity is extremely influenced by the external conditions such as reactor pressure, temperature, light intensity, catalyst loading and the molar feed ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 .Fig. 9 shows the effect of different catalyst loading of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 on the yield rates of CO and CH 4 at different irradiation time under light intensity 20 mW cm -2 and H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio 0.20.The time dependent production of CH 4 at different catalyst loading ranging 50-250 mg has been demonstrated in Fig. 9 (a-b).As shown in Fig. 9 (a), production of CH 4 was increased with increasing WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 catalyst loading.The CH 4 production with 250 mg was 1.35 and 1.62-fold higher than loading amounts of 150 and 50 mg, respectively.This increased in production rate was noticeably because of more active surface available at a higher amount of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 loading, for activating photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under the same reaction conditions.Comparatively, production of CH 4 per unit mass was decreased with increasing catalyst loading and trends were continuous over the entire reaction time.The decreased in yield rates per unit mass were evidently due to lower surface area exposed to light irradiation, resulting in lower rate of reaction per unit mass of catalyst loading.All these findings confirm that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process can be enhanced by providing more active sites through higher catalyst loading. The effect of catalyst loading on the performance of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO at different irradiation time has been presented in Fig. 9 (c-d).As shown in Fig. 9 (c), the trends of CO production are much similar to the CH 4 , whereas, highest CO evolution was obtained with catalyst loading of 250 mg.However, a decreased in CO production rate per unit mass was observed with increasing catalyst loading.All these findings confirm that higher catalyst loading can increase the amount of CO and CH 4 production, however, yield rates are dependent on the catalyst surface exposed to light irradiation.Thus, lower catalyst loading gave higher yield rates per unit mass, however, production rate can be maximized by increasing catalyst loading under the same reaction conditions. The photocatalytic performance of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst was further investigated by varying initial H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratios, while keeping all other parameters constant (catalyst loading 150 mg, light intensity 20 mW cm -2 ).The H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio of 0.2, 0.40 and 0.60 was adjusted by varying water saturator temperature from 30 to 50 C, while keeping CO 2 flow rate constant (i.e., 20 mL min - 1 ).Fig. 10 shows production of CO and CH 4 during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with different initial molar feed ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 at constant reactor temperature and pressure.As shown in Fig. 10 (a), continuous production of CO was obtained over the entire irradiation time, whereas, highest CO was obtained at water saturator temperature of 40 C (H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio of 0.40).The highest CO of 346 mole g-cat -1 produced at 40 C (feed ratio 0.40), which is 1.17 and 1.55-fold higher than 30 C (feed ratio of 0.2) and 50 C (feed ratio of 0.6), respectively.This reveals that highest photocatalytic activity can be obtained at optimized H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio. Similarly, CH 4 yield increases as the water saturator temperature was increased until reaching to maximum at a molar feed ratio of 0.40 and then it was declined as demonstrated in Fig. 10 (b).Evidently, highest CO and CH 4 production rate was detected at a molar feed ratio of 0.40, while, their production rate was declined when the temperature was further increased.Highest CH 4 yield of 452 mole g-cat -1 was produced at feed ratio 0.40, which is 1.22 and 1.83-fold higher than using feed ratio 0.6 and 0.20, respectively.Comparatively, at optimized H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, production of CH 4 was 1.31 times more than CO production under the same reaction condition.This reveals that amount of H 2 O/CO 2 attached to catalyst surface not only enhanced catalyst photoactivity, but also alters selectivity of the products.The selectivity for CO production was decreased from 54.48 to 37.60 by increasing feed ratio from 0.20 to 0.60.Conversely, CH 4 selectivity was increased from 45.52-62.39 by increasing H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio from 0.20 to 0.60, which is 37 increment under the same reaction conditions.This increased of CH 4 selectivity at higher H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio was evidently due to more protons available for converting CO to CH 4 . These findings were further described on the process of adsorption competition between CO 2 and H 2 O reactants over the catalyst active sites 48.It could be seen that yield of CO and CH 4 was increased by increasing H 2 O/CO 2 feed until reaching to maximum, then production was declined.At lower H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, there would be more CO 2 adsorption over the catalyst surface with smaller amount of H 2 O vapors attached to the catalyst active sites.Under such conditions, oxidation process for the production of H would not be efficient.Similarly, at very high H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratios, there would be more H 2 O molecules attached to the catalyst surface, and CO 2 has to compete with H 2 O molecules to adsorb over the catalyst active sites, resulting in slower reduction process.This reveals that excessive attachment of H 2 O or CO 2 molecules over the catalyst surface retarded the redox (oxidation and reduction) reactions, resulting in lower photocatalytic activity for CO and CH 4 production.Previously, similar observations have been reported during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction at different H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio for the production of CO and CH 4 under visible light 27,47.According to thermodynamics, for CO production, 2 protons (H ) are required, whereas, one mole of CH 4 is produced by the involvement of 8 electrons and 8 protons during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.Thus, at lower H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio, number of protons produced were not sufficient to promote CH 4 production, however, when H 2 O/ CO 2 feed ratio was increased, more protons would be produced during water oxidation process, thus, enabling appreciable amount of methane formation. The performance of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst was further investigated using hydrogen as the reducing agents, while keeping all the parameters constants.For this purpose, instead of using water, CO 2 and H 2 of feed ratio 1.0 were regulated by mass flow controllers and were mixed in a gas mixer before entering to reactor and results are presented in Fig. 11 (a).Obviously, CO production was further increased when CO 2 was reduced in the presence of H 2 instead of using water under the same reaction conditions.This increased in CO production during CO 2 reduction with H 2 would be due to activation of reversed water gas shift (RWGS) reaction under light irradiation.Furthermore, during CO 2 reduction by hydrogen through RWGS reaction, CO was continuously evolved over the entire irradiation time.However, during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, initially, production of CO was highest, but it was gradually reached to steady state.Highest CO evolution of 1005 mole g-cat -1 was obtained using CO 2 /H 2 feed mixture, which is 3.48-fold higher than employing water as the reducing agent for CO 2 reduction.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of RWGS reaction.In general, enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction toward CO production was obviously due to activation of revere water gas shift reaction according to Eq. ( 2) 6. (2) The performance of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated using different light sources with their intensities 20 and 100 mW cm -2 using lamps 35 and 100 W, respectively, and time dependent yield rates of CO and CH 4 have been demonstrated in Fig. 11 (b).Obviously, both CO and CH 4 were produced continuously over the entire irradiation time under both types of lamps.However, using light intensity of 100 mW cm -2 , higher amount of CO was produced, compared to lower light intensity (20 mW cm -2 ).Highest CO evolution of 753 mole g-cat -1 was obtained with light intensity 100 mW cm -2 , which is 2.61-fold higher than using 20 mW cm -2 light intensity.Comparatively, highest CH 4 production of 215 mole g-cat -1 observed with light intensity 100 mW cm -2 , a decreased of 1.23 times than it was produced using lower intensity (20 mW cm -2 ).Using higher light intensity, production of CO was increased due to more production of electrons and their utilization for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO.However, decreased in CH 4 yield rate attributed to steam reforming of methane (SRM) in the presence of excessive electrons and holes according to Eq. (3). (3) Furthermore, hydrogen produced during reaction in Eq. ( 3) can be further utilized for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO through RWGS reaction as illustrated in Eq. ( 2).Therefore, significant amount of CO formation at higher light intensity was evidently due to more production of electrons and activation of SRM and RWGS reactions.Previously, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by hydrogen with CO production over Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs has been reported 6. Since the stability of photocatalysts has significant index for practical applications, the photoactivity of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite was conducted in multiple cycles by repeating the experiments under the identical reaction conditions.The stability tests were conducted using two different light intensities i.e., 20 and 100 mW cm -2 and the results are presented in Fig. 12.As demonstrated in Fig. 12 (a), continuous generation of CO and CH 4 was found in all the three cycles.More importantly, in the first cycle, CO and CH 4 production were much closer, whereas, production rates of both CO and CH 4 was increased in the 2nd and 3rd cyclic runs.The CO production of 1.64-fold higher was obtained than CH 4 evolution after 3rd cyclic run.Highest CO evolution of 598 mole g-cat -1 was acquired in the 3rd cycle, which is 1.28 and 2.1fold higher than it was produced in 2nd and 1st cyclic runs, respectively.Similarly, WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 exhibits CH 4 evolution of 365 mole gcat -1 in 3rd cycle, which is 1.09 and 1.38 folds higher than it was produced in a 2nd and 1st cyclic runs, respectively.This demonstrates high stability of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst due to successful fabrication of heterojunction composite with larger exposed catalyst active surface area and faster charge carrier separation 12.The increased in yield rates of CO and CH 4 over the cyclic runs could be explained because of partial reduction of WO 3 and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species over the catalyst surface, resulting in more production of carbon-based products. Fig. 12 (b) presents CO and CH 4 production over WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite with light intensity 100 mW cm -2 in three cycles under the identical reaction conditions.In all the three cycles, continuous generation of CO and CH 4 was found with no declined in photo-activity.The highest CO evolution of 780 mole g-cat -1 was obtained in a third cyclic run, which is 1.03 and 1.04 folds higher than it was produced in 2nd and 1st cycles, respectively.Similarly, CH 4 evolution of 328 mole g-cat -1 after 3rd cycle was found, 1.52 and 1.55-fold higher than it was produced in 2nd and 1st cycles, respectively.All these results confirm that continuous evolution of CO and CH 4 was evolved by employing higher light intensity.This further confirms that WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite maintains its stability in cycles, although very high light intensity (5 folds higher) was employed.High stability of WO 3 based composite catalysts have been reported in literature during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over iron phthalocyanine/porous WO 3 composite for continuous production of CO and CH 4 with stability for 5 cycles 45.More interestingly, Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 composite sustained continuous photocatalytic activity for CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 up to 60 days 49.All these findings confirm that WO 3 based composite photocatalyst sustained high stability for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation. The fresh and spent WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples were further analyzed to determine structural changes after three cycles.Fig. 12 (c) shows Raman analysis of fresh and spent WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite after three cycles with different light intensities.Obviously, all the Raman peaks in fresh WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 also appeared in spent composite samples irradiated at intensity of 20 and 100 mW cm -2 .However, peak intensities were altered with lower and high-power light intensities.For example, lower peak intensity at 806.4 cm -1 was observed using a fresh sample, which was gradually increased using 20 and 100 mW cm -2 .The increased in peak intensities were probably due to morphological change of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 structure in different cycles 23.As discussed in Fig. 2 (b), Raman peak intensities of pristine WO 3 are much higher compared to g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, during cyclic runs with high power light intensity, more WO 3 was exposed to light irradiations.Due to these alternations, there were continuous increased of activity for the formation of CO and CH 4 in cycles under different light intensities.Thus, WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite has high stability for continuous evolution of CO and CH 4 in cycles under visible light irradiation. According to the above discussion, a part of efficient photocatalyst, photocatalytic activity is also dependent on the light intensity, catalyst loading, feed ratio and type of reducing agents and results are summarized in Table 1.It could be seen, using different types of photocatalysts, CO was identified as the major CO 2 reduction product with H 2 O reducing agent (H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio 0.20), catalyst loading 150 mg and light intensity 20 mW cm -2 .Alternatively, with different amounts of catalyst loading from 50-250 mg, various amounts of CO and CH 4 were obtained.At lower amount of catalyst loading, production of CH 4 was highest, while, it was reduced with increasing catalyst loading.This is obvious that at higher catalyst loading, more electrons would be produced over the catalyst active sites, which probably also reduces CH 4 to CO under the same reaction conditions.Furthermore, by increasing H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, production of CH 4 was increased due to the availability of more protons available for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 under light intensity 20 mW cm -2 and catalyst loading 150 mg.More importantly, when water was replaced with hydrogen, the highest amount of CO was produced, probably due to the activation of reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.In addition, when light intensity was increased from 20 to 100 mW cm -2 , both the production of CO and CH 4 were enhanced. As discussed above, production rates of CO and CH 4 are dependent on the catalyst loading and light intensity, thus, a performance comparison of photocatalysts during CO 2 reduction under different reaction conditions would not be possible.Besides, production of CO requires two electrons, whereas, CH 4 needs eight electrons, thus, efficient analysis of photon flux utilization by photocatalysts during CO 2 reduction process based on production rate would not be possible.Thus, it would be more appropriate to calculate quantum yield (QY) to compare the performance of different reaction systems.QY for CO and CH 4 production was calculated under visible light irradiations of wavelength 420 nm and light intensity 20 and 100 mW cm -2 using Eq. ( 4) and (5) For CO production, two electrons were consumed, whereas, CH 4 was produced through the involvement of eight electrons, thus, 2 and 8 has been added in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Besides, number of incident photons were calculated using wavelength 420 nm, light intensity of 20 and 100 mW cm -1 and illuminated area of 28 cm 2 .The summary of QY for CO and CH 4 production for all types of photocatalytic systems have been presented in Table 2.The WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite gave highest CO QY of 2.131 during CO 2 conversion to CO through RWGS reaction.Similarly, QY for CH 4 was estimated to be 3.829 using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O at H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio 0.40.All these findings confirm that higher H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio is favorable for more CH 4 production, however, RWGS reaction promoted CO evolution under the same reaction conditions.A detailed literature for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction has been summarized in a Table 2. Mo-doped WO 3 :0.33H 2 O was investigated and reported CH 4 production of 5.3 mole g-cat -1 h -1 under visible light 16.In another development, Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 composite was tested for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CO and CH 4 production rate of 271.3 and 39.1 mole g-cat -1 h -1 , respectively 18.Similarly, CO and CH 4 yield rates of 7.04 and 8.42 mole g-cat -1 h -1 over 3D/2D Cu 2 O/WO 3 composite obtained during CO 2 reduction under visible light 27.Recently, WO 3 -TiO 2 /Cu 2 ZnInS 2 composite investigated for CO 2 reduction and yield rates of 5.37 and 1.69 mole gcat -1 h -1 for CO and CH 4 yield rates have been estimated under visible light irradiation 35.In another study, CO and CH 4 yield rates of 4.1 and 3.5 mole g-cat -1 h -1 estimated over FePc/WO 3 nanocomposites during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light 45.By comparing all these findings with the current work, significantly enhanced photoactivity for CO and CH 4 production over WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction was obtained due to larger external active surface area and proficient charge carrier separation under visible light irradiation. According to band structure, valence band (VB) of WO 3 is more positive than the VB of g-C 3 N 4 ; conduction band (CB) of WO 3 is more positive than CB of g-C 3 N 4 , which is appropriate to develop type II or Zscheme heterojunction under visible light irradiation.It is obvious that CB of g-C 3 N 4 (-1.13 eV) is more negative than the CB of WO 3 (-0.25 eV), thus, electrons would possibly be transferred from CB of g-C 3 N 4 to CB of WO 3 through type II heterojunction formation between WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .However, CB of WO 3 is not suitable for CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 , thus, there would be possibility of Z-scheme heterojunction formation with the electrons transfer from CB of WO 3 to VB of g-C 3 N 4 under visible light irradiation.Besides, electrons transfer through Zscheme heterojunction would also be possible due to lower band gap energy of WO 3 (E bg 2.80 eV) compared to g-C 3 N 4 (E bg 2.89 eV). A schematic of Z-scheme heterojunction of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with charge carrier separation and production of CO and CH 4 has been demonstrated in Fig. 13.Under visible light irradiations, WO 3 could be excited due to its lower energy band gap (2.80 eV) than g-C 3 N 4 (2.89 eV), producing electron/hole pair (e -/h ) as illustrated in Eq. ( 6).The CB electrons of WO 3 were transferred to VB of g-C 3 N 4 for its activation (Eq.7), resulting in proficient charge carrier separation.Due to protonation, g-C 3 N 4 would also help for providing sink for capturing electrons before being utilized in the CO 2 reduction process.The electrons would be utilized for CO 2 reduction through Eqs. ( 8) and (9), while, holes were consumed for water and H 2 oxidation trough Eqs.(10) and (11) 35. (10) 20.In another work, significant amount of O 2 evolution over Nb doped TiO 2 /g-C 3 N 4 composite during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O has been reported 50.All these findings confirm that there would be possible production of O 2 over the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst, however, it was not reported in the current work due to the limitations of GC system. Furthermore, water and CO 2 are firstly adsorbed over the catalyst surface, while their adsorption is dependent on the H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio in the feed mixture.At lower H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, more CO 2 molecules, chemisorbed to catalyst active surface, would be converted into active -CO 2 .Alternatively, at higher H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratios, more water molecules attached to catalyst surface sites would be converted to protons (H ) and oxygen during oxidation process.Thus, at not available.lower H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio, more CO was evolved, whereas, production of CH 4 was noticeably enhanced at higher H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio due to the presence of excessive protons over the catalyst surface.Besides, photogenerated electrons are effectively transferred from WO 3 to g-C 3 N 4 due to Z-scheme heterojunction, thus, facilitating the separation of photogenerated electron and hole under visible light irradiation.Thus, proficient oxidation and reduction reaction occurs simultaneously, resulting in more production of CO and CH 4 over the catalyst surface 48.Similarly, when light intensity was increased from 20 to 100 mW cm -2 , CO and CH 4 production rates were increased, obviously due to more production of electrons over the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst for CO 2 reduction.In general, enhanced photocatalytic activity of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite was obviously due to good interfacial transfer and separation of charge carrier under visible light irradiations with their appropriate redox potentials for CO 2 reduction and water/hydrogen oxidation.Thus, constructing a Z-scheme heterojunction with larger exposed active surface area and faster charge carrier separation with appropriate redox (oxidation and reduction) potentials are necessary for efficient photocatalysis process."}, {"llm generation": "WO3", "source": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD peaks of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , WO 3 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD peaks of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , WO 3 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.The pure g-C 3 N 4 reveals two peaks at 2 of 13.02and 27.45, corresponding to (100) and (002) crystal planes of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ).The (002) plane belongs to interplanar stacking of aromatic system, while, the plane (100) relates to inplane structural packing motif in the graphitic carbon nitride.The peaks of pristine WO 3 appeared at 2 of 23.11, 23.61, 24.34, 26.58, 28.76, 33.26and 34.14corresponds to WO 3 with monoclinic phase (Card 01-083-0950).In the case of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite, the characteristic peaks of both the g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 were appeared, confirming successful fabrication of composite without distortion of their structure.More importantly, g-C 3 N 4 2 of 27.45was shifted to higher values (27.54), indicating a shortened gallery distance between the basic layer unit and similar observation has been reported previously during construction of 3D g-C 3 N 4 NS 31.Besides, additional peaks relating to impurities were not appeared in the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite XRD patterns, confirming high purity samples and similarly reported in the literature 32. Raman analysis of WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples have been demonstrated in Fig. 2 (b).Pure WO 3 bands appeared at 132.7, 185.9, 269.5, 325.4,716.5 and 805.7 cm -1 , in which, the stretching vibration of WeO bands appeared at 716.5 and 805.7 cm -1 , whereas, bands appeared at 269.5 and 325.4 cm -1 reflect modes of oxygen in WeOWe 33.The Raman peaks for the g-C 3 N 4 appeared at 322.6, 476.3, 708.1, 763.9, 978.9, 1115.7,1235.9, 1481.5 and 1625.1 cm -1 .The bending modes at 322.6, 476.3, 708.1, 763.9, 978.9, 1115.7 and 1235.8 cm -1 are relating to graphitic carbon nitride with polymeric structure.However, modes at 1481.5 and 1625.1 cm -1 ascribed to the presence of D-band and G-band of carbon in the g-C 3 N 4 .In the characteristic modes of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 , Raman modes appeared at 135.7, 210.8, 476.5, 708.3, 805.7, 978.9 and 1235.9 cm -1 .Obviously, there was a shift in the peaks of WO 3 , confirming good interaction of both the materials to form heterojunction for the proficient transfer of charge carriers. The morphology of g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 was further explored using FESEM as demonstrated in Fig. 3.It can be seen that g-C 3 N 4 synthesized by heating melamine has two-dimensional layered structure as shown in Fig. 3 (a).Fig. 3 (b-c) shows obvious g-C 3 N 4 NS wrapped over WO 3 microspheres to give larger exposed external surface.Some g-C 3 N 4 sheets were also attached with WO 3 .In this way, a g-C 3 N 4 /WO 3 heterojunction with good interaction to construct Z-scheme heterojunction was achieved.More interestingly, g-C 3 N 4 /WO 3 has hollow microspheres with multiple channels to construct a 3D hollow microsphere as demonstrated in Fig. 3 (d-f).This would provide more interaction among the semiconductors with more pathways of light absorption and faster sorption process.Consequently, this combination is more compact and promotes charge carrier separation with superior transmission of electrons.Thus, constructing 3D WO 3 microspheres with hollow structure coupled with 2D g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets would enable penetration of light irradiations with a high sorption process to maximize the photoactivity.The interaction among the semiconductors with elements distribution was further investigated using EDX mapping analysis as demonstrated in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 (a) reveals the interaction of structured WO 3 with g-C 3 N 4 .EDX spectra with obvious peaks of all the elements which include W, C, N and O has been shown in Fig. 4 (b).Fig. 4 (c-d) shows EDX mapping analysis with uniform distribution of all the elements over the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite surface.Thus, WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite would be constructed using single-step hydrothermal approach with good interaction among the semiconductors and would be beneficial to promote photocatalytic activity. The structure and interaction of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 microspheres was further examined using TEM and HRTEM.TEM images in Fig. 5 (a-b) displays large size microspheres with good interaction of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.This was obviously due to controlled growth of WO 3 hollow microspheres in the presence of g-C 3 N 4 through hydrothermal approach.Furthermore, HRTEM analysis was conducted to identify heterojunction formation and lattice fringes of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .HRTEM image in Fig. 5 (c) confirms the successful formation of heterojunction with their good interactions to maximize exposed active surface area.Fig. 5 (d-f) reveals lattice fringes of 0.36 and 0.37 nm for WO 3 and 0.32 nm for g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.All these findings confirm successful fabrication of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction with good interfacial interaction, thus, would be beneficial for interfacial charge transportation and separation. Fig. 6 (a) shows diffuse reflectance spectra for WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Obviously, WO 3 has highest visible light absorption capacity compared to g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.The absorption wavelength for all the samples was observed above 400 nm, confirming their proficient visible light absorption.The energy band gap was calculated according to Tauc plot as demonstrated in Fig. 6 (b).The band gap energies for WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 samples were determined to be 2.80, 2.89 and 2.97 eV, respectively.It could be seen that band gap energy was somewhat increased after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with WO 3 microspheres to construct WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite.Previously, we reported a band gap energy of 2.70 eV for bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which was reduced to 2.63 eV in surface charge modified graphitic carbon nanotubes 34.In general, bulk g-C 3 N 4 has a band gap energy of 2.70 eV, which can be shifted towards higher or lower values depending on structure and surface modification of graphitic carbon nitride.Similarly, commercial WO 3 has a band gap energy of 2.70 eV, which can be increased or decreased by fabricating WO 3 with different structures such as nanorods and microspheres.For example, a band gap energy for commercial WO 3 of 2.70 eV has been reported by Raza and coworkers, which was increased to 2.76 in structured WO 3 35.In another report, a band gap energy of 2.79 eV has been reported for WO 3 nanosheets 36.All these findings confirm that band gap energy of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 can be altered with their structural modification and protonation.Thus, band gap energy of g-C 3 N 4 was increased towards higher value due to surface modification, whereas, WO 3 band gap energy was increased due to developing microspheres.When, g-C 3 N 4 was coupled with WO 3 microspheres, a further band gap energy was increased, possibly due to good interaction of 3D/2D heterojunction with development of hollow microspheres using a single step hydrothermal approach. The production of photogenerated charge carrier and their recombination can be assessed through Photoluminescence (PL) analysis.The higher PL intensity, resulting in more recombination of photogenerated charge carrier.The charges separation efficiency of WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples have been demonstrated in Fig. 6 (c).Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , stronger emission peak was appeared, attributed to faster recombination of photogenerated electron and holes over the catalyst surface 37.Furthermore, g-C 3 N 4 PL intensity was gradually decreased, when it was coupled with WO 3 , obviously due to Z-scheme heterojunction formation, resulting in superior charge carrier separation 38,39.Previously, Pan and coworkers reported the synthesis of Z-scheme WO 3-x /TiO 2 composite and observed higher charges separation efficiency with 10 WO 3 loading to TiO 2 , any WO 3 loading beyond this value (i.e., 5, 15, and 20 wt. WO 3 ) has increased the PL intensity of TiO 2 39.It could be seen that Z-scheme heterojunction formation between g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 accelerates the transfer of electrons and enabling proficient charge carrier separation.This suggests, WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction found very efficient photocatalyst for separation and transfer of electrons and similar findings have been reported in the literature 16.Therefore, constructing a WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction would enabling efficient production and separation of charge carrier and would be beneficial for efficient CO 2 reduction under visible light. XPS analysis of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 was carried out to analyze elemental states in the composite sample.Fig. 7 (a) shows high resolution W 4f spectrum with binding energies 36.1 and 38.1 eV for W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 , respectively, corresponds to W 6 oxidation state of WO 3 40.As shown in Fig. 7 (b), N 1s spectrum shows two peaks with binding energies 399.2 and 400.7 eV, ascribed to SP 2 hybridized NeCN and amino functional group.The XPS peak at 404.9 eV can be assigned to proton present over the g-C 3 N 4 surface because of surface charge modification and similarly reported in literature 41.Fig. 7 (c Furthermore, band positions of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 are very important to understand the direction of charges transfer among the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite.The valence band (E VB ) positions of g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 were calculated using the wide spectra of XPS and results are reported in Fig. 7 (e-f).The VB position of 1.64 eV was obtained for g-C 3 N 4 , whereas, WO 3 presents VB position of 2.55 eV.Thus, CB positions were calculated, based on their band gap energies using Eq. ( 1). here, E VB is the valence band edge, E CB is the conduction band edge, E bg is the band gap energy of a semiconductor.The CB values were obtained to be -1.13eV and -0.25 eV for g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively.Previously, Chen et al., synthesized WO 3 nanosheets and reported CB and VB band positions of -0.42 and 2.37 eV, respectively 36.Similarly, a CB position of -0.32 eV for mesoporous WO 3 has been reported 42.Recently, CB and VB band position of -0.26 and 2.37 eV, respectively, for WO 3 were observed, which were favorable for CH 4 formation 16.In another development, VB positions of 1.585 and 3.275 eV for g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively, while, CB positions of -1.125 and 0.905 eV for g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively, have been reported 43.Thus, the band positions of current work have good agreement with the reported values in the literature.It is obvious that CB of g-C 3 N 4 (-1.13 eV) is more negative than the CB of WO 3 (-0.25 eV), however, CB of WO 3 is not much suitable for CO 2 reduction to CO.Thus, there would be possibility of Z-scheme heterojunction formation with the electrons transfer from CB of WO 3 to VB of g-C 3 N 4 under visible light irradiation.Thus, a good band structure of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 would be possible to maximize photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water/H 2 oxidation process under visible light irradiation. The activity test of photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O for the production of CO and CH 4 was conducted without providing external heat source in a fixed-bed photoreactor system under visible light irradiation.First, quality control experiments were carried out using either the photocatalyst or the feed mixture under light irradiation.In the first case, photocatalyst was immersed inside the photoreactor and the reaction was conducted in the presence of nitrogen gas, but without using CO 2 /H 2 O feed mixture under light irradiation.In the second case, CO 2 /H 2 O feed mixture was supplied to reactor, but in the absent of photocatalyst under light irradiation.In the third case, reaction was conducted in the presence of both the feed mixture (CO 2 /H 2 O) and photocatalyst, but without using light irradiation.In the either case, without using feed mixture or the photocatalyst, no detectable carbonbased products were observed under light irradiation, confirming that all the three components i.e., photocatalyst, feed mixture (CO 2 /H 2 O) and source of irradiation are necessary during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.This indicates that photocatalyst is clean and carbonbased products such as CO and CH 4 were originated during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process under light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite for CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 under visible light has been demonstrated in Fig. 8 (a).Using WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , the CO evolution of 121 and 152 mole g-cat -1 , respectively, were achieved.This reveals CO production over the g-C 3 N 4 was 1.26 times higher than it was produced using WO 3 photocatalyst.Similarly, production of CH 4 (65.8 mole g-cat -1 ) over the g-C 3 N 4 was 1.15 times lower than it was produced using WO 3 .This reveals that g-C 3 N 4 is more capable for stimulating CO 2 reduction to CO because of its more negative conduction band position (CB-1.13eV) compared to WO 3 (CB-0.25eV), in addition of faster charge carrier separation due to protonation with 2D layered structure.It could be seen that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was occurred over WO 3 with small amount of CO and CH 4 production under visible light irradiation.Previously, significantly higher amount of CH 4 production over the WO 3 nanosheets was observed compared to commercial WO 3 powder.This was evidently due to more negative CB position of WO 3 nanosheets (CB-0.42eV) compared to CB position of commercial WO 3 (CB0.05eV) under visible light irradiation 36.A methane formation of 6.03 mol g -1 over pure WO 3 with CB position of -0.26 eV has been reported 16.Similarly, production of CH 3 COOH over WO 3 during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light has been reported 44.Using commercial WO 3 , a lower amount of CH 4 was produced, which was significantly enhanced with mesoporous WO 3 .More importantly, production of CH 3 OH was obviously increased over the mesoporous WO 3 compared to commercial WO 3 photocatalyst.It is noticeable that CB position of mesoporous WO 3 of -0.32 eV has been reported, which is favorable for CH 4 formation only.However, significant amount of methanol formation was due to thermo-catalysis generates unique synergistic photo/thermo-catalytic effect 42.In another development, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O was conducted over WO 3 -TiO 2 /Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 composite catalyst and reported the production of CO and CH 4 under visible light.It was reported that pure WO 3 can work as a photocatalyst and amount of CO and CH 4 evolution rate of 5.39 and 0.34 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, have been reported.Besides, higher photocatalytic activity of WO 3 was observed compared to TiO 2 , whereas, WO 3 promoted more CH 4 formation due to higher visible light absorption.The CH 4 formation was further improved in TiO 2 /WO 3 and WO 3 -TiO 2 /Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 samples 35.Similarly, a photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity over WO 3 (CB 0.4and VB3.10) with CO and CH 4 production rate of 0.6 and 0.15 mol g -1 h -1 has been reported, whereas, CO and CH 4 production rates were further increased in Z-scheme heterojunction of FePc/WO 3 composite 45.Recently, Wang et al., reported that during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, back reactions occur through methane oxidation, resulting in the production of CO and CO 2 46.In the current work, as the CB of WO 3 (-0.25 eV) is favorable for methane formation, thus, initially, CH 4 would be produced over the WO 3 , which possible be converted to CO due to back reaction through methane oxidation.All these findings confirm that WO 3 can be used as a photocatalyst or cocatalyst to promote g-C 3 N 4 photoactivity for stimulating CO 2 reduction process under visible light irradiation. The photoactivity of WO 3 coupled g-C 3 N 4 composite was further conducted, whereas, 25 WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 exhibits highest photoactivity for the production of CO with yield rates 289 mole g-cat -1 , 1.9 and 2.4 times more than employing pristine g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively.Similarly, highest CH 4 production over 25 WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 of 265 mole g-cat -1 was achieved, which is 3.49 and 4.02-fold higher than it was produced over g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively.This considerably enhanced photocatalytic activity was evidently due to Z-scheme heterojunction formation between g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 with proficient charge carrier separation among the semiconductors 47.However, any WO 3 loading above 25 lowers the photoactivity of WO Previously, Mo-doped WO 3 :0.33H 2 O was investigated and reported 5.2-fold higher CH 4 production (5.3 mole g-cat -1 h -1 ) compared to pristine WO 3 under the visible light irradiation 16.Similarly, Cu 2 O decorated WO 3 was tested for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CO as the major product under visible light 20.In another development, Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 composite was tested for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light, whereas, CO and CH 4 production rate of 271.3 and 39.1 mole g-cat -1 h -1 , respectively, were obtained 18.3D/2D Cu 2 O/WO 3 composite tested for CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 with yield rates of 7.04 and 8.42 mole g-cat -1 h -1 , respectively under visible light 27.All these findings confirm that WO 3 is an efficient cocatalyst for maximizing photoinduced CO 2 reduction process under visible light irradiation. Apart from the efficient photocatalysts, the photocatalytic activity is extremely influenced by the external conditions such as reactor pressure, temperature, light intensity, catalyst loading and the molar feed ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 .Fig. 9 shows the effect of different catalyst loading of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 on the yield rates of CO and CH 4 at different irradiation time under light intensity 20 mW cm -2 and H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio 0.20.The time dependent production of CH 4 at different catalyst loading ranging 50-250 mg has been demonstrated in Fig. 9 (a-b).As shown in Fig. 9 (a), production of CH 4 was increased with increasing WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 catalyst loading.The CH 4 production with 250 mg was 1.35 and 1.62-fold higher than loading amounts of 150 and 50 mg, respectively.This increased in production rate was noticeably because of more active surface available at a higher amount of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 loading, for activating photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under the same reaction conditions.Comparatively, production of CH 4 per unit mass was decreased with increasing catalyst loading and trends were continuous over the entire reaction time.The decreased in yield rates per unit mass were evidently due to lower surface area exposed to light irradiation, resulting in lower rate of reaction per unit mass of catalyst loading.All these findings confirm that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process can be enhanced by providing more active sites through higher catalyst loading. The effect of catalyst loading on the performance of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO at different irradiation time has been presented in Fig. 9 (c-d).As shown in Fig. 9 (c), the trends of CO production are much similar to the CH 4 , whereas, highest CO evolution was obtained with catalyst loading of 250 mg.However, a decreased in CO production rate per unit mass was observed with increasing catalyst loading.All these findings confirm that higher catalyst loading can increase the amount of CO and CH 4 production, however, yield rates are dependent on the catalyst surface exposed to light irradiation.Thus, lower catalyst loading gave higher yield rates per unit mass, however, production rate can be maximized by increasing catalyst loading under the same reaction conditions. The photocatalytic performance of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst was further investigated by varying initial H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratios, while keeping all other parameters constant (catalyst loading 150 mg, light intensity 20 mW cm -2 ).The H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio of 0.2, 0.40 and 0.60 was adjusted by varying water saturator temperature from 30 to 50 C, while keeping CO 2 flow rate constant (i.e., 20 mL min - 1 ).Fig. 10 shows production of CO and CH 4 during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with different initial molar feed ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 at constant reactor temperature and pressure.As shown in Fig. 10 (a), continuous production of CO was obtained over the entire irradiation time, whereas, highest CO was obtained at water saturator temperature of 40 C (H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio of 0.40).The highest CO of 346 mole g-cat -1 produced at 40 C (feed ratio 0.40), which is 1.17 and 1.55-fold higher than 30 C (feed ratio of 0.2) and 50 C (feed ratio of 0.6), respectively.This reveals that highest photocatalytic activity can be obtained at optimized H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio. Similarly, CH 4 yield increases as the water saturator temperature was increased until reaching to maximum at a molar feed ratio of 0.40 and then it was declined as demonstrated in Fig. 10 (b).Evidently, highest CO and CH 4 production rate was detected at a molar feed ratio of 0.40, while, their production rate was declined when the temperature was further increased.Highest CH 4 yield of 452 mole g-cat -1 was produced at feed ratio 0.40, which is 1.22 and 1.83-fold higher than using feed ratio 0.6 and 0.20, respectively.Comparatively, at optimized H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, production of CH 4 was 1.31 times more than CO production under the same reaction condition.This reveals that amount of H 2 O/CO 2 attached to catalyst surface not only enhanced catalyst photoactivity, but also alters selectivity of the products.The selectivity for CO production was decreased from 54.48 to 37.60 by increasing feed ratio from 0.20 to 0.60.Conversely, CH 4 selectivity was increased from 45.52-62.39 by increasing H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio from 0.20 to 0.60, which is 37 increment under the same reaction conditions.This increased of CH 4 selectivity at higher H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio was evidently due to more protons available for converting CO to CH 4 . These findings were further described on the process of adsorption competition between CO 2 and H 2 O reactants over the catalyst active sites 48.It could be seen that yield of CO and CH 4 was increased by increasing H 2 O/CO 2 feed until reaching to maximum, then production was declined.At lower H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, there would be more CO 2 adsorption over the catalyst surface with smaller amount of H 2 O vapors attached to the catalyst active sites.Under such conditions, oxidation process for the production of H would not be efficient.Similarly, at very high H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratios, there would be more H 2 O molecules attached to the catalyst surface, and CO 2 has to compete with H 2 O molecules to adsorb over the catalyst active sites, resulting in slower reduction process.This reveals that excessive attachment of H 2 O or CO 2 molecules over the catalyst surface retarded the redox (oxidation and reduction) reactions, resulting in lower photocatalytic activity for CO and CH 4 production.Previously, similar observations have been reported during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction at different H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio for the production of CO and CH 4 under visible light 27,47.According to thermodynamics, for CO production, 2 protons (H ) are required, whereas, one mole of CH 4 is produced by the involvement of 8 electrons and 8 protons during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.Thus, at lower H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio, number of protons produced were not sufficient to promote CH 4 production, however, when H 2 O/ CO 2 feed ratio was increased, more protons would be produced during water oxidation process, thus, enabling appreciable amount of methane formation. The performance of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst was further investigated using hydrogen as the reducing agents, while keeping all the parameters constants.For this purpose, instead of using water, CO 2 and H 2 of feed ratio 1.0 were regulated by mass flow controllers and were mixed in a gas mixer before entering to reactor and results are presented in Fig. 11 (a).Obviously, CO production was further increased when CO 2 was reduced in the presence of H 2 instead of using water under the same reaction conditions.This increased in CO production during CO 2 reduction with H 2 would be due to activation of reversed water gas shift (RWGS) reaction under light irradiation.Furthermore, during CO 2 reduction by hydrogen through RWGS reaction, CO was continuously evolved over the entire irradiation time.However, during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, initially, production of CO was highest, but it was gradually reached to steady state.Highest CO evolution of 1005 mole g-cat -1 was obtained using CO 2 /H 2 feed mixture, which is 3.48-fold higher than employing water as the reducing agent for CO 2 reduction.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of RWGS reaction.In general, enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction toward CO production was obviously due to activation of revere water gas shift reaction according to Eq. ( 2) 6. (2) The performance of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated using different light sources with their intensities 20 and 100 mW cm -2 using lamps 35 and 100 W, respectively, and time dependent yield rates of CO and CH 4 have been demonstrated in Fig. 11 (b).Obviously, both CO and CH 4 were produced continuously over the entire irradiation time under both types of lamps.However, using light intensity of 100 mW cm -2 , higher amount of CO was produced, compared to lower light intensity (20 mW cm -2 ).Highest CO evolution of 753 mole g-cat -1 was obtained with light intensity 100 mW cm -2 , which is 2.61-fold higher than using 20 mW cm -2 light intensity.Comparatively, highest CH 4 production of 215 mole g-cat -1 observed with light intensity 100 mW cm -2 , a decreased of 1.23 times than it was produced using lower intensity (20 mW cm -2 ).Using higher light intensity, production of CO was increased due to more production of electrons and their utilization for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO.However, decreased in CH 4 yield rate attributed to steam reforming of methane (SRM) in the presence of excessive electrons and holes according to Eq. (3). (3) Furthermore, hydrogen produced during reaction in Eq. ( 3) can be further utilized for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO through RWGS reaction as illustrated in Eq. ( 2).Therefore, significant amount of CO formation at higher light intensity was evidently due to more production of electrons and activation of SRM and RWGS reactions.Previously, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by hydrogen with CO production over Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs has been reported 6. Since the stability of photocatalysts has significant index for practical applications, the photoactivity of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite was conducted in multiple cycles by repeating the experiments under the identical reaction conditions.The stability tests were conducted using two different light intensities i.e., 20 and 100 mW cm -2 and the results are presented in Fig. 12.As demonstrated in Fig. 12 (a), continuous generation of CO and CH 4 was found in all the three cycles.More importantly, in the first cycle, CO and CH 4 production were much closer, whereas, production rates of both CO and CH 4 was increased in the 2nd and 3rd cyclic runs.The CO production of 1.64-fold higher was obtained than CH 4 evolution after 3rd cyclic run.Highest CO evolution of 598 mole g-cat -1 was acquired in the 3rd cycle, which is 1.28 and 2.1fold higher than it was produced in 2nd and 1st cyclic runs, respectively.Similarly, WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 exhibits CH 4 evolution of 365 mole gcat -1 in 3rd cycle, which is 1.09 and 1.38 folds higher than it was produced in a 2nd and 1st cyclic runs, respectively.This demonstrates high stability of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst due to successful fabrication of heterojunction composite with larger exposed catalyst active surface area and faster charge carrier separation 12.The increased in yield rates of CO and CH 4 over the cyclic runs could be explained because of partial reduction of WO 3 and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species over the catalyst surface, resulting in more production of carbon-based products. Fig. 12 (b) presents CO and CH 4 production over WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite with light intensity 100 mW cm -2 in three cycles under the identical reaction conditions.In all the three cycles, continuous generation of CO and CH 4 was found with no declined in photo-activity.The highest CO evolution of 780 mole g-cat -1 was obtained in a third cyclic run, which is 1.03 and 1.04 folds higher than it was produced in 2nd and 1st cycles, respectively.Similarly, CH 4 evolution of 328 mole g-cat -1 after 3rd cycle was found, 1.52 and 1.55-fold higher than it was produced in 2nd and 1st cycles, respectively.All these results confirm that continuous evolution of CO and CH 4 was evolved by employing higher light intensity.This further confirms that WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite maintains its stability in cycles, although very high light intensity (5 folds higher) was employed.High stability of WO 3 based composite catalysts have been reported in literature during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over iron phthalocyanine/porous WO 3 composite for continuous production of CO and CH 4 with stability for 5 cycles 45.More interestingly, Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 composite sustained continuous photocatalytic activity for CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 up to 60 days 49.All these findings confirm that WO 3 based composite photocatalyst sustained high stability for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation. The fresh and spent WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples were further analyzed to determine structural changes after three cycles.Fig. 12 (c) shows Raman analysis of fresh and spent WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite after three cycles with different light intensities.Obviously, all the Raman peaks in fresh WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 also appeared in spent composite samples irradiated at intensity of 20 and 100 mW cm -2 .However, peak intensities were altered with lower and high-power light intensities.For example, lower peak intensity at 806.4 cm -1 was observed using a fresh sample, which was gradually increased using 20 and 100 mW cm -2 .The increased in peak intensities were probably due to morphological change of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 structure in different cycles 23.As discussed in Fig. 2 (b), Raman peak intensities of pristine WO 3 are much higher compared to g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, during cyclic runs with high power light intensity, more WO 3 was exposed to light irradiations.Due to these alternations, there were continuous increased of activity for the formation of CO and CH 4 in cycles under different light intensities.Thus, WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite has high stability for continuous evolution of CO and CH 4 in cycles under visible light irradiation. According to the above discussion, a part of efficient photocatalyst, photocatalytic activity is also dependent on the light intensity, catalyst loading, feed ratio and type of reducing agents and results are summarized in Table 1.It could be seen, using different types of photocatalysts, CO was identified as the major CO 2 reduction product with H 2 O reducing agent (H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio 0.20), catalyst loading 150 mg and light intensity 20 mW cm -2 .Alternatively, with different amounts of catalyst loading from 50-250 mg, various amounts of CO and CH 4 were obtained.At lower amount of catalyst loading, production of CH 4 was highest, while, it was reduced with increasing catalyst loading.This is obvious that at higher catalyst loading, more electrons would be produced over the catalyst active sites, which probably also reduces CH 4 to CO under the same reaction conditions.Furthermore, by increasing H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, production of CH 4 was increased due to the availability of more protons available for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 under light intensity 20 mW cm -2 and catalyst loading 150 mg.More importantly, when water was replaced with hydrogen, the highest amount of CO was produced, probably due to the activation of reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.In addition, when light intensity was increased from 20 to 100 mW cm -2 , both the production of CO and CH 4 were enhanced. As discussed above, production rates of CO and CH 4 are dependent on the catalyst loading and light intensity, thus, a performance comparison of photocatalysts during CO 2 reduction under different reaction conditions would not be possible.Besides, production of CO requires two electrons, whereas, CH 4 needs eight electrons, thus, efficient analysis of photon flux utilization by photocatalysts during CO 2 reduction process based on production rate would not be possible.Thus, it would be more appropriate to calculate quantum yield (QY) to compare the performance of different reaction systems.QY for CO and CH 4 production was calculated under visible light irradiations of wavelength 420 nm and light intensity 20 and 100 mW cm -2 using Eq. ( 4) and (5) For CO production, two electrons were consumed, whereas, CH 4 was produced through the involvement of eight electrons, thus, 2 and 8 has been added in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Besides, number of incident photons were calculated using wavelength 420 nm, light intensity of 20 and 100 mW cm -1 and illuminated area of 28 cm 2 .The summary of QY for CO and CH 4 production for all types of photocatalytic systems have been presented in Table 2.The WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite gave highest CO QY of 2.131 during CO 2 conversion to CO through RWGS reaction.Similarly, QY for CH 4 was estimated to be 3.829 using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O at H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio 0.40.All these findings confirm that higher H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio is favorable for more CH 4 production, however, RWGS reaction promoted CO evolution under the same reaction conditions.A detailed literature for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction has been summarized in a Table 2. Mo-doped WO 3 :0.33H 2 O was investigated and reported CH 4 production of 5.3 mole g-cat -1 h -1 under visible light 16.In another development, Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 composite was tested for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CO and CH 4 production rate of 271.3 and 39.1 mole g-cat -1 h -1 , respectively 18.Similarly, CO and CH 4 yield rates of 7.04 and 8.42 mole g-cat -1 h -1 over 3D/2D Cu 2 O/WO 3 composite obtained during CO 2 reduction under visible light 27.Recently, WO 3 -TiO 2 /Cu 2 ZnInS 2 composite investigated for CO 2 reduction and yield rates of 5.37 and 1.69 mole gcat -1 h -1 for CO and CH 4 yield rates have been estimated under visible light irradiation 35.In another study, CO and CH 4 yield rates of 4.1 and 3.5 mole g-cat -1 h -1 estimated over FePc/WO 3 nanocomposites during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light 45.By comparing all these findings with the current work, significantly enhanced photoactivity for CO and CH 4 production over WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction was obtained due to larger external active surface area and proficient charge carrier separation under visible light irradiation. According to band structure, valence band (VB) of WO 3 is more positive than the VB of g-C 3 N 4 ; conduction band (CB) of WO 3 is more positive than CB of g-C 3 N 4 , which is appropriate to develop type II or Zscheme heterojunction under visible light irradiation.It is obvious that CB of g-C 3 N 4 (-1.13 eV) is more negative than the CB of WO 3 (-0.25 eV), thus, electrons would possibly be transferred from CB of g-C 3 N 4 to CB of WO 3 through type II heterojunction formation between WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .However, CB of WO 3 is not suitable for CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 , thus, there would be possibility of Z-scheme heterojunction formation with the electrons transfer from CB of WO 3 to VB of g-C 3 N 4 under visible light irradiation.Besides, electrons transfer through Zscheme heterojunction would also be possible due to lower band gap energy of WO 3 (E bg 2.80 eV) compared to g-C 3 N 4 (E bg 2.89 eV). A schematic of Z-scheme heterojunction of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with charge carrier separation and production of CO and CH 4 has been demonstrated in Fig. 13.Under visible light irradiations, WO 3 could be excited due to its lower energy band gap (2.80 eV) than g-C 3 N 4 (2.89 eV), producing electron/hole pair (e -/h ) as illustrated in Eq. ( 6).The CB electrons of WO 3 were transferred to VB of g-C 3 N 4 for its activation (Eq.7), resulting in proficient charge carrier separation.Due to protonation, g-C 3 N 4 would also help for providing sink for capturing electrons before being utilized in the CO 2 reduction process.The electrons would be utilized for CO 2 reduction through Eqs. ( 8) and (9), while, holes were consumed for water and H 2 oxidation trough Eqs.(10) and (11) 35. (10) 20.In another work, significant amount of O 2 evolution over Nb doped TiO 2 /g-C 3 N 4 composite during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O has been reported 50.All these findings confirm that there would be possible production of O 2 over the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst, however, it was not reported in the current work due to the limitations of GC system. Furthermore, water and CO 2 are firstly adsorbed over the catalyst surface, while their adsorption is dependent on the H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio in the feed mixture.At lower H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, more CO 2 molecules, chemisorbed to catalyst active surface, would be converted into active -CO 2 .Alternatively, at higher H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratios, more water molecules attached to catalyst surface sites would be converted to protons (H ) and oxygen during oxidation process.Thus, at not available.lower H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio, more CO was evolved, whereas, production of CH 4 was noticeably enhanced at higher H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio due to the presence of excessive protons over the catalyst surface.Besides, photogenerated electrons are effectively transferred from WO 3 to g-C 3 N 4 due to Z-scheme heterojunction, thus, facilitating the separation of photogenerated electron and hole under visible light irradiation.Thus, proficient oxidation and reduction reaction occurs simultaneously, resulting in more production of CO and CH 4 over the catalyst surface 48.Similarly, when light intensity was increased from 20 to 100 mW cm -2 , CO and CH 4 production rates were increased, obviously due to more production of electrons over the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst for CO 2 reduction.In general, enhanced photocatalytic activity of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite was obviously due to good interfacial transfer and separation of charge carrier under visible light irradiations with their appropriate redox potentials for CO 2 reduction and water/hydrogen oxidation.Thus, constructing a Z-scheme heterojunction with larger exposed active surface area and faster charge carrier separation with appropriate redox (oxidation and reduction) potentials are necessary for efficient photocatalysis process."}, {"llm generation": "WO3/g-C3N4 composite", "source": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD peaks of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , WO 3 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.", "context": "Fig. 2(a) presents XRD peaks of pristine g-C 3 N 4 , WO 3 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.The pure g-C 3 N 4 reveals two peaks at 2 of 13.02and 27.45, corresponding to (100) and (002) crystal planes of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ).The (002) plane belongs to interplanar stacking of aromatic system, while, the plane (100) relates to inplane structural packing motif in the graphitic carbon nitride.The peaks of pristine WO 3 appeared at 2 of 23.11, 23.61, 24.34, 26.58, 28.76, 33.26and 34.14corresponds to WO 3 with monoclinic phase (Card 01-083-0950).In the case of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite, the characteristic peaks of both the g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 were appeared, confirming successful fabrication of composite without distortion of their structure.More importantly, g-C 3 N 4 2 of 27.45was shifted to higher values (27.54), indicating a shortened gallery distance between the basic layer unit and similar observation has been reported previously during construction of 3D g-C 3 N 4 NS 31.Besides, additional peaks relating to impurities were not appeared in the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite XRD patterns, confirming high purity samples and similarly reported in the literature 32. Raman analysis of WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples have been demonstrated in Fig. 2 (b).Pure WO 3 bands appeared at 132.7, 185.9, 269.5, 325.4,716.5 and 805.7 cm -1 , in which, the stretching vibration of WeO bands appeared at 716.5 and 805.7 cm -1 , whereas, bands appeared at 269.5 and 325.4 cm -1 reflect modes of oxygen in WeOWe 33.The Raman peaks for the g-C 3 N 4 appeared at 322.6, 476.3, 708.1, 763.9, 978.9, 1115.7,1235.9, 1481.5 and 1625.1 cm -1 .The bending modes at 322.6, 476.3, 708.1, 763.9, 978.9, 1115.7 and 1235.8 cm -1 are relating to graphitic carbon nitride with polymeric structure.However, modes at 1481.5 and 1625.1 cm -1 ascribed to the presence of D-band and G-band of carbon in the g-C 3 N 4 .In the characteristic modes of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 , Raman modes appeared at 135.7, 210.8, 476.5, 708.3, 805.7, 978.9 and 1235.9 cm -1 .Obviously, there was a shift in the peaks of WO 3 , confirming good interaction of both the materials to form heterojunction for the proficient transfer of charge carriers. The morphology of g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 was further explored using FESEM as demonstrated in Fig. 3.It can be seen that g-C 3 N 4 synthesized by heating melamine has two-dimensional layered structure as shown in Fig. 3 (a).Fig. 3 (b-c) shows obvious g-C 3 N 4 NS wrapped over WO 3 microspheres to give larger exposed external surface.Some g-C 3 N 4 sheets were also attached with WO 3 .In this way, a g-C 3 N 4 /WO 3 heterojunction with good interaction to construct Z-scheme heterojunction was achieved.More interestingly, g-C 3 N 4 /WO 3 has hollow microspheres with multiple channels to construct a 3D hollow microsphere as demonstrated in Fig. 3 (d-f).This would provide more interaction among the semiconductors with more pathways of light absorption and faster sorption process.Consequently, this combination is more compact and promotes charge carrier separation with superior transmission of electrons.Thus, constructing 3D WO 3 microspheres with hollow structure coupled with 2D g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets would enable penetration of light irradiations with a high sorption process to maximize the photoactivity.The interaction among the semiconductors with elements distribution was further investigated using EDX mapping analysis as demonstrated in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 (a) reveals the interaction of structured WO 3 with g-C 3 N 4 .EDX spectra with obvious peaks of all the elements which include W, C, N and O has been shown in Fig. 4 (b).Fig. 4 (c-d) shows EDX mapping analysis with uniform distribution of all the elements over the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite surface.Thus, WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite would be constructed using single-step hydrothermal approach with good interaction among the semiconductors and would be beneficial to promote photocatalytic activity. The structure and interaction of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 microspheres was further examined using TEM and HRTEM.TEM images in Fig. 5 (a-b) displays large size microspheres with good interaction of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets.This was obviously due to controlled growth of WO 3 hollow microspheres in the presence of g-C 3 N 4 through hydrothermal approach.Furthermore, HRTEM analysis was conducted to identify heterojunction formation and lattice fringes of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .HRTEM image in Fig. 5 (c) confirms the successful formation of heterojunction with their good interactions to maximize exposed active surface area.Fig. 5 (d-f) reveals lattice fringes of 0.36 and 0.37 nm for WO 3 and 0.32 nm for g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.All these findings confirm successful fabrication of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction with good interfacial interaction, thus, would be beneficial for interfacial charge transportation and separation. Fig. 6 (a) shows diffuse reflectance spectra for WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.Obviously, WO 3 has highest visible light absorption capacity compared to g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples.The absorption wavelength for all the samples was observed above 400 nm, confirming their proficient visible light absorption.The energy band gap was calculated according to Tauc plot as demonstrated in Fig. 6 (b).The band gap energies for WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 samples were determined to be 2.80, 2.89 and 2.97 eV, respectively.It could be seen that band gap energy was somewhat increased after coupling g-C 3 N 4 with WO 3 microspheres to construct WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite.Previously, we reported a band gap energy of 2.70 eV for bulk g-C 3 N 4 , which was reduced to 2.63 eV in surface charge modified graphitic carbon nanotubes 34.In general, bulk g-C 3 N 4 has a band gap energy of 2.70 eV, which can be shifted towards higher or lower values depending on structure and surface modification of graphitic carbon nitride.Similarly, commercial WO 3 has a band gap energy of 2.70 eV, which can be increased or decreased by fabricating WO 3 with different structures such as nanorods and microspheres.For example, a band gap energy for commercial WO 3 of 2.70 eV has been reported by Raza and coworkers, which was increased to 2.76 in structured WO 3 35.In another report, a band gap energy of 2.79 eV has been reported for WO 3 nanosheets 36.All these findings confirm that band gap energy of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 can be altered with their structural modification and protonation.Thus, band gap energy of g-C 3 N 4 was increased towards higher value due to surface modification, whereas, WO 3 band gap energy was increased due to developing microspheres.When, g-C 3 N 4 was coupled with WO 3 microspheres, a further band gap energy was increased, possibly due to good interaction of 3D/2D heterojunction with development of hollow microspheres using a single step hydrothermal approach. The production of photogenerated charge carrier and their recombination can be assessed through Photoluminescence (PL) analysis.The higher PL intensity, resulting in more recombination of photogenerated charge carrier.The charges separation efficiency of WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples have been demonstrated in Fig. 6 (c).Using pristine g-C 3 N 4 , stronger emission peak was appeared, attributed to faster recombination of photogenerated electron and holes over the catalyst surface 37.Furthermore, g-C 3 N 4 PL intensity was gradually decreased, when it was coupled with WO 3 , obviously due to Z-scheme heterojunction formation, resulting in superior charge carrier separation 38,39.Previously, Pan and coworkers reported the synthesis of Z-scheme WO 3-x /TiO 2 composite and observed higher charges separation efficiency with 10 WO 3 loading to TiO 2 , any WO 3 loading beyond this value (i.e., 5, 15, and 20 wt. WO 3 ) has increased the PL intensity of TiO 2 39.It could be seen that Z-scheme heterojunction formation between g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 accelerates the transfer of electrons and enabling proficient charge carrier separation.This suggests, WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction found very efficient photocatalyst for separation and transfer of electrons and similar findings have been reported in the literature 16.Therefore, constructing a WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction would enabling efficient production and separation of charge carrier and would be beneficial for efficient CO 2 reduction under visible light. XPS analysis of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 was carried out to analyze elemental states in the composite sample.Fig. 7 (a) shows high resolution W 4f spectrum with binding energies 36.1 and 38.1 eV for W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 , respectively, corresponds to W 6 oxidation state of WO 3 40.As shown in Fig. 7 (b), N 1s spectrum shows two peaks with binding energies 399.2 and 400.7 eV, ascribed to SP 2 hybridized NeCN and amino functional group.The XPS peak at 404.9 eV can be assigned to proton present over the g-C 3 N 4 surface because of surface charge modification and similarly reported in literature 41.Fig. 7 (c Furthermore, band positions of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 are very important to understand the direction of charges transfer among the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite.The valence band (E VB ) positions of g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 were calculated using the wide spectra of XPS and results are reported in Fig. 7 (e-f).The VB position of 1.64 eV was obtained for g-C 3 N 4 , whereas, WO 3 presents VB position of 2.55 eV.Thus, CB positions were calculated, based on their band gap energies using Eq. ( 1). here, E VB is the valence band edge, E CB is the conduction band edge, E bg is the band gap energy of a semiconductor.The CB values were obtained to be -1.13eV and -0.25 eV for g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively.Previously, Chen et al., synthesized WO 3 nanosheets and reported CB and VB band positions of -0.42 and 2.37 eV, respectively 36.Similarly, a CB position of -0.32 eV for mesoporous WO 3 has been reported 42.Recently, CB and VB band position of -0.26 and 2.37 eV, respectively, for WO 3 were observed, which were favorable for CH 4 formation 16.In another development, VB positions of 1.585 and 3.275 eV for g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively, while, CB positions of -1.125 and 0.905 eV for g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively, have been reported 43.Thus, the band positions of current work have good agreement with the reported values in the literature.It is obvious that CB of g-C 3 N 4 (-1.13 eV) is more negative than the CB of WO 3 (-0.25 eV), however, CB of WO 3 is not much suitable for CO 2 reduction to CO.Thus, there would be possibility of Z-scheme heterojunction formation with the electrons transfer from CB of WO 3 to VB of g-C 3 N 4 under visible light irradiation.Thus, a good band structure of WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 would be possible to maximize photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and water/H 2 oxidation process under visible light irradiation. The activity test of photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O for the production of CO and CH 4 was conducted without providing external heat source in a fixed-bed photoreactor system under visible light irradiation.First, quality control experiments were carried out using either the photocatalyst or the feed mixture under light irradiation.In the first case, photocatalyst was immersed inside the photoreactor and the reaction was conducted in the presence of nitrogen gas, but without using CO 2 /H 2 O feed mixture under light irradiation.In the second case, CO 2 /H 2 O feed mixture was supplied to reactor, but in the absent of photocatalyst under light irradiation.In the third case, reaction was conducted in the presence of both the feed mixture (CO 2 /H 2 O) and photocatalyst, but without using light irradiation.In the either case, without using feed mixture or the photocatalyst, no detectable carbonbased products were observed under light irradiation, confirming that all the three components i.e., photocatalyst, feed mixture (CO 2 /H 2 O) and source of irradiation are necessary during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.This indicates that photocatalyst is clean and carbonbased products such as CO and CH 4 were originated during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process under light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of WO 3 , g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite for CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 under visible light has been demonstrated in Fig. 8 (a).Using WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 , the CO evolution of 121 and 152 mole g-cat -1 , respectively, were achieved.This reveals CO production over the g-C 3 N 4 was 1.26 times higher than it was produced using WO 3 photocatalyst.Similarly, production of CH 4 (65.8 mole g-cat -1 ) over the g-C 3 N 4 was 1.15 times lower than it was produced using WO 3 .This reveals that g-C 3 N 4 is more capable for stimulating CO 2 reduction to CO because of its more negative conduction band position (CB-1.13eV) compared to WO 3 (CB-0.25eV), in addition of faster charge carrier separation due to protonation with 2D layered structure.It could be seen that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was occurred over WO 3 with small amount of CO and CH 4 production under visible light irradiation.Previously, significantly higher amount of CH 4 production over the WO 3 nanosheets was observed compared to commercial WO 3 powder.This was evidently due to more negative CB position of WO 3 nanosheets (CB-0.42eV) compared to CB position of commercial WO 3 (CB0.05eV) under visible light irradiation 36.A methane formation of 6.03 mol g -1 over pure WO 3 with CB position of -0.26 eV has been reported 16.Similarly, production of CH 3 COOH over WO 3 during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light has been reported 44.Using commercial WO 3 , a lower amount of CH 4 was produced, which was significantly enhanced with mesoporous WO 3 .More importantly, production of CH 3 OH was obviously increased over the mesoporous WO 3 compared to commercial WO 3 photocatalyst.It is noticeable that CB position of mesoporous WO 3 of -0.32 eV has been reported, which is favorable for CH 4 formation only.However, significant amount of methanol formation was due to thermo-catalysis generates unique synergistic photo/thermo-catalytic effect 42.In another development, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O was conducted over WO 3 -TiO 2 /Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 composite catalyst and reported the production of CO and CH 4 under visible light.It was reported that pure WO 3 can work as a photocatalyst and amount of CO and CH 4 evolution rate of 5.39 and 0.34 mol g -1 h -1 , respectively, have been reported.Besides, higher photocatalytic activity of WO 3 was observed compared to TiO 2 , whereas, WO 3 promoted more CH 4 formation due to higher visible light absorption.The CH 4 formation was further improved in TiO 2 /WO 3 and WO 3 -TiO 2 /Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 samples 35.Similarly, a photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity over WO 3 (CB 0.4and VB3.10) with CO and CH 4 production rate of 0.6 and 0.15 mol g -1 h -1 has been reported, whereas, CO and CH 4 production rates were further increased in Z-scheme heterojunction of FePc/WO 3 composite 45.Recently, Wang et al., reported that during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process, back reactions occur through methane oxidation, resulting in the production of CO and CO 2 46.In the current work, as the CB of WO 3 (-0.25 eV) is favorable for methane formation, thus, initially, CH 4 would be produced over the WO 3 , which possible be converted to CO due to back reaction through methane oxidation.All these findings confirm that WO 3 can be used as a photocatalyst or cocatalyst to promote g-C 3 N 4 photoactivity for stimulating CO 2 reduction process under visible light irradiation. The photoactivity of WO 3 coupled g-C 3 N 4 composite was further conducted, whereas, 25 WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 exhibits highest photoactivity for the production of CO with yield rates 289 mole g-cat -1 , 1.9 and 2.4 times more than employing pristine g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively.Similarly, highest CH 4 production over 25 WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 of 265 mole g-cat -1 was achieved, which is 3.49 and 4.02-fold higher than it was produced over g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 , respectively.This considerably enhanced photocatalytic activity was evidently due to Z-scheme heterojunction formation between g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 with proficient charge carrier separation among the semiconductors 47.However, any WO 3 loading above 25 lowers the photoactivity of WO Previously, Mo-doped WO 3 :0.33H 2 O was investigated and reported 5.2-fold higher CH 4 production (5.3 mole g-cat -1 h -1 ) compared to pristine WO 3 under the visible light irradiation 16.Similarly, Cu 2 O decorated WO 3 was tested for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CO as the major product under visible light 20.In another development, Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 composite was tested for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light, whereas, CO and CH 4 production rate of 271.3 and 39.1 mole g-cat -1 h -1 , respectively, were obtained 18.3D/2D Cu 2 O/WO 3 composite tested for CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 with yield rates of 7.04 and 8.42 mole g-cat -1 h -1 , respectively under visible light 27.All these findings confirm that WO 3 is an efficient cocatalyst for maximizing photoinduced CO 2 reduction process under visible light irradiation. Apart from the efficient photocatalysts, the photocatalytic activity is extremely influenced by the external conditions such as reactor pressure, temperature, light intensity, catalyst loading and the molar feed ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 .Fig. 9 shows the effect of different catalyst loading of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 on the yield rates of CO and CH 4 at different irradiation time under light intensity 20 mW cm -2 and H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio 0.20.The time dependent production of CH 4 at different catalyst loading ranging 50-250 mg has been demonstrated in Fig. 9 (a-b).As shown in Fig. 9 (a), production of CH 4 was increased with increasing WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 catalyst loading.The CH 4 production with 250 mg was 1.35 and 1.62-fold higher than loading amounts of 150 and 50 mg, respectively.This increased in production rate was noticeably because of more active surface available at a higher amount of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 loading, for activating photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under the same reaction conditions.Comparatively, production of CH 4 per unit mass was decreased with increasing catalyst loading and trends were continuous over the entire reaction time.The decreased in yield rates per unit mass were evidently due to lower surface area exposed to light irradiation, resulting in lower rate of reaction per unit mass of catalyst loading.All these findings confirm that photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process can be enhanced by providing more active sites through higher catalyst loading. The effect of catalyst loading on the performance of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O to CO at different irradiation time has been presented in Fig. 9 (c-d).As shown in Fig. 9 (c), the trends of CO production are much similar to the CH 4 , whereas, highest CO evolution was obtained with catalyst loading of 250 mg.However, a decreased in CO production rate per unit mass was observed with increasing catalyst loading.All these findings confirm that higher catalyst loading can increase the amount of CO and CH 4 production, however, yield rates are dependent on the catalyst surface exposed to light irradiation.Thus, lower catalyst loading gave higher yield rates per unit mass, however, production rate can be maximized by increasing catalyst loading under the same reaction conditions. The photocatalytic performance of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst was further investigated by varying initial H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratios, while keeping all other parameters constant (catalyst loading 150 mg, light intensity 20 mW cm -2 ).The H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio of 0.2, 0.40 and 0.60 was adjusted by varying water saturator temperature from 30 to 50 C, while keeping CO 2 flow rate constant (i.e., 20 mL min - 1 ).Fig. 10 shows production of CO and CH 4 during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with different initial molar feed ratio of H 2 O/CO 2 at constant reactor temperature and pressure.As shown in Fig. 10 (a), continuous production of CO was obtained over the entire irradiation time, whereas, highest CO was obtained at water saturator temperature of 40 C (H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio of 0.40).The highest CO of 346 mole g-cat -1 produced at 40 C (feed ratio 0.40), which is 1.17 and 1.55-fold higher than 30 C (feed ratio of 0.2) and 50 C (feed ratio of 0.6), respectively.This reveals that highest photocatalytic activity can be obtained at optimized H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio. Similarly, CH 4 yield increases as the water saturator temperature was increased until reaching to maximum at a molar feed ratio of 0.40 and then it was declined as demonstrated in Fig. 10 (b).Evidently, highest CO and CH 4 production rate was detected at a molar feed ratio of 0.40, while, their production rate was declined when the temperature was further increased.Highest CH 4 yield of 452 mole g-cat -1 was produced at feed ratio 0.40, which is 1.22 and 1.83-fold higher than using feed ratio 0.6 and 0.20, respectively.Comparatively, at optimized H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, production of CH 4 was 1.31 times more than CO production under the same reaction condition.This reveals that amount of H 2 O/CO 2 attached to catalyst surface not only enhanced catalyst photoactivity, but also alters selectivity of the products.The selectivity for CO production was decreased from 54.48 to 37.60 by increasing feed ratio from 0.20 to 0.60.Conversely, CH 4 selectivity was increased from 45.52-62.39 by increasing H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio from 0.20 to 0.60, which is 37 increment under the same reaction conditions.This increased of CH 4 selectivity at higher H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio was evidently due to more protons available for converting CO to CH 4 . These findings were further described on the process of adsorption competition between CO 2 and H 2 O reactants over the catalyst active sites 48.It could be seen that yield of CO and CH 4 was increased by increasing H 2 O/CO 2 feed until reaching to maximum, then production was declined.At lower H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, there would be more CO 2 adsorption over the catalyst surface with smaller amount of H 2 O vapors attached to the catalyst active sites.Under such conditions, oxidation process for the production of H would not be efficient.Similarly, at very high H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratios, there would be more H 2 O molecules attached to the catalyst surface, and CO 2 has to compete with H 2 O molecules to adsorb over the catalyst active sites, resulting in slower reduction process.This reveals that excessive attachment of H 2 O or CO 2 molecules over the catalyst surface retarded the redox (oxidation and reduction) reactions, resulting in lower photocatalytic activity for CO and CH 4 production.Previously, similar observations have been reported during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction at different H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio for the production of CO and CH 4 under visible light 27,47.According to thermodynamics, for CO production, 2 protons (H ) are required, whereas, one mole of CH 4 is produced by the involvement of 8 electrons and 8 protons during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process.Thus, at lower H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio, number of protons produced were not sufficient to promote CH 4 production, however, when H 2 O/ CO 2 feed ratio was increased, more protons would be produced during water oxidation process, thus, enabling appreciable amount of methane formation. The performance of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst was further investigated using hydrogen as the reducing agents, while keeping all the parameters constants.For this purpose, instead of using water, CO 2 and H 2 of feed ratio 1.0 were regulated by mass flow controllers and were mixed in a gas mixer before entering to reactor and results are presented in Fig. 11 (a).Obviously, CO production was further increased when CO 2 was reduced in the presence of H 2 instead of using water under the same reaction conditions.This increased in CO production during CO 2 reduction with H 2 would be due to activation of reversed water gas shift (RWGS) reaction under light irradiation.Furthermore, during CO 2 reduction by hydrogen through RWGS reaction, CO was continuously evolved over the entire irradiation time.However, during CO 2 reduction with H 2 O, initially, production of CO was highest, but it was gradually reached to steady state.Highest CO evolution of 1005 mole g-cat -1 was obtained using CO 2 /H 2 feed mixture, which is 3.48-fold higher than employing water as the reducing agent for CO 2 reduction.More importantly, CH 4 production was declined when water was replaced with H 2 as the reducing agent, probably due to activation of RWGS reaction.In general, enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction toward CO production was obviously due to activation of revere water gas shift reaction according to Eq. ( 2) 6. (2) The performance of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was further investigated using different light sources with their intensities 20 and 100 mW cm -2 using lamps 35 and 100 W, respectively, and time dependent yield rates of CO and CH 4 have been demonstrated in Fig. 11 (b).Obviously, both CO and CH 4 were produced continuously over the entire irradiation time under both types of lamps.However, using light intensity of 100 mW cm -2 , higher amount of CO was produced, compared to lower light intensity (20 mW cm -2 ).Highest CO evolution of 753 mole g-cat -1 was obtained with light intensity 100 mW cm -2 , which is 2.61-fold higher than using 20 mW cm -2 light intensity.Comparatively, highest CH 4 production of 215 mole g-cat -1 observed with light intensity 100 mW cm -2 , a decreased of 1.23 times than it was produced using lower intensity (20 mW cm -2 ).Using higher light intensity, production of CO was increased due to more production of electrons and their utilization for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO.However, decreased in CH 4 yield rate attributed to steam reforming of methane (SRM) in the presence of excessive electrons and holes according to Eq. (3). (3) Furthermore, hydrogen produced during reaction in Eq. ( 3) can be further utilized for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO through RWGS reaction as illustrated in Eq. ( 2).Therefore, significant amount of CO formation at higher light intensity was evidently due to more production of electrons and activation of SRM and RWGS reactions.Previously, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction by hydrogen with CO production over Ag-NPs/TiO 2 NWs has been reported 6. Since the stability of photocatalysts has significant index for practical applications, the photoactivity of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite was conducted in multiple cycles by repeating the experiments under the identical reaction conditions.The stability tests were conducted using two different light intensities i.e., 20 and 100 mW cm -2 and the results are presented in Fig. 12.As demonstrated in Fig. 12 (a), continuous generation of CO and CH 4 was found in all the three cycles.More importantly, in the first cycle, CO and CH 4 production were much closer, whereas, production rates of both CO and CH 4 was increased in the 2nd and 3rd cyclic runs.The CO production of 1.64-fold higher was obtained than CH 4 evolution after 3rd cyclic run.Highest CO evolution of 598 mole g-cat -1 was acquired in the 3rd cycle, which is 1.28 and 2.1fold higher than it was produced in 2nd and 1st cyclic runs, respectively.Similarly, WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 exhibits CH 4 evolution of 365 mole gcat -1 in 3rd cycle, which is 1.09 and 1.38 folds higher than it was produced in a 2nd and 1st cyclic runs, respectively.This demonstrates high stability of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst due to successful fabrication of heterojunction composite with larger exposed catalyst active surface area and faster charge carrier separation 12.The increased in yield rates of CO and CH 4 over the cyclic runs could be explained because of partial reduction of WO 3 and/or activation of adsorbed carbon species over the catalyst surface, resulting in more production of carbon-based products. Fig. 12 (b) presents CO and CH 4 production over WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite with light intensity 100 mW cm -2 in three cycles under the identical reaction conditions.In all the three cycles, continuous generation of CO and CH 4 was found with no declined in photo-activity.The highest CO evolution of 780 mole g-cat -1 was obtained in a third cyclic run, which is 1.03 and 1.04 folds higher than it was produced in 2nd and 1st cycles, respectively.Similarly, CH 4 evolution of 328 mole g-cat -1 after 3rd cycle was found, 1.52 and 1.55-fold higher than it was produced in 2nd and 1st cycles, respectively.All these results confirm that continuous evolution of CO and CH 4 was evolved by employing higher light intensity.This further confirms that WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite maintains its stability in cycles, although very high light intensity (5 folds higher) was employed.High stability of WO 3 based composite catalysts have been reported in literature during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over iron phthalocyanine/porous WO 3 composite for continuous production of CO and CH 4 with stability for 5 cycles 45.More interestingly, Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 composite sustained continuous photocatalytic activity for CO 2 photoreduction to CO and CH 4 up to 60 days 49.All these findings confirm that WO 3 based composite photocatalyst sustained high stability for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation. The fresh and spent WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite samples were further analyzed to determine structural changes after three cycles.Fig. 12 (c) shows Raman analysis of fresh and spent WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite after three cycles with different light intensities.Obviously, all the Raman peaks in fresh WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 also appeared in spent composite samples irradiated at intensity of 20 and 100 mW cm -2 .However, peak intensities were altered with lower and high-power light intensities.For example, lower peak intensity at 806.4 cm -1 was observed using a fresh sample, which was gradually increased using 20 and 100 mW cm -2 .The increased in peak intensities were probably due to morphological change of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 structure in different cycles 23.As discussed in Fig. 2 (b), Raman peak intensities of pristine WO 3 are much higher compared to g-C 3 N 4 , therefore, during cyclic runs with high power light intensity, more WO 3 was exposed to light irradiations.Due to these alternations, there were continuous increased of activity for the formation of CO and CH 4 in cycles under different light intensities.Thus, WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite has high stability for continuous evolution of CO and CH 4 in cycles under visible light irradiation. According to the above discussion, a part of efficient photocatalyst, photocatalytic activity is also dependent on the light intensity, catalyst loading, feed ratio and type of reducing agents and results are summarized in Table 1.It could be seen, using different types of photocatalysts, CO was identified as the major CO 2 reduction product with H 2 O reducing agent (H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio 0.20), catalyst loading 150 mg and light intensity 20 mW cm -2 .Alternatively, with different amounts of catalyst loading from 50-250 mg, various amounts of CO and CH 4 were obtained.At lower amount of catalyst loading, production of CH 4 was highest, while, it was reduced with increasing catalyst loading.This is obvious that at higher catalyst loading, more electrons would be produced over the catalyst active sites, which probably also reduces CH 4 to CO under the same reaction conditions.Furthermore, by increasing H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, production of CH 4 was increased due to the availability of more protons available for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 under light intensity 20 mW cm -2 and catalyst loading 150 mg.More importantly, when water was replaced with hydrogen, the highest amount of CO was produced, probably due to the activation of reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.In addition, when light intensity was increased from 20 to 100 mW cm -2 , both the production of CO and CH 4 were enhanced. As discussed above, production rates of CO and CH 4 are dependent on the catalyst loading and light intensity, thus, a performance comparison of photocatalysts during CO 2 reduction under different reaction conditions would not be possible.Besides, production of CO requires two electrons, whereas, CH 4 needs eight electrons, thus, efficient analysis of photon flux utilization by photocatalysts during CO 2 reduction process based on production rate would not be possible.Thus, it would be more appropriate to calculate quantum yield (QY) to compare the performance of different reaction systems.QY for CO and CH 4 production was calculated under visible light irradiations of wavelength 420 nm and light intensity 20 and 100 mW cm -2 using Eq. ( 4) and (5) For CO production, two electrons were consumed, whereas, CH 4 was produced through the involvement of eight electrons, thus, 2 and 8 has been added in Eqs. ( 4) and (5).Besides, number of incident photons were calculated using wavelength 420 nm, light intensity of 20 and 100 mW cm -1 and illuminated area of 28 cm 2 .The summary of QY for CO and CH 4 production for all types of photocatalytic systems have been presented in Table 2.The WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite gave highest CO QY of 2.131 during CO 2 conversion to CO through RWGS reaction.Similarly, QY for CH 4 was estimated to be 3.829 using photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O at H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio 0.40.All these findings confirm that higher H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio is favorable for more CH 4 production, however, RWGS reaction promoted CO evolution under the same reaction conditions.A detailed literature for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction has been summarized in a Table 2. Mo-doped WO 3 :0.33H 2 O was investigated and reported CH 4 production of 5.3 mole g-cat -1 h -1 under visible light 16.In another development, Pd-Au/TiO 2 -WO 3 composite was tested for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with CO and CH 4 production rate of 271.3 and 39.1 mole g-cat -1 h -1 , respectively 18.Similarly, CO and CH 4 yield rates of 7.04 and 8.42 mole g-cat -1 h -1 over 3D/2D Cu 2 O/WO 3 composite obtained during CO 2 reduction under visible light 27.Recently, WO 3 -TiO 2 /Cu 2 ZnInS 2 composite investigated for CO 2 reduction and yield rates of 5.37 and 1.69 mole gcat -1 h -1 for CO and CH 4 yield rates have been estimated under visible light irradiation 35.In another study, CO and CH 4 yield rates of 4.1 and 3.5 mole g-cat -1 h -1 estimated over FePc/WO 3 nanocomposites during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light 45.By comparing all these findings with the current work, significantly enhanced photoactivity for CO and CH 4 production over WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction was obtained due to larger external active surface area and proficient charge carrier separation under visible light irradiation. According to band structure, valence band (VB) of WO 3 is more positive than the VB of g-C 3 N 4 ; conduction band (CB) of WO 3 is more positive than CB of g-C 3 N 4 , which is appropriate to develop type II or Zscheme heterojunction under visible light irradiation.It is obvious that CB of g-C 3 N 4 (-1.13 eV) is more negative than the CB of WO 3 (-0.25 eV), thus, electrons would possibly be transferred from CB of g-C 3 N 4 to CB of WO 3 through type II heterojunction formation between WO 3 and g-C 3 N 4 .However, CB of WO 3 is not suitable for CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 , thus, there would be possibility of Z-scheme heterojunction formation with the electrons transfer from CB of WO 3 to VB of g-C 3 N 4 under visible light irradiation.Besides, electrons transfer through Zscheme heterojunction would also be possible due to lower band gap energy of WO 3 (E bg 2.80 eV) compared to g-C 3 N 4 (E bg 2.89 eV). A schematic of Z-scheme heterojunction of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst with charge carrier separation and production of CO and CH 4 has been demonstrated in Fig. 13.Under visible light irradiations, WO 3 could be excited due to its lower energy band gap (2.80 eV) than g-C 3 N 4 (2.89 eV), producing electron/hole pair (e -/h ) as illustrated in Eq. ( 6).The CB electrons of WO 3 were transferred to VB of g-C 3 N 4 for its activation (Eq.7), resulting in proficient charge carrier separation.Due to protonation, g-C 3 N 4 would also help for providing sink for capturing electrons before being utilized in the CO 2 reduction process.The electrons would be utilized for CO 2 reduction through Eqs. ( 8) and (9), while, holes were consumed for water and H 2 oxidation trough Eqs.(10) and (11) 35. (10) 20.In another work, significant amount of O 2 evolution over Nb doped TiO 2 /g-C 3 N 4 composite during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O has been reported 50.All these findings confirm that there would be possible production of O 2 over the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst, however, it was not reported in the current work due to the limitations of GC system. Furthermore, water and CO 2 are firstly adsorbed over the catalyst surface, while their adsorption is dependent on the H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio in the feed mixture.At lower H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio, more CO 2 molecules, chemisorbed to catalyst active surface, would be converted into active -CO 2 .Alternatively, at higher H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratios, more water molecules attached to catalyst surface sites would be converted to protons (H ) and oxygen during oxidation process.Thus, at not available.lower H 2 O/CO 2 molar feed ratio, more CO was evolved, whereas, production of CH 4 was noticeably enhanced at higher H 2 O/CO 2 feed ratio due to the presence of excessive protons over the catalyst surface.Besides, photogenerated electrons are effectively transferred from WO 3 to g-C 3 N 4 due to Z-scheme heterojunction, thus, facilitating the separation of photogenerated electron and hole under visible light irradiation.Thus, proficient oxidation and reduction reaction occurs simultaneously, resulting in more production of CO and CH 4 over the catalyst surface 48.Similarly, when light intensity was increased from 20 to 100 mW cm -2 , CO and CH 4 production rates were increased, obviously due to more production of electrons over the WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite catalyst for CO 2 reduction.In general, enhanced photocatalytic activity of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite was obviously due to good interfacial transfer and separation of charge carrier under visible light irradiations with their appropriate redox potentials for CO 2 reduction and water/hydrogen oxidation.Thus, constructing a Z-scheme heterojunction with larger exposed active surface area and faster charge carrier separation with appropriate redox (oxidation and reduction) potentials are necessary for efficient photocatalysis process."}, {"llm generation": "WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite", "source": "The significantly enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 over WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite was achieved than using pristine g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 samples.", "context": "In this work, g-C 3 N 4 coupled with WO 3 to construct Z-scheme heterojunction was successfully synthesized via hydrothermal approach.The new developed WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite shows good interfacial transfer and separation of charge carrier separation under visible light irradiation.The significantly enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 over WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite was achieved than using pristine g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 samples.Under visible light irradiation, WO 3 donates electrons to g-C 3 N 4 due to their different conduction band position with the formation of Z-scheme heterojunction, enabling proficient charges separation among the semiconductors with enhanced CO 2 reduction to CO and CH 4 .In addition, effects of different parameters such as catalyst loading, types of reducing agents (H 2 and water) and light intensities were further tested to understand their effects on the performance of WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst.With the increase of catalyst loading and light intensity, production of both CO and CH 4 were enhanced due to the availability of more active sites in addition of proficient production of charge carrier and their separation.Comparatively, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O enables more CH 4 formation, whereas, hydrogen promoted more CO formation due to RWGS reaction.Similarly, using higher light intensity photocatalytic activity was obviously enhanced due to more generation of charge carrier, resulting in significantly improved CO and CH 4 formation.This reveals that fabricating structured WO 3 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction composite is a promising approach for stimulating photocatalytic CO 2 conversion to solar fuels under visible light irradiations.
