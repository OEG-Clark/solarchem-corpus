Compared with untreated TiO 2 nanosheets, the H 2 SO 4 -modified samples exhibited markedly improved quantum yield (QY), energy returned on energy invested (EROEI), and turnover number (TON) for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 under visible-light irradiation.As supported by physical-chemical characterization, the enhanced photocatalytic activities can be attributed to acidification promoting the formation of hydroxyl groups (Brnsted acidic sites) and oxygen vacancies/Ti 3 species.Thus, efficient charge separation and transfer to the TiO 2 surface for both CO 2 reduction and the accompanying H 2 O oxidation is facilitated.The highest activity for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 was obtained with TiO 2 nanosheets with 0.5 mol L -1 H 2 SO 4 , with QY, EROEI, and TON of 0.726, 0.335, and 83.124, respectively.Furthermore, the catalyst maintained stable performance throughout five successive recyclability test runs."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2 nanosheets", "source": "The photocatalytic activity of the fabricated TiO 2 nanosheets toward gas-phase CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O vapor under visible light irradiation was experimentally investigated.", "context": "XRD was applied to investigate the possible changes in the crystallinities and phase purities of TiO 2 samples synthesized under different conditions (Fig. 1).Remarkably, all of the samples showed diffraction peaks that were well consistent with the standard anatase pattern (JCPDS Card No. 21-1272).No impurity phase was observed, implying that the products had high purity.No appreciable changes in the numbers, intensities, and full-widths at half-maximum (FWHM) of the peaks could be observed among the samples 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , suggesting that modification with H 2 SO 4 does not affect the crystallographic structure of TiO 2 . Fig. 2 shows a sequence of representative FESEM micrographs, which clearly display the morphological features and surface characteristics of the TiO 2 samples prepared under different conditions.All of the TiO 2 samples (Fig. 2(a-d)) showed uniform sheetshaped truncated octahedral bipyramid structures, with an average thickness of ca.41 nm and a side length of ca.120 nm.No obvious morphology changes were observed before and after surface acidification.HRTEM (Fig. 3) was employed to obtain information on the crystallographic structure of the TiO 2 nanosheets at an atomic scale.The lattice spacing parallel to the top and bottom facets was measured as 0.235 nm, corresponding to the d-spacing of the (0 0 1) planes of anatase TiO 2 .The interplanar distance of 0.353 nm between the adjacent lattice fringes on the side surface is consistent with the value for the thermodynamically stable (1 0 1) facet.Therefore, the top/bottom surfaces and side surfaces enclosing the TiO 2 nanosheets are surmised to be high-energy 0 0 1 facets and lowenergy 1 0 1 facets, respectively.Based on a slab model of anatase TiO 2 single crystals 35, H 2 SO 4 acidification left the percentages of exposed 0 0 1 facets on 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 essentially unchanged at approximately 60. The pore structure and BET specific surface area of each of the products were evaluated through nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements.As shown in Fig. 4, all of the TiO 2 samples showed type IV isotherms with a well-pronounced hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range of 0.9 to 1.0, according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification, indicating the presence of mesopores (2 -50 nm) 36.The corresponding hysteresis loops were of type H3, implying the formation of slit-shaped pores from the aggregation of single-crystal nanosheets 12.The pore size distributions (inset in Fig. 4) calculated from the desorption isotherms by the BJH method indicate that all of the TiO 2 samples exhibited wide distributions ranging from 10 to 95 nm. The BET specific surface areas of each of the products are summarized in Table 1.As a control standard, 0-TiO 2 exhibits a surface area of 18.01 m 2 g -1 .An increment in H 2 SO 4 concentration (0.2-0.7 mol L -1 ) led to a slight decrease in BET surface area (14.51-12.28m 2 g -1 ).This may be attributed to some H 2 SO 4 molecules entering and plugging the pores of TiO 2 . XPS analysis was utilized to investigate the chemical environments and the electron-binding energies of TiO 2 samples prepared under various conditions.The C 1s level at 284.6 eV was taken as an internal reference to correct the shift of the binding energy.The presence of characteristic peaks in the wide-scan XPS survey spectra of the derivatized TiO 2 samples (Fig. 5a) demonstrated the existence of Ti, O, F, and S on the crystal surface.The S/Ti ratios of the acidified TiO 2 samples were about 0.195, 0.229, and 0.267 for 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively. The high-resolution scanning XPS spectra of the Ti 2p core level region of all of the samples are shown in Fig. 5b.Generally, the Ti 2p spectrum can be fitted by four peaks at 457.4, 458.5, 463.3, and 464.4 eV, corresponding to the signals of Ti 3 2p 3/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 , Ti 3 2p 1/2 , and Ti 4 2p 1/2 , respectively 37.It was confirmed from Fig. 5b that the two Ti 2p doublet peaks at 458.5 and 464.4 eV can be ascribed to Ti 4 bound to oxygen in this study.No obvious shoulder was detected in the low-energy region of the Ti 2p 3/2 spectrum, which can be attributed to the insensitivity of XPS in distinguishing Ti 3 and Ti 4 .The S 2p XPS spectra of the catalysts shown in Fig. 5c identify the state of the sulfur species on the surface of the acidified TiO 2 .The binding energy of S 2p was observed as ca.169 eV for each of the acidified samples, in good agreement with the S 2p peak of S 6 38.No signal at 161.0-162.8eV for sulfide or at 164 eV for elemental sulfur could be detected 39.In comparison with the unmodified sample, all of the H 2 SO 4 -modified samples displayed a Ti 2p 3/2 core level at a slightly higher BE value (Fig. 5b), implying the formation of a bridging bidentate structure involving coordination of Ti 4 with bidentate SO 4 2-.The O 1s XPS spectra are illustrated in Fig. 5d, which could be deconvoluted into four peaks using Shirley backgrounds and Voigt (mixed Lorentzian-Gaussian) functions 40.The major peak located at 529.4 eV can be assigned to lattice oxygen (Ti O Ti), and the other three peaks at 530.8, 531.7, and 532.8 eV match those of oxygen in sulfate species, surface hydroxyl groups, and adsorbed water molecules, respectively 41.According to the deconvoluted peak areas, the percentages of the four peaks are summarized in Table 2.As can be seen in Table 2, the percentages of surface hydroxyl groups were 23, 26, 28, and 30 and the percentages of adsorbed H 2 O were 9, 10, 13, and 16 for 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively.These results demonstrate that acidification increased the number of hydroxyl groups and water molecules on the TiO 2 surface.The reason for the increase in the number of surface Ti-OH groups was the dissociation of H 2 O on the more abundant oxygen vacancies caused by acidification 42.The increase in the number of water molecules may have stemmed from their bonding at the increased number of surface bridging hydroxyl groups 43.Moreover, a reduced Ti O Ti percentage was found with increasing initial H 2 SO 4 concentration, implying that H 2 SO 4 treatment followed by heat treatment has a positive influence in increasing the number of oxygen vacancies.The atomic ratio of Ti O Ti/Ti of acidified TiO 2 was less than 2, implying the existence of oxygen vacancies.The existence of oxygen vacancies was further proved by UV/Vis DRS. As shown in Fig. 5e, in high-resolution scanning XPS spectra the binding energy of F 1s was situated at 683.8-684.5 eV for all of the TiO 2 nanosheets, which is typical for Ti F species on a TiO 2 surface 44.No signal for F -in the lattice (688.5 eV) was found, further illustrating that all of the F -was adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2 rather than in the lattice. EPR is a highly effective characterization technique for determining paramagnetic species having one or more unpaired electrons, and is usually used to identify the presence of Ti 3 in TiO 2 45.It is known that a g-value of 1.988 can be unequivocally assigned to a paramagnetic Ti 3 center in a distorted rhombic oxygen ligand field, and that the EPR signal intensity is correlated with Intensity (a.u.) g valu e g 1.988Fig. 6.EPR spectra of 0-TiO2, 0.2-TiO2, 0.5-TiO2, and 0.7-TiO2. the amount of Ti 3 in the sample 46,47.As shown in Fig. 6, the EPR signal assigned to Ti 3 progressively intensified as the concentration of H 2 SO 4 used for treatment was increased, confirming that surface acidification followed by heat treatment enhanced the generation of Ti 3 .Ti 3 defects originated through two possible pathways 48,49.One involved the transfer of two extra electrons from oxygen vacancies at the two-fold coordinated bridging sites to adjacent Ti 4 sites.The other involved the introduction of an electron into the 3d orbital of Ti 4 through bulk substitution of lattice O 2-atoms in TiO 2 by F -.The most evident distinction between the types of Ti 3 defects is that F -derived Ti 3 cannot induce any observed photon excitation in the infrared region, whereas Ti 3 associated with oxygen vacancies can give rise to such excitation 49. The light absorption properties of the TiO 2 samples synthesized under various conditions were analyzed by UV/Vis DRS and are depicted in Fig. 7a.All of the samples displayed an absorption edge in the region of 400 nm, suggesting that no sulfur had been incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice.A broad absorption band beyond 400 nm up to the visible region was apparent for samples 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , and the absorption intensity increased with increasing initial H 2 SO 4 concentration.Since various functional groups on TiO 2 may introduce a new absorption band in the visible light region 50, 0.5 mol L -1 Na 2 SO 4 instead of 0.5 mol L -1 H 2 SO 4 was used to modify the TiO 2 nanosheets under analogous conditions.No obvious difference in the UV/Vis DRS between 0-TiO 2 and the 0-TiO 2 modified with 0.5 mol L -1 Na 2 SO 4 (Fig. 7b) could be observed, indicating that SO 4 2-could not form visible-light-active complexes on TiO 2 under our preparative conditions.Similar results have been obtained by other researchers 515253.Consequently, oxygen vacancy states between the valence and conduction bands induced by Ti 3 species contributed to the visible response of the TiO 2 samples. The band gap, E g , for each of the TiO 2 samples was evaluated from the Tauc plot equation 54: where is the absorption coefficient, h represents Planck's constant, refers to the frequency of the photon, A is a constant, and n is 1/2 for a direct transition.The relationships between ( hv) 1/2 and h for all of the TiO 2 samples are shown in Fig. 7c.The band gaps are estimated to be 3.13, 3.09, 3.07, and 3.00 eV for 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively.The gradual narrowing of the band gap from 0-TiO 2 to 0.7-TiO 2 implies increasing concentration of Ti 3 /oxygen vacancies 55. Theoretical calculations and related experiments have demonstrated that a vacancy band of electronic states would be induced due to a high vacancy concentration 56.The shallow donor level just below the conduction band is responsible for the visible light response.Three kinds of oxygen vacancy state, namely O v , O v Ti 3 , and O v :2Ti 3 0 , have been postulated by other researchers 24.The O v Ti 3 and O v :2Ti 3 0 are situated at 0.75 and 1.18 eV below the CB minimum, respectively.The number of different oxygen vacancy states in TiO 2 depends on the preparation conditions.For unmodified TiO 2 , high hydrothermal temperature facilitates cleavage of Ti O bonds and thus enhances the generation of O v Ti 3 and O v :2Ti 3 0 .Therefore, the 0-TiO 2 exhibited obvious absorption in the visible light region.During H 2 SO 4 treatment, H would react with surface oxygen giving strongly adsorbed H 2 O molecules.Upon heat treatment under vacuum conditions, the strongly adsorbed H 2 O was lost, leading to the formation of defect sites at the TiO 2 surface, as depicted in Scheme 1 30,57. Consequently, the visible absorption of TiO 2 was improved after surface acidification.The existence of oxygen vacancies was indicated indirectly by the blue colors of the samples hydrothermally treated at 240 C (see the inset in Fig. 7a), since blue coloration is an obvious characteristic of the formation of oxygen vacancies related to Ti 3 58.Moreover, together with EPR characterization, it could be concluded that the higher the Ti 3 content, the deeper the blue color.Fig. 8. Raman spectra of 0-TiO2, 0.2-TiO2, 0.5-TiO2, and 0.7-TiO2. Change of wavenumber and FWHM of the peak at around 142 cm -1 , as well as the B1g (394 cm -1 ):A1g (514 cm -1 ):Eg (636 cm -1 ) ratios of the respective TiO2 photocatalysts. Sample Wavenumber (cm -1 ) FWHM (cm -1 ) B1g (394 cm -1 ):A1g (514 cm -1 ):Eg (636 cm 3.1.7.Raman spectroscopy Raman spectroscopy was used to reveal the vibrational and structural properties of the TiO 2 catalysts.It can be observed in Fig. 8 that the spectra of all of the samples featured similar peaks at approximately 142, 195, 394, 514, and 636 cm -1 , which are consistent with the spectrum of the typical anatase TiO 2 phase.As demonstrated by Park and Siegel, oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 crystals cause an up-shift and broadening of the E g (142 cm -1 ) mode in the Raman spectrum due to the atomic rearrangement caused by oxygen vacancies 59.Moreover, the relative intensities of B 1g (394 cm -1 ), A 1g (514 cm -1 ), and E g (636 cm -1 ) are closely related to the change in the oxygen vacancies and Ti 3 quantities 26.To evaluate more clearly the distinction between the spectra, the wavenumber, FWHM, and relative intensity of each mode was determined, as listed in Table 3. Comparing the acidified samples with the non-acidified sample, the E g (142 cm -1 ) mode slightly shifted towards higher wavenumber and its FWHM was enlarged with increasing H 2 SO 4 concentration.In addition, the intensities of the B 1g (394 cm -1 ) and E g (636 cm -1 ) modes were gradually enhanced relative to that of the A 1g (514 cm -1 ) mode with increasing initial H 2 SO 4 concentration.Consequently, surface acidification leads to an inevitable increase in the defect density on the TiO 2 surface.All of these results are in accordance with the UV/Vis DRS analysis.3.1.8.PL spectra PL spectra were recorded to obtain information on the dynamics of the photogenerated species 60.Fig. 9 shows the PL spectra of the TiO 2 samples prepared under various conditions, recorded in the wavelength range 350-550 nm with excitation at 300 nm.All of the TiO 2 samples showed similar curve shapes in the range 350-550 nm, but with different intensities.Generally, the PL intensity became weaker with increasing concentration of H 2 SO 4 used for treatment, indicating a lower recombination rate of photoelectrons and holes 26.Therefore, sulfuric acid modification on TiO 2 nanosheets is favorable for efficiently separating the charge carriers by prolonging the lifetime of carriers and suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs.This result is similar to that reported by Xu et al. 11. The experimental transient photocurrent response is also deemed an effective parameter to characterize the separation efficiency of photogenerated e --h pairs 2.Further work is needed to provide additional evidence supporting the proposed superiority of surface acidification through transient photocurrent measurements. The photocatalytic activity of the fabricated TiO 2 nanosheets toward gas-phase CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O vapor under visible light irradiation was experimentally investigated.According to previous reports, a series of compounds such as CH 4 , CO, CH 3 OH, and HCOOH constitute the major carbon-containing products, and H 2 is the major reducing by-product 61.However, no substance other than CH 4 was detected by gas chromatography above the detection limit in this study.The potential for photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 is given in Eq. ( 2) with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode at pH 7.0. The amounts of generated CH 4 , in mol g -1 , with increasing time are presented in Fig. 10a.It should be noted that the 0-TiO 2 with a band gap of 3.13 eV yielded 7.43 mol g -1 CH 4 after 4 h of reaction under visible light ( 400 nm).To explore the source of CH 4 formation, a series of control experiments was performed.Direct photolysis of a mixture of pure CO 2 and H 2 O vapor in the absence of TiO 2 as well as dark adsorption were conducted.After 4 h, no carbon-containing substances were detected.In another photocatalytic process, the CO 2 reactant was replaced with highpurity Ar.No carbon compounds could be detected.Further control experiments were performed using only CO 2 as gas precursor (without water vapor) under visible light irradiation.CH 4 generation was found and the yield increased gradually during the first 2 h of irradiation and then remained almost unchanged.After 4 h of irradiation, the CH 4 yields were 6.57, 7.05, 7.62, and 7.63 mol g -1 on 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively.The results demonstrated that the unavoidable carbon impurities in TiO 2 originating from the preparation process may participate in the CO 2 photoreduction reaction.The discrimination and the role of reacting species derived from residual carbon materials during the CO 2 reduction process deserve further investigation by the use of isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as a reactant 4.After deducting background values at various times, the yield of CH 4 as a function of time is shown in Fig. 10b.It can be seen that 0-TiO 2 gave a very low yield of CH 4 because it cannot be activated under visible irradiation due to its large band gap.Similarly, as shown in Scheme 2, it is impossible for bulk anatase TiO 2 with a band gap of 3.2 eV to induce CO 2 reduction.In contrast, all of the surface-acidified samples (0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 ) yielded significantly larger amounts of CH 4 after 4 h of photoreaction.The 0.5-TiO 2 showed the highest photocatalytic activity, with a CH 4 production rate of 3.3 mol g -1 h -1 (13.20 mol g -1 after 4 h of irradiation).Several studies have been carried out on TiO 2 -based catalysts for visible light reduction of CO 2 in gas-solid reaction systems, and CH 4 was detected as the major product 4,61626364.Their average production rate was in the range 0.3-4.6 mol g -1 h -1 .Thus, the CH 4 yield in this study approached the maximum value reported. QY and EROEI of the photocatalytic process are important factors in evaluating the activities of the catalysts.The calculated QYs were found to be 0.048 for 0-TiO 2 , 0.214 for 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.726 for 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.494 for 0.7-TiO 2 after photocatalytic reactions for 240 min.Additionally, the EROEI were calculated to be about 0.022, 0.099, 0.335, and 0.228 for 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively.These values clearly indicate that the activities of the TiO 2 catalysts were in the order 0.5-TiO 2 0.7-TiO 2 0.2-TiO 2 0-TiO 2 .To exclude the effect of surface area, QY and EROEI per unit BET surface area of TiO 2 (defined as QY/S and EROEI/S) were calculated and the results are presented in Table 1.The QY/S and EROEI/S values of the TiO 2 catalysts are seen to exhibit the same order as QY and EROEI.The results suggest that other properties besides surface area also contribute to the improved photocatalytic activity. TON is an important parameter in evaluating catalysts.According to the literature 34, the TON values for 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 amount to 9.306, 27.973, 83.124, and 49.507, respectively, demonstrating that the visible light reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor is a catalyzed reduction process. In general, oxidation half-reactions plays a pivotal role in the photoreduction process of CO 2 .Without the addition of any other reductants, H 2 O was employed as an efficient electron donor for CO 2 conversion.Therefore, to better understand the reaction mechanism of photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor, it is very important to quantitatively analyze the product(s) of water oxidation, such as O 2 .However, background levels of O 2 and N 2 of a few hundred ppm in the reactor cannot be avoided.Hence, the volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 rather than a quantitative determination of O 2 was used as an indicator to evaluate the variation of O 2 as a function of time.A similar method has been adopted by other researchers 656667.As shown in Fig. 11, the time dependence of the O 2 /N 2 ratio shows a similar tendency as that of CH 4 production during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor on 0.5-TiO 2 under visible-light irradiation, suggesting the generation of O 2 in our work (Eq.( 3)).In other words, H 2 O reacts with h to produce O 2 along with reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 , as depicted in Scheme 2. To further evaluate the stability of the prepared TiO 2 catalysts, recyclability experiments on CO 2 photoreduction were performed on 0.5-TiO 2 .As displayed in Fig. 12, no obvious decrease in the CH 4 yield could be discerned after 20 h of visible light irradiation over five runs, indicating excellent reusability of the photocatalyst. According to the physical-chemical characterization, the obvious difference in CO 2 reduction performance by acidification should be ascribed to a change in the surface characteristics rather than the bulk properties.As mentioned above, acidification enhances the generation of Ti-OH, which has been proved to be an effective site for the oxidation of H 2 O (electron donor in our system) 33.The oxidation of H 2 O is an inevitable simultaneous step for scavenging holes during photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Efficient consumption of photo-excited holes in the photooxidation process is beneficial to suppress the recombination of photogenerated e --h pairs and thus promote the photoreduction of CO 2 .Therefore, more Ti-OH would consume more holes, leaving more electrons to participate in the reduction process. Moreover, acidification facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies accompanied by Ti 3 57.Since oxygen vacancies are believed to be electron donors in TiO 2 , contributing to the improved donor density, stronger acidification would be beneficial to the visible light activities of CO 2 reduction mediated by these vacancies 68.Furthermore, the Ti 3 /oxygen vacancies served as efficient sites for electron trapping and CO 2 adsorption 32 In view of the fact that H 2 SO 4 treatment did not significantly narrow the band gap of TiO 2 , the enhancing effect of surface protonation on the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is discussed in more detail by comparing the particle size dependence of the photogenerated e --h separation before and after modification with H 2 SO 4 .When the particle size of a semiconductor is smaller than the Bohr radius, the electrons and holes are confined in a potential well (quantum size effect) 69.In contrast, Huang et al. demonstrated that a large specific surface area functioned more effectively than the quantum size effect in controlling the photocatalytic reactivity of TiO 2 70. In addition to a high active surface area, a suitable photocatalyst must also have high e --h separation efficiency 69.To relax the band to the bulk level, an ideal photocatalyst should have a particle size of twice the width of the surface space charge region 71.Otherwise, the proximity effect would lead to an increase in the recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers.Calculation of the width of the space charge region in depletion (L d ) or accumulation (L a ) requires the Debye length, L D , and the potential drop across the space charge region, V s 72: where 0 and r are the permittivity of free space and the dielectric constant, respectively, k represents the Boltzmann constant, T refers to the absolute temperature, e denotes the electron charge, and N D is the donor density.The widths of the space charge layers are described by: and Using values typical of anatase TiO 2 (N D 10 18 -10 20 cm -3 , r 48, V s 0.03 V) 737475, the width of the space charge layer in this material was determined as 1.5-12.5 nm. If the carrier diffusion length is taken into consideration, a maximum geometric size of the photocatalyst comparable to twice the width of the space charge region plus the carrier diffusion length would be acceptable.The carrier diffusion length L is given by: with where and are the carrier lifetime and the carrier mobility, respectively.The value of carrier mobility is 0.2 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for anatase TiO 2 , and the lifetime of photogenerated carriers in TiO 2 was determined to be 1.5 ns based on photoluminescence spectral analysis 76,77.Thus, the L value was determined to be ca.30 nm.As a consequence, the size of anatase TiO 2 for efficient separation of e --h pairs lies in the range 63-85 nm. According to density functional theory calculations of surface chemistry and based on experimental evidence, for TiO 2 enclosed with 0 0 1 and 1 0 1 facets, the photogenerated electrons would selectively transfer to the 1 0 1 facets, whereas the holes would concentrate on the 0 0 1 facets 78,79.In the present work, the prepared TiO 2 nanosheets had an average side length of 120 nm and an average thickness of 40 nm.Consequently, the greater side length of TiO 2 , i.e. 120 nm 85 nm, did not favor the transfer of electrons to the 1 0 1 facets.In comparison with non-acidified TiO 2 , the carrier lifetime in protonated TiO 2 is prolonged five-fold 75.This is because the TiO 2 -H 2 SO 4 junction will function as a Schottky barrier, impelling the majority of the electrons in the bulk to the positively charged outer layer and preventing them from reentering the interior of the TiO 2 .The acceptable size of anatase TiO 2 nanosheets is thereby enlarged to a range of 127 -149 nm, greater than the side length of the prepared catalyst (ca.120 nm).The photogenerated electrons could transfer to the 1 0 1 facets of the TiO 2 nanosheets to participate in the CO 2 reduction process. Moreover, based on Beer's law 80, the absorption length, L p , is given by: where is the absorption coefficient.The of anatase TiO 2 at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm is ca. 3 10 6 m -1 81, corresponding to an absorption length of about 333 nm.This result indicates that the prepared catalyst could ensure the efficient absorption of incident light.Taking together the above findings, H 2 SO 4 treatment of TiO 2 nanosheets enclosed with 0 0 1 and 1 0 1 facets not only ensures the creation of the most electron-hole pairs within TiO 2 under visible-light irradiation, but is also helpful for suppressing charge recombination. In addition, proton adsorption on metal oxide surfaces shifts the positions of both the valence band edge maximum and the conduction band edge minimum 82.This can be attributed to the formation of a Helmholtz double layer at the interface between the semiconductor and the surface protons.Some contact potential drop inside the semiconductor space charge layer would occur to maintain acid-base equilibrium 83.Based on a solid-liquid reaction system, Gomes et al. obtained a potential drop equation (Eq.( 10)) through a series of deductions 84. Here, represents the magnitude of the potential drop between the semiconductor and the ionized surface groups, A is a constant, R denotes the gas constant, T denotes the absolute temperature, F is the Faraday constant, and (a MO -) s and (a M ) s are the activities of the MO -and M species at the semiconductor surface.Obviously, the Nernst shift of the potential is -59 mV per pH unit at 298 K 85.In this study, it was difficult to accurately calculate the shift of the conduction band edge of TiO 2 , due to the following reasons: (1) some H of H 2 SO 4 participated in the formation of oxygen vacancies and was released in the form of H 2 O during the synthesis process (Scheme 1); (2) pH values in the surrounding phase of TiO 2 nanosheets cannot be determined in a solid-gas reaction system.In any case, the redox potential of the conduction band electrons is rendered more positive at higher proton concentration, hindering the reduction reaction.Thus, during the photocatalytic process in this work, excessive surface protonation would induce an undesirable influence that inhibits the reduction of CO 2 . In addition to the adverse influence of a Nernst shift, excess oxygen vacancies at extremely high protonation degrees would act as recombination centers, leaving fewer electrons and holes for reducing CO 2 and oxidizing H 2 O, respectively 25.Additionally, a higher degree of sulfuric acid modification would result in more bridging bidentate structures on the surface of the TiO 2 , causing a space-steric effect and a decrease in the number of active sites. Considering all of the above, there should be an optimal sulfuric acid concentration for TiO 2 modification.In this study, the QY, EROEI, and TON for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 were found to be maximized at an initial H 2 SO 4 concentration of 0.5 mol L -1 for protonated TiO 2 with highly exposed 0 0 1 facets."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2 photocatalysts", "source": "In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that surface modification with H 2 SO 4 significantly enhances the activities of TiO 2 photocatalysts enclosed with 0 0 1 and 1 0 1 facets for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 under visible light.", "context": "In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that surface modification with H 2 SO 4 significantly enhances the activities of TiO 2 photocatalysts enclosed with 0 0 1 and 1 0 1 facets for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 under visible light.Acidification with H 2 SO 4 promotes the formation of surface hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies/Ti 3 species, which is beneficial for the reduction of CO 2 and the oxidation of H 2 O, as well as increasing the visible-light absorption.In particular, the surface protonation resulting from acidification with H 2 SO 4 extends the lifetime of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, overcoming the limitation of unfavorable side length of the prepared TiO 2 nanosheets for the migration of photogenerated carriers.However, excessive acidification would be detrimental to the photocatalytic process.This is because the conduction band of TiO 2 would shift to a more positive value due to surface protonation, and bridging bidentate structures on TiO 2 may cause a space-steric effect and a decrease in the number of active sites.The optimal photocatalyst was found to be that treated with 0.5 mol L -1 H 2 SO 4 .After 240 min of reaction, the CH 4 yield was 13.20 mol g -1 , corresponding to a QY, EROEI, and TON of 0.726, 0.335, and 83.124, respectively.Furthermore, the photocatalyst displayed good stability in the reduction of CO 2 with water vapor under visible light irradiation.The photocatalysts presented herein provide a potential alternative for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 utilizing solar energy.

The crucial intermediate of carboxylate species (CO 2 -) is generated on the defect structure of TiO 2 by transfer of an electron from Ti 3 to adsorbed CO 2 .Therefore, increased Ti 3 /oxygen vacancy amounts can accelerate the formation of CO 2 -, promoting the photoreduction of CO 2 .Taking together the above evidence, H 2 SO 4 modification could improve the visible light response of TiO 2 and the adsorption of CO 2 .

Fig. 2 shows a sequence of representative FESEM micrographs, which clearly display the morphological features and surface characteristics of the TiO 2 samples prepared under different conditions.All of the TiO 2 samples (Fig. 2(a-d)) showed uniform sheetshaped truncated octahedral bipyramid structures, with an average thickness of ca.41 nm and a side length of ca.120 nm.No obvious morphology changes were observed before and after surface acidification.HRTEM (Fig. 3) was employed to obtain information on the crystallographic structure of the TiO 2 nanosheets at an atomic scale.The lattice spacing parallel to the top and bottom facets was measured as 0.235 nm, corresponding to the d-spacing of the (0 0 1) planes of anatase TiO 2 .The interplanar distance of 0.353 nm between the adjacent lattice fringes on the side surface is consistent with the value for the thermodynamically stable (1 0 1) facet.Therefore, the top/bottom surfaces and side surfaces enclosing the TiO 2 nanosheets are surmised to be high-energy 0 0 1 facets and lowenergy 1 0 1 facets, respectively.Based on a slab model of anatase TiO 2 single crystals 35, H 2 SO 4 acidification left the percentages of exposed 0 0 1 facets on 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 essentially unchanged at approximately 60. The pore structure and BET specific surface area of each of the products were evaluated through nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements.As shown in Fig. 4, all of the TiO 2 samples showed type IV isotherms with a well-pronounced hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range of 0.9 to 1.0, according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification, indicating the presence of mesopores (2 -50 nm) 36.The corresponding hysteresis loops were of type H3, implying the formation of slit-shaped pores from the aggregation of single-crystal nanosheets 12.The pore size distributions (inset in Fig. 4) calculated from the desorption isotherms by the BJH method indicate that all of the TiO 2 samples exhibited wide distributions ranging from 10 to 95 nm. The BET specific surface areas of each of the products are summarized in Table 1.As a control standard, 0-TiO 2 exhibits a surface area of 18.01 m 2 g -1 .An increment in H 2 SO 4 concentration (0.2-0.7 mol L -1 ) led to a slight decrease in BET surface area (14.51-12.28m 2 g -1 ).This may be attributed to some H 2 SO 4 molecules entering and plugging the pores of TiO 2 . XPS analysis was utilized to investigate the chemical environments and the electron-binding energies of TiO 2 samples prepared under various conditions.The C 1s level at 284.6 eV was taken as an internal reference to correct the shift of the binding energy.The presence of characteristic peaks in the wide-scan XPS survey spectra of the derivatized TiO 2 samples (Fig. 5a) demonstrated the existence of Ti, O, F, and S on the crystal surface.The S/Ti ratios of the acidified TiO 2 samples were about 0.195, 0.229, and 0.267 for 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively. The high-resolution scanning XPS spectra of the Ti 2p core level region of all of the samples are shown in Fig. 5b.Generally, the Ti 2p spectrum can be fitted by four peaks at 457.4, 458.5, 463.3, and 464.4 eV, corresponding to the signals of Ti 3 2p 3/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 , Ti 3 2p 1/2 , and Ti 4 2p 1/2 , respectively 37.It was confirmed from Fig. 5b that the two Ti 2p doublet peaks at 458.5 and 464.4 eV can be ascribed to Ti 4 bound to oxygen in this study.No obvious shoulder was detected in the low-energy region of the Ti 2p 3/2 spectrum, which can be attributed to the insensitivity of XPS in distinguishing Ti 3 and Ti 4 .The S 2p XPS spectra of the catalysts shown in Fig. 5c identify the state of the sulfur species on the surface of the acidified TiO 2 .The binding energy of S 2p was observed as ca.169 eV for each of the acidified samples, in good agreement with the S 2p peak of S 6 38.No signal at 161.0-162.8eV for sulfide or at 164 eV for elemental sulfur could be detected 39.In comparison with the unmodified sample, all of the H 2 SO 4 -modified samples displayed a Ti 2p 3/2 core level at a slightly higher BE value (Fig. 5b), implying the formation of a bridging bidentate structure involving coordination of Ti 4 with bidentate SO 4 2-.The O 1s XPS spectra are illustrated in Fig. 5d, which could be deconvoluted into four peaks using Shirley backgrounds and Voigt (mixed Lorentzian-Gaussian) functions 40.The major peak located at 529.4 eV can be assigned to lattice oxygen (Ti O Ti), and the other three peaks at 530.8, 531.7, and 532.8 eV match those of oxygen in sulfate species, surface hydroxyl groups, and adsorbed water molecules, respectively 41.According to the deconvoluted peak areas, the percentages of the four peaks are summarized in Table 2.As can be seen in Table 2, the percentages of surface hydroxyl groups were 23, 26, 28, and 30 and the percentages of adsorbed H 2 O were 9, 10, 13, and 16 for 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively.These results demonstrate that acidification increased the number of hydroxyl groups and water molecules on the TiO 2 surface.The reason for the increase in the number of surface Ti-OH groups was the dissociation of H 2 O on the more abundant oxygen vacancies caused by acidification 42.The increase in the number of water molecules may have stemmed from their bonding at the increased number of surface bridging hydroxyl groups 43.Moreover, a reduced Ti O Ti percentage was found with increasing initial H 2 SO 4 concentration, implying that H 2 SO 4 treatment followed by heat treatment has a positive influence in increasing the number of oxygen vacancies.The atomic ratio of Ti O Ti/Ti of acidified TiO 2 was less than 2, implying the existence of oxygen vacancies.The existence of oxygen vacancies was further proved by UV/Vis DRS. As shown in Fig. 5e, in high-resolution scanning XPS spectra the binding energy of F 1s was situated at 683.8-684.5 eV for all of the TiO 2 nanosheets, which is typical for Ti F species on a TiO 2 surface 44.No signal for F -in the lattice (688.5 eV) was found, further illustrating that all of the F -was adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2 rather than in the lattice. EPR is a highly effective characterization technique for determining paramagnetic species having one or more unpaired electrons, and is usually used to identify the presence of Ti 3 in TiO 2 45.It is known that a g-value of 1.988 can be unequivocally assigned to a paramagnetic Ti 3 center in a distorted rhombic oxygen ligand field, and that the EPR signal intensity is correlated with Intensity (a.u.) g valu e g 1.988Fig. 6.EPR spectra of 0-TiO2, 0.2-TiO2, 0.5-TiO2, and 0.7-TiO2. the amount of Ti 3 in the sample 46,47.As shown in Fig. 6, the EPR signal assigned to Ti 3 progressively intensified as the concentration of H 2 SO 4 used for treatment was increased, confirming that surface acidification followed by heat treatment enhanced the generation of Ti 3 .Ti 3 defects originated through two possible pathways 48,49.One involved the transfer of two extra electrons from oxygen vacancies at the two-fold coordinated bridging sites to adjacent Ti 4 sites.The other involved the introduction of an electron into the 3d orbital of Ti 4 through bulk substitution of lattice O 2-atoms in TiO 2 by F -.The most evident distinction between the types of Ti 3 defects is that F -derived Ti 3 cannot induce any observed photon excitation in the infrared region, whereas Ti 3 associated with oxygen vacancies can give rise to such excitation 49. The light absorption properties of the TiO 2 samples synthesized under various conditions were analyzed by UV/Vis DRS and are depicted in Fig. 7a.All of the samples displayed an absorption edge in the region of 400 nm, suggesting that no sulfur had been incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice.A broad absorption band beyond 400 nm up to the visible region was apparent for samples 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , and the absorption intensity increased with increasing initial H 2 SO 4 concentration.Since various functional groups on TiO 2 may introduce a new absorption band in the visible light region 50, 0.5 mol L -1 Na 2 SO 4 instead of 0.5 mol L -1 H 2 SO 4 was used to modify the TiO 2 nanosheets under analogous conditions.No obvious difference in the UV/Vis DRS between 0-TiO 2 and the 0-TiO 2 modified with 0.5 mol L -1 Na 2 SO 4 (Fig. 7b) could be observed, indicating that SO 4 2-could not form visible-light-active complexes on TiO 2 under our preparative conditions.Similar results have been obtained by other researchers 515253.Consequently, oxygen vacancy states between the valence and conduction bands induced by Ti 3 species contributed to the visible response of the TiO 2 samples. The band gap, E g , for each of the TiO 2 samples was evaluated from the Tauc plot equation 54: where is the absorption coefficient, h represents Planck's constant, refers to the frequency of the photon, A is a constant, and n is 1/2 for a direct transition.The relationships between ( hv) 1/2 and h for all of the TiO 2 samples are shown in Fig. 7c.The band gaps are estimated to be 3.13, 3.09, 3.07, and 3.00 eV for 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively.The gradual narrowing of the band gap from 0-TiO 2 to 0.7-TiO 2 implies increasing concentration of Ti 3 /oxygen vacancies 55. Theoretical calculations and related experiments have demonstrated that a vacancy band of electronic states would be induced due to a high vacancy concentration 56.The shallow donor level just below the conduction band is responsible for the visible light response.Three kinds of oxygen vacancy state, namely O v , O v Ti 3 , and O v :2Ti 3 0 , have been postulated by other researchers 24.The O v Ti 3 and O v :2Ti 3 0 are situated at 0.75 and 1.18 eV below the CB minimum, respectively.The number of different oxygen vacancy states in TiO 2 depends on the preparation conditions.For unmodified TiO 2 , high hydrothermal temperature facilitates cleavage of Ti O bonds and thus enhances the generation of O v Ti 3 and O v :2Ti 3 0 .Therefore, the 0-TiO 2 exhibited obvious absorption in the visible light region.During H 2 SO 4 treatment, H would react with surface oxygen giving strongly adsorbed H 2 O molecules.Upon heat treatment under vacuum conditions, the strongly adsorbed H 2 O was lost, leading to the formation of defect sites at the TiO 2 surface, as depicted in Scheme 1 30,57. Consequently, the visible absorption of TiO 2 was improved after surface acidification.The existence of oxygen vacancies was indicated indirectly by the blue colors of the samples hydrothermally treated at 240 C (see the inset in Fig. 7a), since blue coloration is an obvious characteristic of the formation of oxygen vacancies related to Ti 3 58.Moreover, together with EPR characterization, it could be concluded that the higher the Ti 3 content, the deeper the blue color.Fig. 8. Raman spectra of 0-TiO2, 0.2-TiO2, 0.5-TiO2, and 0.7-TiO2. Change of wavenumber and FWHM of the peak at around 142 cm -1 , as well as the B1g (394 cm -1 ):A1g (514 cm -1 ):Eg (636 cm -1 ) ratios of the respective TiO2 photocatalysts. Sample Wavenumber (cm -1 ) FWHM (cm -1 ) B1g (394 cm -1 ):A1g (514 cm -1 ):Eg (636 cm 3.1.7.Raman spectroscopy Raman spectroscopy was used to reveal the vibrational and structural properties of the TiO 2 catalysts.It can be observed in Fig. 8 that the spectra of all of the samples featured similar peaks at approximately 142, 195, 394, 514, and 636 cm -1 , which are consistent with the spectrum of the typical anatase TiO 2 phase.As demonstrated by Park and Siegel, oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 crystals cause an up-shift and broadening of the E g (142 cm -1 ) mode in the Raman spectrum due to the atomic rearrangement caused by oxygen vacancies 59.Moreover, the relative intensities of B 1g (394 cm -1 ), A 1g (514 cm -1 ), and E g (636 cm -1 ) are closely related to the change in the oxygen vacancies and Ti 3 quantities 26.To evaluate more clearly the distinction between the spectra, the wavenumber, FWHM, and relative intensity of each mode was determined, as listed in Table 3. Comparing the acidified samples with the non-acidified sample, the E g (142 cm -1 ) mode slightly shifted towards higher wavenumber and its FWHM was enlarged with increasing H 2 SO 4 concentration.In addition, the intensities of the B 1g (394 cm -1 ) and E g (636 cm -1 ) modes were gradually enhanced relative to that of the A 1g (514 cm -1 ) mode with increasing initial H 2 SO 4 concentration.Consequently, surface acidification leads to an inevitable increase in the defect density on the TiO 2 surface.All of these results are in accordance with the UV/Vis DRS analysis.3.1.8.PL spectra PL spectra were recorded to obtain information on the dynamics of the photogenerated species 60.Fig. 9 shows the PL spectra of the TiO 2 samples prepared under various conditions, recorded in the wavelength range 350-550 nm with excitation at 300 nm.All of the TiO 2 samples showed similar curve shapes in the range 350-550 nm, but with different intensities.Generally, the PL intensity became weaker with increasing concentration of H 2 SO 4 used for treatment, indicating a lower recombination rate of photoelectrons and holes 26.Therefore, sulfuric acid modification on TiO 2 nanosheets is favorable for efficiently separating the charge carriers by prolonging the lifetime of carriers and suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs.This result is similar to that reported by Xu et al. 11. The experimental transient photocurrent response is also deemed an effective parameter to characterize the separation efficiency of photogenerated e --h pairs 2.Further work is needed to provide additional evidence supporting the proposed superiority of surface acidification through transient photocurrent measurements. The photocatalytic activity of the fabricated TiO 2 nanosheets toward gas-phase CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O vapor under visible light irradiation was experimentally investigated.According to previous reports, a series of compounds such as CH 4 , CO, CH 3 OH, and HCOOH constitute the major carbon-containing products, and H 2 is the major reducing by-product 61.However, no substance other than CH 4 was detected by gas chromatography above the detection limit in this study.The potential for photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 is given in Eq. ( 2) with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode at pH 7.0. The amounts of generated CH 4 , in mol g -1 , with increasing time are presented in Fig. 10a.It should be noted that the 0-TiO 2 with a band gap of 3.13 eV yielded 7.43 mol g -1 CH 4 after 4 h of reaction under visible light ( 400 nm).To explore the source of CH 4 formation, a series of control experiments was performed.Direct photolysis of a mixture of pure CO 2 and H 2 O vapor in the absence of TiO 2 as well as dark adsorption were conducted.After 4 h, no carbon-containing substances were detected.In another photocatalytic process, the CO 2 reactant was replaced with highpurity Ar.No carbon compounds could be detected.Further control experiments were performed using only CO 2 as gas precursor (without water vapor) under visible light irradiation.CH 4 generation was found and the yield increased gradually during the first 2 h of irradiation and then remained almost unchanged.After 4 h of irradiation, the CH 4 yields were 6.57, 7.05, 7.62, and 7.63 mol g -1 on 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively.The results demonstrated that the unavoidable carbon impurities in TiO 2 originating from the preparation process may participate in the CO 2 photoreduction reaction.The discrimination and the role of reacting species derived from residual carbon materials during the CO 2 reduction process deserve further investigation by the use of isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as a reactant 4.After deducting background values at various times, the yield of CH 4 as a function of time is shown in Fig. 10b.It can be seen that 0-TiO 2 gave a very low yield of CH 4 because it cannot be activated under visible irradiation due to its large band gap.Similarly, as shown in Scheme 2, it is impossible for bulk anatase TiO 2 with a band gap of 3.2 eV to induce CO 2 reduction.In contrast, all of the surface-acidified samples (0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 ) yielded significantly larger amounts of CH 4 after 4 h of photoreaction.The 0.5-TiO 2 showed the highest photocatalytic activity, with a CH 4 production rate of 3.3 mol g -1 h -1 (13.20 mol g -1 after 4 h of irradiation).Several studies have been carried out on TiO 2 -based catalysts for visible light reduction of CO 2 in gas-solid reaction systems, and CH 4 was detected as the major product 4,61626364.Their average production rate was in the range 0.3-4.6 mol g -1 h -1 .Thus, the CH 4 yield in this study approached the maximum value reported. QY and EROEI of the photocatalytic process are important factors in evaluating the activities of the catalysts.The calculated QYs were found to be 0.048 for 0-TiO 2 , 0.214 for 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.726 for 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.494 for 0.7-TiO 2 after photocatalytic reactions for 240 min.Additionally, the EROEI were calculated to be about 0.022, 0.099, 0.335, and 0.228 for 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively.These values clearly indicate that the activities of the TiO 2 catalysts were in the order 0.5-TiO 2 0.7-TiO 2 0.2-TiO 2 0-TiO 2 .To exclude the effect of surface area, QY and EROEI per unit BET surface area of TiO 2 (defined as QY/S and EROEI/S) were calculated and the results are presented in Table 1.The QY/S and EROEI/S values of the TiO 2 catalysts are seen to exhibit the same order as QY and EROEI.The results suggest that other properties besides surface area also contribute to the improved photocatalytic activity. TON is an important parameter in evaluating catalysts.According to the literature 34, the TON values for 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 amount to 9.306, 27.973, 83.124, and 49.507, respectively, demonstrating that the visible light reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor is a catalyzed reduction process. In general, oxidation half-reactions plays a pivotal role in the photoreduction process of CO 2 .Without the addition of any other reductants, H 2 O was employed as an efficient electron donor for CO 2 conversion.Therefore, to better understand the reaction mechanism of photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor, it is very important to quantitatively analyze the product(s) of water oxidation, such as O 2 .However, background levels of O 2 and N 2 of a few hundred ppm in the reactor cannot be avoided.Hence, the volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 rather than a quantitative determination of O 2 was used as an indicator to evaluate the variation of O 2 as a function of time.A similar method has been adopted by other researchers 656667.As shown in Fig. 11, the time dependence of the O 2 /N 2 ratio shows a similar tendency as that of CH 4 production during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor on 0.5-TiO 2 under visible-light irradiation, suggesting the generation of O 2 in our work (Eq.( 3)).In other words, H 2 O reacts with h to produce O 2 along with reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 , as depicted in Scheme 2. To further evaluate the stability of the prepared TiO 2 catalysts, recyclability experiments on CO 2 photoreduction were performed on 0.5-TiO 2 .As displayed in Fig. 12, no obvious decrease in the CH 4 yield could be discerned after 20 h of visible light irradiation over five runs, indicating excellent reusability of the photocatalyst. According to the physical-chemical characterization, the obvious difference in CO 2 reduction performance by acidification should be ascribed to a change in the surface characteristics rather than the bulk properties.As mentioned above, acidification enhances the generation of Ti-OH, which has been proved to be an effective site for the oxidation of H 2 O (electron donor in our system) 33.The oxidation of H 2 O is an inevitable simultaneous step for scavenging holes during photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Efficient consumption of photo-excited holes in the photooxidation process is beneficial to suppress the recombination of photogenerated e --h pairs and thus promote the photoreduction of CO 2 .Therefore, more Ti-OH would consume more holes, leaving more electrons to participate in the reduction process. Moreover, acidification facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies accompanied by Ti 3 57.Since oxygen vacancies are believed to be electron donors in TiO 2 , contributing to the improved donor density, stronger acidification would be beneficial to the visible light activities of CO 2 reduction mediated by these vacancies 68.Furthermore, the Ti 3 /oxygen vacancies served as efficient sites for electron trapping and CO 2 adsorption 32 In view of the fact that H 2 SO 4 treatment did not significantly narrow the band gap of TiO 2 , the enhancing effect of surface protonation on the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is discussed in more detail by comparing the particle size dependence of the photogenerated e --h separation before and after modification with H 2 SO 4 .When the particle size of a semiconductor is smaller than the Bohr radius, the electrons and holes are confined in a potential well (quantum size effect) 69.In contrast, Huang et al. demonstrated that a large specific surface area functioned more effectively than the quantum size effect in controlling the photocatalytic reactivity of TiO 2 70. In addition to a high active surface area, a suitable photocatalyst must also have high e --h separation efficiency 69.To relax the band to the bulk level, an ideal photocatalyst should have a particle size of twice the width of the surface space charge region 71.Otherwise, the proximity effect would lead to an increase in the recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers.Calculation of the width of the space charge region in depletion (L d ) or accumulation (L a ) requires the Debye length, L D , and the potential drop across the space charge region, V s 72: where 0 and r are the permittivity of free space and the dielectric constant, respectively, k represents the Boltzmann constant, T refers to the absolute temperature, e denotes the electron charge, and N D is the donor density.The widths of the space charge layers are described by: and Using values typical of anatase TiO 2 (N D 10 18 -10 20 cm -3 , r 48, V s 0.03 V) 737475, the width of the space charge layer in this material was determined as 1.5-12.5 nm. If the carrier diffusion length is taken into consideration, a maximum geometric size of the photocatalyst comparable to twice the width of the space charge region plus the carrier diffusion length would be acceptable.The carrier diffusion length L is given by: with where and are the carrier lifetime and the carrier mobility, respectively.The value of carrier mobility is 0.2 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for anatase TiO 2 , and the lifetime of photogenerated carriers in TiO 2 was determined to be 1.5 ns based on photoluminescence spectral analysis 76,77.Thus, the L value was determined to be ca.30 nm.As a consequence, the size of anatase TiO 2 for efficient separation of e --h pairs lies in the range 63-85 nm. According to density functional theory calculations of surface chemistry and based on experimental evidence, for TiO 2 enclosed with 0 0 1 and 1 0 1 facets, the photogenerated electrons would selectively transfer to the 1 0 1 facets, whereas the holes would concentrate on the 0 0 1 facets 78,79.In the present work, the prepared TiO 2 nanosheets had an average side length of 120 nm and an average thickness of 40 nm.Consequently, the greater side length of TiO 2 , i.e. 120 nm 85 nm, did not favor the transfer of electrons to the 1 0 1 facets.In comparison with non-acidified TiO 2 , the carrier lifetime in protonated TiO 2 is prolonged five-fold 75.This is because the TiO 2 -H 2 SO 4 junction will function as a Schottky barrier, impelling the majority of the electrons in the bulk to the positively charged outer layer and preventing them from reentering the interior of the TiO 2 .The acceptable size of anatase TiO 2 nanosheets is thereby enlarged to a range of 127 -149 nm, greater than the side length of the prepared catalyst (ca.120 nm).The photogenerated electrons could transfer to the 1 0 1 facets of the TiO 2 nanosheets to participate in the CO 2 reduction process. Moreover, based on Beer's law 80, the absorption length, L p , is given by: where is the absorption coefficient.The of anatase TiO 2 at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm is ca. 3 10 6 m -1 81, corresponding to an absorption length of about 333 nm.This result indicates that the prepared catalyst could ensure the efficient absorption of incident light.Taking together the above findings, H 2 SO 4 treatment of TiO 2 nanosheets enclosed with 0 0 1 and 1 0 1 facets not only ensures the creation of the most electron-hole pairs within TiO 2 under visible-light irradiation, but is also helpful for suppressing charge recombination. In addition, proton adsorption on metal oxide surfaces shifts the positions of both the valence band edge maximum and the conduction band edge minimum 82.This can be attributed to the formation of a Helmholtz double layer at the interface between the semiconductor and the surface protons.Some contact potential drop inside the semiconductor space charge layer would occur to maintain acid-base equilibrium 83.Based on a solid-liquid reaction system, Gomes et al. obtained a potential drop equation (Eq.( 10)) through a series of deductions 84. Here, represents the magnitude of the potential drop between the semiconductor and the ionized surface groups, A is a constant, R denotes the gas constant, T denotes the absolute temperature, F is the Faraday constant, and (a MO -) s and (a M ) s are the activities of the MO -and M species at the semiconductor surface.Obviously, the Nernst shift of the potential is -59 mV per pH unit at 298 K 85.In this study, it was difficult to accurately calculate the shift of the conduction band edge of TiO 2 , due to the following reasons: (1) some H of H 2 SO 4 participated in the formation of oxygen vacancies and was released in the form of H 2 O during the synthesis process (Scheme 1); (2) pH values in the surrounding phase of TiO 2 nanosheets cannot be determined in a solid-gas reaction system.In any case, the redox potential of the conduction band electrons is rendered more positive at higher proton concentration, hindering the reduction reaction.Thus, during the photocatalytic process in this work, excessive surface protonation would induce an undesirable influence that inhibits the reduction of CO 2 . In addition to the adverse influence of a Nernst shift, excess oxygen vacancies at extremely high protonation degrees would act as recombination centers, leaving fewer electrons and holes for reducing CO 2 and oxidizing H 2 O, respectively 25.Additionally, a higher degree of sulfuric acid modification would result in more bridging bidentate structures on the surface of the TiO 2 , causing a space-steric effect and a decrease in the number of active sites. Considering all of the above, there should be an optimal sulfuric acid concentration for TiO 2 modification.In this study, the QY, EROEI, and TON for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 were found to be maximized at an initial H 2 SO 4 concentration of 0.5 mol L -1 for protonated TiO 2 with highly exposed 0 0 1 facets."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Several studies have been carried out on TiO 2 -based catalysts for visible light reduction of CO 2 in gas-solid reaction systems, and CH 4 was detected as the major product 4,61626364.", "context": "XRD was applied to investigate the possible changes in the crystallinities and phase purities of TiO 2 samples synthesized under different conditions (Fig. 1).Remarkably, all of the samples showed diffraction peaks that were well consistent with the standard anatase pattern (JCPDS Card No. 21-1272).No impurity phase was observed, implying that the products had high purity.No appreciable changes in the numbers, intensities, and full-widths at half-maximum (FWHM) of the peaks could be observed among the samples 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , suggesting that modification with H 2 SO 4 does not affect the crystallographic structure of TiO 2 . Fig. 2 shows a sequence of representative FESEM micrographs, which clearly display the morphological features and surface characteristics of the TiO 2 samples prepared under different conditions.All of the TiO 2 samples (Fig. 2(a-d)) showed uniform sheetshaped truncated octahedral bipyramid structures, with an average thickness of ca.41 nm and a side length of ca.120 nm.No obvious morphology changes were observed before and after surface acidification.HRTEM (Fig. 3) was employed to obtain information on the crystallographic structure of the TiO 2 nanosheets at an atomic scale.The lattice spacing parallel to the top and bottom facets was measured as 0.235 nm, corresponding to the d-spacing of the (0 0 1) planes of anatase TiO 2 .The interplanar distance of 0.353 nm between the adjacent lattice fringes on the side surface is consistent with the value for the thermodynamically stable (1 0 1) facet.Therefore, the top/bottom surfaces and side surfaces enclosing the TiO 2 nanosheets are surmised to be high-energy 0 0 1 facets and lowenergy 1 0 1 facets, respectively.Based on a slab model of anatase TiO 2 single crystals 35, H 2 SO 4 acidification left the percentages of exposed 0 0 1 facets on 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 essentially unchanged at approximately 60. The pore structure and BET specific surface area of each of the products were evaluated through nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements.As shown in Fig. 4, all of the TiO 2 samples showed type IV isotherms with a well-pronounced hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range of 0.9 to 1.0, according to the Brunauer-Deming-Deming-Teller (BDDT) classification, indicating the presence of mesopores (2 -50 nm) 36.The corresponding hysteresis loops were of type H3, implying the formation of slit-shaped pores from the aggregation of single-crystal nanosheets 12.The pore size distributions (inset in Fig. 4) calculated from the desorption isotherms by the BJH method indicate that all of the TiO 2 samples exhibited wide distributions ranging from 10 to 95 nm. The BET specific surface areas of each of the products are summarized in Table 1.As a control standard, 0-TiO 2 exhibits a surface area of 18.01 m 2 g -1 .An increment in H 2 SO 4 concentration (0.2-0.7 mol L -1 ) led to a slight decrease in BET surface area (14.51-12.28m 2 g -1 ).This may be attributed to some H 2 SO 4 molecules entering and plugging the pores of TiO 2 . XPS analysis was utilized to investigate the chemical environments and the electron-binding energies of TiO 2 samples prepared under various conditions.The C 1s level at 284.6 eV was taken as an internal reference to correct the shift of the binding energy.The presence of characteristic peaks in the wide-scan XPS survey spectra of the derivatized TiO 2 samples (Fig. 5a) demonstrated the existence of Ti, O, F, and S on the crystal surface.The S/Ti ratios of the acidified TiO 2 samples were about 0.195, 0.229, and 0.267 for 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively. The high-resolution scanning XPS spectra of the Ti 2p core level region of all of the samples are shown in Fig. 5b.Generally, the Ti 2p spectrum can be fitted by four peaks at 457.4, 458.5, 463.3, and 464.4 eV, corresponding to the signals of Ti 3 2p 3/2 , Ti 4 2p 3/2 , Ti 3 2p 1/2 , and Ti 4 2p 1/2 , respectively 37.It was confirmed from Fig. 5b that the two Ti 2p doublet peaks at 458.5 and 464.4 eV can be ascribed to Ti 4 bound to oxygen in this study.No obvious shoulder was detected in the low-energy region of the Ti 2p 3/2 spectrum, which can be attributed to the insensitivity of XPS in distinguishing Ti 3 and Ti 4 .The S 2p XPS spectra of the catalysts shown in Fig. 5c identify the state of the sulfur species on the surface of the acidified TiO 2 .The binding energy of S 2p was observed as ca.169 eV for each of the acidified samples, in good agreement with the S 2p peak of S 6 38.No signal at 161.0-162.8eV for sulfide or at 164 eV for elemental sulfur could be detected 39.In comparison with the unmodified sample, all of the H 2 SO 4 -modified samples displayed a Ti 2p 3/2 core level at a slightly higher BE value (Fig. 5b), implying the formation of a bridging bidentate structure involving coordination of Ti 4 with bidentate SO 4 2-.The O 1s XPS spectra are illustrated in Fig. 5d, which could be deconvoluted into four peaks using Shirley backgrounds and Voigt (mixed Lorentzian-Gaussian) functions 40.The major peak located at 529.4 eV can be assigned to lattice oxygen (Ti O Ti), and the other three peaks at 530.8, 531.7, and 532.8 eV match those of oxygen in sulfate species, surface hydroxyl groups, and adsorbed water molecules, respectively 41.According to the deconvoluted peak areas, the percentages of the four peaks are summarized in Table 2.As can be seen in Table 2, the percentages of surface hydroxyl groups were 23, 26, 28, and 30 and the percentages of adsorbed H 2 O were 9, 10, 13, and 16 for 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively.These results demonstrate that acidification increased the number of hydroxyl groups and water molecules on the TiO 2 surface.The reason for the increase in the number of surface Ti-OH groups was the dissociation of H 2 O on the more abundant oxygen vacancies caused by acidification 42.The increase in the number of water molecules may have stemmed from their bonding at the increased number of surface bridging hydroxyl groups 43.Moreover, a reduced Ti O Ti percentage was found with increasing initial H 2 SO 4 concentration, implying that H 2 SO 4 treatment followed by heat treatment has a positive influence in increasing the number of oxygen vacancies.The atomic ratio of Ti O Ti/Ti of acidified TiO 2 was less than 2, implying the existence of oxygen vacancies.The existence of oxygen vacancies was further proved by UV/Vis DRS. As shown in Fig. 5e, in high-resolution scanning XPS spectra the binding energy of F 1s was situated at 683.8-684.5 eV for all of the TiO 2 nanosheets, which is typical for Ti F species on a TiO 2 surface 44.No signal for F -in the lattice (688.5 eV) was found, further illustrating that all of the F -was adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2 rather than in the lattice. EPR is a highly effective characterization technique for determining paramagnetic species having one or more unpaired electrons, and is usually used to identify the presence of Ti 3 in TiO 2 45.It is known that a g-value of 1.988 can be unequivocally assigned to a paramagnetic Ti 3 center in a distorted rhombic oxygen ligand field, and that the EPR signal intensity is correlated with Intensity (a.u.) g valu e g 1.988Fig. 6.EPR spectra of 0-TiO2, 0.2-TiO2, 0.5-TiO2, and 0.7-TiO2. the amount of Ti 3 in the sample 46,47.As shown in Fig. 6, the EPR signal assigned to Ti 3 progressively intensified as the concentration of H 2 SO 4 used for treatment was increased, confirming that surface acidification followed by heat treatment enhanced the generation of Ti 3 .Ti 3 defects originated through two possible pathways 48,49.One involved the transfer of two extra electrons from oxygen vacancies at the two-fold coordinated bridging sites to adjacent Ti 4 sites.The other involved the introduction of an electron into the 3d orbital of Ti 4 through bulk substitution of lattice O 2-atoms in TiO 2 by F -.The most evident distinction between the types of Ti 3 defects is that F -derived Ti 3 cannot induce any observed photon excitation in the infrared region, whereas Ti 3 associated with oxygen vacancies can give rise to such excitation 49. The light absorption properties of the TiO 2 samples synthesized under various conditions were analyzed by UV/Vis DRS and are depicted in Fig. 7a.All of the samples displayed an absorption edge in the region of 400 nm, suggesting that no sulfur had been incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice.A broad absorption band beyond 400 nm up to the visible region was apparent for samples 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , and the absorption intensity increased with increasing initial H 2 SO 4 concentration.Since various functional groups on TiO 2 may introduce a new absorption band in the visible light region 50, 0.5 mol L -1 Na 2 SO 4 instead of 0.5 mol L -1 H 2 SO 4 was used to modify the TiO 2 nanosheets under analogous conditions.No obvious difference in the UV/Vis DRS between 0-TiO 2 and the 0-TiO 2 modified with 0.5 mol L -1 Na 2 SO 4 (Fig. 7b) could be observed, indicating that SO 4 2-could not form visible-light-active complexes on TiO 2 under our preparative conditions.Similar results have been obtained by other researchers 515253.Consequently, oxygen vacancy states between the valence and conduction bands induced by Ti 3 species contributed to the visible response of the TiO 2 samples. The band gap, E g , for each of the TiO 2 samples was evaluated from the Tauc plot equation 54: where is the absorption coefficient, h represents Planck's constant, refers to the frequency of the photon, A is a constant, and n is 1/2 for a direct transition.The relationships between ( hv) 1/2 and h for all of the TiO 2 samples are shown in Fig. 7c.The band gaps are estimated to be 3.13, 3.09, 3.07, and 3.00 eV for 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively.The gradual narrowing of the band gap from 0-TiO 2 to 0.7-TiO 2 implies increasing concentration of Ti 3 /oxygen vacancies 55. Theoretical calculations and related experiments have demonstrated that a vacancy band of electronic states would be induced due to a high vacancy concentration 56.The shallow donor level just below the conduction band is responsible for the visible light response.Three kinds of oxygen vacancy state, namely O v , O v Ti 3 , and O v :2Ti 3 0 , have been postulated by other researchers 24.The O v Ti 3 and O v :2Ti 3 0 are situated at 0.75 and 1.18 eV below the CB minimum, respectively.The number of different oxygen vacancy states in TiO 2 depends on the preparation conditions.For unmodified TiO 2 , high hydrothermal temperature facilitates cleavage of Ti O bonds and thus enhances the generation of O v Ti 3 and O v :2Ti 3 0 .Therefore, the 0-TiO 2 exhibited obvious absorption in the visible light region.During H 2 SO 4 treatment, H would react with surface oxygen giving strongly adsorbed H 2 O molecules.Upon heat treatment under vacuum conditions, the strongly adsorbed H 2 O was lost, leading to the formation of defect sites at the TiO 2 surface, as depicted in Scheme 1 30,57. Consequently, the visible absorption of TiO 2 was improved after surface acidification.The existence of oxygen vacancies was indicated indirectly by the blue colors of the samples hydrothermally treated at 240 C (see the inset in Fig. 7a), since blue coloration is an obvious characteristic of the formation of oxygen vacancies related to Ti 3 58.Moreover, together with EPR characterization, it could be concluded that the higher the Ti 3 content, the deeper the blue color.Fig. 8. Raman spectra of 0-TiO2, 0.2-TiO2, 0.5-TiO2, and 0.7-TiO2. Change of wavenumber and FWHM of the peak at around 142 cm -1 , as well as the B1g (394 cm -1 ):A1g (514 cm -1 ):Eg (636 cm -1 ) ratios of the respective TiO2 photocatalysts. Sample Wavenumber (cm -1 ) FWHM (cm -1 ) B1g (394 cm -1 ):A1g (514 cm -1 ):Eg (636 cm 3.1.7.Raman spectroscopy Raman spectroscopy was used to reveal the vibrational and structural properties of the TiO 2 catalysts.It can be observed in Fig. 8 that the spectra of all of the samples featured similar peaks at approximately 142, 195, 394, 514, and 636 cm -1 , which are consistent with the spectrum of the typical anatase TiO 2 phase.As demonstrated by Park and Siegel, oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 crystals cause an up-shift and broadening of the E g (142 cm -1 ) mode in the Raman spectrum due to the atomic rearrangement caused by oxygen vacancies 59.Moreover, the relative intensities of B 1g (394 cm -1 ), A 1g (514 cm -1 ), and E g (636 cm -1 ) are closely related to the change in the oxygen vacancies and Ti 3 quantities 26.To evaluate more clearly the distinction between the spectra, the wavenumber, FWHM, and relative intensity of each mode was determined, as listed in Table 3. Comparing the acidified samples with the non-acidified sample, the E g (142 cm -1 ) mode slightly shifted towards higher wavenumber and its FWHM was enlarged with increasing H 2 SO 4 concentration.In addition, the intensities of the B 1g (394 cm -1 ) and E g (636 cm -1 ) modes were gradually enhanced relative to that of the A 1g (514 cm -1 ) mode with increasing initial H 2 SO 4 concentration.Consequently, surface acidification leads to an inevitable increase in the defect density on the TiO 2 surface.All of these results are in accordance with the UV/Vis DRS analysis.3.1.8.PL spectra PL spectra were recorded to obtain information on the dynamics of the photogenerated species 60.Fig. 9 shows the PL spectra of the TiO 2 samples prepared under various conditions, recorded in the wavelength range 350-550 nm with excitation at 300 nm.All of the TiO 2 samples showed similar curve shapes in the range 350-550 nm, but with different intensities.Generally, the PL intensity became weaker with increasing concentration of H 2 SO 4 used for treatment, indicating a lower recombination rate of photoelectrons and holes 26.Therefore, sulfuric acid modification on TiO 2 nanosheets is favorable for efficiently separating the charge carriers by prolonging the lifetime of carriers and suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs.This result is similar to that reported by Xu et al. 11. The experimental transient photocurrent response is also deemed an effective parameter to characterize the separation efficiency of photogenerated e --h pairs 2.Further work is needed to provide additional evidence supporting the proposed superiority of surface acidification through transient photocurrent measurements. The photocatalytic activity of the fabricated TiO 2 nanosheets toward gas-phase CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O vapor under visible light irradiation was experimentally investigated.According to previous reports, a series of compounds such as CH 4 , CO, CH 3 OH, and HCOOH constitute the major carbon-containing products, and H 2 is the major reducing by-product 61.However, no substance other than CH 4 was detected by gas chromatography above the detection limit in this study.The potential for photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 is given in Eq. ( 2) with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode at pH 7.0. The amounts of generated CH 4 , in mol g -1 , with increasing time are presented in Fig. 10a.It should be noted that the 0-TiO 2 with a band gap of 3.13 eV yielded 7.43 mol g -1 CH 4 after 4 h of reaction under visible light ( 400 nm).To explore the source of CH 4 formation, a series of control experiments was performed.Direct photolysis of a mixture of pure CO 2 and H 2 O vapor in the absence of TiO 2 as well as dark adsorption were conducted.After 4 h, no carbon-containing substances were detected.In another photocatalytic process, the CO 2 reactant was replaced with highpurity Ar.No carbon compounds could be detected.Further control experiments were performed using only CO 2 as gas precursor (without water vapor) under visible light irradiation.CH 4 generation was found and the yield increased gradually during the first 2 h of irradiation and then remained almost unchanged.After 4 h of irradiation, the CH 4 yields were 6.57, 7.05, 7.62, and 7.63 mol g -1 on 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively.The results demonstrated that the unavoidable carbon impurities in TiO 2 originating from the preparation process may participate in the CO 2 photoreduction reaction.The discrimination and the role of reacting species derived from residual carbon materials during the CO 2 reduction process deserve further investigation by the use of isotopically labeled 13 CO 2 as a reactant 4.After deducting background values at various times, the yield of CH 4 as a function of time is shown in Fig. 10b.It can be seen that 0-TiO 2 gave a very low yield of CH 4 because it cannot be activated under visible irradiation due to its large band gap.Similarly, as shown in Scheme 2, it is impossible for bulk anatase TiO 2 with a band gap of 3.2 eV to induce CO 2 reduction.In contrast, all of the surface-acidified samples (0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 ) yielded significantly larger amounts of CH 4 after 4 h of photoreaction.The 0.5-TiO 2 showed the highest photocatalytic activity, with a CH 4 production rate of 3.3 mol g -1 h -1 (13.20 mol g -1 after 4 h of irradiation).Several studies have been carried out on TiO 2 -based catalysts for visible light reduction of CO 2 in gas-solid reaction systems, and CH 4 was detected as the major product 4,61626364.Their average production rate was in the range 0.3-4.6 mol g -1 h -1 .Thus, the CH 4 yield in this study approached the maximum value reported. QY and EROEI of the photocatalytic process are important factors in evaluating the activities of the catalysts.The calculated QYs were found to be 0.048 for 0-TiO 2 , 0.214 for 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.726 for 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.494 for 0.7-TiO 2 after photocatalytic reactions for 240 min.Additionally, the EROEI were calculated to be about 0.022, 0.099, 0.335, and 0.228 for 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 , respectively.These values clearly indicate that the activities of the TiO 2 catalysts were in the order 0.5-TiO 2 0.7-TiO 2 0.2-TiO 2 0-TiO 2 .To exclude the effect of surface area, QY and EROEI per unit BET surface area of TiO 2 (defined as QY/S and EROEI/S) were calculated and the results are presented in Table 1.The QY/S and EROEI/S values of the TiO 2 catalysts are seen to exhibit the same order as QY and EROEI.The results suggest that other properties besides surface area also contribute to the improved photocatalytic activity. TON is an important parameter in evaluating catalysts.According to the literature 34, the TON values for 0-TiO 2 , 0.2-TiO 2 , 0.5-TiO 2 , and 0.7-TiO 2 amount to 9.306, 27.973, 83.124, and 49.507, respectively, demonstrating that the visible light reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor is a catalyzed reduction process. In general, oxidation half-reactions plays a pivotal role in the photoreduction process of CO 2 .Without the addition of any other reductants, H 2 O was employed as an efficient electron donor for CO 2 conversion.Therefore, to better understand the reaction mechanism of photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor, it is very important to quantitatively analyze the product(s) of water oxidation, such as O 2 .However, background levels of O 2 and N 2 of a few hundred ppm in the reactor cannot be avoided.Hence, the volumetric ratio of O 2 /N 2 rather than a quantitative determination of O 2 was used as an indicator to evaluate the variation of O 2 as a function of time.A similar method has been adopted by other researchers 656667.As shown in Fig. 11, the time dependence of the O 2 /N 2 ratio shows a similar tendency as that of CH 4 production during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor on 0.5-TiO 2 under visible-light irradiation, suggesting the generation of O 2 in our work (Eq.( 3)).In other words, H 2 O reacts with h to produce O 2 along with reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 , as depicted in Scheme 2. To further evaluate the stability of the prepared TiO 2 catalysts, recyclability experiments on CO 2 photoreduction were performed on 0.5-TiO 2 .As displayed in Fig. 12, no obvious decrease in the CH 4 yield could be discerned after 20 h of visible light irradiation over five runs, indicating excellent reusability of the photocatalyst. According to the physical-chemical characterization, the obvious difference in CO 2 reduction performance by acidification should be ascribed to a change in the surface characteristics rather than the bulk properties.As mentioned above, acidification enhances the generation of Ti-OH, which has been proved to be an effective site for the oxidation of H 2 O (electron donor in our system) 33.The oxidation of H 2 O is an inevitable simultaneous step for scavenging holes during photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Efficient consumption of photo-excited holes in the photooxidation process is beneficial to suppress the recombination of photogenerated e --h pairs and thus promote the photoreduction of CO 2 .Therefore, more Ti-OH would consume more holes, leaving more electrons to participate in the reduction process. Moreover, acidification facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies accompanied by Ti 3 57.Since oxygen vacancies are believed to be electron donors in TiO 2 , contributing to the improved donor density, stronger acidification would be beneficial to the visible light activities of CO 2 reduction mediated by these vacancies 68.Furthermore, the Ti 3 /oxygen vacancies served as efficient sites for electron trapping and CO 2 adsorption 32 In view of the fact that H 2 SO 4 treatment did not significantly narrow the band gap of TiO 2 , the enhancing effect of surface protonation on the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is discussed in more detail by comparing the particle size dependence of the photogenerated e --h separation before and after modification with H 2 SO 4 .When the particle size of a semiconductor is smaller than the Bohr radius, the electrons and holes are confined in a potential well (quantum size effect) 69.In contrast, Huang et al. demonstrated that a large specific surface area functioned more effectively than the quantum size effect in controlling the photocatalytic reactivity of TiO 2 70. In addition to a high active surface area, a suitable photocatalyst must also have high e --h separation efficiency 69.To relax the band to the bulk level, an ideal photocatalyst should have a particle size of twice the width of the surface space charge region 71.Otherwise, the proximity effect would lead to an increase in the recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers.Calculation of the width of the space charge region in depletion (L d ) or accumulation (L a ) requires the Debye length, L D , and the potential drop across the space charge region, V s 72: where 0 and r are the permittivity of free space and the dielectric constant, respectively, k represents the Boltzmann constant, T refers to the absolute temperature, e denotes the electron charge, and N D is the donor density.The widths of the space charge layers are described by: and Using values typical of anatase TiO 2 (N D 10 18 -10 20 cm -3 , r 48, V s 0.03 V) 737475, the width of the space charge layer in this material was determined as 1.5-12.5 nm. If the carrier diffusion length is taken into consideration, a maximum geometric size of the photocatalyst comparable to twice the width of the space charge region plus the carrier diffusion length would be acceptable.The carrier diffusion length L is given by: with where and are the carrier lifetime and the carrier mobility, respectively.The value of carrier mobility is 0.2 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for anatase TiO 2 , and the lifetime of photogenerated carriers in TiO 2 was determined to be 1.5 ns based on photoluminescence spectral analysis 76,77.Thus, the L value was determined to be ca.30 nm.As a consequence, the size of anatase TiO 2 for efficient separation of e --h pairs lies in the range 63-85 nm. According to density functional theory calculations of surface chemistry and based on experimental evidence, for TiO 2 enclosed with 0 0 1 and 1 0 1 facets, the photogenerated electrons would selectively transfer to the 1 0 1 facets, whereas the holes would concentrate on the 0 0 1 facets 78,79.In the present work, the prepared TiO 2 nanosheets had an average side length of 120 nm and an average thickness of 40 nm.Consequently, the greater side length of TiO 2 , i.e. 120 nm 85 nm, did not favor the transfer of electrons to the 1 0 1 facets.In comparison with non-acidified TiO 2 , the carrier lifetime in protonated TiO 2 is prolonged five-fold 75.This is because the TiO 2 -H 2 SO 4 junction will function as a Schottky barrier, impelling the majority of the electrons in the bulk to the positively charged outer layer and preventing them from reentering the interior of the TiO 2 .The acceptable size of anatase TiO 2 nanosheets is thereby enlarged to a range of 127 -149 nm, greater than the side length of the prepared catalyst (ca.120 nm).The photogenerated electrons could transfer to the 1 0 1 facets of the TiO 2 nanosheets to participate in the CO 2 reduction process. Moreover, based on Beer's law 80, the absorption length, L p , is given by: where is the absorption coefficient.The of anatase TiO 2 at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm is ca. 3 10 6 m -1 81, corresponding to an absorption length of about 333 nm.This result indicates that the prepared catalyst could ensure the efficient absorption of incident light.Taking together the above findings, H 2 SO 4 treatment of TiO 2 nanosheets enclosed with 0 0 1 and 1 0 1 facets not only ensures the creation of the most electron-hole pairs within TiO 2 under visible-light irradiation, but is also helpful for suppressing charge recombination. In addition, proton adsorption on metal oxide surfaces shifts the positions of both the valence band edge maximum and the conduction band edge minimum 82.This can be attributed to the formation of a Helmholtz double layer at the interface between the semiconductor and the surface protons.Some contact potential drop inside the semiconductor space charge layer would occur to maintain acid-base equilibrium 83.Based on a solid-liquid reaction system, Gomes et al. obtained a potential drop equation (Eq.( 10)) through a series of deductions 84. Here, represents the magnitude of the potential drop between the semiconductor and the ionized surface groups, A is a constant, R denotes the gas constant, T denotes the absolute temperature, F is the Faraday constant, and (a MO -) s and (a M ) s are the activities of the MO -and M species at the semiconductor surface.Obviously, the Nernst shift of the potential is -59 mV per pH unit at 298 K 85.In this study, it was difficult to accurately calculate the shift of the conduction band edge of TiO 2 , due to the following reasons: (1) some H of H 2 SO 4 participated in the formation of oxygen vacancies and was released in the form of H 2 O during the synthesis process (Scheme 1); (2) pH values in the surrounding phase of TiO 2 nanosheets cannot be determined in a solid-gas reaction system.In any case, the redox potential of the conduction band electrons is rendered more positive at higher proton concentration, hindering the reduction reaction.Thus, during the photocatalytic process in this work, excessive surface protonation would induce an undesirable influence that inhibits the reduction of CO 2 . In addition to the adverse influence of a Nernst shift, excess oxygen vacancies at extremely high protonation degrees would act as recombination centers, leaving fewer electrons and holes for reducing CO 2 and oxidizing H 2 O, respectively 25.Additionally, a higher degree of sulfuric acid modification would result in more bridging bidentate structures on the surface of the TiO 2 , causing a space-steric effect and a decrease in the number of active sites. Considering all of the above, there should be an optimal sulfuric acid concentration for TiO 2 modification.In this study, the QY, EROEI, and TON for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 were found to be maximized at an initial H 2 SO 4 concentration of 0.5 mol L -1 for protonated TiO 2 with highly exposed 0 0 1 facets."}, {"llm generation": "water vapor (Gas)", "source": "Furthermore, the photocatalyst displayed good stability in the reduction of CO 2 with water vapor under visible light irradiation.", "context": "In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that surface modification with H 2 SO 4 significantly enhances the activities of TiO 2 photocatalysts enclosed with 0 0 1 and 1 0 1 facets for CO 2 reduction to CH 4 under visible light.Acidification with H 2 SO 4 promotes the formation of surface hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies/Ti 3 species, which is beneficial for the reduction of CO 2 and the oxidation of H 2 O, as well as increasing the visible-light absorption.In particular, the surface protonation resulting from acidification with H 2 SO 4 extends the lifetime of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, overcoming the limitation of unfavorable side length of the prepared TiO 2 nanosheets for the migration of photogenerated carriers.However, excessive acidification would be detrimental to the photocatalytic process.This is because the conduction band of TiO 2 would shift to a more positive value due to surface protonation, and bridging bidentate structures on TiO 2 may cause a space-steric effect and a decrease in the number of active sites.The optimal photocatalyst was found to be that treated with 0.5 mol L -1 H 2 SO 4 .After 240 min of reaction, the CH 4 yield was 13.20 mol g -1 , corresponding to a QY, EROEI, and TON of 0.726, 0.335, and 83.124, respectively.Furthermore, the photocatalyst displayed good stability in the reduction of CO 2 with water vapor under visible light irradiation.The photocatalysts presented herein provide a potential alternative for the photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 utilizing solar energy.

The crucial intermediate of carboxylate species (CO 2 -) is generated on the defect structure of TiO 2 by transfer of an electron from Ti 3 to adsorbed CO 2 .Therefore, increased Ti 3 /oxygen vacancy amounts can accelerate the formation of CO 2 -, promoting the photoreduction of CO 2 .Taking together the above evidence, H 2 SO 4 modification could improve the visible light response of TiO 2 and the adsorption of CO 2 .
