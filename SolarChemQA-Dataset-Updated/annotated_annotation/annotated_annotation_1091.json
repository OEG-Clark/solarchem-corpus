The physical mixture sample of ZT was prepared as follows.90 mg (0.1 mmol) ZnTCPP and 676.5 mg (0.4 mmol) NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) were added into 20 mL DMF in a 30 mL sample bottle and stirred for 30 min.Then the sample bottle was vibrated for 1 day in a vibration machine to obtain a fine physical mixture.The prepared physical mixture sample was labelled as ZT. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of samples were tested using a D/MAX-2500 X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu K radiation.The fieldemission scanning electron micro-scope (Hitachi S-4800) was used to obtain the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) was measured with a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi equipped with Al K radiation, and the XPS data was calibrated with the binding energy of C1 s fixed at 284.6 eV.The EPR experiments was conducted by degassing sample suspensions with nitrogen and measured using a Bruker-A300 in the dark.The UV-vis spectra was analyzed using a Shimadzu UV3600 spectrometer and BaSO 4 was used as the reflectance sample.The Fluorescence test was conducted with HORIBA Fluoromax-4 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a 300 nm excitation light.The Motte-Schottky curves was examined with PARSTAT MC1000, Princeton Applied Research, USA electrochemical workstation.All the photoelectrochemical experiments were conducted using a CHI 660D electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua, China). The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction tests were carried out using a Xe lamp ( 350 nm) as light source and circulating condensate water was set at 20 C. 20 mg sample was dissolved in 2 mL methanol and filtrated on the surface of fiberglass wafer (thickness: 5 mm, diameter: 2.5 cm).The top surface area of the fiberglass is about 4.9 cm 2 .The loaded fiberglass was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 C for 10 h before being used as the photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction examination.5 mL solvent (TEOA: MeCN 1:4) was used as the sacrificial agent.The reactor was pumped to vacuum ( -0.1 MPa) and then the sacrifice agent was injected.Finally, the high pure (99.999 ) carbon dioxide was introduced until the reactor pressure reached -30 KPa.The fiberglass without photocatalysts was also tested for 12 h at identical condition before being used as the sample carrier.Photocatalytic reduction product of CO or CH 4 was recorded per hour for 8 h using Shimadzu GC-2014 equipped with TCD detectors.The used catalyst was dried at 80 C for 12 h to activate before being used in the next examination.The recycle test was examined in the completely identical environment.

In order to investigate the content of ZnTCPP, the ICP analysis of D-TiMOF and ZT was conducted and shown in Table S1.The Zn/Ti molar ratio of D-TiMOF is 0.058 while the value of ZT is 0.046.Both of them are close to the initial addition of Zn/Ti ratio at 0.05, indicating in situ hydrothermal method can realize efficient loading of ZnTCPP.The crystal structure analysis of the different samples is also conducted and shown in Fig. 1a ,D-TiMOF shows similar crystal structure with TiMOF and no obvious XRD patterns differences are caused by the incorporation of ZnTCPP.It indicates that D-TiMOF exhibits similar crystal structure as TiMOF, which is important to obtain NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) related properties as discussed follows.As shown in Fig. S1g, the prepared TiO 2 show spherical particles.TiMOF using NH 2 BDC as ligand exhibits discoid shape (Fig. S1a,d).After loading ZnTCPP on the surface of TiMOF, ZT exhibits rough flocculent surface (Fig. S1c,f).D-TiMOF shows truncated and fragmentary particles which may be attributed to the big steric hindrance of porphyrin molecule due to the coordination between ZnTCPP and titanium oxo clusters (Fig. S1b,e). The FTIR spectra are investigated in order to further confirm the introduction of ZnTCPP in D-TiMOF (Fig. 1b).The TCPP shows typical stretching bands of the pyrrole ring in the range of 700-1500 cm -1 with the stretching bands at 1710 cm -1 , 1410 cm -1 and 965 cm -1 corresponding to (C--O), (C-O) and (N-H) modes, respectively.For D-TiMOF, the stretching modes at 1380 cm -1 and 1430 cm -1 can be attributed to symmetric (COO -) stretches, and the asymmetric (COO -) stretch appears at 1570 cm -1 .Compared with TCPP, the shift of carboxyl vibration peaks to low frequency is attributed to the transition of free porphyrin to carboxylato chelating functionality in D-TiMOF 26.Besides, a new signal at 997 cm -1 corresponding to the (Zn-N) stretch appears in D-TiMOF further verifies that the ZnTCPP has been successfully incorporated into D-TiMOF due to the coordination of Zn atoms with N atoms in ZnTCPP (Fig. S2b) 44.The FTIR spectra of D-TiMOF and TiMOF are enlarged and shown in Fig. S2a for comparison.The obviously enhanced adsorption peaks at 1650 cm -1 , 1350 cm -1 correspond to the C--C and C--N stretching vibration, respectively.The enhanced peak signals are attributed to the addition of ZnTCPP.Besides, two vibration bands at 3450 cm -1 and 3348 cm -1 are symmetric and asymmetric stretching of the amino group 47.The decreased intensity of amine vibration peak at 3358 cm -1 is attributed to the decreased proportion of NH 2 BDC in D-TiMOF compared with TiMOF only containing NH 2 BDC ligand. Fig. 1c and d exhibit the specific surface area and pore distribution of different samples.The enlarged picture of Fig. 1d is shown in Fig. S3.TiMOF and D-TiMOF show adsorption/desorption isotherms with characteristic of micropores.The specific surface area of TiO 2 , ZT, D-TiMOF and TiMOF are 60 m 2 /g, 987 m 2 /g, 1374 m 2 /g and 1481 m 2 /g, respectively.D-TiMOF inherits the high specific surface area of TiMOF, which will be benefit for the CO 2 adsorption.The introduction of ZnTCPP ligand as part of D-TiMOF's skeleton expands the mesopore distribution without obvious decrement of the specific surface area.The slightly decreased surface area of D-TiMOF can be attributed to the disordered pore channels of D-TiMOF caused by the incorporation of ZnTCPP.D-TiMOF has a similar pore distribution but a relatively smaller proportions of micropores and bigger proportions of mesopores compared with TiMOF due to the coordination between ZnTCPP and titanium oxo clusters, which constructs more mesopores.TiO 2 only has limited specific surface area due to the absence of porous skeleton.From TiO 2 to dual ligands MOFs, D-TiMOF shows an increased specific surface area and more available open channels for CO 2 molecules.As shown in Fig. S5, ZT and D-TiMOF show enhanced CO 2 uptake ability compared with TiMOF and TiO 2 due to the incorporation of ZnTCPP.The enhanced effect of ZnTCPP on the CO 2 uptake ability can be revealed by the comparison between D-TiMOF and ZT.Though the in situ hydrothermal method during the preparation of D-TiMOF can't avoid the surface coating of ZnTCPP, ZT prefers to load more ZnTCPP on the surface by post-synthesis method compared with D-TiMOF.The stronger CO 2 uptake ability of ZT than D-TiMOF exhibits that more surface coated ZnTCPP in ZT can contribute more CO 2 uptake ability than the inner incorporation of ZnTCPP in D-TiMOF. The chemical composition and electronic structure of as-prepared samples are characterized by XPS as shown in Fig. 2. The Zn 2p peaks in D-TiMOF are obvious due to the incorporation of ZnTCPP and the peaks at 1045.1 eV and 1022.1 eV correspond to the Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 (Fig. S4e).As shown in Fig. 2b, the N1 s spectrum shows a specific pyrrolic-N peak in D-TiMOF at 400.82 eV, which is attributed to the pyrrole rings in Zn-porphyrin.The N1 s spectra at 401.67 eV 48 (D-TiMOF) and 402.41 eV 49 (TiMOF) can be attributed to NH 2 group. As N element has a pyrrole form in ZnTCPP instead of amine group in NH 2 BDC, the decreased signal intensity of NH 2 and newly formed pyrrole indicates decreased NH 2 BDC proportion and increased ZnTCPP proportion in D-TiMOF, which corresponds to the above FTIR comparison results between D-TiMOF and TiMOF.The splitting of the Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 spin-orbitals at 5.8 eV indicates that Ti bonded to O is in the form of Ti 4 for the Ti-oxo cluster 47,50.Besides, D-TiMOF has a positive peak shift of Ti 2p 3/2 compared to TiMOF because Ti acts as an acceptor and takes electrons from the O atoms of the porphyrin carbonyl groups( -O -C--O) 51,52.It further confirms the coordination relationship of ZnTCPP ligand-titanium oxo clusters mode.As a control sample, the XPS spectrum of ZT is shown in Fig. S4.The XPS comparison between ZT and D-TiMOF confirms their structure differences and also confirms the coordination effect between ZnTCPP and titanium-oxo clusters.The optical absorption ability of D-TiMOF, the UV-vis spectra of TiO 2 , TiMOF and D-TiMOF are also compared, as shown in Fig. 3a.The bandgap of as-prepared samples is calculated based on the Tauc plot method 53 as shown in Fig. 3b.Due to the coordination of ligands with titanium oxo clusters, the optical absorption capacity is enhanced with the introduction of NH 2 BDC and ZnTCPP ligands in TiMOF and D-TiMOF compared with TiO 2 .D-TiMOF exhibits a significantly enhanced optical absorption ability than TiMOF.The absorption peak at 422 nm corresponds to the Soret band of porphyrin, and absorption peaks at 524 nm, 559 nm, 593 nm and 652 nm are attributed to its weak split Q band 44.D-TiMOF has a narrower bandgap of 2.24 eV compared with TiMOF (2.53 eV), which corresponds to the enhanced visible light absorption ability of D-TiMOF.It is reported that the CB of TiMOF consists of Ti 3d orbitals and O 2p orbitals while the VB is contributed by the C 2p orbitals within NH 2 BDC 54.The newly introduced ZnTCPP coordination mode with Ti-oxo cluster is likely to affect the CB and VB at the same time.In order to characterize the band structure change, Motte-Schottky curves are examined (Fig. S8).All the Motte-Schottky plots of TiO 2 , D-TiMOF and TiMOF exhibit positive slopes, indicating their n-type semiconductor characteristic 45.The flat band potential is reported to be 0.10 V more positive than its CB bottom in the n-type semiconductors.The calculated CB of TiO 2 , TiMOF and D-TiMOF are -0.6 V, -0.83 V and -0.66 V, respectively.The VB is calculated via the equation (Eg E CB -E VB ).The calculated VB of TiO 2 , TiMOF and D-TiMOF are 2.68 V, 1.7 V and 1.58 V, respectively. The calculated band structure is shown in Fig. 4a.On the one hand, the CB band potential of these three samples (TiO 2 , TiMOF and D-TiMOF) are all above the CO 2 /CO conversion potential at -0.53 V, so their band structure satisfies the thermodynamic requirement of CO 2 / CO conversion.On the other hand, the bandgap determines the photoelectric conversion efficiency.A smaller bandgap means a lower energy barrier to overcome for electrons excited from valence band to conduction band.A gradually decreased bandgap from 3.28 V to 2.24 V is obtained after titanium oxo clusters orderly coordinated with NH 2 BDC and ZnTCPP to form TiMOF and D-TiMOF, respectively.As discussed above, D-TiMOF constructs a new Ti-based MOFs with ZnTCPP sensitized titanium oxo clusters to realize the modification and promotion of the TiMOF's band structure.The optical electric conversion efficiency has an important effect on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction efficiency of TiMOF.As shown in Fig. 4b, though the prepared Ti-based MOFs (TiMOF and D-TiMOF) exhibit stronger PL intensity compared with titanium oxo clusters, D-TiMOF has stronger charge separation ability over TiMOF.The similar gradually decreased PL intensity trend is also found in TiO 2 /NH 2 -MIL-125 complex with an increased TiO 2 content 47.The apparent weaker charge separation ability of Ti-based MOFs relative to titanium oxo clusters may be attributed to the low electron transfer efficiency from titanium oxo clusters to NH 2 BDC ligands, which is promoted via construction of D-TiMOF.To further evaluate the enhanced charge separation ability of D-TiMOF, the photocurrent profile is shown in Fig. S7.The photocurrent intensity of D-TiMOF (2.76 A) is about 40 folds that of TiMOF (0.068 A).The obviously enhanced photoelectronic conversion of D-TiMOF can be attributed to the porphyrin's strong electron injection ability and the cooperation between titanium-oxo clusters with porphyrin in the coordination forms.In conclusion, D-TiMOF has two kinds of ligands, i.e., NH 2 BDC and porphyrin, which exhibits enhanced photoelectronic conversion, charge separation and electron transfer ability compared with TiMOF.In addition, D-TiMOF also exhibits a much more proper band structure for CO 2 /CO redox compared with TiO 2 and TiMOF.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance is discussed as follows. The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance experiments were conducted under the gas reaction conditions via a GC-2014 with 1 ppm limit of detection.The control experiment at identical condition was conducted for 12 h except using high pure nitrogen gas instead of carbon dioxide as the raw gas.No CO x related product was detected.It indicates that no CO x gas product is generated from photocatalyst decomposition, sacrifice reagent or reaction system itself during the reaction period.As shown in Fig. 5, the average CO productivity of TiO 2 , TiMOF, ZnTCPP, ZT and D-TiMOF are 3.94 umolg -1 h -1 , 5.36 umolg -1 h -1 , 6.43 umolg -1 h -1 , 6.72 umolg -1 h -1 and 59.55 umolg -1 h -1 , respectively.Both TiO 2 and ZnTCPP exhibit photocatalytic activity, indicating that both of titanium oxo clusters and ZnTCPP can become the active sites.Compared with TiO 2 , TiMOF exhibits higher photocatalytic activity due to the increased CO 2 uptake ability and higher surface area though its charge separation ability is weaker.D-TiMOF exhibits 11 folds photocatalytic CO 2 -to-CO conversion efficiency compared with TiMOF due to the introduction of ZnTCPP.Though ZnTCPP exhibits stronger photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 , the coordination form between ZnTCPP and titanium oxo clusters in D-TiMOF exhibits a much more efficient CO 2 -to-CO conversion efficiency than the simple mixture of ZnTCPP and titanium oxo clusters (ZT).The significantly increased CO yield of D-TiMOF over ZT indicates that the coordination form of ZnTCPP with titanium oxo clusters in D-TiMOF is superior to ZT with ZnTCPP loaded on the surface of TiMOF.D-TiMOF with a similar addition of ZnTCPP shows 8.9 folds CO yield compared with ZT.Though Zn/Ti ratio is only about 5, the significantly enhanced CO yield of D-TiMOF compared with ZT and TiMOF indicates the existence of the synergistic effect between titanium oxo clusters and ZnTCPP. In addition, the photocatalytic recycle performance was tested and the obtained D-TiMOF shows stable photocatalytic performance for three cycles.No obvious signals about CH 4 product can be detected during the 8 h reaction and it verifies the higher CO gas product selectivity and stability of D-TiMOF.The photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of D-TiMOF is better than catalysts reported recently (Table S2).The reaction scheme is illustrated in Fig. 6.Two reaction sites in D-TiMOF are proposed.Based on the experiment results, both of ZnTCPP and titanium oxo clusters can be the photoactive sites.Under the irradiation, the excited NH 2 BDC provides electrons for titanium oxo clusters to drive Ti 4 /Ti 3 conversion and further conduct CO 2 /CO reduction reactions.At first stage, TiMOF exhibits enhanced CO 2 reduction activity compared with TiO 2 due to the enhanced optical adsorption and CO 2 uptake ability with the introduction of NH 2 BDC.At second stage, the introduction of ZnTCPP exhibits the further enhanced CO 2 uptake ability and significantly enhanced photoelectric conversion ability.Especially, the significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity of D-TiMOF is attributed to the synergistic effect between ZnTCPP and titanium oxo clusters.ZnTCPP not only acts as the second reactive site to directly drive CO 2 reduction reactions, but also provides photoelectrons for Ti 4 /Ti 3 conversion.In addition, the NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) derived dual ligand MOFs (D-TiMOF) inherits the porous structure and high surface area of NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti), increasing the local CO 2 concentration around the reactive sites."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
