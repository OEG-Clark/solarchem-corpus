The morphology of synthesized PCN-222-Zn crystal was revealed by the SEM images.The PCN-222-Zn crystal displayed a characteristic hexagonal-rod shapes of Zr-based MOF.All the PCN-222-Zn displayed uniform ultralong nanorod morphology, with 500-800 nm diameter.No impurity crystal particles were found.After using 8 M HCl solution to remove the unconverted reactant and activate the PCN-222-Zn, we used ICP technique to check the doping amount of Zn(II) ions in PCN-222-Zn (Fig. 2). The different doping amount of Zn 2 ions in PCN-222-Zn samples were tested by applying the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis.As showed in Table 1, different PCN-222-Zn samples had different Zn 2 ions incorporation in porphyrin linkers.Here, we calculated the Zr/Zn element ratio to get the information of the incorporated porphyrin linkers in different PCN-222-Zn samples.Since the atomic ration between the Zr atom and porphyrin linker was 3:1.For the 25 PCN-222-Zn, the atom ratio between Zr and Zn was about 11.06, indicating that about 25 of porphyrin linkers were doped with Zn 2 .As for the 15 PCN-222-Zn and 5 PCN-222-Zn, the doping amount Zn 2 decreased from The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of PCN-222, TCPP and PCN-222-Zn were showed in Fig. 3.The characteristic asymmetric vibrational peaks of pyrrole ring of the CN, N-H, CC and C-H in TCPP was clearly found in the range 500-700 cm -1 .The peak located at 1676 cm -1 can be ascribed to the CO 25.After doping with Zn 2 in the porphyrin linker, the intensity of the N-H bond stretch peak located at 965 cm -1 became weak 26.Besides, the newly showed peak at 660 cm -1 was identified to the Zn-N bond stretch in PCN-222-Zn.The above results verified that part of porphyrin linkers in PCN-222-Zn coordinated with Zn 2 ions. The nitrogen sorption isotherms obtained on all samples at 77 K were displayed in Fig. 4a.As can be seen, the nitrogen uptake capacity of the PCN-222 samples slightly varied depending on the doping amount of Zn 2 ions in porphyrin.As more Zn 2 ions incorporation with porphyrin linkers, the BET surface area of PCN-222 slightly decreased from 2170 m 2 /g to 1587 m 2 /g (25 PCN-222-Zn).Besides, the CO 2 adsorption ability was seen as an important aspect to evaluate the catalytic performance of catalyst.As shown in Fig. 4b, all the volumetric CO 2 adsorption measurements of all samples were conducted at 298 K.The CO 2 uptake volume at 298 K were calculated to be 70.54m 3 /g, 75.03 m 3 /g, 78.90 m 3 /g, and 88.24 m 3 /g for the PCN-222, 5 PCN-222-Zn, 15 PCN-222-Zn, and 25 PCN-222-Zn.The improved CO 2 adsorption of samples can be explained by the increased affinity between the unsaturated Zn(II) sites and CO 2 molecular 27. As shown in Fig. 5, all the PCN-222 samples displayed a broad visible-light absorption from 200 to 800 nm, which were suitable for the photoreduction application.After metalation of the porphyrin linkers with Zn, the visible-light absorption ability of the sample further improved.Inspired by their superior visible-light absorption and chemical stability, all the PCN-222-Zn samples were applied as photocatalysts for the reduction of CO 2 . All the photoreduction of CO 2 reactions on all PCN-222 samples were conducted under the visible-light irradiation.Previous research using Zr-MOFs as photocatalysts for photoreduction of CO 2 were normally studies in the acetonitrile solution.TEOA was used as scavenger and hydrogen donor as well, which was not eco-friendly.In our study, the photoreduction of CO 2 process was conducted in the aqueous solution with ethylene glycol used as scavenger.After 4 h reaction, the HCOO -was detected as the major product for all samples, trace H 2 and CH 4 were also found as the by-product.As shown in Fig. 6, the yield rate of HCOO -for the PCN-222 was 28.65 mol/g/h.After incorporation with the Zn in porphyrin, the highest yield rate of HCOO -(354.14mol/g/h) was achieved on 5 PCN-222-Zn.Compared to the reported value for Zr-MOFs photocatalysts in the various systems (Table 1 in Supplementary Information), it was notable that the 5 PCN-222-Zn exhibited a high catalytic activity.Blank experiments were designed to confirm the results of the catalytic reaction.Three control experiments were conducted as below: (a) 2 mg 25 PCN-222-Zn in 2 ml H 2 O (100 l ethylene glycol) purging with N 2 for 30 min under visible-light irradiation for 4 h (b) 2 mg 25 PCN-222-Zn in 2 ml H 2 O (100 l ethylene glycol) purging with CO 2 for 30 min without visible-light irradiation for 4 h (c) 2 mg 25 PCN-222-Zn in 2 ml MeCN (100 l TEOA) purging with CO 2 for 30 min under visiblelight irradiation for 4 h.Less than 5 mol/g/h of HCOO -was detected in blank experiment (c), suggesting that MeCN/ TEOA system was not suitable.Also, no products were obtained in blank experiment (a) and (b), indicating that CO 2 gas and visible-light irradiation were indispensable to the photoreduction reaction. To test the stability of the PCN-222-Zn, a recycle measurement was conducted.After 12 h reaction, the suspension was collected and filtrated.Later, we used the ICP-AES to check the supernatant.About 0.032 wt Zn 2 ions are found in the supernatant, indicating that a small part of the Zn 2 was leaching from the metallized porphyrin liners.As shown in Fig. S1, the morphology of 25 PCN-222-Zn did not change, suggesting the structure of MOF didn't collapse.Besides, the results of recycling tests demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst were very stable (Fig. S2).To verify our guess, the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra at 650 nm emission ( ex 450 nm) were conducted on all samples.As shown in Fig. 7, all the TRPL plots could be well fitted by bi-exponential function, and the calculated PL lifetimes for 5 PCN-222-Zn, 15 PCN-222-Zn, 25 PCN-222-Zn, and PCN-222 were 25.24 ns, 20.04 ns, 17.12 ns, and 3.80 ns.Normally, the long lifetime indicated the fast separation efficiency of electron-hole pair in catalysts 28.It can be found that the lifetime of the 25 PCN-222-Zn was obviously shorter compared to that of 5 PCN-222-Zn, which suggesting the excess Zn 2 ions in PCN-222 may became the electron-hole recombination center.To get a deep understanding of the mechanism for the improved photocatalytic activity of PCN-222-Zn, we combined the experimental results with reported research study together.Firstly, by using the Kubelka-Munk (KM) method, the band gaps of the PCN-222-Zn and PCN-222 were confirmed to be 1.54 eV and 1.82 eV (Fig. S3).Then the Mott-Schottky tests were conducted to get the conduction band (LUMO) of the PCN-222-Zn and PCN-222 (Fig. S3).As shown in Fig S3, the more negative potential of LUMO in PCN-222-Zn than that of PCN-222 indicated a more thermodynamic favorable for the photoreduction of CO 2 to generate HCOO -.Given the dynamic, the PL spectra and lifetime confirmed the more efficient photoinduced carrier separation efficiency for PCN-222-Zn.Besides, the CO 2 uptake ability was considered as a crucial factor for the catalytic activity of the catalyst.The increased CO 2 adsorption volume in PCN-222-Zn can attribute to its high HCOO -conversion efficiency.Some DFT calculation results also verify the strong affinity between unsaturated metal ions in porphyrin and the CO 2 molecular 29.Interestingly, a few research groups found the electron trapping and transfer in unsaturated transition metal sites in porphyrin due to the variable valance of transition metal ions.In our case, the directly excited electrons from porphyrin in PCN-222-Zn can transfer to Zr 6 oxo cluster and unsaturated Zn(II) sites at the same time, which formed the dual catalytic routes.At last, the uncoordinated porphyrin rings can facilitate re-bonding of the broken Zn-N bonds during the reaction, which acts as a \"self-healing\" system 30,31.Compared to 25 PCN-222-Zn, 5 PCN-222-Zn has more uncoordinated porphyrin linkers that could help rebuild the dual-metal co-catalysts sites.Also, the doping amount of Zn 2 ions in 5 PCN-222-Zn would not be too much to become the photoinduced electron and holes recombination centre.A possible mechanism of dual catalytic routes for photoreduction of CO 2 over PCN-222-Zn was illustrated in Fig. 8."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "In a typical experiment 2 mg of catalyst was suspended in a 2 ml water solution containing 100 l ethylene glycol as scavenger in a 5 ml glass vial equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a septum screw cap.", "context": "ZrCl 4 ( 98), ZnCl 2 , tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)-porphyrin (TCPP), formic acid, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9), acetone and ethanol are all purchased from the Fisher Chemicals.All reagents are analytical grade without purification for the reaction.
