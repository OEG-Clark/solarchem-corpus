biopolymers: cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin.Cellulose is a linear homopolymer of -1,4-d-glucopyranose units (GUs), and three hydroxyl groups in each GU interact with one another to form chain configuration by intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds.Cellulose has five allomorphic crystalline forms designated as cellulose-I, -II, -III, -IV, and -V.Under NaOH hydrothermal conditions (100 C), only natural cellulose can be crystallized and transformed into cellulose-I, which belongs to the native cellulose crystalline with parallel chain orientation (Scheme 2), 51,52 while the other four allomorphs can be obtained only by artificial synthesis from cellulose-I.The distinctive characteristic for the natural cellulose crystalline (cellulose-I) would necessarily change original hydrothermal conditions and potentially create a special microenvironment for Ce(NO 3 ) 3 (ceria source) to nucleation and growth for the resulting CeO 2 nanocrystallines.It is therefore reasonable to conjecture that some transformation on the morphology would occur upon the resulting BC-Hs. Figure 1 records the XRD patterns of the resulting CeO 2 samples at different synthesis phases.After hydrothermal treatment at 180 C, followed by centrifugal separation and drying at 60 C (Figure 1a), LAP-H has two weak diffraction peaks at 2 14.83 and 22.02, respectively, corresponding to the (1 1 0) and (2 0 0) planes of the typical cellulose-I crystalline structure (JCPDS no: 03-0226). 52,53For RC-H, eight typical diffraction peaks with sharp and high intensities can be clearly seen at 2 28.53,33.12, 47.51, 56.38, 59.12, 69.43, 76.79, and 79.05, respectively, indexed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), (4 0 0), (3 3 1), and (4 2 0) planes of the CeO 2 crystal with a face-centered cubic fluorite structure (JCPDS no: 34-0394), indicative of its high crystallinity and crystallite size.For the BC-Hs prepared with increasing dosages of LAP from a 2-fold weight to a 20-fold weight of RC, the same diffraction peaks of CeO 2 can also be found, implying that there is no impurity in these samples.However, the intensities of these diffraction peaks diminish gradually in the sequence of BC-H2 BC-H5 BC-H10 Scheme 1. Schematic Illustration of the Preparation of BCs Scheme 2. Underlying Evolution Process for the BC-15 Nanorods with the Assistance of LAP BC-H15, and the changes in width of the diffraction peaks emerge in the reverse order accordingly.When the dosage of LAP is finally elevated to 20-fold, the intensities of the diffraction peaks for BC-H20 restore partly, and several diffraction peaks attributed to the hydrothermal intermediate of hexagonal Ce(OH) 3 can be observed at 2 15.85(10 0), 31.92(20 0), 40(2 0 1), and 49.32(1 0 2) (JCPDS no: 19-0284) as well. 54With Ce(NO 3 ) 3 and NaOH as precursors, the synthesis of CeO 2 nanocrystallines via the hydrothermal method at a hydrothermal temperature of 180 C often leads to the formation of CeO 2 nanocubes, exhibiting sharp and intense diffraction peaks with high crystallinity, 30,31,3637383940415556575859 similar to those of RC-H. In conast, the successive broadening and weakening diffraction peaks of the BC-Hs reflect their relatively poor crystalline nature with different crystallinities and decreased crystallite sizes, further confirming our conjecture on morphology transformation of CeO 2 nanocrystallines.In our case, NaOH acts not only as the precursor to obtain Ce(OH) 3 nuclei for the further formation of CeO 2 but also as the solubilizer to decompose LAP into cellulose and further crystallize it to cellulose-I.For BC-H2, -H5, and -H10 obtained from a relatively low dosage of LAP, the amount of cellulose-I generated from NaOH treatment increases with the increasing dosage of LAP; meanwhile, the NaOH concentration in the hydrothermal system is also sufficient to dissolve/recrystallize Ce(OH) 3 .Both ensure the suitable microenvironment for CeO 2 crystal plane regulation, and thus, the intensities of diffraction peaks for BC-H2, -H5, and -H10 vary with a decreasing trend.Clearly, NaOH is successively consumed by the increasing dosages of LAP, and the corresponding content of cellulose-I reaches a just-match point as the dosage of LAP up to 15-fold, which can potentially afford the full microenvironment to regulate the growth of the CeO 2 crystal plane.Although addition of more LAP (20-fold) is beneficial to further increase the yield of cellulose-I, the excessive consumption of NaOH leads to a low NaOH concentration left.With the same synthesis process, Yan et al. ever reported that the rate of dissolution/recrystallization of Ce(OH) 3 is quite slow under low NaOH concentrations.CeO 2 nH 2 O is harvested just by air oxidization of Ce(OH) 3 nanocrystallines from Ce 3 to Ce 4 during the drying procedure.54 Therefore, the diffraction peaks of Ce(OH) 3 are visible on BC-H20, indicating that part of Ce(OH) 3 is excluded from the cellulose-I-regulated microenvironment as compared with the other BC-Hs, which cause the intensity bounce of the diffraction peaks.Of particular note, both hemicelluloses (H) and lignin (L) are amorphous in nature and dissolvable in NaOH solution without crystallization, and they can be leached out after the centrifugal separation step.60 Therefore, no assignable diffraction peaks of them are found.This reveals that the existence of hemicelluloses and lignin in the hydrothermal system has no effect on the cellulose-Iregulated microenvironment for growth of the CeO 2 crystal plane. After calcining at 450 C (Figure 1b), all the BC-Hs (CeO 2 nH 2 O) are further dehydrated to the BCs (CeO 2 ).In line with those of the BC-Hs, the intensity and width of diffraction peaks on the BCs show similar patterns of change.With the weakest and widest diffraction peaks, BC-15 has the smallest crystallinity value of 58.3 calculated from the Scherrer equation with the strongest (1 1 1) diffraction peak, implying the lowest crystallization degree and most structural defects it possesses compared with the other samples.In contrast, RC shows the strongest diffraction peaks due to the improvement of the crystallinity of CeO 2 nanocubes at the higher temperature of 450 C.In addition, no obvious broad diffraction peaks assigned to amorphous carbon (23 and 42) are visible on these samples other than BC-20, suggesting that cellulose-I in the BC-Hs is either not transformed into carbon (hydrochar) or transformed into carbon initially and burnt out subsequently during the calcining treatment in air.The broad amorphous peak from 15 to 35on BC-20 appears to verify the latter with the characteristic of amorphous carbon.This possibly originates from the overwhelming addition of LAP in the synthesis of BC-20, and the remanent carbonaceous organic matters are carbonized and burnt at a relatively low temperature of 450 C. Figure 2 illustrates the representative TEM images to further get insight into the conceivable evolution on the morphology and microstructure of RC-H and BC-Hs.It is clearly seen in Figure 2a that RC-H displays well-defined square-shaped nanocubes with an average length of a side of 50 nm, in good coherence with the XRD results (Figure 1a).After the introduction of LAP into the precursors for CeO 2 with increasing dosages from a 2-fold weight to a 20-fold weight of RC, noticeable transformation on the morphology and microstructure of the corresponding products can be observed.For the relatively low dosages of LAP, some small-sized nanocubes and nanoparticles with irregular shapes are well visible for BC-H2 (Figure 2b); moreover, little rodlike nanoparticles begin to emerge for BC-H5 (Figure 2c), substantiating that cellulose-I commences to function on regulating the growth microenvironment for CeO 2 nanocrystallines.After the dosage of LAP is increased to 10-fold, almost all nanocubes transform into irregular nanoparticles and no nanocubes can be found any more; meanwhile, more nanoparticles cluster together to form nanorods for BC-H10 (Figure 2d), implying that the regulatory function is enhanced with the increasing amount of cellulose-I.The amount of nanorods further increases with almost complete disappearance of the nanoparticles as the dosage of LAP is increased to 15-fold (Figure 2e).The nanorods are measured with an average diameter of 9 nm and the length varying from 10 to 80 nm.When the dosage of LAP is finally increased to 20-fold, some nanoparticles with small sizes are formed again, similar to those in BC-H10 (Figure 2f).All the stepwise observations well interpret the morphological evolution process of the BC-Hs and further solidify that the introduction of LAP into the precursor for CeO 2 plays a crucial role on regulating the morphology and microstructure of the products.After calcining at 450 C, the morphology of the screening hydrothermal product among the BC-Hs (BC-15) as well as that of the reference sample (RC) is further observed by TEM.From Figure 3a, it can be seen that RC presents regular nanocubes with an average length of a side of 60 nm, somewhat larger than that of RC-H, while BC-15 still maintains as nanorods with an average diameter of 7 nm and an average length of 20 nm (Figure 3b), which is less than those of BC-H15 harvested after hydrothermal treatment at 180 C.It is widely acknowledged that the higher the treated temperature, the easier the sintering and agglomeration of metal oxide crystals to occur.As a result, a larger crystallite size can be obtained.However, the opposite phenomenon is observed for BC-15 in our case.Evidently, the existence of cellulose-I exerts some effect on confining the sintering and agglomeration of BC-H15 to grow up to a larger crystallite size during the calcination, which is quite consistent with the results of XRD characterization.Further inspection of the HR-TEM investigation on BC-15 reveals that the interplanar spacings between two adjacent lattice planes of the nanorods are measured approximately to be 0.27,0.19, and 0.31 nm, which are quite consistent with the (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (1 1 1) crystal planes of CeO 2 , respectively (Figure 3c). Figure 3d depicts the typical selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of BC-15.Different diffraction rings in SAED correspond to the different lattice planes.One can see the clear (2 0 0) and (1 1 1) diffraction rings of CeO 2 , and a relatively indistinct (3 1 1) diffraction ring can also be identified.In addition, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of BC-15 illustrates the uniformly distributed nanorod morphology (Figure S1), in agreement with its TEM investigation.All these observations further corroborate the successful synthesis of CeO 2 nanorods with the assistance of LAP.Although it is still unclear how the morphology transformation from nanocubes to nanorods and the confinement of size enlargement of CeO 2 nanocrystallines occur, in association with the experimental results, we speculate on an underlying evolution process, as illustrated in Scheme 2. LAP undergoes decomposition into various sizes of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, and subsequently crystallization by NaOH to cellulose-I, whose parallel chain orientation is supposed to not only provide a quasi-tubular confinement space to shape the ceria source into nanorods during hydrothermal-drying processes but also restrain the nanorod growth during the calcination.Indeed, the growth of CeO 2 nanocrystallines under hydrothermal treatment is always very complicated.In the presence of NaOH and cellulose, the crystallization process of the ceria source and dissolution/ recrystallization of the intermediate might experience some unpredictable changes.This issue therefore deserves to be further explored. To monitor the surface functional groups and their intrinsic information regarding dispersion, FTIR spectra data are obtained for RC and BCs.As shown in Figure 4, the peak positions of the BCs are the same as those of RC in the overall wavenumber region, indicating that the surface functional groups of the BCs almost remain unchanged after the introduction of LAP.The peak at 3400 cm -1 is assigned to the -OH stretching vibration, and the multipeaks between 1570 and 1400 cm -1 represent the bending vibration mode of the physically adsorbed water (O-H) molecules.In the lowwavenumber region, two peaks appearing at 560 and 460 cm -1 stand for the vibrations of Ce-O (III) and Ce-O (IV) bands, respectively. 61These results demonstrate that the surfaces of BCs are rich in oxygen-containing functional groups, which are beneficial to conducting further reaction with CO 2 . XPS is conducted to further elucidate the surface elemental compositions and valence states in RC and BC-15.In the wide XPS survey spectra (Figure 5a), there are three predominant peaks at around 300 eV (Ce 4s), 530 eV (O 1s), and 900 eV (Ce 3d), indicating the existence of Ce and O atoms without evidence of impurities.In the high-resolution scan of the two samples (Figure 5b), the multipeak Ce 3d spectra can be divided into six individual peaks.The further deconvolution of these peaks derives eight characteristic peaks at the binding energies of 882.6, 885.0, 889.2, 898.3, 901.3, 903.2, 907.7, and 917.1 eV. 39The peaks at 885.0 and 903.2 eV are ascribed to Ce 3 and the other six are assigned to Ce 4 , which reveal the coexistence of Ce 4 and Ce 3 .It is well established that the Ce 3 proportion is labeled as the amount of oxygen vacancies (O v ) on CeO 2 surfaces, which are the major defects of CeO 2 catalysts and often act as valuable reactive sites for catalytic reactions. 62From the peak areas of Ce 3 and Ce 4 signals, we calculate the proportion of surface Ce 3 based on the equation Ce 3 /(Ce 3 Ce 4 ), and the results show that the Ce 3 concentration on the BC (22.3) is higher than that on RC (13.1), suggesting that BC-15 possesses more amount of O v than RC.In order to further clarify the O v information in the two samples, the O 1s spectra of the BC and RC are fitted in Figure 5c.From the deconvoluted spectra, three types of O 1s (O, O, and O) peaks are observed at 529.3, 529.9, and 531.7 eV, corresponding to the lattice oxygen (O), chemisorbed oxygen (O), and weakly bound oxygen (O), respectively. 63It is known that the O v concentration can be described from the peak areas of the three oxygen species signals by the equation (O O)/(O O O), 64 and the calculated proportions of the O v concentration on the two samples are 45.5 (BC-15) and 35.7 (RC), respectively, also verifying the markedly increased amount of O v on BC-15 and coinciding well with the result from the Ce 3d signals.In addition, Raman spectra are applied on O v in the samples (Figure 5d).Both BC and RC exhibit two adsorption bands at 458 and 592 cm -1 , indicative of the symmetrical vibration (F 2g ) of the O atoms around the central Ce 4 and defectinduced (D) modes of the cubic CeO 2 fluoride phase for Ce 3 , respectively.The intensity ratio of the D to F 2g bands (I D /I F 2g ) is regarded as an indicator for the concentration of O v . 34The calculated values of I D /I F2g are 0.43 (BC-15) and 0.22 (RC), The textural properties of RC and BC-15 are analyzed by N 2 -sorption characterization.As shown in Figure 6a, RC and BC-15 display a type II isotherm but with different types of hysteresis loops.For RC, the adsorption and desorption branches of the isotherm almost coincide at the P/P 0 from 0 to 0.9.At high P/P 0 from 0.95 to 1.0, the adsorption branch increases rapidly with an obvious H3-type hysteresis loop without a clear adsorption plateau at P/P 0 approaching 1.0, a feature of a tendency to a macroporous range. 65,66BC-15 has a similar H3-type hysteresis loop to RC for macropores but with a clear H2-type hysteresis loop at the increasing P/P 0 from 0.4 to 0.9, which is correlated to the capillary condensation, characteristic of mesopores of a variety of sizes.The PSD of the two samples also confirms this point (inset of Figure 6a).BC-15 presents a relatively narrow PSD centered at 17 nm and a low portion PSD more than 50 nm, while RC shows an almost backward tendency with little mesoporosity but much macroporosity distribution.It deserves to be mentioned that the peak intensity of PSD for BC-15 in the mesoporous range is much higher than that for RC, indicating the relatively high proportion of mesopores of BC-15.After the just-right regulation of the microenvironment by LAP for the growth of CeO 2 crystal planes, the resulting BC-15 nanorods possess an enhanced SSA of 117.7 m 2 g -1 , which greatly transcends not only that of RC (51.9 m 2 g -1 ) but also those of the previously reported CeO 2 nanorod counterparts synthesized with Ce-(NO 3 ) 3 and NaOH as precursors by the hydrothermal method under different conditions (62, 30 86.4, 31 83.6, 34 69, 35 68, 36 90, 38 67.1, 39 82.3, 41 112, 55 and 69.7 66 m 2 g -1 ).This is presumedly caused by the introduction of LAP in the precursors which not only leads to the growth of the CeO 2 crystal to nanorods but also forms more interstitial spaces between the agglomerated CeO 2 nanorods.As a result, the SSA of BC-15 is remarkably increased.Generally, the larger the SSA, the more the active sites for a photocatalyst accordingly.CO 2 adsorption on a photocatalyst occurs prior to the reduction reaction.To figure out this, we perform CO 2 -TPD investigation to assess the CO 2 adsorption capacity of RC and BC-15.As shown in Figure 6b, the TPD profiles of RC and BC-15 show a similar broad desorption range with a centered peak at 650 C, suggesting that CO 2 molecules bind strongly with the two samples.Meanwhile, the desorption intensity of BC-15 is obviously higher than that of RC, confirming the more active sites of BC-15 and thus leading to more CO 2 molecules absorbed to participate in the reduction reaction.On the other hand, it is reported that ceria surfaces with more defect sites or vacancies are conductive to absorb more CO 2 .Combined with the XPS and Raman results (Figure 5), the more amount of O v on BC-15 could be another headstream for the large amount of CO 2 absorption.The above results prove that the introduction of LAP during the synthesis of CeO 2 in our case can effectively regulate the shape of CeO 2 nanocrystals, afford more usable active sites, and further boost CO 2 adsorption capacity for potential promotion of CO 2 photoreduction performance.The optical absorption properties of RC and BC-15 are investigated by UV-vis DRS, as displayed in Figure 7a.Both of them exhibit obviously visible harvest ability.However, BC-15 possesses significantly enhanced optical absorption compared to RC within the wavelength range of 200-800 nm.Meanwhile, the absorption edge of BC-15 is red-shifted evidently compared with that of RC, suggesting that BC-15 synthesized by the introduction of LAP broadens the light response range with higher visible light harvest ability, in favor of improving photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.In addition, the band gap values of the two samples are extrapolated according to M. A. Butler's research method. 56y the Tauc plot with the equation of h A (h -E g ) 1/2 , the calculated values are 2.5 and 2.2 eV for RC and BC-15, respectively, as shown in Figure 7b.This phenomenon demonstrates that BC-15 can narrow down the width of the band gap, which thus makes more efficient utilization of the solar spectrum and consequently more photoinduced charge generation to obtain enhanced CO 2 photoreduction performance. To better elucidate the photoresponse properties and migration behavior of charge carriers of RC and BC-15, photocurrent response and EIS experiments are conducted.Figure 8a indicates the photocurrent response curves of RC and BC-15 under visible light irradiation.Generally, the higher photocurrent value correlates to the higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated charges in photocatalyst possesses.Obviously, the photocurrent of BC-15 is 1.6-fold stronger than that of RC.The enhanced photocurrent of BC-15 originates possibly from its more compact stacking of the smaller-size nanorods than the relative sparse stacking of the larger-size nanocubes of RC, which can significantly increase the electron-transfer rate and inhibit the electron-hole recombination to achieve superior photocatalytic performance.In good accordance with the results of photocurrent responses, the EIS profiles in Figure 8b show that BC-15 has a much smaller fitted diameter of the semicircle than that of RC, further confirming the better electron-transfer rate and the lower recombination rate of charge carriers, which is conductive to further enhance CO 2 photoreduction performance. As is well known, the intensity of PL emission reflects indirectly the separation degree of photogenerated carriers of a photocatalyst. 67,68Figure S3 records PL spectra of RC and BC-15.It can be seen that both of them exhibit strong emission peaks centered at 442 nm, while BC-15 has a weaker peak than RC.In general, the lower PL spectra intensity implies the faster transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers on a semiconductor surface.Therefore, such a PL result of BC-15 suggests that there would be slower recombination of the electron-hole pairs with more available electrons and holes participating in CO 2 photoreduction.In association with the results of CO 2 -TPD, UV-vis absorption spectra, and photocurrent response, BC-15 synthesized with the assistance of LAP in our case is evidently endowed with excellent photoelectrical properties and hence would potentially give rise to superior CO 2 photoreduction behaviors. 3.2.Photocatalytic Evaluations.In order to clarify the activity of different CeO 2 samples, the photocatalytic behaviors of the CeO 2 photocatalysts are evaluated by reduction of CO 2 with water under visible light at a wavelength of 420 nm.For RC and BCs, the main reduction product of CO is totally found.The other potential products such as CH 4 or HCOOH are not detected.Figure 9 presents CO evolution performance over RC and BCs within a reaction time of 6 h.It is found that the CO evolution amount of all the photocatalysts increases with the increasing reaction time.RC exhibits the lowest CO evolution amount of 17.15 mol g -1 at 6 h, while all the BCs deliver the higher ones.Among them, BC-15 generates the highest CO evolution amount of 21.13 mol g -1 at a reaction time of 1 h, much higher than those of some previously reported CeO 2 -based photocatalysts under the same reaction conditions (Table S1).Clearly, the LAP-assisted synthesis endows CeO 2 (BCs) with superior photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.The dosage of LAP introduced into the precursor for the BC is a key factor to determine the final photocatalytic activity of the resulting product.The BCs synthesized with more or insufficient amounts of LAP (BC-5, BC-10, and BC-20) lead to a relatively lower CO yield, which is probably caused by some limited (BC-5 and BC-10) or overwhelming (BC-20) regulation of plane growth of formed CeO 2 during the BC synthesis.As discussed in XRD and TEM characterizations, only when the introduction amount of LAP gets fitly to an appropriate point, the formed CeO 2 (BC-15) would grow to the efficient nanorods which possess the most active sites and structure defects, visible light harvest ability, and optimal separation efficiency of photogenerated electronhole pairs.As a result, the resulting BC-15 can achieve the highest photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.In addition, the photocatalytic stability is further evaluated, and the corresponding recycling test of BC-15 is shown in Figure S4.After four cycles, the final yield of CO only has a slight drop from 126.8 to 112.4 mol g -1 , indicating the excellent photostability of BC-15 during reaction time.The structure of used BC-15 shows no significant changes compared with the fresh one, suggesting its structural stability against photocorrosion (Figures S5 andS6).To trace the origin of the carbon source in CO, we conduct a control isotopic experiment with 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 as a feedstock for BC-15 under identical reaction conditions, which is analyzed through the combination of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-7920 and MS-5975).As shown in Figure S7, the peak at m/z 29 in MS can be assigned to 13 CO, well confirming that the production of CO exactly originates from the introduced 13 CO 2 and excluding its potential possibility from the oxidation of carbon. 3.3.Mechanism of Photocatalytic Reduction of CO 2 .Based on the results of the characterization and photocatalytic evaluations, the activity enhancement of BC-15 can be attributed to the light sensitization and band regulation which lead to highly efficient separation of holes (h ) at the valence band (VB) and excited electrons (e -) at the conduction band (CB).A possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism of BC-15 is illustrated in Figure 10.Based on the data from the XPS measurements, the VB of BC-15 is determined at about 1.62 eV (Figure S2).The measured band gap energy of BC-15 is 2.2 eV (Figure 7b).The CB of BC-15 can be calculated accordingly using the following equation: E CB E VB -E g .Therefore, the CB and VB positions of BC-15 are -0.58 and 1.62 eV, respectively.The reduction potential for CO 2 to CO (E CO 2 /CO) is -0.53 eV. 40Therefore, BC-15 meets the energy requirement for the reduction of CO 2 to CO.Meanwhile, at the VB of BC-15, H 2 O molecules are oxidized by h to generate O 2 and protons, and CO 2 molecules are reduced to CO by e -at the CB of BC-15 with the assistance of the protons.

Figure 1 records the XRD patterns of the resulting CeO 2 samples at different synthesis phases.After hydrothermal treatment at 180 C, followed by centrifugal separation and drying at 60 C (Figure 1a), LAP-H has two weak diffraction peaks at 2 14.83 and 22.02, respectively, corresponding to the (1 1 0) and (2 0 0) planes of the typical cellulose-I crystalline structure (JCPDS no: 03-0226). 52,53For RC-H, eight typical diffraction peaks with sharp and high intensities can be clearly seen at 2 28.53,33.12, 47.51, 56.38, 59.12, 69.43, 76.79, and 79.05, respectively, indexed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), (4 0 0), (3 3 1), and (4 2 0) planes of the CeO 2 crystal with a face-centered cubic fluorite structure (JCPDS no: 34-0394), indicative of its high crystallinity and crystallite size.For the BC-Hs prepared with increasing dosages of LAP from a 2-fold weight to a 20-fold weight of RC, the same diffraction peaks of CeO 2 can also be found, implying that there is no impurity in these samples.However, the intensities of these diffraction peaks diminish gradually in the sequence of BC-H2 BC-H5 BC-H10 Scheme 1. Schematic Illustration of the Preparation of BCs Scheme 2. Underlying Evolution Process for the BC-15 Nanorods with the Assistance of LAP BC-H15, and the changes in width of the diffraction peaks emerge in the reverse order accordingly.When the dosage of LAP is finally elevated to 20-fold, the intensities of the diffraction peaks for BC-H20 restore partly, and several diffraction peaks attributed to the hydrothermal intermediate of hexagonal Ce(OH) 3 can be observed at 2 15.85(10 0), 31.92(20 0), 40(2 0 1), and 49.32(1 0 2) (JCPDS no: 19-0284) as well. 54With Ce(NO 3 ) 3 and NaOH as precursors, the synthesis of CeO 2 nanocrystallines via the hydrothermal method at a hydrothermal temperature of 180 C often leads to the formation of CeO 2 nanocubes, exhibiting sharp and intense diffraction peaks with high crystallinity, 30,31,3637383940415556575859 similar to those of RC-H. In conast, the successive broadening and weakening diffraction peaks of the BC-Hs reflect their relatively poor crystalline nature with different crystallinities and decreased crystallite sizes, further confirming our conjecture on morphology transformation of CeO 2 nanocrystallines.In our case, NaOH acts not only as the precursor to obtain Ce(OH) 3 nuclei for the further formation of CeO 2 but also as the solubilizer to decompose LAP into cellulose and further crystallize it to cellulose-I.For BC-H2, -H5, and -H10 obtained from a relatively low dosage of LAP, the amount of cellulose-I generated from NaOH treatment increases with the increasing dosage of LAP; meanwhile, the NaOH concentration in the hydrothermal system is also sufficient to dissolve/recrystallize Ce(OH) 3 .Both ensure the suitable microenvironment for CeO 2 crystal plane regulation, and thus, the intensities of diffraction peaks for BC-H2, -H5, and -H10 vary with a decreasing trend.Clearly, NaOH is successively consumed by the increasing dosages of LAP, and the corresponding content of cellulose-I reaches a just-match point as the dosage of LAP up to 15-fold, which can potentially afford the full microenvironment to regulate the growth of the CeO 2 crystal plane.Although addition of more LAP (20-fold) is beneficial to further increase the yield of cellulose-I, the excessive consumption of NaOH leads to a low NaOH concentration left.With the same synthesis process, Yan et al. ever reported that the rate of dissolution/recrystallization of Ce(OH) 3 is quite slow under low NaOH concentrations.CeO 2 nH 2 O is harvested just by air oxidization of Ce(OH) 3 nanocrystallines from Ce 3 to Ce 4 during the drying procedure.54 Therefore, the diffraction peaks of Ce(OH) 3 are visible on BC-H20, indicating that part of Ce(OH) 3 is excluded from the cellulose-I-regulated microenvironment as compared with the other BC-Hs, which cause the intensity bounce of the diffraction peaks.Of particular note, both hemicelluloses (H) and lignin (L) are amorphous in nature and dissolvable in NaOH solution without crystallization, and they can be leached out after the centrifugal separation step.60 Therefore, no assignable diffraction peaks of them are found.This reveals that the existence of hemicelluloses and lignin in the hydrothermal system has no effect on the cellulose-Iregulated microenvironment for growth of the CeO 2 crystal plane. After calcining at 450 C (Figure 1b), all the BC-Hs (CeO 2 nH 2 O) are further dehydrated to the BCs (CeO 2 ).In line with those of the BC-Hs, the intensity and width of diffraction peaks on the BCs show similar patterns of change.With the weakest and widest diffraction peaks, BC-15 has the smallest crystallinity value of 58.3 calculated from the Scherrer equation with the strongest (1 1 1) diffraction peak, implying the lowest crystallization degree and most structural defects it possesses compared with the other samples.In contrast, RC shows the strongest diffraction peaks due to the improvement of the crystallinity of CeO 2 nanocubes at the higher temperature of 450 C.In addition, no obvious broad diffraction peaks assigned to amorphous carbon (23 and 42) are visible on these samples other than BC-20, suggesting that cellulose-I in the BC-Hs is either not transformed into carbon (hydrochar) or transformed into carbon initially and burnt out subsequently during the calcining treatment in air.The broad amorphous peak from 15 to 35on BC-20 appears to verify the latter with the characteristic of amorphous carbon.This possibly originates from the overwhelming addition of LAP in the synthesis of BC-20, and the remanent carbonaceous organic matters are carbonized and burnt at a relatively low temperature of 450 C. Figure 2 illustrates the representative TEM images to further get insight into the conceivable evolution on the morphology and microstructure of RC-H and BC-Hs.It is clearly seen in Figure 2a that RC-H displays well-defined square-shaped nanocubes with an average length of a side of 50 nm, in good coherence with the XRD results (Figure 1a).After the introduction of LAP into the precursors for CeO 2 with increasing dosages from a 2-fold weight to a 20-fold weight of RC, noticeable transformation on the morphology and microstructure of the corresponding products can be observed.For the relatively low dosages of LAP, some small-sized nanocubes and nanoparticles with irregular shapes are well visible for BC-H2 (Figure 2b); moreover, little rodlike nanoparticles begin to emerge for BC-H5 (Figure 2c), substantiating that cellulose-I commences to function on regulating the growth microenvironment for CeO 2 nanocrystallines.After the dosage of LAP is increased to 10-fold, almost all nanocubes transform into irregular nanoparticles and no nanocubes can be found any more; meanwhile, more nanoparticles cluster together to form nanorods for BC-H10 (Figure 2d), implying that the regulatory function is enhanced with the increasing amount of cellulose-I.The amount of nanorods further increases with almost complete disappearance of the nanoparticles as the dosage of LAP is increased to 15-fold (Figure 2e).The nanorods are measured with an average diameter of 9 nm and the length varying from 10 to 80 nm.When the dosage of LAP is finally increased to 20-fold, some nanoparticles with small sizes are formed again, similar to those in BC-H10 (Figure 2f).All the stepwise observations well interpret the morphological evolution process of the BC-Hs and further solidify that the introduction of LAP into the precursor for CeO 2 plays a crucial role on regulating the morphology and microstructure of the products.After calcining at 450 C, the morphology of the screening hydrothermal product among the BC-Hs (BC-15) as well as that of the reference sample (RC) is further observed by TEM.From Figure 3a, it can be seen that RC presents regular nanocubes with an average length of a side of 60 nm, somewhat larger than that of RC-H, while BC-15 still maintains as nanorods with an average diameter of 7 nm and an average length of 20 nm (Figure 3b), which is less than those of BC-H15 harvested after hydrothermal treatment at 180 C.It is widely acknowledged that the higher the treated temperature, the easier the sintering and agglomeration of metal oxide crystals to occur.As a result, a larger crystallite size can be obtained.However, the opposite phenomenon is observed for BC-15 in our case.Evidently, the existence of cellulose-I exerts some effect on confining the sintering and agglomeration of BC-H15 to grow up to a larger crystallite size during the calcination, which is quite consistent with the results of XRD characterization.Further inspection of the HR-TEM investigation on BC-15 reveals that the interplanar spacings between two adjacent lattice planes of the nanorods are measured approximately to be 0.27,0.19, and 0.31 nm, which are quite consistent with the (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (1 1 1) crystal planes of CeO 2 , respectively (Figure 3c). Figure 3d depicts the typical selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of BC-15.Different diffraction rings in SAED correspond to the different lattice planes.One can see the clear (2 0 0) and (1 1 1) diffraction rings of CeO 2 , and a relatively indistinct (3 1 1) diffraction ring can also be identified.In addition, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of BC-15 illustrates the uniformly distributed nanorod morphology (Figure S1), in agreement with its TEM investigation.All these observations further corroborate the successful synthesis of CeO 2 nanorods with the assistance of LAP.Although it is still unclear how the morphology transformation from nanocubes to nanorods and the confinement of size enlargement of CeO 2 nanocrystallines occur, in association with the experimental results, we speculate on an underlying evolution process, as illustrated in Scheme 2. LAP undergoes decomposition into various sizes of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, and subsequently crystallization by NaOH to cellulose-I, whose parallel chain orientation is supposed to not only provide a quasi-tubular confinement space to shape the ceria source into nanorods during hydrothermal-drying processes but also restrain the nanorod growth during the calcination.Indeed, the growth of CeO 2 nanocrystallines under hydrothermal treatment is always very complicated.In the presence of NaOH and cellulose, the crystallization process of the ceria source and dissolution/ recrystallization of the intermediate might experience some unpredictable changes.This issue therefore deserves to be further explored. To monitor the surface functional groups and their intrinsic information regarding dispersion, FTIR spectra data are obtained for RC and BCs.As shown in Figure 4, the peak positions of the BCs are the same as those of RC in the overall wavenumber region, indicating that the surface functional groups of the BCs almost remain unchanged after the introduction of LAP.The peak at 3400 cm -1 is assigned to the -OH stretching vibration, and the multipeaks between 1570 and 1400 cm -1 represent the bending vibration mode of the physically adsorbed water (O-H) molecules.In the lowwavenumber region, two peaks appearing at 560 and 460 cm -1 stand for the vibrations of Ce-O (III) and Ce-O (IV) bands, respectively. 61These results demonstrate that the surfaces of BCs are rich in oxygen-containing functional groups, which are beneficial to conducting further reaction with CO 2 . XPS is conducted to further elucidate the surface elemental compositions and valence states in RC and BC-15.In the wide XPS survey spectra (Figure 5a), there are three predominant peaks at around 300 eV (Ce 4s), 530 eV (O 1s), and 900 eV (Ce 3d), indicating the existence of Ce and O atoms without evidence of impurities.In the high-resolution scan of the two samples (Figure 5b), the multipeak Ce 3d spectra can be divided into six individual peaks.The further deconvolution of these peaks derives eight characteristic peaks at the binding energies of 882.6, 885.0, 889.2, 898.3, 901.3, 903.2, 907.7, and 917.1 eV. 39The peaks at 885.0 and 903.2 eV are ascribed to Ce 3 and the other six are assigned to Ce 4 , which reveal the coexistence of Ce 4 and Ce 3 .It is well established that the Ce 3 proportion is labeled as the amount of oxygen vacancies (O v ) on CeO 2 surfaces, which are the major defects of CeO 2 catalysts and often act as valuable reactive sites for catalytic reactions. 62From the peak areas of Ce 3 and Ce 4 signals, we calculate the proportion of surface Ce 3 based on the equation Ce 3 /(Ce 3 Ce 4 ), and the results show that the Ce 3 concentration on the BC (22.3) is higher than that on RC (13.1), suggesting that BC-15 possesses more amount of O v than RC.In order to further clarify the O v information in the two samples, the O 1s spectra of the BC and RC are fitted in Figure 5c.From the deconvoluted spectra, three types of O 1s (O, O, and O) peaks are observed at 529.3, 529.9, and 531.7 eV, corresponding to the lattice oxygen (O), chemisorbed oxygen (O), and weakly bound oxygen (O), respectively. 63It is known that the O v concentration can be described from the peak areas of the three oxygen species signals by the equation (O O)/(O O O), 64 and the calculated proportions of the O v concentration on the two samples are 45.5 (BC-15) and 35.7 (RC), respectively, also verifying the markedly increased amount of O v on BC-15 and coinciding well with the result from the Ce 3d signals.In addition, Raman spectra are applied on O v in the samples (Figure 5d).Both BC and RC exhibit two adsorption bands at 458 and 592 cm -1 , indicative of the symmetrical vibration (F 2g ) of the O atoms around the central Ce 4 and defectinduced (D) modes of the cubic CeO 2 fluoride phase for Ce 3 , respectively.The intensity ratio of the D to F 2g bands (I D /I F 2g ) is regarded as an indicator for the concentration of O v . 34The calculated values of I D /I F2g are 0.43 (BC-15) and 0.22 (RC), The textural properties of RC and BC-15 are analyzed by N 2 -sorption characterization.As shown in Figure 6a, RC and BC-15 display a type II isotherm but with different types of hysteresis loops.For RC, the adsorption and desorption branches of the isotherm almost coincide at the P/P 0 from 0 to 0.9.At high P/P 0 from 0.95 to 1.0, the adsorption branch increases rapidly with an obvious H3-type hysteresis loop without a clear adsorption plateau at P/P 0 approaching 1.0, a feature of a tendency to a macroporous range. 65,66BC-15 has a similar H3-type hysteresis loop to RC for macropores but with a clear H2-type hysteresis loop at the increasing P/P 0 from 0.4 to 0.9, which is correlated to the capillary condensation, characteristic of mesopores of a variety of sizes.The PSD of the two samples also confirms this point (inset of Figure 6a).BC-15 presents a relatively narrow PSD centered at 17 nm and a low portion PSD more than 50 nm, while RC shows an almost backward tendency with little mesoporosity but much macroporosity distribution.It deserves to be mentioned that the peak intensity of PSD for BC-15 in the mesoporous range is much higher than that for RC, indicating the relatively high proportion of mesopores of BC-15.After the just-right regulation of the microenvironment by LAP for the growth of CeO 2 crystal planes, the resulting BC-15 nanorods possess an enhanced SSA of 117.7 m 2 g -1 , which greatly transcends not only that of RC (51.9 m 2 g -1 ) but also those of the previously reported CeO 2 nanorod counterparts synthesized with Ce-(NO 3 ) 3 and NaOH as precursors by the hydrothermal method under different conditions (62, 30 86.4, 31 83.6, 34 69, 35 68, 36 90, 38 67.1, 39 82.3, 41 112, 55 and 69.7 66 m 2 g -1 ).This is presumedly caused by the introduction of LAP in the precursors which not only leads to the growth of the CeO 2 crystal to nanorods but also forms more interstitial spaces between the agglomerated CeO 2 nanorods.As a result, the SSA of BC-15 is remarkably increased.Generally, the larger the SSA, the more the active sites for a photocatalyst accordingly.CO 2 adsorption on a photocatalyst occurs prior to the reduction reaction.To figure out this, we perform CO 2 -TPD investigation to assess the CO 2 adsorption capacity of RC and BC-15.As shown in Figure 6b, the TPD profiles of RC and BC-15 show a similar broad desorption range with a centered peak at 650 C, suggesting that CO 2 molecules bind strongly with the two samples.Meanwhile, the desorption intensity of BC-15 is obviously higher than that of RC, confirming the more active sites of BC-15 and thus leading to more CO 2 molecules absorbed to participate in the reduction reaction.On the other hand, it is reported that ceria surfaces with more defect sites or vacancies are conductive to absorb more CO 2 .Combined with the XPS and Raman results (Figure 5), the more amount of O v on BC-15 could be another headstream for the large amount of CO 2 absorption.The above results prove that the introduction of LAP during the synthesis of CeO 2 in our case can effectively regulate the shape of CeO 2 nanocrystals, afford more usable active sites, and further boost CO 2 adsorption capacity for potential promotion of CO 2 photoreduction performance.The optical absorption properties of RC and BC-15 are investigated by UV-vis DRS, as displayed in Figure 7a.Both of them exhibit obviously visible harvest ability.However, BC-15 possesses significantly enhanced optical absorption compared to RC within the wavelength range of 200-800 nm.Meanwhile, the absorption edge of BC-15 is red-shifted evidently compared with that of RC, suggesting that BC-15 synthesized by the introduction of LAP broadens the light response range with higher visible light harvest ability, in favor of improving photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.In addition, the band gap values of the two samples are extrapolated according to M. A. Butler's research method. 56y the Tauc plot with the equation of h A (h -E g ) 1/2 , the calculated values are 2.5 and 2.2 eV for RC and BC-15, respectively, as shown in Figure 7b.This phenomenon demonstrates that BC-15 can narrow down the width of the band gap, which thus makes more efficient utilization of the solar spectrum and consequently more photoinduced charge generation to obtain enhanced CO 2 photoreduction performance. To better elucidate the photoresponse properties and migration behavior of charge carriers of RC and BC-15, photocurrent response and EIS experiments are conducted.Figure 8a indicates the photocurrent response curves of RC and BC-15 under visible light irradiation.Generally, the higher photocurrent value correlates to the higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated charges in photocatalyst possesses.Obviously, the photocurrent of BC-15 is 1.6-fold stronger than that of RC.The enhanced photocurrent of BC-15 originates possibly from its more compact stacking of the smaller-size nanorods than the relative sparse stacking of the larger-size nanocubes of RC, which can significantly increase the electron-transfer rate and inhibit the electron-hole recombination to achieve superior photocatalytic performance.In good accordance with the results of photocurrent responses, the EIS profiles in Figure 8b show that BC-15 has a much smaller fitted diameter of the semicircle than that of RC, further confirming the better electron-transfer rate and the lower recombination rate of charge carriers, which is conductive to further enhance CO 2 photoreduction performance. As is well known, the intensity of PL emission reflects indirectly the separation degree of photogenerated carriers of a photocatalyst. 67,68Figure S3 records PL spectra of RC and BC-15.It can be seen that both of them exhibit strong emission peaks centered at 442 nm, while BC-15 has a weaker peak than RC.In general, the lower PL spectra intensity implies the faster transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers on a semiconductor surface.Therefore, such a PL result of BC-15 suggests that there would be slower recombination of the electron-hole pairs with more available electrons and holes participating in CO 2 photoreduction.In association with the results of CO 2 -TPD, UV-vis absorption spectra, and photocurrent response, BC-15 synthesized with the assistance of LAP in our case is evidently endowed with excellent photoelectrical properties and hence would potentially give rise to superior CO 2 photoreduction behaviors. 3.2.Photocatalytic Evaluations.In order to clarify the activity of different CeO 2 samples, the photocatalytic behaviors of the CeO 2 photocatalysts are evaluated by reduction of CO 2 with water under visible light at a wavelength of 420 nm.For RC and BCs, the main reduction product of CO is totally found.The other potential products such as CH 4 or HCOOH are not detected.Figure 9 presents CO evolution performance over RC and BCs within a reaction time of 6 h.It is found that the CO evolution amount of all the photocatalysts increases with the increasing reaction time.RC exhibits the lowest CO evolution amount of 17.15 mol g -1 at 6 h, while all the BCs deliver the higher ones.Among them, BC-15 generates the highest CO evolution amount of 21.13 mol g -1 at a reaction time of 1 h, much higher than those of some previously reported CeO 2 -based photocatalysts under the same reaction conditions (Table S1).Clearly, the LAP-assisted synthesis endows CeO 2 (BCs) with superior photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction.The dosage of LAP introduced into the precursor for the BC is a key factor to determine the final photocatalytic activity of the resulting product.The BCs synthesized with more or insufficient amounts of LAP (BC-5, BC-10, and BC-20) lead to a relatively lower CO yield, which is probably caused by some limited (BC-5 and BC-10) or overwhelming (BC-20) regulation of plane growth of formed CeO 2 during the BC synthesis.As discussed in XRD and TEM characterizations, only when the introduction amount of LAP gets fitly to an appropriate point, the formed CeO 2 (BC-15) would grow to the efficient nanorods which possess the most active sites and structure defects, visible light harvest ability, and optimal separation efficiency of photogenerated electronhole pairs.As a result, the resulting BC-15 can achieve the highest photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.In addition, the photocatalytic stability is further evaluated, and the corresponding recycling test of BC-15 is shown in Figure S4.After four cycles, the final yield of CO only has a slight drop from 126.8 to 112.4 mol g -1 , indicating the excellent photostability of BC-15 during reaction time.The structure of used BC-15 shows no significant changes compared with the fresh one, suggesting its structural stability against photocorrosion (Figures S5 andS6).To trace the origin of the carbon source in CO, we conduct a control isotopic experiment with 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 as a feedstock for BC-15 under identical reaction conditions, which is analyzed through the combination of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-7920 and MS-5975).As shown in Figure S7, the peak at m/z 29 in MS can be assigned to 13 CO, well confirming that the production of CO exactly originates from the introduced 13 CO 2 and excluding its potential possibility from the oxidation of carbon. 3.3.Mechanism of Photocatalytic Reduction of CO 2 .Based on the results of the characterization and photocatalytic evaluations, the activity enhancement of BC-15 can be attributed to the light sensitization and band regulation which lead to highly efficient separation of holes (h ) at the valence band (VB) and excited electrons (e -) at the conduction band (CB).A possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism of BC-15 is illustrated in Figure 10.Based on the data from the XPS measurements, the VB of BC-15 is determined at about 1.62 eV (Figure S2).The measured band gap energy of BC-15 is 2.2 eV (Figure 7b).The CB of BC-15 can be calculated accordingly using the following equation: E CB E VB -E g .Therefore, the CB and VB positions of BC-15 are -0.58 and 1.62 eV, respectively.The reduction potential for CO 2 to CO (E CO 2 /CO) is -0.53 eV. 40Therefore, BC-15 meets the energy requirement for the reduction of CO 2 to CO.Meanwhile, at the VB of BC-15, H 2 O molecules are oxidized by h to generate O 2 and protons, and CO 2 molecules are reduced to CO by e -at the CB of BC-15 with the assistance of the protons.

Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.LAP was collected from the Shantou University campus.Distilled water is used in all the experiments. 2.2.Synthesis of CeO 2 .The CeO 2 samples in this work were synthesized by a conventional hydrothermal-calcining method.For the reference pristine CeO 2 , 0.87 g of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O and 40 mL of 6 M NaOH solution were mixed and stirred to be homogeneous for 30 min.Afterward, the resulting mixture was transferred to a stainlesssteel autoclave with a 50 mL Teflon inner layer and put into a drying oven at 180 C and kept standing for 24 h.After cooling to room temperature, the obtained white precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and ethanol several times, and dried at 60 C overnight.The resulting intermediate was denoted as RC-H.Then, the solid power was put into an open crucible and heated at 450 C for 3 h in air with a heating rate of 5 C min -1 .The final product, weighed to be 0.34 g, was denoted as RC.To obtain the BCs, LAP was initially washed with distilled water to remove the dirt and then dried at 60 C.Prior to use, the dried LAP was cut into tiny pieces.Then, 0.87 g of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O and 40 mL of NaOH solution (6 M) were mixed and stirred to be homogeneous for 30 min.Next, an increasing weight of the LAP pieces (0.68, 1.7, 3.4, 5.1, and 6.8 g corresponding to 2-, 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-fold weight of the obtained RC, respectively) was added into the solution and stirred for another 30 min.The following hydrothermal, centrifugal separation, and drying processes were under the same conditions as those for RC.The resulting intermediates were denoted as BC-H2, BC-H5, BC-H10, BC-H15, and BC-H20, respectively.Then, the obtained light-green intermediates were put into an open crucible and heated at 450 C for 3 h in air with a heating rate of 5 C min -1 .The final products were denoted as BC-2, BC-5, BC-10, BC-15, and BC-20, respectively.In addition, a reference

using a Cu K radiation source.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) of samples were performed using a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan).Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of samples were recorded from KBr pellets as the sample Matrixon with a Nicolet Magna-IR 550 spectrometer.Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectrometry (UV-vis DRS) of samples was conducted via a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600).N 2 sorptions of samples were obtained on a porosity (NDVA-2000e) analyzer.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda methods were used to calculate the SSA and pore size distribution (PSD), respectively.Photoluminescence (PL) and transient fluorescence (FL) spectra were investigated using a F4500 PL detector (Hitachi, Japan).CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption data of samples (CO 2 -TPD) were determined on a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ-C chemisorption instrument.Transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed using an electrochemical workstation (VersaSTAT3) in the three-electrode system.0.005 g of the as-synthesized CeO 2 sample was added to 0.1 mL of oleic acid and 1.0 mL of ethanol in a certain amount of ethylene glycol with ultrasonication.Then, the dispersion mixture was spun onto FTO substrates (1.0 cm 0.8 cm) to obtain the working electrodes.A platinum wire and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. 2.4.Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction Evaluations.Photocatalytic activity of
