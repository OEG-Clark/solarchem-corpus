The crystallite size estimated from the line broadening of the anatase TiO 2 (101) reflection plane (2 25.3 ) according to the Debye-Scherrer equation is about 14 nm.TG result (Figure 3) under air atmosphere exhibits that this TiO 2 -GCM composite has a chemical composition of about 80 wt anatase TiO 2 and 20 wt graphitic carbon. The SEM image in Figure 4b show that the microspherical morphology of the SiO 2 template is replicated in the TiO 2 -GCM composite, the average diameter of the microspherical TiO 2 -GCM is about 0.2 m which is similar to the hard template SiO 2 microspheres (Figure 4a).The detailed structure was provided by TEM images.From the low-magnification image (Figure 5a), it can be seen that besides the microspherical morphology, uniform wormlike mesoporous channels in large domains were clearly observed for TiO 2 -GCM.In addition, low-magnification image (Figure 5a) and the high-magnification TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 5b) both confirm that anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles with the size of 8-14 nm are well deposited in the graphitic mesoporous carbon.And the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset in Figure 5b) confirms that the formed anatase TiO 2 is single-crystalline nature, which is accord with that obtained from XRD analysis.Furthermore, HRTEM image exhibits that the mesoporous carbon support has a relative high graphitic degree with the d spacing of the observed lattice planes of 0.345 nm and very close to the d( 002) value (0.34 nm) of typical graphite, which is in agreement with our previous study. 21igure 6 gives the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and corresponding pore size distribution curve of TiO 2 -GCM.The isotherm exhibits a typical type-IV curve with a hysteretic loop in a wide relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0. Figure 6.It can be seen that the TiO 2 -GCM composite has a uniform pore size distribution centered at about 3.4 nm which is ascribed to the void spaces between the nanoparticles.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area for TiO 2 -GCM is up to 250.5 m 2 g -1 , such high specific surface area is beneficial to the reactant molecules adsorbed on the surface of the material and make the TiO 2 -GCM composite have important applications in photocatalysis. In order to enhance the efficient photoreduction of CO 2 , the primary task is the development of high efficiency semiconductor photocatalysts. 22Here the TiO 2 -GCM composite was used as a photocatalyst to convert CO 2 with H 2 O into methane (CH 4 ) under simulated solar irradiation, and the detailed test procedure can be seen in experimental section.For comparison, the photocatalytic performance of the commercial Degussa P25 titania was also carried out under the same experimental conditions.Figure 7 shows the time profile of the yields of CH 4 under irradiation of simulated solar, it can be observed that the TiO 2 -GCM composite (CH 4 : 10.3 mol g -1 cat) exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity than commercial TiO 2 (CH 4 : 0.7 mol g -1 cat) when the irradiation time of 300 min. Such pronounced photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the unique structure of the TiO 2 -GCM composite with a variety of favorable properties.First, monodispersed microspheres with wormlike mesostructure make facile the reactant diffusion into the bulk of catalyst and hence provide fast intraparticle molecular transfer.Second, the high surface area can enhance the light harvesting and the adsorption for reactant molecules.Finally, well-interconnected graphitic carbon matrix has a high electronic conductivity which extends TiO 2 's bandgap to higher wavelengths and suppresses the recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, these seem to be the main reason in our study for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 by the combination with graphitic mesoporous carbon."}, {"llm generation": "TiO2-GCM composite", "source": "Due to the special composition and structure, the TiO 2 -GCM composite exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.", "context": "In summary, we have demonstrated that mesoporous TiO 2 /graphitic carbon microspheres were synthesized via a simple nanocasting route.XRD, TG, N 2 -sorption, SEM and TEM results all consistently reveal that anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles with diameter of 8-14 nm were highly dispersed in the graphitic carbon microspheres, and the obtained TiO 2 -GCM composite possesses uniform worm-like mesostructure with high specific surface area.Due to the special composition and structure, the TiO 2 -GCM composite exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under simulated solar irradiation.
