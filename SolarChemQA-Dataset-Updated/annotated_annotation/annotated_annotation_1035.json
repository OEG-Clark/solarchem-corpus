Fig. 1(a) displays the in situ loading of Ti 3 C 2 on NiAl-LDH.The obtained Ti 3 C 2 (1 g) was dispersed in DMSO (100 ml) and stirred overnight.Then, the powder was separated and sonicated in ionized water.The suspension was centrifuged for 1 h.The supernatant was collected, and the concentration of Ti 3 C 2 was determined to be 15 mg/mL.The Ti 3 C 2 dispersion was mixed with Ni(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (0.87 g), Al(NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O (0.375 g), NH 4 F (0.592 g) and urea (2.4 g).The mixture was sonicated and vigorously stirred for 0.5 h.Then, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 mL) and kept at 120 C for 24 h.During the crystallization process, Ti 3 C 2 was deposited on the scaffold of NiAl-LDH.The obtained sample was washed alternatively with deionized water and alcohol.In this manner, NiAl-LDH/Ti 3 C 2 hybrids with different volumes of Ti 3 C 2 dispersions (10, 30 and 60 ml) were obtained and denoted LDH/TC-1, LDH/TC-2 and LDH/TC-3.For comparison, bare NiAl-LDH without the modification by Ti 3 C 2 was also prepared using the same procedure. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the samples were conducted on a Brucker D8 diffractometer with a Cu Ka radiation source.The sample morphologies were investigated using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, HITACHI S-4800) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS, Oxford instruments X-Max).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded using an FEI Tecnai F20 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin-Elmer) with Mg K radiation (h 1253.6eV).The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (UV-vis-DRS) was measured using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer and transformed into an absorption spectrum according to the Kubelka-Munk relationship. The specific surface areas and pore diameter distributions were measured using nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K obtained with an automatic surface area analyser (Micromeritics Tristar-3000, USA).Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer LS 55 Fluorescence spectrometer at 355 nm.The photoluminescence (PL) decay profiles were obtained using a Horiba Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog-3-21-TCSPC spectrometer. The photocatalytic performance of the catalysts was evaluated under irradiation by a 300 W Xenon arc lamp.In each test, the sample (0.1 g) and deionized water (0.4 mL) were introduced as the reducer.The reaction setup was filled with highly purified CO 2 gas to achieve adsorption-desorption equilibrium prior to irradiation.Then, the lamp was turned on for 6 consecutive hours.During irradiation, approximately 1 mL of gas was removed for subsequent analysis performed using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu Corp., Japan) that is equipped with both FID and TCD detectors.The carrier gas was high-purity Ar gas.The isotope-labelled experiments were performed using 13 CO 2 and H 2 18 O as the reactants, and the products were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (QP2010SE, Shimadzu Corp., Japan). Transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed using a CHI760E electrochemical workstation.A standard threeelectrode configuration was applied, and 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution was used as the electrolyte.Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass coated with the sample was used as the working electrode.Pt sheets and a saturated calomel electrode (SCEs) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.The measurements were operated at open-circuit potential.A sinusoidal ac perturbation of 5 mV was applied to the electrode over the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 10 kHz.The XRD pattern for NiAl-LDH (Fig. 1b) displays the characteristic features of hydrotalcite-type compounds.The diffraction peaks at 11.3, 22.8, 34.6, 39.0, 46.2, 60.2 and 61.5 are assigned to the (003), (006), ( 012), ( 015), (018), ( 110) and (113) planes, respectively, and are in accordance with the standard (JCPDS 22-0452) 32."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": [{"llm generation": "Batch", "source": "Then, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 mL) and kept at 120 C for 24 h.", "context": "Ni(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (99) and Al(NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O (99) were both obtained from Aladdin and used as the precursors for NiAl-LDH.Ti 3 AlC 2 and ammonium fluoride were obtained from Macklin.Hydrofluoric acid and urea were supplied by Aladdin, and all other chemicals used in the experiments were purchased from the Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company.
