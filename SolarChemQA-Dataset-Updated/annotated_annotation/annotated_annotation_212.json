Photodeposition of Au was performed in a continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor equipped with a 700 W Hg immersion lamp cooled by water circulating in a double wall jacket 11.During photodeposition, the concentration of CO 2 , O 2 , and H 2 was analyzed with a non-dispersive IR photometer, a paramagnetic and a thermal conductivity detector (XStream, Emerson Process Management), respectively.350 mg of catalyst was dispersed in a solution of 550 ml dest.H 2 O and 50 ml methanol.The reactor was deaerated for 60 min using pure N 2 prior to irradiation to obtain reliable H 2 concentrations due to the photocatalytic methanol reforming and to avoid the reverse reaction of hydrogen and oxygen.The activity of Ti/SBA was evaluated by irradiation for 60 min in the absence of the Au precursor.3.5 ml of a 1.5 A 10 A3 molar auric acid solution (HAuCl 4 99.9,Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the suspension, and the reactor was again deaerated for 60 min using pure N 2 .Photodeposition was performed at 30 C with 50 irradiation power (350 W) for 2.5 h.After successful photodeposition, the materials were filtered and freeze-dried over night. The flow scheme of the CO 2 photoreactor setup is presented in Fig. S1.The main elements of this setup are the gas supply, the saturator, the reactor, the analysis devices (GC and QMS), and the pumping system.The home-made gas-phase photoreactor with a volume of approximately 27 ml is constructed on the basis of the design presented by Grimes et al. 14,15.The reactor is fully metal-sealed and can be pumped down to a pressure of 10 A8 mbar.While two separate cooling water circuits control the reactor and the saturator temperature, the gas lines can be heated to avoid water condensation.A sample is spread on glass tray on the bottom of the reactor to obtain a homogeneous light distribution.A 200 W Hg/Xe (Newport Oriel) lamp is used to irradiate the sample through a quartz window allowing for high transmissions of high-energy UV light.Thus, the light irradiance at the sample is 200 mW/cm 2 or 110 mW/cm 2 when a 320 nm cutoff filter is used.Reactions can be performed either in continuous or in batch mode.For this purpose, product gases can be analyzed by QMS (Balzers, Omnistar) in continuous mode and by a GC (Shimadzu 14B) in batch mode.Trace gas analysis is performed with the GC, which is equipped with TCD and FID detectors.Two Porapak N columns and one molecular sieve column are used for separation.Calibration of the GC was performed using a standard gas mixture containing 1000 ppm C 1 -C 5 hydrocarbons and 10 of nitrogen balanced by He (Air Liquide).It was confirmed that the concentration of C1-C4 hydrocarbons can be analyzed reliably down to a concentration of 1 ppm, and the standard deviation for the different hydrocarbon compounds was derived to be below 5. The samples were thoroughly pre-treated in humid He under UV irradiation to remove surface contaminations.The cleaning procedure was repeated until carbon contaminations were sufficiently removed (5 ppm) from the sample surface. CO 2 reduction experiments were performed under static conditions in an atmosphere of 5 CO 2 and 6000 ppm water, which was balanced by He.These conditions were achieved by saturating a CO 2 /He stream with water at 273 K.A CO 2 excess was chosen because of the unfavorable interaction of CO 2 with the isolated titanate species.The initial pressure was adjusted to 1500 mbar.The hydrocarbon formation under illumination with a 200 W Hg/ Xe lamp was monitored during a period of 7 h.For this purpose, samples were taken for GC analysis after 1, 5, and 7 h.The decrease in pressure during sampling was taken into account by normalization of the obtained signals to N 2 used as an internal standard.After reaction, the reactor was pumped down to 5 A 10 A2 mbar and flushed with high purity He.Blank experiments revealed that no hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of a photocatalyst or in absence of high-energy UV light, which was excluded using a 435 nm cutoff filter. Characterization of the samples by UV-Vis spectroscopy and XPS was performed according to previous measurements described in detail elsewhere 13. DRIFT spectra of the samples were recorded at different temperatures between RT and 400 C to remove surface-bound water.Samples were heated with a rate of 5 K/min.At 120 C, the temperature was kept constant, while the spectra were measured.The obtained spectra were first converted to log(1/R) and then normalized to the absorption of the harmonic vibration of SiO 2 , which can be found in the region between 2100 cm A1 and 1700 cm A1 .Diamond powder was used as diluent due to its chemical inertness in a 1:1 ratio (by weight) for the IR spectroscopic measurements (particle size 30-40 lm, Winter Quality Tools)."}, {"llm generation": "Ti/SBA-15", "source": "The preparation and in-depth characterization of the Ti/SBA-15 material was described in detail elsewhere 13.", "context": "The preparation and in-depth characterization of the Ti/SBA-15 material was described in detail elsewhere 13.In short, it was proven by UV-Vis, X-ray photoelectron, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy that tetrahedrally coordinated TiO 4 -species were obtained within the mesoporous SBA-15 matrix.The Ti-content was confirmed to be 2 wt resulting in a coverage of 0.3 Ti/nm 2 . The evolution of H 2 was constantly measured during the photodeposition of Au revealing that hydrogen evolution took place only in the presence of auric acid (Fig. 1).During irradiation, the Au precursor is reduced to metallic Au, which can be considered as a fast reaction.In the presence of metallic Au, H 2 is produced due to the photocatalytic reforming of aqueous methanol, in which methanol acts as hole scavenger.Presumably, metallic Au is the hydrogen evolution site.Therefore, this observation is a first indication for the successful deposition of Au nanoparticles onto Ti/SBA-15.However, to further prove the existence of Au nanoparticles, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy was employed showing a characteristic plasmon absorption peak of metallic Au at 550 nm 16,17 (for details see Section 3.5).From the plasmon maximum position, it can be assumed that the Au nanoparticles are smaller than or similar to 10 nm in size 17.Elemental analysis revealed that the obtained Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample contains 0.25 wt of Au corresponding to the amount supplied during photoassisted deposition. Therefore, all the supplied Au ions were successfully deposited onto the support material. The two different materials Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 were thoroughly cleaned by illumination in humid He under static conditions in the fully metal-sealed gas-phase photoreactor.Recently, Mul et al. showed that this pre-illumination procedure in the presence of water vapor is mandatory to achieve reliable results in the photocatalytic activity in gas-phase CO 2 reduction 7,18.During the cleaning procedure in humid He, mainly CH 4 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 were detected (Fig. 2), which is in good agreement with the carbon contaminations observed by Mul et al. 7.In addition to these hydrocarbons, methanol was observed for Au/Ti/SBA-15, which is most likely a result of the photodeposition procedure, in which methanol was used as sacrificial electron donor.However, the methanol signal decreased throughout prolonged irradiation, and it is likely that methanol was converted to CO 2 , which was also detected throughout prolonged irradiation in the Au photodeposition procedure. It is remarkable to note that the overall amount of carbon contaminations was higher than the contamination previously observed by Mul et al. 7.Therefore, subsequent cleaning steps were necessary to obtain a clean catalyst surface.In case of Ti/ SBA-15, four subsequent cleaning steps were conducted, whereas the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample was cleaned seven times for 7 h each.Additionally, Au/Ti/SBA-15-C was prepared by calcination at 250 C in synthetic air with the aim to reduce the number of necessary cleaning steps.This calcination temperature has previously been chosen for the calcination of PVA-protected gold colloids on metal oxides 19.However, four additional cleaning steps in humid He were still necessary to sufficiently remove the carbon contaminations.The decrease in the concentration of the three main contaminants CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 of each cleaning step can be represented with high accuracy as an exponential decay curve in case of the Au/Ti/SBA-15.This might be rationalized by the decreasing surface coverage of methanol in the subsequent cleaning steps which can be converted into methane in a two electron process. The hydrocarbon formation during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction within 7 h of illumination for Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 is shown in Fig. 3a.Except for the presence of CO 2 , the conditions of the photocatalytic process were similar to the conditions applied during the cleaning procedure (1500 mbar, 6000 ppm H 2 O, 200 W Hg/Xe lamp), and it can be assumed that no more contaminants desorb during the actual CO 2 reduction experiments.Thus, the detected hydrocarbons were unambiguously formed from CO 2 as carbon source. Obviously, in the first reaction run, the yield of CH 4 is significantly higher for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample which is in good agreement with observations by Anpo et al. 12, who detected higher methane yields in the presence of Pt co-catalysts.However, a subsequent reaction period without further pre-treatment revealed that a threefold increase in the CH 4 yield is observed for the Ti/SBA-15 sample, whereas the overall yield for the Au/Ti/ SBA-15 material is almost comparable to the first reaction run, and only a slightly lower yield was observed.Furthermore, it is evident that the yield of CH 4 after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15 resembles the value obtained after 7 h of irradiation in the first reaction run.The comparison between the Au/Ti/SBA-15 and the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample shows that the CH 4 yield is significantly lower for the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample (Fig. S2).Consequently, since calcinations affect the photocatalytic performance in a negative way, it is not possible to shorten the photocatalytic cleaning procedure by this means. After an additional surface cleaning of all samples in humid He, the performances of the different materials were reproduced.The CH 4 yields were similar for two subsequently performed reactions on Au/Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15-C.An increase in the CH 4 yield was again observed in the second reaction run for Ti/SBA-15.However, it has to be noted that the overall yield was lower, indicating that both the gold-containing and the gold-free catalyst deactivated during prolonged irradiation (Fig. S2).In addition to CH 4 , longer-chain hydrocarbons were produced in different quantities with both catalysts.While C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 were produced in the two subsequent reactions using the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, negligible amounts of longer-chain hydrocarbons were detected with Ti/SBA-15 in the first run (Fig. 3b).However, after deactivation of Ti/SBA-15, longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was also observed during the first reaction run (Fig. S2).In addition to the threefold increase in the yield of CH 4 , a threefold increase in ethane formation was observed in the subsequent reaction using Ti/SBA-15 (Fig. 3b).Again, these observations were reproducible in two consecutive runs after additional surface cleaning in humid He.We therefore suppose that under the present reaction conditions, a carbon pool is reproducibly built up during the first reaction run on the Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which cannot be removed by evacuation.This carbon pool can then participate in the product formation at the beginning of the second run.As a consequence, no time for the accumulation of intermediates is required in the second run, product formation starts earlier, and the total yield is higher.It is assumed that saturation of the catalyst surface with these less reactive carbon species is required to achieve high hydrocarbon yields.On the other hand, in the presence of Au, this carbon accumulation does not seem to occur and is either removed by evacuation or these carbon species are not reactive in subsequent reaction runs.Consequently, the yields observed in the second run are similar to the first ones.It is reasonable to assume that a higher hydrogenation rate in the presence of Au is responsible for the observed behavior of Au/Ti/SBA-15 after the first reaction run.In general, noble metals usually show high activity in hydrogenation reactions 20,21.In photocatalytic reactions, it is accepted that H 2 formation occurs at these electron-trapping sites, and more hydrogen is available in close proximity to gold facilitating hydrogenation 22,23.It should be noted that this is in agreement with the higher yield of H 2 that has been observed during photodeposition experiments.Visible-light assisted photoreactions in the presence of Au as the cause of the higher activity can be excluded as no product formation was observed when the samples were irradiated with Vis light. The 30 ppm of CH 4 produced within 5 h of irradiation in the presence of Au/Ti/SBA-15 is equivalent to 0.047 lmol resulting in 0.188 lmol/g cat /h or 9.4 lmol/g Ti /h.For Ti/SBA-15, the yield in the second run can be calculated to amount to 12.1 lmol/g Ti /h.The photon flux entering the reactor can be estimated, and thus, an apparent quantum yield for CH 4 for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 material can be calculated.In the range from 200 to 320 nm, the AQY is calculated to be 1.13 A 10 A3 , which appears to be low but is still in good agreement with values reported in the literature (Supporting information). To get further insight into the formation of the carbon pool, two consecutive reaction cycles were performed followed by irradiation of the photocatalysts in humid He.Surprisingly, on both catalyst systems, evolution of hydrocarbons was observed under irradiation in humid He (Fig. 4a).A steep increase in methane and longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was observed after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15.This is in line with the proposed formation of a carbon pool.For the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, a slower formation of C x H y is characteristic.The formation of hydrocarbons during irradiation in humid He, however, is a clear indication that a carbon pool is also created on Au/Ti/SBA-15, but to a lower extent, and its effects on hydrocarbon formation are less pronounced.Possibly, the nature or location of these carbon species is different. Finally, the influence of the water content on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was investigated using a reaction gas mixture containing 5 CO 2 /He only.Consequently, just pre-adsorbed water in the pores of the catalysts was available as reducing agent.The results of these water-free reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 4b.Prior and subsequent to these experiments, CO 2 reduction was performed using the reaction gas mixture containing gasphase water.These results are also included in Fig. 4b.Unexpectedly, less longer-chain hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of gas-phase water on both catalysts systems (Fig. 4c).The CH 4 yield is significantly higher for both catalysts.It should be noted that the carbon pool was already formed on the Ti/SBA-15 surface during a previously performed experiment with CO 2 and gas-phase water.Considering the overall produced carbon content (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 ), the carbon yield (C A ) increased by about 20 in the absence of water, which was mainly due to the higher CH 4 yields compensating the decrease in longer-chain hydrocarbon yields.The overall hydrocarbon yield was even increased in the consecutive experiment performed with the CO 2 /H 2 O mixture.For Ti/SBA-15, the CH 4 yield decreased, but the C 2 H 6 yield was drastically increased (Fig. 4c).A higher ethane yield and a higher methane yield were observed for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which might indicate that a carbon pool was formed on its surface under water-free feed conditions.Furthermore, these experiments show that the water content on the sample surface is sufficient to perform photocatalytic CO 2 reduction for at least 5 h of irradiation with both photocatalysts.In contrast to these observations, Anpo et al. observed the formation of larger quantities of CH 4 for high H 2 O/CO 2 ratios, and only small quantities of CH 4 were produced in the absence of gas-phase water 3.However, it is well known that water strongly binds to isolated Ti-species, and high temperatures are required to remove water effectively 24.Therefore, the surface of the photocatalysts should be saturated with H 2 O and, as a result, CO 2 reduction is feasible.In addition, high methane yields in water-poor conditions are in agreement with a C 2 H 6 /CH 4 ratio exceeding 1 for stoichiometric CO 2 /H 2 O mixtures observed by Mul et al. 7 and increasing ethane yield for higher water content reaction gas-mixtures as observed by Anpo et al. 3.Further studies are required to fully explain these observations.However, an option that should be considered is the inhibition of a subsequent photo-reforming reaction of the produced CH 4 in a water-free gasphase that may occur in the presence of gas-phase H 2 O. CO and H 2 may be produced due to this process, which then might be in-volved in the formation of higher hydrocarbons.Unfortunately, small amounts of CO and H 2 cannot be detected by the GC application used here.In terms of irradiation in water-free CO 2 , a lack of CO and H 2 could diminish the formation of higher hydrocarbons. In a related manner, a photoinduced cracking reaction of higher hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of larger amounts of methane, cannot be ruled out.Furthermore, an influence of the carbon pool in higher hydrocarbon production was observed.Thus, it should be considered that high water contents are required to hydrogenate these species.Without gas-phase water, partially hydrogenated species may instead remain adsorbed.Furthermore, the water content may influence the mobility of intermediates on the catalyst surface.A higher amount of water should lead to the formation of a physisorbed layer that almost resembles liquid water.In this layer, partially hydrogenated species may move more freely, while they are stuck in place without this layer. After reaction all samples were characterized by DRIFTS, UV-Vis and XPS and compared to the unreacted materials to get further insight into possible intermediates, the deactivation of the catalysts, and the carbon pool, which was accumulating during CO 2 reduction.The carbon content as determined by XPS analysis was similar for all the samples.Structural changes in the Ti-species within the course of gas-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction causing deactivation of the materials can be excluded comparing Ti/SBA-15 and Au/ Ti/SBA-15 before and after reaction (XPS results, Fig. S3).UV-Vis indicates a narrowing of the Au plasmon for Au/Ti/SBA-15 after reaction, which may be caused by different Ti-Au interactions (Fig. 5).One has to keep in mind that TiO x -species have the potential to alter the local environment of the Au particles 16,17.A narrowing of the Au plasmon peak was also observed in the Au/Ti/ SBA-15-C sample accompanied by an increase in intensity and a shift in the plasmon peak maximum to higher wavelength.This indicates a particle growth due to calcination (not shown).Therefore, the changes observed by UV-Vis spectroscopy might partially explain the activity decrease in Au/Ti/SBA-15. Difference IR spectra of the reacted and the fresh Ti/SBA-15 catalyst revealed that formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were present at the surface of Ti/SBA-15 after CO 2 reduction reaction (Fig. 6).The bands observed at 1685 and 2853 cm A1 are in good agreement with values of the m(CO) and m(CH 2 ) stretching modes of formaldehyde adsorbed at different surfaces 25262728. The intense band at 2972 cm A1 is representative for the asymmetric stretching (m a (CH 2 )) of paraformaldehyde, which is known to be obtained by the polymerization of formaldehyde at low temperatures 25,26,28.The assignment of the bands is clearly verified by the thermal stability of paraformaldehyde.Interestingly, less formaldehyde was detected for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, and the signals assigned to paraformaldehyde are shifted to higher wavenumbers (Fig. S4).Assuming that paraformaldehyde is the intermediate of higher hydrocarbon formation, it is likely that it is immediately available at the surface of the Au/Ti/SBA-15, catalyst and higher hydrocarbons can be produced, whereas at Ti/ SBA-15, paraformaldehyde is formed upon accumulation of formaldehyde at the surface and is not hydrogenated further.This may explain the inhibition of ethane production on Ti/SBA-15, as observed during the first reaction run.Nevertheless, the IR spectroscopic results indicate that the carbon pool most likely consists of adsorbed (para-)formaldehyde. In the literature, different reaction mechanisms are proposed for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Anpo et al. 4 propose a mechanism in which CO 2 and H 2 O decompose competitively into C-and OH-radicals at the excited Ti-O centers, presumably with CO as an intermediate species.Similar observations were recently reported for crystalline TiO 2 by Zapol et al. 29.Mul et al. 7 followed the proposed route by Frei et al. 6 who suggested a mechanism involving CO in the initial state and formaldehyde, which is converted to CH 4 and longer-chain hydrocarbons in the presence of water.A Ti-hydroperoxide species is assumed to be essential in this process.Based on the results obtained within this study, the mechanism proposed by Mul et al. 7 and Frei et al. 6 is considered more likely as (1) formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were observed by diffuse reflectance IR measurements, (2) higher CH 4 yields are observed for water-poor reaction conditions, and (3) CO 2 is weakly interacting with isolated Ti-species 13, whereas water is strongly bound to the surface."}, {"llm generation": "Au/Ti/SBA-15", "source": "Elemental analysis revealed that the obtained Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample contains 0.25 wt of Au corresponding to the amount supplied during photoassisted deposition.", "context": "The preparation and in-depth characterization of the Ti/SBA-15 material was described in detail elsewhere 13.In short, it was proven by UV-Vis, X-ray photoelectron, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy that tetrahedrally coordinated TiO 4 -species were obtained within the mesoporous SBA-15 matrix.The Ti-content was confirmed to be 2 wt resulting in a coverage of 0.3 Ti/nm 2 .

Finally, the influence of the water content on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was investigated using a reaction gas mixture containing 5 CO 2 /He only.Consequently, just pre-adsorbed water in the pores of the catalysts was available as reducing agent.The results of these water-free reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 4b.Prior and subsequent to these experiments, CO 2 reduction was performed using the reaction gas mixture containing gasphase water.These results are also included in Fig. 4b.Unexpectedly, less longer-chain hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of gas-phase water on both catalysts systems (Fig. 4c).The CH 4 yield is significantly higher for both catalysts.It should be noted that the carbon pool was already formed on the Ti/SBA-15 surface during a previously performed experiment with CO 2 and gas-phase water.Considering the overall produced carbon content (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 ), the carbon yield (C A ) increased by about 20 in the absence of water, which was mainly due to the higher CH 4 yields compensating the decrease in longer-chain hydrocarbon yields.The overall hydrocarbon yield was even increased in the consecutive experiment performed with the CO 2 /H 2 O mixture.For Ti/SBA-15, the CH 4 yield decreased, but the C 2 H 6 yield was drastically increased (Fig. 4c).A higher ethane yield and a higher methane yield were observed for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which might indicate that a carbon pool was formed on its surface under water-free feed conditions.Furthermore, these experiments show that the water content on the sample surface is sufficient to perform photocatalytic CO 2 reduction for at least 5 h of irradiation with both photocatalysts.In contrast to these observations, Anpo et al. observed the formation of larger quantities of CH 4 for high H 2 O/CO 2 ratios, and only small quantities of CH 4 were produced in the absence of gas-phase water 3.However, it is well known that water strongly binds to isolated Ti-species, and high temperatures are required to remove water effectively 24.Therefore, the surface of the photocatalysts should be saturated with H 2 O and, as a result, CO 2 reduction is feasible.In addition, high methane yields in water-poor conditions are in agreement with a C 2 H 6 /CH 4 ratio exceeding 1 for stoichiometric CO 2 /H 2 O mixtures observed by Mul et al. 7 and increasing ethane yield for higher water content reaction gas-mixtures as observed by Anpo et al. 3.Further studies are required to fully explain these observations.However, an option that should be considered is the inhibition of a subsequent photo-reforming reaction of the produced CH 4 in a water-free gasphase that may occur in the presence of gas-phase H 2 O. CO and H 2 may be produced due to this process, which then might be in-volved in the formation of higher hydrocarbons.Unfortunately, small amounts of CO and H 2 cannot be detected by the GC application used here.In terms of irradiation in water-free CO 2 , a lack of CO and H 2 could diminish the formation of higher hydrocarbons. In a related manner, a photoinduced cracking reaction of higher hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of larger amounts of methane, cannot be ruled out.Furthermore, an influence of the carbon pool in higher hydrocarbon production was observed.Thus, it should be considered that high water contents are required to hydrogenate these species.Without gas-phase water, partially hydrogenated species may instead remain adsorbed.Furthermore, the water content may influence the mobility of intermediates on the catalyst surface.A higher amount of water should lead to the formation of a physisorbed layer that almost resembles liquid water.In this layer, partially hydrogenated species may move more freely, while they are stuck in place without this layer. After reaction all samples were characterized by DRIFTS, UV-Vis and XPS and compared to the unreacted materials to get further insight into possible intermediates, the deactivation of the catalysts, and the carbon pool, which was accumulating during CO 2 reduction.The carbon content as determined by XPS analysis was similar for all the samples.Structural changes in the Ti-species within the course of gas-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction causing deactivation of the materials can be excluded comparing Ti/SBA-15 and Au/ Ti/SBA-15 before and after reaction (XPS results, Fig. S3).UV-Vis indicates a narrowing of the Au plasmon for Au/Ti/SBA-15 after reaction, which may be caused by different Ti-Au interactions (Fig. 5).One has to keep in mind that TiO x -species have the potential to alter the local environment of the Au particles 16,17.A narrowing of the Au plasmon peak was also observed in the Au/Ti/ SBA-15-C sample accompanied by an increase in intensity and a shift in the plasmon peak maximum to higher wavelength.This indicates a particle growth due to calcination (not shown).Therefore, the changes observed by UV-Vis spectroscopy might partially explain the activity decrease in Au/Ti/SBA-15. Difference IR spectra of the reacted and the fresh Ti/SBA-15 catalyst revealed that formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were present at the surface of Ti/SBA-15 after CO 2 reduction reaction (Fig. 6).The bands observed at 1685 and 2853 cm A1 are in good agreement with values of the m(CO) and m(CH 2 ) stretching modes of formaldehyde adsorbed at different surfaces 25262728. The intense band at 2972 cm A1 is representative for the asymmetric stretching (m a (CH 2 )) of paraformaldehyde, which is known to be obtained by the polymerization of formaldehyde at low temperatures 25,26,28.The assignment of the bands is clearly verified by the thermal stability of paraformaldehyde.Interestingly, less formaldehyde was detected for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, and the signals assigned to paraformaldehyde are shifted to higher wavenumbers (Fig. S4).Assuming that paraformaldehyde is the intermediate of higher hydrocarbon formation, it is likely that it is immediately available at the surface of the Au/Ti/SBA-15, catalyst and higher hydrocarbons can be produced, whereas at Ti/ SBA-15, paraformaldehyde is formed upon accumulation of formaldehyde at the surface and is not hydrogenated further.This may explain the inhibition of ethane production on Ti/SBA-15, as observed during the first reaction run.Nevertheless, the IR spectroscopic results indicate that the carbon pool most likely consists of adsorbed (para-)formaldehyde. In the literature, different reaction mechanisms are proposed for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Anpo et al. 4 propose a mechanism in which CO 2 and H 2 O decompose competitively into C-and OH-radicals at the excited Ti-O centers, presumably with CO as an intermediate species.Similar observations were recently reported for crystalline TiO 2 by Zapol et al. 29.Mul et al. 7 followed the proposed route by Frei et al. 6 who suggested a mechanism involving CO in the initial state and formaldehyde, which is converted to CH 4 and longer-chain hydrocarbons in the presence of water.A Ti-hydroperoxide species is assumed to be essential in this process.Based on the results obtained within this study, the mechanism proposed by Mul et al. 7 and Frei et al. 6 is considered more likely as (1) formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were observed by diffuse reflectance IR measurements, (2) higher CH 4 yields are observed for water-poor reaction conditions, and (3) CO 2 is weakly interacting with isolated Ti-species 13, whereas water is strongly bound to the surface."}, {"llm generation": "Au/Ti/SBA-15-C", "source": "Additionally, Au/Ti/SBA-15-C was prepared by calcination at 250 C in synthetic air with the aim to reduce the number of necessary cleaning steps.", "context": "The preparation and in-depth characterization of the Ti/SBA-15 material was described in detail elsewhere 13.In short, it was proven by UV-Vis, X-ray photoelectron, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy that tetrahedrally coordinated TiO 4 -species were obtained within the mesoporous SBA-15 matrix.The Ti-content was confirmed to be 2 wt resulting in a coverage of 0.3 Ti/nm 2 . The evolution of H 2 was constantly measured during the photodeposition of Au revealing that hydrogen evolution took place only in the presence of auric acid (Fig. 1).During irradiation, the Au precursor is reduced to metallic Au, which can be considered as a fast reaction.In the presence of metallic Au, H 2 is produced due to the photocatalytic reforming of aqueous methanol, in which methanol acts as hole scavenger.Presumably, metallic Au is the hydrogen evolution site.Therefore, this observation is a first indication for the successful deposition of Au nanoparticles onto Ti/SBA-15.However, to further prove the existence of Au nanoparticles, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy was employed showing a characteristic plasmon absorption peak of metallic Au at 550 nm 16,17 (for details see Section 3.5).From the plasmon maximum position, it can be assumed that the Au nanoparticles are smaller than or similar to 10 nm in size 17.Elemental analysis revealed that the obtained Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample contains 0.25 wt of Au corresponding to the amount supplied during photoassisted deposition. Therefore, all the supplied Au ions were successfully deposited onto the support material. The two different materials Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 were thoroughly cleaned by illumination in humid He under static conditions in the fully metal-sealed gas-phase photoreactor.Recently, Mul et al. showed that this pre-illumination procedure in the presence of water vapor is mandatory to achieve reliable results in the photocatalytic activity in gas-phase CO 2 reduction 7,18.During the cleaning procedure in humid He, mainly CH 4 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 were detected (Fig. 2), which is in good agreement with the carbon contaminations observed by Mul et al. 7.In addition to these hydrocarbons, methanol was observed for Au/Ti/SBA-15, which is most likely a result of the photodeposition procedure, in which methanol was used as sacrificial electron donor.However, the methanol signal decreased throughout prolonged irradiation, and it is likely that methanol was converted to CO 2 , which was also detected throughout prolonged irradiation in the Au photodeposition procedure. It is remarkable to note that the overall amount of carbon contaminations was higher than the contamination previously observed by Mul et al. 7.Therefore, subsequent cleaning steps were necessary to obtain a clean catalyst surface.In case of Ti/ SBA-15, four subsequent cleaning steps were conducted, whereas the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample was cleaned seven times for 7 h each.Additionally, Au/Ti/SBA-15-C was prepared by calcination at 250 C in synthetic air with the aim to reduce the number of necessary cleaning steps.This calcination temperature has previously been chosen for the calcination of PVA-protected gold colloids on metal oxides 19.However, four additional cleaning steps in humid He were still necessary to sufficiently remove the carbon contaminations.The decrease in the concentration of the three main contaminants CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 of each cleaning step can be represented with high accuracy as an exponential decay curve in case of the Au/Ti/SBA-15.This might be rationalized by the decreasing surface coverage of methanol in the subsequent cleaning steps which can be converted into methane in a two electron process. The hydrocarbon formation during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction within 7 h of illumination for Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 is shown in Fig. 3a.Except for the presence of CO 2 , the conditions of the photocatalytic process were similar to the conditions applied during the cleaning procedure (1500 mbar, 6000 ppm H 2 O, 200 W Hg/Xe lamp), and it can be assumed that no more contaminants desorb during the actual CO 2 reduction experiments.Thus, the detected hydrocarbons were unambiguously formed from CO 2 as carbon source. Obviously, in the first reaction run, the yield of CH 4 is significantly higher for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample which is in good agreement with observations by Anpo et al. 12, who detected higher methane yields in the presence of Pt co-catalysts.However, a subsequent reaction period without further pre-treatment revealed that a threefold increase in the CH 4 yield is observed for the Ti/SBA-15 sample, whereas the overall yield for the Au/Ti/ SBA-15 material is almost comparable to the first reaction run, and only a slightly lower yield was observed.Furthermore, it is evident that the yield of CH 4 after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15 resembles the value obtained after 7 h of irradiation in the first reaction run.The comparison between the Au/Ti/SBA-15 and the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample shows that the CH 4 yield is significantly lower for the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample (Fig. S2).Consequently, since calcinations affect the photocatalytic performance in a negative way, it is not possible to shorten the photocatalytic cleaning procedure by this means. After an additional surface cleaning of all samples in humid He, the performances of the different materials were reproduced.The CH 4 yields were similar for two subsequently performed reactions on Au/Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15-C.An increase in the CH 4 yield was again observed in the second reaction run for Ti/SBA-15.However, it has to be noted that the overall yield was lower, indicating that both the gold-containing and the gold-free catalyst deactivated during prolonged irradiation (Fig. S2).In addition to CH 4 , longer-chain hydrocarbons were produced in different quantities with both catalysts.While C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 were produced in the two subsequent reactions using the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, negligible amounts of longer-chain hydrocarbons were detected with Ti/SBA-15 in the first run (Fig. 3b).However, after deactivation of Ti/SBA-15, longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was also observed during the first reaction run (Fig. S2).In addition to the threefold increase in the yield of CH 4 , a threefold increase in ethane formation was observed in the subsequent reaction using Ti/SBA-15 (Fig. 3b).Again, these observations were reproducible in two consecutive runs after additional surface cleaning in humid He.We therefore suppose that under the present reaction conditions, a carbon pool is reproducibly built up during the first reaction run on the Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which cannot be removed by evacuation.This carbon pool can then participate in the product formation at the beginning of the second run.As a consequence, no time for the accumulation of intermediates is required in the second run, product formation starts earlier, and the total yield is higher.It is assumed that saturation of the catalyst surface with these less reactive carbon species is required to achieve high hydrocarbon yields.On the other hand, in the presence of Au, this carbon accumulation does not seem to occur and is either removed by evacuation or these carbon species are not reactive in subsequent reaction runs.Consequently, the yields observed in the second run are similar to the first ones.It is reasonable to assume that a higher hydrogenation rate in the presence of Au is responsible for the observed behavior of Au/Ti/SBA-15 after the first reaction run.In general, noble metals usually show high activity in hydrogenation reactions 20,21.In photocatalytic reactions, it is accepted that H 2 formation occurs at these electron-trapping sites, and more hydrogen is available in close proximity to gold facilitating hydrogenation 22,23.It should be noted that this is in agreement with the higher yield of H 2 that has been observed during photodeposition experiments.Visible-light assisted photoreactions in the presence of Au as the cause of the higher activity can be excluded as no product formation was observed when the samples were irradiated with Vis light. The 30 ppm of CH 4 produced within 5 h of irradiation in the presence of Au/Ti/SBA-15 is equivalent to 0.047 lmol resulting in 0.188 lmol/g cat /h or 9.4 lmol/g Ti /h.For Ti/SBA-15, the yield in the second run can be calculated to amount to 12.1 lmol/g Ti /h.The photon flux entering the reactor can be estimated, and thus, an apparent quantum yield for CH 4 for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 material can be calculated.In the range from 200 to 320 nm, the AQY is calculated to be 1.13 A 10 A3 , which appears to be low but is still in good agreement with values reported in the literature (Supporting information). To get further insight into the formation of the carbon pool, two consecutive reaction cycles were performed followed by irradiation of the photocatalysts in humid He.Surprisingly, on both catalyst systems, evolution of hydrocarbons was observed under irradiation in humid He (Fig. 4a).A steep increase in methane and longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was observed after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15.This is in line with the proposed formation of a carbon pool.For the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, a slower formation of C x H y is characteristic.The formation of hydrocarbons during irradiation in humid He, however, is a clear indication that a carbon pool is also created on Au/Ti/SBA-15, but to a lower extent, and its effects on hydrocarbon formation are less pronounced.Possibly, the nature or location of these carbon species is different. Finally, the influence of the water content on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was investigated using a reaction gas mixture containing 5 CO 2 /He only.Consequently, just pre-adsorbed water in the pores of the catalysts was available as reducing agent.The results of these water-free reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 4b.Prior and subsequent to these experiments, CO 2 reduction was performed using the reaction gas mixture containing gasphase water.These results are also included in Fig. 4b.Unexpectedly, less longer-chain hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of gas-phase water on both catalysts systems (Fig. 4c).The CH 4 yield is significantly higher for both catalysts.It should be noted that the carbon pool was already formed on the Ti/SBA-15 surface during a previously performed experiment with CO 2 and gas-phase water.Considering the overall produced carbon content (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 ), the carbon yield (C A ) increased by about 20 in the absence of water, which was mainly due to the higher CH 4 yields compensating the decrease in longer-chain hydrocarbon yields.The overall hydrocarbon yield was even increased in the consecutive experiment performed with the CO 2 /H 2 O mixture.For Ti/SBA-15, the CH 4 yield decreased, but the C 2 H 6 yield was drastically increased (Fig. 4c).A higher ethane yield and a higher methane yield were observed for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which might indicate that a carbon pool was formed on its surface under water-free feed conditions.Furthermore, these experiments show that the water content on the sample surface is sufficient to perform photocatalytic CO 2 reduction for at least 5 h of irradiation with both photocatalysts.In contrast to these observations, Anpo et al. observed the formation of larger quantities of CH 4 for high H 2 O/CO 2 ratios, and only small quantities of CH 4 were produced in the absence of gas-phase water 3.However, it is well known that water strongly binds to isolated Ti-species, and high temperatures are required to remove water effectively 24.Therefore, the surface of the photocatalysts should be saturated with H 2 O and, as a result, CO 2 reduction is feasible.In addition, high methane yields in water-poor conditions are in agreement with a C 2 H 6 /CH 4 ratio exceeding 1 for stoichiometric CO 2 /H 2 O mixtures observed by Mul et al. 7 and increasing ethane yield for higher water content reaction gas-mixtures as observed by Anpo et al. 3.Further studies are required to fully explain these observations.However, an option that should be considered is the inhibition of a subsequent photo-reforming reaction of the produced CH 4 in a water-free gasphase that may occur in the presence of gas-phase H 2 O.

The evolution of H 2 was constantly measured during the photodeposition of Au revealing that hydrogen evolution took place only in the presence of auric acid (Fig. 1).During irradiation, the Au precursor is reduced to metallic Au, which can be considered as a fast reaction.In the presence of metallic Au, H 2 is produced due to the photocatalytic reforming of aqueous methanol, in which methanol acts as hole scavenger.Presumably, metallic Au is the hydrogen evolution site.Therefore, this observation is a first indication for the successful deposition of Au nanoparticles onto Ti/SBA-15.However, to further prove the existence of Au nanoparticles, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy was employed showing a characteristic plasmon absorption peak of metallic Au at 550 nm 16,17 (for details see Section 3.5).From the plasmon maximum position, it can be assumed that the Au nanoparticles are smaller than or similar to 10 nm in size 17.Elemental analysis revealed that the obtained Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample contains 0.25 wt of Au corresponding to the amount supplied during photoassisted deposition. Therefore, all the supplied Au ions were successfully deposited onto the support material. The two different materials Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 were thoroughly cleaned by illumination in humid He under static conditions in the fully metal-sealed gas-phase photoreactor.Recently, Mul et al. showed that this pre-illumination procedure in the presence of water vapor is mandatory to achieve reliable results in the photocatalytic activity in gas-phase CO 2 reduction 7,18.During the cleaning procedure in humid He, mainly CH 4 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 were detected (Fig. 2), which is in good agreement with the carbon contaminations observed by Mul et al. 7.In addition to these hydrocarbons, methanol was observed for Au/Ti/SBA-15, which is most likely a result of the photodeposition procedure, in which methanol was used as sacrificial electron donor.However, the methanol signal decreased throughout prolonged irradiation, and it is likely that methanol was converted to CO 2 , which was also detected throughout prolonged irradiation in the Au photodeposition procedure. It is remarkable to note that the overall amount of carbon contaminations was higher than the contamination previously observed by Mul et al. 7.Therefore, subsequent cleaning steps were necessary to obtain a clean catalyst surface.In case of Ti/ SBA-15, four subsequent cleaning steps were conducted, whereas the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample was cleaned seven times for 7 h each.Additionally, Au/Ti/SBA-15-C was prepared by calcination at 250 C in synthetic air with the aim to reduce the number of necessary cleaning steps.This calcination temperature has previously been chosen for the calcination of PVA-protected gold colloids on metal oxides 19.However, four additional cleaning steps in humid He were still necessary to sufficiently remove the carbon contaminations.The decrease in the concentration of the three main contaminants CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 of each cleaning step can be represented with high accuracy as an exponential decay curve in case of the Au/Ti/SBA-15.This might be rationalized by the decreasing surface coverage of methanol in the subsequent cleaning steps which can be converted into methane in a two electron process. The hydrocarbon formation during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction within 7 h of illumination for Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 is shown in Fig. 3a.Except for the presence of CO 2 , the conditions of the photocatalytic process were similar to the conditions applied during the cleaning procedure (1500 mbar, 6000 ppm H 2 O, 200 W Hg/Xe lamp), and it can be assumed that no more contaminants desorb during the actual CO 2 reduction experiments.Thus, the detected hydrocarbons were unambiguously formed from CO 2 as carbon source. Obviously, in the first reaction run, the yield of CH 4 is significantly higher for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample which is in good agreement with observations by Anpo et al. 12, who detected higher methane yields in the presence of Pt co-catalysts.However, a subsequent reaction period without further pre-treatment revealed that a threefold increase in the CH 4 yield is observed for the Ti/SBA-15 sample, whereas the overall yield for the Au/Ti/ SBA-15 material is almost comparable to the first reaction run, and only a slightly lower yield was observed.Furthermore, it is evident that the yield of CH 4 after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15 resembles the value obtained after 7 h of irradiation in the first reaction run.The comparison between the Au/Ti/SBA-15 and the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample shows that the CH 4 yield is significantly lower for the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample (Fig. S2).Consequently, since calcinations affect the photocatalytic performance in a negative way, it is not possible to shorten the photocatalytic cleaning procedure by this means. After an additional surface cleaning of all samples in humid He, the performances of the different materials were reproduced.The CH 4 yields were similar for two subsequently performed reactions on Au/Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15-C.An increase in the CH 4 yield was again observed in the second reaction run for Ti/SBA-15.However, it has to be noted that the overall yield was lower, indicating that both the gold-containing and the gold-free catalyst deactivated during prolonged irradiation (Fig. S2).In addition to CH 4 , longer-chain hydrocarbons were produced in different quantities with both catalysts.While C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 were produced in the two subsequent reactions using the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, negligible amounts of longer-chain hydrocarbons were detected with Ti/SBA-15 in the first run (Fig. 3b).However, after deactivation of Ti/SBA-15, longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was also observed during the first reaction run (Fig. S2).In addition to the threefold increase in the yield of CH 4 , a threefold increase in ethane formation was observed in the subsequent reaction using Ti/SBA-15 (Fig. 3b).Again, these observations were reproducible in two consecutive runs after additional surface cleaning in humid He.We therefore suppose that under the present reaction conditions, a carbon pool is reproducibly built up during the first reaction run on the Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which cannot be removed by evacuation.This carbon pool can then participate in the product formation at the beginning of the second run.As a consequence, no time for the accumulation of intermediates is required in the second run, product formation starts earlier, and the total yield is higher.It is assumed that saturation of the catalyst surface with these less reactive carbon species is required to achieve high hydrocarbon yields.On the other hand, in the presence of Au, this carbon accumulation does not seem to occur and is either removed by evacuation or these carbon species are not reactive in subsequent reaction runs.Consequently, the yields observed in the second run are similar to the first ones.It is reasonable to assume that a higher hydrogenation rate in the presence of Au is responsible for the observed behavior of Au/Ti/SBA-15 after the first reaction run.In general, noble metals usually show high activity in hydrogenation reactions 20,21.In photocatalytic reactions, it is accepted that H 2 formation occurs at these electron-trapping sites, and more hydrogen is available in close proximity to gold facilitating hydrogenation 22,23.It should be noted that this is in agreement with the higher yield of H 2 that has been observed during photodeposition experiments.Visible-light assisted photoreactions in the presence of Au as the cause of the higher activity can be excluded as no product formation was observed when the samples were irradiated with Vis light. The 30 ppm of CH 4 produced within 5 h of irradiation in the presence of Au/Ti/SBA-15 is equivalent to 0.047 lmol resulting in 0.188 lmol/g cat /h or 9.4 lmol/g Ti /h.For Ti/SBA-15, the yield in the second run can be calculated to amount to 12.1 lmol/g Ti /h.The photon flux entering the reactor can be estimated, and thus, an apparent quantum yield for CH 4 for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 material can be calculated.In the range from 200 to 320 nm, the AQY is calculated to be 1.13 A 10 A3 , which appears to be low but is still in good agreement with values reported in the literature (Supporting information). To get further insight into the formation of the carbon pool, two consecutive reaction cycles were performed followed by irradiation of the photocatalysts in humid He.Surprisingly, on both catalyst systems, evolution of hydrocarbons was observed under irradiation in humid He (Fig. 4a).A steep increase in methane and longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was observed after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15.This is in line with the proposed formation of a carbon pool.For the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, a slower formation of C x H y is characteristic.The formation of hydrocarbons during irradiation in humid He, however, is a clear indication that a carbon pool is also created on Au/Ti/SBA-15, but to a lower extent, and its effects on hydrocarbon formation are less pronounced.Possibly, the nature or location of these carbon species is different. Finally, the influence of the water content on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was investigated using a reaction gas mixture containing 5 CO 2 /He only.Consequently, just pre-adsorbed water in the pores of the catalysts was available as reducing agent.The results of these water-free reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 4b.Prior and subsequent to these experiments, CO 2 reduction was performed using the reaction gas mixture containing gasphase water.These results are also included in Fig. 4b.Unexpectedly, less longer-chain hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of gas-phase water on both catalysts systems (Fig. 4c).The CH 4 yield is significantly higher for both catalysts.It should be noted that the carbon pool was already formed on the Ti/SBA-15 surface during a previously performed experiment with CO 2 and gas-phase water.Considering the overall produced carbon content (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 ), the carbon yield (C A ) increased by about 20 in the absence of water, which was mainly due to the higher CH 4 yields compensating the decrease in longer-chain hydrocarbon yields.The overall hydrocarbon yield was even increased in the consecutive experiment performed with the CO 2 /H 2 O mixture.For Ti/SBA-15, the CH 4 yield decreased, but the C 2 H 6 yield was drastically increased (Fig. 4c).A higher ethane yield and a higher methane yield were observed for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which might indicate that a carbon pool was formed on its surface under water-free feed conditions.Furthermore, these experiments show that the water content on the sample surface is sufficient to perform photocatalytic CO 2 reduction for at least 5 h of irradiation with both photocatalysts.In contrast to these observations, Anpo et al. observed the formation of larger quantities of CH 4 for high H 2 O/CO 2 ratios, and only small quantities of CH 4 were produced in the absence of gas-phase water 3.However, it is well known that water strongly binds to isolated Ti-species, and high temperatures are required to remove water effectively 24.Therefore, the surface of the photocatalysts should be saturated with H 2 O and, as a result, CO 2 reduction is feasible.In addition, high methane yields in water-poor conditions are in agreement with a C 2 H 6 /CH 4 ratio exceeding 1 for stoichiometric CO 2 /H 2 O mixtures observed by Mul et al. 7 and increasing ethane yield for higher water content reaction gas-mixtures as observed by Anpo et al. 3.Further studies are required to fully explain these observations.However, an option that should be considered is the inhibition of a subsequent photo-reforming reaction of the produced CH 4 in a water-free gasphase that may occur in the presence of gas-phase H 2 O. CO and H 2 may be produced due to this process, which then might be in-volved in the formation of higher hydrocarbons.Unfortunately, small amounts of CO and H 2 cannot be detected by the GC application used here.In terms of irradiation in water-free CO 2 , a lack of CO and H 2 could diminish the formation of higher hydrocarbons. In a related manner, a photoinduced cracking reaction of higher hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of larger amounts of methane, cannot be ruled out.Furthermore, an influence of the carbon pool in higher hydrocarbon production was observed.Thus, it should be considered that high water contents are required to hydrogenate these species.Without gas-phase water, partially hydrogenated species may instead remain adsorbed.Furthermore, the water content may influence the mobility of intermediates on the catalyst surface.A higher amount of water should lead to the formation of a physisorbed layer that almost resembles liquid water.In this layer, partially hydrogenated species may move more freely, while they are stuck in place without this layer. After reaction all samples were characterized by DRIFTS, UV-Vis and XPS and compared to the unreacted materials to get further insight into possible intermediates, the deactivation of the catalysts, and the carbon pool, which was accumulating during CO 2 reduction.The carbon content as determined by XPS analysis was similar for all the samples.Structural changes in the Ti-species within the course of gas-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction causing deactivation of the materials can be excluded comparing Ti/SBA-15 and Au/ Ti/SBA-15 before and after reaction (XPS results, Fig. S3).UV-Vis indicates a narrowing of the Au plasmon for Au/Ti/SBA-15 after reaction, which may be caused by different Ti-Au interactions (Fig. 5).One has to keep in mind that TiO x -species have the potential to alter the local environment of the Au particles 16,17.A narrowing of the Au plasmon peak was also observed in the Au/Ti/ SBA-15-C sample accompanied by an increase in intensity and a shift in the plasmon peak maximum to higher wavelength.This indicates a particle growth due to calcination (not shown).Therefore, the changes observed by UV-Vis spectroscopy might partially explain the activity decrease in Au/Ti/SBA-15. Difference IR spectra of the reacted and the fresh Ti/SBA-15 catalyst revealed that formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were present at the surface of Ti/SBA-15 after CO 2 reduction reaction (Fig. 6).The bands observed at 1685 and 2853 cm A1 are in good agreement with values of the m(CO) and m(CH 2 ) stretching modes of formaldehyde adsorbed at different surfaces 25262728. The intense band at 2972 cm A1 is representative for the asymmetric stretching (m a (CH 2 )) of paraformaldehyde, which is known to be obtained by the polymerization of formaldehyde at low temperatures 25,26,28.The assignment of the bands is clearly verified by the thermal stability of paraformaldehyde.Interestingly, less formaldehyde was detected for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, and the signals assigned to paraformaldehyde are shifted to higher wavenumbers (Fig. S4).Assuming that paraformaldehyde is the intermediate of higher hydrocarbon formation, it is likely that it is immediately available at the surface of the Au/Ti/SBA-15, catalyst and higher hydrocarbons can be produced, whereas at Ti/ SBA-15, paraformaldehyde is formed upon accumulation of formaldehyde at the surface and is not hydrogenated further.This may explain the inhibition of ethane production on Ti/SBA-15, as observed during the first reaction run.Nevertheless, the IR spectroscopic results indicate that the carbon pool most likely consists of adsorbed (para-)formaldehyde. In the literature, different reaction mechanisms are proposed for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Anpo et al. 4 propose a mechanism in which CO 2 and H 2 O decompose competitively into C-and OH-radicals at the excited Ti-O centers, presumably with CO as an intermediate species.Similar observations were recently reported for crystalline TiO 2 by Zapol et al. 29.Mul et al. 7 followed the proposed route by Frei et al. 6 who suggested a mechanism involving CO in the initial state and formaldehyde, which is converted to CH 4 and longer-chain hydrocarbons in the presence of water.A Ti-hydroperoxide species is assumed to be essential in this process.Based on the results obtained within this study, the mechanism proposed by Mul et al. 7 and Frei et al. 6 is considered more likely as (1) formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were observed by diffuse reflectance IR measurements, (2) higher CH 4 yields are observed for water-poor reaction conditions, and (3) CO 2 is weakly interacting with isolated Ti-species 13, whereas water is strongly bound to the surface."}, {"llm generation": "gold", "source": "In photocatalytic reactions, it is accepted that H 2 formation occurs at these electron-trapping sites, and more hydrogen is available in close proximity to gold facilitating hydrogenation 22,23.", "context": "The preparation and in-depth characterization of the Ti/SBA-15 material was described in detail elsewhere 13.In short, it was proven by UV-Vis, X-ray photoelectron, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy that tetrahedrally coordinated TiO 4 -species were obtained within the mesoporous SBA-15 matrix.The Ti-content was confirmed to be 2 wt resulting in a coverage of 0.3 Ti/nm 2 .

Finally, the influence of the water content on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was investigated using a reaction gas mixture containing 5 CO 2 /He only.Consequently, just pre-adsorbed water in the pores of the catalysts was available as reducing agent.The results of these water-free reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 4b.Prior and subsequent to these experiments, CO 2 reduction was performed using the reaction gas mixture containing gasphase water.These results are also included in Fig. 4b.Unexpectedly, less longer-chain hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of gas-phase water on both catalysts systems (Fig. 4c).The CH 4 yield is significantly higher for both catalysts.It should be noted that the carbon pool was already formed on the Ti/SBA-15 surface during a previously performed experiment with CO 2 and gas-phase water.Considering the overall produced carbon content (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 ), the carbon yield (C A ) increased by about 20 in the absence of water, which was mainly due to the higher CH 4 yields compensating the decrease in longer-chain hydrocarbon yields.The overall hydrocarbon yield was even increased in the consecutive experiment performed with the CO 2 /H 2 O mixture.For Ti/SBA-15, the CH 4 yield decreased, but the C 2 H 6 yield was drastically increased (Fig. 4c).A higher ethane yield and a higher methane yield were observed for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which might indicate that a carbon pool was formed on its surface under water-free feed conditions.Furthermore, these experiments show that the water content on the sample surface is sufficient to perform photocatalytic CO 2 reduction for at least 5 h of irradiation with both photocatalysts.In contrast to these observations, Anpo et al. observed the formation of larger quantities of CH 4 for high H 2 O/CO 2 ratios, and only small quantities of CH 4 were produced in the absence of gas-phase water 3.However, it is well known that water strongly binds to isolated Ti-species, and high temperatures are required to remove water effectively 24.Therefore, the surface of the photocatalysts should be saturated with H 2 O and, as a result, CO 2 reduction is feasible.In addition, high methane yields in water-poor conditions are in agreement with a C 2 H 6 /CH 4 ratio exceeding 1 for stoichiometric CO 2 /H 2 O mixtures observed by Mul et al. 7 and increasing ethane yield for higher water content reaction gas-mixtures as observed by Anpo et al. 3.Further studies are required to fully explain these observations.However, an option that should be considered is the inhibition of a subsequent photo-reforming reaction of the produced CH 4 in a water-free gasphase that may occur in the presence of gas-phase H 2 O. CO and H 2 may be produced due to this process, which then might be in-volved in the formation of higher hydrocarbons.Unfortunately, small amounts of CO and H 2 cannot be detected by the GC application used here.In terms of irradiation in water-free CO 2 , a lack of CO and H 2 could diminish the formation of higher hydrocarbons. In a related manner, a photoinduced cracking reaction of higher hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of larger amounts of methane, cannot be ruled out.Furthermore, an influence of the carbon pool in higher hydrocarbon production was observed.Thus, it should be considered that high water contents are required to hydrogenate these species.Without gas-phase water, partially hydrogenated species may instead remain adsorbed.Furthermore, the water content may influence the mobility of intermediates on the catalyst surface.A higher amount of water should lead to the formation of a physisorbed layer that almost resembles liquid water.In this layer, partially hydrogenated species may move more freely, while they are stuck in place without this layer. After reaction all samples were characterized by DRIFTS, UV-Vis and XPS and compared to the unreacted materials to get further insight into possible intermediates, the deactivation of the catalysts, and the carbon pool, which was accumulating during CO 2 reduction.The carbon content as determined by XPS analysis was similar for all the samples.Structural changes in the Ti-species within the course of gas-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction causing deactivation of the materials can be excluded comparing Ti/SBA-15 and Au/ Ti/SBA-15 before and after reaction (XPS results, Fig. S3).UV-Vis indicates a narrowing of the Au plasmon for Au/Ti/SBA-15 after reaction, which may be caused by different Ti-Au interactions (Fig. 5).One has to keep in mind that TiO x -species have the potential to alter the local environment of the Au particles 16,17.A narrowing of the Au plasmon peak was also observed in the Au/Ti/ SBA-15-C sample accompanied by an increase in intensity and a shift in the plasmon peak maximum to higher wavelength.This indicates a particle growth due to calcination (not shown).Therefore, the changes observed by UV-Vis spectroscopy might partially explain the activity decrease in Au/Ti/SBA-15. Difference IR spectra of the reacted and the fresh Ti/SBA-15 catalyst revealed that formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were present at the surface of Ti/SBA-15 after CO 2 reduction reaction (Fig. 6).The bands observed at 1685 and 2853 cm A1 are in good agreement with values of the m(CO) and m(CH 2 ) stretching modes of formaldehyde adsorbed at different surfaces 25262728. The intense band at 2972 cm A1 is representative for the asymmetric stretching (m a (CH 2 )) of paraformaldehyde, which is known to be obtained by the polymerization of formaldehyde at low temperatures 25,26,28.The assignment of the bands is clearly verified by the thermal stability of paraformaldehyde.Interestingly, less formaldehyde was detected for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, and the signals assigned to paraformaldehyde are shifted to higher wavenumbers (Fig. S4).Assuming that paraformaldehyde is the intermediate of higher hydrocarbon formation, it is likely that it is immediately available at the surface of the Au/Ti/SBA-15, catalyst and higher hydrocarbons can be produced, whereas at Ti/ SBA-15, paraformaldehyde is formed upon accumulation of formaldehyde at the surface and is not hydrogenated further.This may explain the inhibition of ethane production on Ti/SBA-15, as observed during the first reaction run.Nevertheless, the IR spectroscopic results indicate that the carbon pool most likely consists of adsorbed (para-)formaldehyde. In the literature, different reaction mechanisms are proposed for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Anpo et al. 4 propose a mechanism in which CO 2 and H 2 O decompose competitively into C-and OH-radicals at the excited Ti-O centers, presumably with CO as an intermediate species.Similar observations were recently reported for crystalline TiO 2 by Zapol et al. 29.Mul et al. 7 followed the proposed route by Frei et al. 6 who suggested a mechanism involving CO in the initial state and formaldehyde, which is converted to CH 4 and longer-chain hydrocarbons in the presence of water.A Ti-hydroperoxide species is assumed to be essential in this process.Based on the results obtained within this study, the mechanism proposed by Mul et al. 7 and Frei et al. 6 is considered more likely as (1) formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were observed by diffuse reflectance IR measurements, (2) higher CH 4 yields are observed for water-poor reaction conditions, and (3) CO 2 is weakly interacting with isolated Ti-species 13, whereas water is strongly bound to the surface."}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "UV", "source": "A 200 W Hg/Xe (Newport Oriel) lamp is used to irradiate the sample through a quartz window allowing for high transmissions of high-energy UV light.", "context": "The synthesis of SBA-15 and the grafting procedure for obtaining isolated TiO x -species on the SBA-15 surface have been described in detail elsewhere 13.

The evolution of H 2 was constantly measured during the photodeposition of Au revealing that hydrogen evolution took place only in the presence of auric acid (Fig. 1).During irradiation, the Au precursor is reduced to metallic Au, which can be considered as a fast reaction.In the presence of metallic Au, H 2 is produced due to the photocatalytic reforming of aqueous methanol, in which methanol acts as hole scavenger.Presumably, metallic Au is the hydrogen evolution site.Therefore, this observation is a first indication for the successful deposition of Au nanoparticles onto Ti/SBA-15.However, to further prove the existence of Au nanoparticles, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy was employed showing a characteristic plasmon absorption peak of metallic Au at 550 nm 16,17 (for details see Section 3.5).From the plasmon maximum position, it can be assumed that the Au nanoparticles are smaller than or similar to 10 nm in size 17.Elemental analysis revealed that the obtained Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample contains 0.25 wt of Au corresponding to the amount supplied during photoassisted deposition. Therefore, all the supplied Au ions were successfully deposited onto the support material. The two different materials Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 were thoroughly cleaned by illumination in humid He under static conditions in the fully metal-sealed gas-phase photoreactor.Recently, Mul et al. showed that this pre-illumination procedure in the presence of water vapor is mandatory to achieve reliable results in the photocatalytic activity in gas-phase CO 2 reduction 7,18.During the cleaning procedure in humid He, mainly CH 4 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 were detected (Fig. 2), which is in good agreement with the carbon contaminations observed by Mul et al. 7.In addition to these hydrocarbons, methanol was observed for Au/Ti/SBA-15, which is most likely a result of the photodeposition procedure, in which methanol was used as sacrificial electron donor.However, the methanol signal decreased throughout prolonged irradiation, and it is likely that methanol was converted to CO 2 , which was also detected throughout prolonged irradiation in the Au photodeposition procedure. It is remarkable to note that the overall amount of carbon contaminations was higher than the contamination previously observed by Mul et al. 7.Therefore, subsequent cleaning steps were necessary to obtain a clean catalyst surface.In case of Ti/ SBA-15, four subsequent cleaning steps were conducted, whereas the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample was cleaned seven times for 7 h each.Additionally, Au/Ti/SBA-15-C was prepared by calcination at 250 C in synthetic air with the aim to reduce the number of necessary cleaning steps.This calcination temperature has previously been chosen for the calcination of PVA-protected gold colloids on metal oxides 19.However, four additional cleaning steps in humid He were still necessary to sufficiently remove the carbon contaminations.The decrease in the concentration of the three main contaminants CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 of each cleaning step can be represented with high accuracy as an exponential decay curve in case of the Au/Ti/SBA-15.This might be rationalized by the decreasing surface coverage of methanol in the subsequent cleaning steps which can be converted into methane in a two electron process. The hydrocarbon formation during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction within 7 h of illumination for Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 is shown in Fig. 3a.Except for the presence of CO 2 , the conditions of the photocatalytic process were similar to the conditions applied during the cleaning procedure (1500 mbar, 6000 ppm H 2 O, 200 W Hg/Xe lamp), and it can be assumed that no more contaminants desorb during the actual CO 2 reduction experiments.Thus, the detected hydrocarbons were unambiguously formed from CO 2 as carbon source. Obviously, in the first reaction run, the yield of CH 4 is significantly higher for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample which is in good agreement with observations by Anpo et al. 12, who detected higher methane yields in the presence of Pt co-catalysts.However, a subsequent reaction period without further pre-treatment revealed that a threefold increase in the CH 4 yield is observed for the Ti/SBA-15 sample, whereas the overall yield for the Au/Ti/ SBA-15 material is almost comparable to the first reaction run, and only a slightly lower yield was observed.Furthermore, it is evident that the yield of CH 4 after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15 resembles the value obtained after 7 h of irradiation in the first reaction run.The comparison between the Au/Ti/SBA-15 and the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample shows that the CH 4 yield is significantly lower for the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample (Fig. S2).Consequently, since calcinations affect the photocatalytic performance in a negative way, it is not possible to shorten the photocatalytic cleaning procedure by this means. After an additional surface cleaning of all samples in humid He, the performances of the different materials were reproduced.The CH 4 yields were similar for two subsequently performed reactions on Au/Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15-C.An increase in the CH 4 yield was again observed in the second reaction run for Ti/SBA-15.However, it has to be noted that the overall yield was lower, indicating that both the gold-containing and the gold-free catalyst deactivated during prolonged irradiation (Fig. S2).In addition to CH 4 , longer-chain hydrocarbons were produced in different quantities with both catalysts.While C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 were produced in the two subsequent reactions using the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, negligible amounts of longer-chain hydrocarbons were detected with Ti/SBA-15 in the first run (Fig. 3b).However, after deactivation of Ti/SBA-15, longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was also observed during the first reaction run (Fig. S2).In addition to the threefold increase in the yield of CH 4 , a threefold increase in ethane formation was observed in the subsequent reaction using Ti/SBA-15 (Fig. 3b).Again, these observations were reproducible in two consecutive runs after additional surface cleaning in humid He.We therefore suppose that under the present reaction conditions, a carbon pool is reproducibly built up during the first reaction run on the Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which cannot be removed by evacuation.This carbon pool can then participate in the product formation at the beginning of the second run.As a consequence, no time for the accumulation of intermediates is required in the second run, product formation starts earlier, and the total yield is higher.It is assumed that saturation of the catalyst surface with these less reactive carbon species is required to achieve high hydrocarbon yields.On the other hand, in the presence of Au, this carbon accumulation does not seem to occur and is either removed by evacuation or these carbon species are not reactive in subsequent reaction runs.Consequently, the yields observed in the second run are similar to the first ones.It is reasonable to assume that a higher hydrogenation rate in the presence of Au is responsible for the observed behavior of Au/Ti/SBA-15 after the first reaction run.In general, noble metals usually show high activity in hydrogenation reactions 20,21.In photocatalytic reactions, it is accepted that H 2 formation occurs at these electron-trapping sites, and more hydrogen is available in close proximity to gold facilitating hydrogenation 22,23.It should be noted that this is in agreement with the higher yield of H 2 that has been observed during photodeposition experiments.Visible-light assisted photoreactions in the presence of Au as the cause of the higher activity can be excluded as no product formation was observed when the samples were irradiated with Vis light. The 30 ppm of CH 4 produced within 5 h of irradiation in the presence of Au/Ti/SBA-15 is equivalent to 0.047 lmol resulting in 0.188 lmol/g cat /h or 9.4 lmol/g Ti /h.For Ti/SBA-15, the yield in the second run can be calculated to amount to 12.1 lmol/g Ti /h.The photon flux entering the reactor can be estimated, and thus, an apparent quantum yield for CH 4 for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 material can be calculated.In the range from 200 to 320 nm, the AQY is calculated to be 1.13 A 10 A3 , which appears to be low but is still in good agreement with values reported in the literature (Supporting information). To get further insight into the formation of the carbon pool, two consecutive reaction cycles were performed followed by irradiation of the photocatalysts in humid He.Surprisingly, on both catalyst systems, evolution of hydrocarbons was observed under irradiation in humid He (Fig. 4a).A steep increase in methane and longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was observed after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15.This is in line with the proposed formation of a carbon pool.For the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, a slower formation of C x H y is characteristic.The formation of hydrocarbons during irradiation in humid He, however, is a clear indication that a carbon pool is also created on Au/Ti/SBA-15, but to a lower extent, and its effects on hydrocarbon formation are less pronounced.Possibly, the nature or location of these carbon species is different. Finally, the influence of the water content on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was investigated using a reaction gas mixture containing 5 CO 2 /He only.Consequently, just pre-adsorbed water in the pores of the catalysts was available as reducing agent.The results of these water-free reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 4b.Prior and subsequent to these experiments, CO 2 reduction was performed using the reaction gas mixture containing gasphase water.These results are also included in Fig. 4b.Unexpectedly, less longer-chain hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of gas-phase water on both catalysts systems (Fig. 4c).The CH 4 yield is significantly higher for both catalysts.It should be noted that the carbon pool was already formed on the Ti/SBA-15 surface during a previously performed experiment with CO 2 and gas-phase water.Considering the overall produced carbon content (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 ), the carbon yield (C A ) increased by about 20 in the absence of water, which was mainly due to the higher CH 4 yields compensating the decrease in longer-chain hydrocarbon yields.The overall hydrocarbon yield was even increased in the consecutive experiment performed with the CO 2 /H 2 O mixture.For Ti/SBA-15, the CH 4 yield decreased, but the C 2 H 6 yield was drastically increased (Fig. 4c).A higher ethane yield and a higher methane yield were observed for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which might indicate that a carbon pool was formed on its surface under water-free feed conditions.Furthermore, these experiments show that the water content on the sample surface is sufficient to perform photocatalytic CO 2 reduction for at least 5 h of irradiation with both photocatalysts.In contrast to these observations, Anpo et al. observed the formation of larger quantities of CH 4 for high H 2 O/CO 2 ratios, and only small quantities of CH 4 were produced in the absence of gas-phase water 3.However, it is well known that water strongly binds to isolated Ti-species, and high temperatures are required to remove water effectively 24.Therefore, the surface of the photocatalysts should be saturated with H 2 O and, as a result, CO 2 reduction is feasible.In addition, high methane yields in water-poor conditions are in agreement with a C 2 H 6 /CH 4 ratio exceeding 1 for stoichiometric CO 2 /H 2 O mixtures observed by Mul et al. 7 and increasing ethane yield for higher water content reaction gas-mixtures as observed by Anpo et al. 3.Further studies are required to fully explain these observations.However, an option that should be considered is the inhibition of a subsequent photo-reforming reaction of the produced CH 4 in a water-free gasphase that may occur in the presence of gas-phase H 2 O. CO and H 2 may be produced due to this process, which then might be in-volved in the formation of higher hydrocarbons.Unfortunately, small amounts of CO and H 2 cannot be detected by the GC application used here.In terms of irradiation in water-free CO 2 , a lack of CO and H 2 could diminish the formation of higher hydrocarbons. In a related manner, a photoinduced cracking reaction of higher hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of larger amounts of methane, cannot be ruled out.Furthermore, an influence of the carbon pool in higher hydrocarbon production was observed.Thus, it should be considered that high water contents are required to hydrogenate these species.Without gas-phase water, partially hydrogenated species may instead remain adsorbed.Furthermore, the water content may influence the mobility of intermediates on the catalyst surface.A higher amount of water should lead to the formation of a physisorbed layer that almost resembles liquid water.In this layer, partially hydrogenated species may move more freely, while they are stuck in place without this layer. After reaction all samples were characterized by DRIFTS, UV-Vis and XPS and compared to the unreacted materials to get further insight into possible intermediates, the deactivation of the catalysts, and the carbon pool, which was accumulating during CO 2 reduction.The carbon content as determined by XPS analysis was similar for all the samples.Structural changes in the Ti-species within the course of gas-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction causing deactivation of the materials can be excluded comparing Ti/SBA-15 and Au/ Ti/SBA-15 before and after reaction (XPS results, Fig. S3).UV-Vis indicates a narrowing of the Au plasmon for Au/Ti/SBA-15 after reaction, which may be caused by different Ti-Au interactions (Fig. 5).One has to keep in mind that TiO x -species have the potential to alter the local environment of the Au particles 16,17.A narrowing of the Au plasmon peak was also observed in the Au/Ti/ SBA-15-C sample accompanied by an increase in intensity and a shift in the plasmon peak maximum to higher wavelength.This indicates a particle growth due to calcination (not shown).Therefore, the changes observed by UV-Vis spectroscopy might partially explain the activity decrease in Au/Ti/SBA-15. Difference IR spectra of the reacted and the fresh Ti/SBA-15 catalyst revealed that formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were present at the surface of Ti/SBA-15 after CO 2 reduction reaction (Fig. 6).The bands observed at 1685 and 2853 cm A1 are in good agreement with values of the m(CO) and m(CH 2 ) stretching modes of formaldehyde adsorbed at different surfaces 25262728. The intense band at 2972 cm A1 is representative for the asymmetric stretching (m a (CH 2 )) of paraformaldehyde, which is known to be obtained by the polymerization of formaldehyde at low temperatures 25,26,28.The assignment of the bands is clearly verified by the thermal stability of paraformaldehyde.Interestingly, less formaldehyde was detected for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, and the signals assigned to paraformaldehyde are shifted to higher wavenumbers (Fig. S4).Assuming that paraformaldehyde is the intermediate of higher hydrocarbon formation, it is likely that it is immediately available at the surface of the Au/Ti/SBA-15, catalyst and higher hydrocarbons can be produced, whereas at Ti/ SBA-15, paraformaldehyde is formed upon accumulation of formaldehyde at the surface and is not hydrogenated further.This may explain the inhibition of ethane production on Ti/SBA-15, as observed during the first reaction run.Nevertheless, the IR spectroscopic results indicate that the carbon pool most likely consists of adsorbed (para-)formaldehyde. In the literature, different reaction mechanisms are proposed for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Anpo et al. 4 propose a mechanism in which CO 2 and H 2 O decompose competitively into C-and OH-radicals at the excited Ti-O centers, presumably with CO as an intermediate species.Similar observations were recently reported for crystalline TiO 2 by Zapol et al. 29.Mul et al. 7 followed the proposed route by Frei et al. 6 who suggested a mechanism involving CO in the initial state and formaldehyde, which is converted to CH 4 and longer-chain hydrocarbons in the presence of water.A Ti-hydroperoxide species is assumed to be essential in this process.Based on the results obtained within this study, the mechanism proposed by Mul et al. 7 and Frei et al. 6 is considered more likely as (1) formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were observed by diffuse reflectance IR measurements, (2) higher CH 4 yields are observed for water-poor reaction conditions, and (3) CO 2 is weakly interacting with isolated Ti-species 13, whereas water is strongly bound to the surface."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Mercury-Xenon", "source": "A 200 W Hg/Xe (Newport Oriel) lamp is used to irradiate the sample through a quartz window allowing for high transmissions of high-energy UV light.", "context": "The synthesis of SBA-15 and the grafting procedure for obtaining isolated TiO x -species on the SBA-15 surface have been described in detail elsewhere 13. Photodeposition of Au was performed in a continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor equipped with a 700 W Hg immersion lamp cooled by water circulating in a double wall jacket 11.During photodeposition, the concentration of CO 2 , O 2 , and H 2 was analyzed with a non-dispersive IR photometer, a paramagnetic and a thermal conductivity detector (XStream, Emerson Process Management), respectively.350 mg of catalyst was dispersed in a solution of 550 ml dest.H 2 O and 50 ml methanol.The reactor was deaerated for 60 min using pure N 2 prior to irradiation to obtain reliable H 2 concentrations due to the photocatalytic methanol reforming and to avoid the reverse reaction of hydrogen and oxygen.The activity of Ti/SBA was evaluated by irradiation for 60 min in the absence of the Au precursor.3.5 ml of a 1.5 A 10 A3 molar auric acid solution (HAuCl 4 99.9,Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the suspension, and the reactor was again deaerated for 60 min using pure N 2 .Photodeposition was performed at 30 C with 50 irradiation power (350 W) for 2.5 h.After successful photodeposition, the materials were filtered and freeze-dried over night. The flow scheme of the CO 2 photoreactor setup is presented in Fig. S1.The main elements of this setup are the gas supply, the saturator, the reactor, the analysis devices (GC and QMS), and the pumping system.The home-made gas-phase photoreactor with a volume of approximately 27 ml is constructed on the basis of the design presented by Grimes et al. 14,15.The reactor is fully metal-sealed and can be pumped down to a pressure of 10 A8 mbar.While two separate cooling water circuits control the reactor and the saturator temperature, the gas lines can be heated to avoid water condensation.A sample is spread on glass tray on the bottom of the reactor to obtain a homogeneous light distribution.A 200 W Hg/Xe (Newport Oriel) lamp is used to irradiate the sample through a quartz window allowing for high transmissions of high-energy UV light.Thus, the light irradiance at the sample is 200 mW/cm 2 or 110 mW/cm 2 when a 320 nm cutoff filter is used.Reactions can be performed either in continuous or in batch mode.For this purpose, product gases can be analyzed by QMS (Balzers, Omnistar) in continuous mode and by a GC (Shimadzu 14B) in batch mode.Trace gas analysis is performed with the GC, which is equipped with TCD and FID detectors.Two Porapak N columns and one molecular sieve column are used for separation.Calibration of the GC was performed using a standard gas mixture containing 1000 ppm C 1 -C 5 hydrocarbons and 10 of nitrogen balanced by He (Air Liquide).It was confirmed that the concentration of C1-C4 hydrocarbons can be analyzed reliably down to a concentration of 1 ppm, and the standard deviation for the different hydrocarbon compounds was derived to be below 5. The samples were thoroughly pre-treated in humid He under UV irradiation to remove surface contaminations.The cleaning procedure was repeated until carbon contaminations were sufficiently removed (5 ppm) from the sample surface. CO 2 reduction experiments were performed under static conditions in an atmosphere of 5 CO 2 and 6000 ppm water, which was balanced by He.These conditions were achieved by saturating a CO 2 /He stream with water at 273 K.A CO 2 excess was chosen because of the unfavorable interaction of CO 2 with the isolated titanate species.The initial pressure was adjusted to 1500 mbar.The hydrocarbon formation under illumination with a 200 W Hg/ Xe lamp was monitored during a period of 7 h.For this purpose, samples were taken for GC analysis after 1, 5, and 7 h.The decrease in pressure during sampling was taken into account by normalization of the obtained signals to N 2 used as an internal standard.After reaction, the reactor was pumped down to 5 A 10 A2 mbar and flushed with high purity He.Blank experiments revealed that no hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of a photocatalyst or in absence of high-energy UV light, which was excluded using a 435 nm cutoff filter. Characterization of the samples by UV-Vis spectroscopy and XPS was performed according to previous measurements described in detail elsewhere 13. DRIFT spectra of the samples were recorded at different temperatures between RT and 400 C to remove surface-bound water.Samples were heated with a rate of 5 K/min.At 120 C, the temperature was kept constant, while the spectra were measured.The obtained spectra were first converted to log(1/R) and then normalized to the absorption of the harmonic vibration of SiO 2 , which can be found in the region between 2100 cm A1 and 1700 cm A1 .Diamond powder was used as diluent due to its chemical inertness in a 1:1 ratio (by weight) for the IR spectroscopic measurements (particle size 30-40 lm, Winter Quality Tools)."}, {"llm generation": "Hg/Xe lamp", "source": "Except for the presence of CO 2 , the conditions of the photocatalytic process were similar to the conditions applied during the cleaning procedure (1500 mbar, 6000 ppm H 2 O, 200 W Hg/Xe lamp), and it can be assumed that no more contaminants desorb during the actual CO 2 reduction experiments.", "context": "The preparation and in-depth characterization of the Ti/SBA-15 material was described in detail elsewhere 13.In short, it was proven by UV-Vis, X-ray photoelectron, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy that tetrahedrally coordinated TiO 4 -species were obtained within the mesoporous SBA-15 matrix.The Ti-content was confirmed to be 2 wt resulting in a coverage of 0.3 Ti/nm 2 . The evolution of H 2 was constantly measured during the photodeposition of Au revealing that hydrogen evolution took place only in the presence of auric acid (Fig. 1).During irradiation, the Au precursor is reduced to metallic Au, which can be considered as a fast reaction.In the presence of metallic Au, H 2 is produced due to the photocatalytic reforming of aqueous methanol, in which methanol acts as hole scavenger.Presumably, metallic Au is the hydrogen evolution site.Therefore, this observation is a first indication for the successful deposition of Au nanoparticles onto Ti/SBA-15.However, to further prove the existence of Au nanoparticles, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy was employed showing a characteristic plasmon absorption peak of metallic Au at 550 nm 16,17 (for details see Section 3.5).From the plasmon maximum position, it can be assumed that the Au nanoparticles are smaller than or similar to 10 nm in size 17.Elemental analysis revealed that the obtained Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample contains 0.25 wt of Au corresponding to the amount supplied during photoassisted deposition. Therefore, all the supplied Au ions were successfully deposited onto the support material. The two different materials Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 were thoroughly cleaned by illumination in humid He under static conditions in the fully metal-sealed gas-phase photoreactor.Recently, Mul et al. showed that this pre-illumination procedure in the presence of water vapor is mandatory to achieve reliable results in the photocatalytic activity in gas-phase CO 2 reduction 7,18.During the cleaning procedure in humid He, mainly CH 4 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 were detected (Fig. 2), which is in good agreement with the carbon contaminations observed by Mul et al. 7.In addition to these hydrocarbons, methanol was observed for Au/Ti/SBA-15, which is most likely a result of the photodeposition procedure, in which methanol was used as sacrificial electron donor.However, the methanol signal decreased throughout prolonged irradiation, and it is likely that methanol was converted to CO 2 , which was also detected throughout prolonged irradiation in the Au photodeposition procedure. It is remarkable to note that the overall amount of carbon contaminations was higher than the contamination previously observed by Mul et al. 7.Therefore, subsequent cleaning steps were necessary to obtain a clean catalyst surface.In case of Ti/ SBA-15, four subsequent cleaning steps were conducted, whereas the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample was cleaned seven times for 7 h each.Additionally, Au/Ti/SBA-15-C was prepared by calcination at 250 C in synthetic air with the aim to reduce the number of necessary cleaning steps.This calcination temperature has previously been chosen for the calcination of PVA-protected gold colloids on metal oxides 19.However, four additional cleaning steps in humid He were still necessary to sufficiently remove the carbon contaminations.The decrease in the concentration of the three main contaminants CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 of each cleaning step can be represented with high accuracy as an exponential decay curve in case of the Au/Ti/SBA-15.This might be rationalized by the decreasing surface coverage of methanol in the subsequent cleaning steps which can be converted into methane in a two electron process. The hydrocarbon formation during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction within 7 h of illumination for Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 is shown in Fig. 3a.Except for the presence of CO 2 , the conditions of the photocatalytic process were similar to the conditions applied during the cleaning procedure (1500 mbar, 6000 ppm H 2 O, 200 W Hg/Xe lamp), and it can be assumed that no more contaminants desorb during the actual CO 2 reduction experiments.Thus, the detected hydrocarbons were unambiguously formed from CO 2 as carbon source. Obviously, in the first reaction run, the yield of CH 4 is significantly higher for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample which is in good agreement with observations by Anpo et al. 12, who detected higher methane yields in the presence of Pt co-catalysts.However, a subsequent reaction period without further pre-treatment revealed that a threefold increase in the CH 4 yield is observed for the Ti/SBA-15 sample, whereas the overall yield for the Au/Ti/ SBA-15 material is almost comparable to the first reaction run, and only a slightly lower yield was observed.Furthermore, it is evident that the yield of CH 4 after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15 resembles the value obtained after 7 h of irradiation in the first reaction run.The comparison between the Au/Ti/SBA-15 and the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample shows that the CH 4 yield is significantly lower for the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample (Fig. S2).Consequently, since calcinations affect the photocatalytic performance in a negative way, it is not possible to shorten the photocatalytic cleaning procedure by this means. After an additional surface cleaning of all samples in humid He, the performances of the different materials were reproduced.The CH 4 yields were similar for two subsequently performed reactions on Au/Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15-C.An increase in the CH 4 yield was again observed in the second reaction run for Ti/SBA-15.However, it has to be noted that the overall yield was lower, indicating that both the gold-containing and the gold-free catalyst deactivated during prolonged irradiation (Fig. S2).In addition to CH 4 , longer-chain hydrocarbons were produced in different quantities with both catalysts.While C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 were produced in the two subsequent reactions using the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, negligible amounts of longer-chain hydrocarbons were detected with Ti/SBA-15 in the first run (Fig. 3b).However, after deactivation of Ti/SBA-15, longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was also observed during the first reaction run (Fig. S2).In addition to the threefold increase in the yield of CH 4 , a threefold increase in ethane formation was observed in the subsequent reaction using Ti/SBA-15 (Fig. 3b).Again, these observations were reproducible in two consecutive runs after additional surface cleaning in humid He.We therefore suppose that under the present reaction conditions, a carbon pool is reproducibly built up during the first reaction run on the Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which cannot be removed by evacuation.This carbon pool can then participate in the product formation at the beginning of the second run.As a consequence, no time for the accumulation of intermediates is required in the second run, product formation starts earlier, and the total yield is higher.It is assumed that saturation of the catalyst surface with these less reactive carbon species is required to achieve high hydrocarbon yields.On the other hand, in the presence of Au, this carbon accumulation does not seem to occur and is either removed by evacuation or these carbon species are not reactive in subsequent reaction runs.Consequently, the yields observed in the second run are similar to the first ones.It is reasonable to assume that a higher hydrogenation rate in the presence of Au is responsible for the observed behavior of Au/Ti/SBA-15 after the first reaction run.In general, noble metals usually show high activity in hydrogenation reactions 20,21.In photocatalytic reactions, it is accepted that H 2 formation occurs at these electron-trapping sites, and more hydrogen is available in close proximity to gold facilitating hydrogenation 22,23.It should be noted that this is in agreement with the higher yield of H 2 that has been observed during photodeposition experiments.Visible-light assisted photoreactions in the presence of Au as the cause of the higher activity can be excluded as no product formation was observed when the samples were irradiated with Vis light. The 30 ppm of CH 4 produced within 5 h of irradiation in the presence of Au/Ti/SBA-15 is equivalent to 0.047 lmol resulting in 0.188 lmol/g cat /h or 9.4 lmol/g Ti /h.For Ti/SBA-15, the yield in the second run can be calculated to amount to 12.1 lmol/g Ti /h.The photon flux entering the reactor can be estimated, and thus, an apparent quantum yield for CH 4 for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 material can be calculated.In the range from 200 to 320 nm, the AQY is calculated to be 1.13 A 10 A3 , which appears to be low but is still in good agreement with values reported in the literature (Supporting information). To get further insight into the formation of the carbon pool, two consecutive reaction cycles were performed followed by irradiation of the photocatalysts in humid He.Surprisingly, on both catalyst systems, evolution of hydrocarbons was observed under irradiation in humid He (Fig. 4a).A steep increase in methane and longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was observed after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15.This is in line with the proposed formation of a carbon pool.For the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, a slower formation of C x H y is characteristic.The formation of hydrocarbons during irradiation in humid He, however, is a clear indication that a carbon pool is also created on Au/Ti/SBA-15, but to a lower extent, and its effects on hydrocarbon formation are less pronounced.Possibly, the nature or location of these carbon species is different. Finally, the influence of the water content on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was investigated using a reaction gas mixture containing 5 CO 2 /He only.Consequently, just pre-adsorbed water in the pores of the catalysts was available as reducing agent.The results of these water-free reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 4b.Prior and subsequent to these experiments, CO 2 reduction was performed using the reaction gas mixture containing gasphase water.These results are also included in Fig. 4b.Unexpectedly, less longer-chain hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of gas-phase water on both catalysts systems (Fig. 4c).The CH 4 yield is significantly higher for both catalysts.It should be noted that the carbon pool was already formed on the Ti/SBA-15 surface during a previously performed experiment with CO 2 and gas-phase water.Considering the overall produced carbon content (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 ), the carbon yield (C A ) increased by about 20 in the absence of water, which was mainly due to the higher CH 4 yields compensating the decrease in longer-chain hydrocarbon yields.The overall hydrocarbon yield was even increased in the consecutive experiment performed with the CO 2 /H 2 O mixture.For Ti/SBA-15, the CH 4 yield decreased, but the C 2 H 6 yield was drastically increased (Fig. 4c).A higher ethane yield and a higher methane yield were observed for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which might indicate that a carbon pool was formed on its surface under water-free feed conditions.Furthermore, these experiments show that the water content on the sample surface is sufficient to perform photocatalytic CO 2 reduction for at least 5 h of irradiation with both photocatalysts.In contrast to these observations, Anpo et al. observed the formation of larger quantities of CH 4 for high H 2 O/CO 2 ratios, and only small quantities of CH 4 were produced in the absence of gas-phase water 3.However, it is well known that water strongly binds to isolated Ti-species, and high temperatures are required to remove water effectively 24.Therefore, the surface of the photocatalysts should be saturated with H 2 O and, as a result, CO 2 reduction is feasible.In addition, high methane yields in water-poor conditions are in agreement with a C 2 H 6 /CH 4 ratio exceeding 1 for stoichiometric CO 2 /H 2 O mixtures observed by Mul et al. 7 and increasing ethane yield for higher water content reaction gas-mixtures as observed by Anpo et al. 3.Further studies are required to fully explain these observations.However, an option that should be considered is the inhibition of a subsequent photo-reforming reaction of the produced CH 4 in a water-free gasphase that may occur in the presence of gas-phase H 2 O. CO and H 2 may be produced due to this process, which then might be in-volved in the formation of higher hydrocarbons.Unfortunately, small amounts of CO and H 2 cannot be detected by the GC application used here.In terms of irradiation in water-free CO 2 , a lack of CO and H 2 could diminish the formation of higher hydrocarbons. In a related manner, a photoinduced cracking reaction of higher hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of larger amounts of methane, cannot be ruled out.Furthermore, an influence of the carbon pool in higher hydrocarbon production was observed.Thus, it should be considered that high water contents are required to hydrogenate these species.Without gas-phase water, partially hydrogenated species may instead remain adsorbed.Furthermore, the water content may influence the mobility of intermediates on the catalyst surface.A higher amount of water should lead to the formation of a physisorbed layer that almost resembles liquid water.In this layer, partially hydrogenated species may move more freely, while they are stuck in place without this layer. After reaction all samples were characterized by DRIFTS, UV-Vis and XPS and compared to the unreacted materials to get further insight into possible intermediates, the deactivation of the catalysts, and the carbon pool, which was accumulating during CO 2 reduction.The carbon content as determined by XPS analysis was similar for all the samples.Structural changes in the Ti-species within the course of gas-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction causing deactivation of the materials can be excluded comparing Ti/SBA-15 and Au/ Ti/SBA-15 before and after reaction (XPS results, Fig. S3).UV-Vis indicates a narrowing of the Au plasmon for Au/Ti/SBA-15 after reaction, which may be caused by different Ti-Au interactions (Fig. 5).One has to keep in mind that TiO x -species have the potential to alter the local environment of the Au particles 16,17.A narrowing of the Au plasmon peak was also observed in the Au/Ti/ SBA-15-C sample accompanied by an increase in intensity and a shift in the plasmon peak maximum to higher wavelength.This indicates a particle growth due to calcination (not shown).Therefore, the changes observed by UV-Vis spectroscopy might partially explain the activity decrease in Au/Ti/SBA-15. Difference IR spectra of the reacted and the fresh Ti/SBA-15 catalyst revealed that formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were present at the surface of Ti/SBA-15 after CO 2 reduction reaction (Fig. 6).The bands observed at 1685 and 2853 cm A1 are in good agreement with values of the m(CO) and m(CH 2 ) stretching modes of formaldehyde adsorbed at different surfaces 25262728. The intense band at 2972 cm A1 is representative for the asymmetric stretching (m a (CH 2 )) of paraformaldehyde, which is known to be obtained by the polymerization of formaldehyde at low temperatures 25,26,28.The assignment of the bands is clearly verified by the thermal stability of paraformaldehyde.Interestingly, less formaldehyde was detected for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, and the signals assigned to paraformaldehyde are shifted to higher wavenumbers (Fig. S4).Assuming that paraformaldehyde is the intermediate of higher hydrocarbon formation, it is likely that it is immediately available at the surface of the Au/Ti/SBA-15, catalyst and higher hydrocarbons can be produced, whereas at Ti/ SBA-15, paraformaldehyde is formed upon accumulation of formaldehyde at the surface and is not hydrogenated further.This may explain the inhibition of ethane production on Ti/SBA-15, as observed during the first reaction run.Nevertheless, the IR spectroscopic results indicate that the carbon pool most likely consists of adsorbed (para-)formaldehyde. In the literature, different reaction mechanisms are proposed for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Anpo et al. 4 propose a mechanism in which CO 2 and H 2 O decompose competitively into C-and OH-radicals at the excited Ti-O centers, presumably with CO as an intermediate species.Similar observations were recently reported for crystalline TiO 2 by Zapol et al. 29.Mul et al. 7 followed the proposed route by Frei et al. 6 who suggested a mechanism involving CO in the initial state and formaldehyde, which is converted to CH 4 and longer-chain hydrocarbons in the presence of water.A Ti-hydroperoxide species is assumed to be essential in this process.Based on the results obtained within this study, the mechanism proposed by Mul et al. 7 and Frei et al. 6 is considered more likely as (1) formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were observed by diffuse reflectance IR measurements, (2) higher CH 4 yields are observed for water-poor reaction conditions, and (3) CO 2 is weakly interacting with isolated Ti-species 13, whereas water is strongly bound to the surface."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Product formation from contaminants was ruled out experimentally by a thorough pre-cleaning of the samples and the leak-tight design of the fully metal-sealed gas-phase photoreactor.", "context": "Photodeposition of Au nanoparticles was found to enhance the rate of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to short hydrocarbons over titanate species in SBA-15.Product formation from contaminants was ruled out experimentally by a thorough pre-cleaning of the samples and the leak-tight design of the fully metal-sealed gas-phase photoreactor.Without Au, an active carbon pool was observed to accumulate on the catalyst, and higher hydrocarbons were formed.Infrared spectroscopy was used to identify formaldehyde/paraformaldehyde as major compounds of the carbon pool.The results obtained in the absence of gas-phase water indicate that adsorbed water in the mesopores is sufficient to achieve CO 2 reduction and convert CO 2 mainly to methane.These results contribute to the knowledge-based improvement of photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "The home-made gas-phase photoreactor with a volume of approximately 27 ml is constructed on the basis of the design presented by Grimes et al. 14,15.", "context": "The synthesis of SBA-15 and the grafting procedure for obtaining isolated TiO x -species on the SBA-15 surface have been described in detail elsewhere 13. Photodeposition of Au was performed in a continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor equipped with a 700 W Hg immersion lamp cooled by water circulating in a double wall jacket 11.During photodeposition, the concentration of CO 2 , O 2 , and H 2 was analyzed with a non-dispersive IR photometer, a paramagnetic and a thermal conductivity detector (XStream, Emerson Process Management), respectively.350 mg of catalyst was dispersed in a solution of 550 ml dest.H 2 O and 50 ml methanol.The reactor was deaerated for 60 min using pure N 2 prior to irradiation to obtain reliable H 2 concentrations due to the photocatalytic methanol reforming and to avoid the reverse reaction of hydrogen and oxygen.The activity of Ti/SBA was evaluated by irradiation for 60 min in the absence of the Au precursor.3.5 ml of a 1.5 A 10 A3 molar auric acid solution (HAuCl 4 99.9,Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the suspension, and the reactor was again deaerated for 60 min using pure N 2 .Photodeposition was performed at 30 C with 50 irradiation power (350 W) for 2.5 h.After successful photodeposition, the materials were filtered and freeze-dried over night. The flow scheme of the CO 2 photoreactor setup is presented in Fig. S1.The main elements of this setup are the gas supply, the saturator, the reactor, the analysis devices (GC and QMS), and the pumping system.The home-made gas-phase photoreactor with a volume of approximately 27 ml is constructed on the basis of the design presented by Grimes et al. 14,15.The reactor is fully metal-sealed and can be pumped down to a pressure of 10 A8 mbar.While two separate cooling water circuits control the reactor and the saturator temperature, the gas lines can be heated to avoid water condensation.A sample is spread on glass tray on the bottom of the reactor to obtain a homogeneous light distribution.A 200 W Hg/Xe (Newport Oriel) lamp is used to irradiate the sample through a quartz window allowing for high transmissions of high-energy UV light.Thus, the light irradiance at the sample is 200 mW/cm 2 or 110 mW/cm 2 when a 320 nm cutoff filter is used.Reactions can be performed either in continuous or in batch mode.For this purpose, product gases can be analyzed by QMS (Balzers, Omnistar) in continuous mode and by a GC (Shimadzu 14B) in batch mode.Trace gas analysis is performed with the GC, which is equipped with TCD and FID detectors.Two Porapak N columns and one molecular sieve column are used for separation.Calibration of the GC was performed using a standard gas mixture containing 1000 ppm C 1 -C 5 hydrocarbons and 10 of nitrogen balanced by He (Air Liquide).It was confirmed that the concentration of C1-C4 hydrocarbons can be analyzed reliably down to a concentration of 1 ppm, and the standard deviation for the different hydrocarbon compounds was derived to be below 5. The samples were thoroughly pre-treated in humid He under UV irradiation to remove surface contaminations.The cleaning procedure was repeated until carbon contaminations were sufficiently removed (5 ppm) from the sample surface. CO 2 reduction experiments were performed under static conditions in an atmosphere of 5 CO 2 and 6000 ppm water, which was balanced by He.These conditions were achieved by saturating a CO 2 /He stream with water at 273 K.A CO 2 excess was chosen because of the unfavorable interaction of CO 2 with the isolated titanate species.The initial pressure was adjusted to 1500 mbar.The hydrocarbon formation under illumination with a 200 W Hg/ Xe lamp was monitored during a period of 7 h.For this purpose, samples were taken for GC analysis after 1, 5, and 7 h.The decrease in pressure during sampling was taken into account by normalization of the obtained signals to N 2 used as an internal standard.After reaction, the reactor was pumped down to 5 A 10 A2 mbar and flushed with high purity He.Blank experiments revealed that no hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of a photocatalyst or in absence of high-energy UV light, which was excluded using a 435 nm cutoff filter. Characterization of the samples by UV-Vis spectroscopy and XPS was performed according to previous measurements described in detail elsewhere 13. DRIFT spectra of the samples were recorded at different temperatures between RT and 400 C to remove surface-bound water.Samples were heated with a rate of 5 K/min.At 120 C, the temperature was kept constant, while the spectra were measured.The obtained spectra were first converted to log(1/R) and then normalized to the absorption of the harmonic vibration of SiO 2 , which can be found in the region between 2100 cm A1 and 1700 cm A1 .Diamond powder was used as diluent due to its chemical inertness in a 1:1 ratio (by weight) for the IR spectroscopic measurements (particle size 30-40 lm, Winter Quality Tools)."}, {"llm generation": "aqueous", "source": "In the presence of metallic Au, H 2 is produced due to the photocatalytic reforming of aqueous methanol, in which methanol acts as hole scavenger.", "context": "The preparation and in-depth characterization of the Ti/SBA-15 material was described in detail elsewhere 13.In short, it was proven by UV-Vis, X-ray photoelectron, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy that tetrahedrally coordinated TiO 4 -species were obtained within the mesoporous SBA-15 matrix.The Ti-content was confirmed to be 2 wt resulting in a coverage of 0.3 Ti/nm 2 . The evolution of H 2 was constantly measured during the photodeposition of Au revealing that hydrogen evolution took place only in the presence of auric acid (Fig. 1).During irradiation, the Au precursor is reduced to metallic Au, which can be considered as a fast reaction.In the presence of metallic Au, H 2 is produced due to the photocatalytic reforming of aqueous methanol, in which methanol acts as hole scavenger.Presumably, metallic Au is the hydrogen evolution site.Therefore, this observation is a first indication for the successful deposition of Au nanoparticles onto Ti/SBA-15.However, to further prove the existence of Au nanoparticles, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy was employed showing a characteristic plasmon absorption peak of metallic Au at 550 nm 16,17 (for details see Section 3.5).From the plasmon maximum position, it can be assumed that the Au nanoparticles are smaller than or similar to 10 nm in size 17.Elemental analysis revealed that the obtained Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample contains 0.25 wt of Au corresponding to the amount supplied during photoassisted deposition. Therefore, all the supplied Au ions were successfully deposited onto the support material. The two different materials Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 were thoroughly cleaned by illumination in humid He under static conditions in the fully metal-sealed gas-phase photoreactor.Recently, Mul et al. showed that this pre-illumination procedure in the presence of water vapor is mandatory to achieve reliable results in the photocatalytic activity in gas-phase CO 2 reduction 7,18.During the cleaning procedure in humid He, mainly CH 4 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 were detected (Fig. 2), which is in good agreement with the carbon contaminations observed by Mul et al. 7.In addition to these hydrocarbons, methanol was observed for Au/Ti/SBA-15, which is most likely a result of the photodeposition procedure, in which methanol was used as sacrificial electron donor.However, the methanol signal decreased throughout prolonged irradiation, and it is likely that methanol was converted to CO 2 , which was also detected throughout prolonged irradiation in the Au photodeposition procedure. It is remarkable to note that the overall amount of carbon contaminations was higher than the contamination previously observed by Mul et al. 7.Therefore, subsequent cleaning steps were necessary to obtain a clean catalyst surface.In case of Ti/ SBA-15, four subsequent cleaning steps were conducted, whereas the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample was cleaned seven times for 7 h each.Additionally, Au/Ti/SBA-15-C was prepared by calcination at 250 C in synthetic air with the aim to reduce the number of necessary cleaning steps.This calcination temperature has previously been chosen for the calcination of PVA-protected gold colloids on metal oxides 19.However, four additional cleaning steps in humid He were still necessary to sufficiently remove the carbon contaminations.The decrease in the concentration of the three main contaminants CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 of each cleaning step can be represented with high accuracy as an exponential decay curve in case of the Au/Ti/SBA-15.This might be rationalized by the decreasing surface coverage of methanol in the subsequent cleaning steps which can be converted into methane in a two electron process. The hydrocarbon formation during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction within 7 h of illumination for Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 is shown in Fig. 3a.Except for the presence of CO 2 , the conditions of the photocatalytic process were similar to the conditions applied during the cleaning procedure (1500 mbar, 6000 ppm H 2 O, 200 W Hg/Xe lamp), and it can be assumed that no more contaminants desorb during the actual CO 2 reduction experiments.Thus, the detected hydrocarbons were unambiguously formed from CO 2 as carbon source. Obviously, in the first reaction run, the yield of CH 4 is significantly higher for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample which is in good agreement with observations by Anpo et al. 12, who detected higher methane yields in the presence of Pt co-catalysts.However, a subsequent reaction period without further pre-treatment revealed that a threefold increase in the CH 4 yield is observed for the Ti/SBA-15 sample, whereas the overall yield for the Au/Ti/ SBA-15 material is almost comparable to the first reaction run, and only a slightly lower yield was observed.Furthermore, it is evident that the yield of CH 4 after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15 resembles the value obtained after 7 h of irradiation in the first reaction run.The comparison between the Au/Ti/SBA-15 and the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample shows that the CH 4 yield is significantly lower for the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample (Fig. S2).Consequently, since calcinations affect the photocatalytic performance in a negative way, it is not possible to shorten the photocatalytic cleaning procedure by this means. After an additional surface cleaning of all samples in humid He, the performances of the different materials were reproduced.The CH 4 yields were similar for two subsequently performed reactions on Au/Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15-C.An increase in the CH 4 yield was again observed in the second reaction run for Ti/SBA-15.However, it has to be noted that the overall yield was lower, indicating that both the gold-containing and the gold-free catalyst deactivated during prolonged irradiation (Fig. S2).In addition to CH 4 , longer-chain hydrocarbons were produced in different quantities with both catalysts.While C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 were produced in the two subsequent reactions using the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, negligible amounts of longer-chain hydrocarbons were detected with Ti/SBA-15 in the first run (Fig. 3b).However, after deactivation of Ti/SBA-15, longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was also observed during the first reaction run (Fig. S2).In addition to the threefold increase in the yield of CH 4 , a threefold increase in ethane formation was observed in the subsequent reaction using Ti/SBA-15 (Fig. 3b).Again, these observations were reproducible in two consecutive runs after additional surface cleaning in humid He.We therefore suppose that under the present reaction conditions, a carbon pool is reproducibly built up during the first reaction run on the Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which cannot be removed by evacuation.This carbon pool can then participate in the product formation at the beginning of the second run.As a consequence, no time for the accumulation of intermediates is required in the second run, product formation starts earlier, and the total yield is higher.It is assumed that saturation of the catalyst surface with these less reactive carbon species is required to achieve high hydrocarbon yields.On the other hand, in the presence of Au, this carbon accumulation does not seem to occur and is either removed by evacuation or these carbon species are not reactive in subsequent reaction runs.Consequently, the yields observed in the second run are similar to the first ones.It is reasonable to assume that a higher hydrogenation rate in the presence of Au is responsible for the observed behavior of Au/Ti/SBA-15 after the first reaction run.In general, noble metals usually show high activity in hydrogenation reactions 20,21.In photocatalytic reactions, it is accepted that H 2 formation occurs at these electron-trapping sites, and more hydrogen is available in close proximity to gold facilitating hydrogenation 22,23.It should be noted that this is in agreement with the higher yield of H 2 that has been observed during photodeposition experiments.Visible-light assisted photoreactions in the presence of Au as the cause of the higher activity can be excluded as no product formation was observed when the samples were irradiated with Vis light. The 30 ppm of CH 4 produced within 5 h of irradiation in the presence of Au/Ti/SBA-15 is equivalent to 0.047 lmol resulting in 0.188 lmol/g cat /h or 9.4 lmol/g Ti /h.For Ti/SBA-15, the yield in the second run can be calculated to amount to 12.1 lmol/g Ti /h.The photon flux entering the reactor can be estimated, and thus, an apparent quantum yield for CH 4 for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 material can be calculated.In the range from 200 to 320 nm, the AQY is calculated to be 1.13 A 10 A3 , which appears to be low but is still in good agreement with values reported in the literature (Supporting information). To get further insight into the formation of the carbon pool, two consecutive reaction cycles were performed followed by irradiation of the photocatalysts in humid He.Surprisingly, on both catalyst systems, evolution of hydrocarbons was observed under irradiation in humid He (Fig. 4a).A steep increase in methane and longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was observed after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15.This is in line with the proposed formation of a carbon pool.For the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, a slower formation of C x H y is characteristic.The formation of hydrocarbons during irradiation in humid He, however, is a clear indication that a carbon pool is also created on Au/Ti/SBA-15, but to a lower extent, and its effects on hydrocarbon formation are less pronounced.Possibly, the nature or location of these carbon species is different. Finally, the influence of the water content on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was investigated using a reaction gas mixture containing 5 CO 2 /He only.Consequently, just pre-adsorbed water in the pores of the catalysts was available as reducing agent.The results of these water-free reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 4b.Prior and subsequent to these experiments, CO 2 reduction was performed using the reaction gas mixture containing gasphase water.These results are also included in Fig. 4b.Unexpectedly, less longer-chain hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of gas-phase water on both catalysts systems (Fig. 4c).The CH 4 yield is significantly higher for both catalysts.It should be noted that the carbon pool was already formed on the Ti/SBA-15 surface during a previously performed experiment with CO 2 and gas-phase water.Considering the overall produced carbon content (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 ), the carbon yield (C A ) increased by about 20 in the absence of water, which was mainly due to the higher CH 4 yields compensating the decrease in longer-chain hydrocarbon yields.The overall hydrocarbon yield was even increased in the consecutive experiment performed with the CO 2 /H 2 O mixture.For Ti/SBA-15, the CH 4 yield decreased, but the C 2 H 6 yield was drastically increased (Fig. 4c).A higher ethane yield and a higher methane yield were observed for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which might indicate that a carbon pool was formed on its surface under water-free feed conditions.Furthermore, these experiments show that the water content on the sample surface is sufficient to perform photocatalytic CO 2 reduction for at least 5 h of irradiation with both photocatalysts.In contrast to these observations, Anpo et al. observed the formation of larger quantities of CH 4 for high H 2 O/CO 2 ratios, and only small quantities of CH 4 were produced in the absence of gas-phase water 3.However, it is well known that water strongly binds to isolated Ti-species, and high temperatures are required to remove water effectively 24.Therefore, the surface of the photocatalysts should be saturated with H 2 O and, as a result, CO 2 reduction is feasible.In addition, high methane yields in water-poor conditions are in agreement with a C 2 H 6 /CH 4 ratio exceeding 1 for stoichiometric CO 2 /H 2 O mixtures observed by Mul et al. 7 and increasing ethane yield for higher water content reaction gas-mixtures as observed by Anpo et al. 3.Further studies are required to fully explain these observations.However, an option that should be considered is the inhibition of a subsequent photo-reforming reaction of the produced CH 4 in a water-free gasphase that may occur in the presence of gas-phase H 2 O. CO and H 2 may be produced due to this process, which then might be in-volved in the formation of higher hydrocarbons.Unfortunately, small amounts of CO and H 2 cannot be detected by the GC application used here.In terms of irradiation in water-free CO 2 , a lack of CO and H 2 could diminish the formation of higher hydrocarbons. In a related manner, a photoinduced cracking reaction of higher hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of larger amounts of methane, cannot be ruled out.Furthermore, an influence of the carbon pool in higher hydrocarbon production was observed.Thus, it should be considered that high water contents are required to hydrogenate these species.Without gas-phase water, partially hydrogenated species may instead remain adsorbed.Furthermore, the water content may influence the mobility of intermediates on the catalyst surface.A higher amount of water should lead to the formation of a physisorbed layer that almost resembles liquid water.In this layer, partially hydrogenated species may move more freely, while they are stuck in place without this layer. After reaction all samples were characterized by DRIFTS, UV-Vis and XPS and compared to the unreacted materials to get further insight into possible intermediates, the deactivation of the catalysts, and the carbon pool, which was accumulating during CO 2 reduction.The carbon content as determined by XPS analysis was similar for all the samples.Structural changes in the Ti-species within the course of gas-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction causing deactivation of the materials can be excluded comparing Ti/SBA-15 and Au/ Ti/SBA-15 before and after reaction (XPS results, Fig. S3).UV-Vis indicates a narrowing of the Au plasmon for Au/Ti/SBA-15 after reaction, which may be caused by different Ti-Au interactions (Fig. 5).One has to keep in mind that TiO x -species have the potential to alter the local environment of the Au particles 16,17.A narrowing of the Au plasmon peak was also observed in the Au/Ti/ SBA-15-C sample accompanied by an increase in intensity and a shift in the plasmon peak maximum to higher wavelength.This indicates a particle growth due to calcination (not shown).Therefore, the changes observed by UV-Vis spectroscopy might partially explain the activity decrease in Au/Ti/SBA-15. Difference IR spectra of the reacted and the fresh Ti/SBA-15 catalyst revealed that formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were present at the surface of Ti/SBA-15 after CO 2 reduction reaction (Fig. 6).The bands observed at 1685 and 2853 cm A1 are in good agreement with values of the m(CO) and m(CH 2 ) stretching modes of formaldehyde adsorbed at different surfaces 25262728. The intense band at 2972 cm A1 is representative for the asymmetric stretching (m a (CH 2 )) of paraformaldehyde, which is known to be obtained by the polymerization of formaldehyde at low temperatures 25,26,28.The assignment of the bands is clearly verified by the thermal stability of paraformaldehyde.Interestingly, less formaldehyde was detected for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, and the signals assigned to paraformaldehyde are shifted to higher wavenumbers (Fig. S4).Assuming that paraformaldehyde is the intermediate of higher hydrocarbon formation, it is likely that it is immediately available at the surface of the Au/Ti/SBA-15, catalyst and higher hydrocarbons can be produced, whereas at Ti/ SBA-15, paraformaldehyde is formed upon accumulation of formaldehyde at the surface and is not hydrogenated further.This may explain the inhibition of ethane production on Ti/SBA-15, as observed during the first reaction run.Nevertheless, the IR spectroscopic results indicate that the carbon pool most likely consists of adsorbed (para-)formaldehyde.

The 30 ppm of CH 4 produced within 5 h of irradiation in the presence of Au/Ti/SBA-15 is equivalent to 0.047 lmol resulting in 0.188 lmol/g cat /h or 9.4 lmol/g Ti /h.For Ti/SBA-15, the yield in the second run can be calculated to amount to 12.1 lmol/g Ti /h.The photon flux entering the reactor can be estimated, and thus, an apparent quantum yield for CH 4 for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 material can be calculated.In the range from 200 to 320 nm, the AQY is calculated to be 1.13 A 10 A3 , which appears to be low but is still in good agreement with values reported in the literature (Supporting information). To get further insight into the formation of the carbon pool, two consecutive reaction cycles were performed followed by irradiation of the photocatalysts in humid He.Surprisingly, on both catalyst systems, evolution of hydrocarbons was observed under irradiation in humid He (Fig. 4a).A steep increase in methane and longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was observed after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15.This is in line with the proposed formation of a carbon pool.For the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, a slower formation of C x H y is characteristic.The formation of hydrocarbons during irradiation in humid He, however, is a clear indication that a carbon pool is also created on Au/Ti/SBA-15, but to a lower extent, and its effects on hydrocarbon formation are less pronounced.Possibly, the nature or location of these carbon species is different. Finally, the influence of the water content on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was investigated using a reaction gas mixture containing 5 CO 2 /He only.Consequently, just pre-adsorbed water in the pores of the catalysts was available as reducing agent.The results of these water-free reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 4b.Prior and subsequent to these experiments, CO 2 reduction was performed using the reaction gas mixture containing gasphase water.These results are also included in Fig. 4b.Unexpectedly, less longer-chain hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of gas-phase water on both catalysts systems (Fig. 4c).The CH 4 yield is significantly higher for both catalysts.It should be noted that the carbon pool was already formed on the Ti/SBA-15 surface during a previously performed experiment with CO 2 and gas-phase water.Considering the overall produced carbon content (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 ), the carbon yield (C A ) increased by about 20 in the absence of water, which was mainly due to the higher CH 4 yields compensating the decrease in longer-chain hydrocarbon yields.The overall hydrocarbon yield was even increased in the consecutive experiment performed with the CO 2 /H 2 O mixture.For Ti/SBA-15, the CH 4 yield decreased, but the C 2 H 6 yield was drastically increased (Fig. 4c).A higher ethane yield and a higher methane yield were observed for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which might indicate that a carbon pool was formed on its surface under water-free feed conditions.Furthermore, these experiments show that the water content on the sample surface is sufficient to perform photocatalytic CO 2 reduction for at least 5 h of irradiation with both photocatalysts.In contrast to these observations, Anpo et al. observed the formation of larger quantities of CH 4 for high H 2 O/CO 2 ratios, and only small quantities of CH 4 were produced in the absence of gas-phase water 3.However, it is well known that water strongly binds to isolated Ti-species, and high temperatures are required to remove water effectively 24.Therefore, the surface of the photocatalysts should be saturated with H 2 O and, as a result, CO 2 reduction is feasible.In addition, high methane yields in water-poor conditions are in agreement with a C 2 H 6 /CH 4 ratio exceeding 1 for stoichiometric CO 2 /H 2 O mixtures observed by Mul et al. 7 and increasing ethane yield for higher water content reaction gas-mixtures as observed by Anpo et al. 3.Further studies are required to fully explain these observations.However, an option that should be considered is the inhibition of a subsequent photo-reforming reaction of the produced CH 4 in a water-free gasphase that may occur in the presence of gas-phase H 2 O. CO and H 2 may be produced due to this process, which then might be in-volved in the formation of higher hydrocarbons.Unfortunately, small amounts of CO and H 2 cannot be detected by the GC application used here.In terms of irradiation in water-free CO 2 , a lack of CO and H 2 could diminish the formation of higher hydrocarbons. In a related manner, a photoinduced cracking reaction of higher hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of larger amounts of methane, cannot be ruled out.Furthermore, an influence of the carbon pool in higher hydrocarbon production was observed.Thus, it should be considered that high water contents are required to hydrogenate these species.Without gas-phase water, partially hydrogenated species may instead remain adsorbed.Furthermore, the water content may influence the mobility of intermediates on the catalyst surface.A higher amount of water should lead to the formation of a physisorbed layer that almost resembles liquid water.In this layer, partially hydrogenated species may move more freely, while they are stuck in place without this layer. After reaction all samples were characterized by DRIFTS, UV-Vis and XPS and compared to the unreacted materials to get further insight into possible intermediates, the deactivation of the catalysts, and the carbon pool, which was accumulating during CO 2 reduction.The carbon content as determined by XPS analysis was similar for all the samples.Structural changes in the Ti-species within the course of gas-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction causing deactivation of the materials can be excluded comparing Ti/SBA-15 and Au/ Ti/SBA-15 before and after reaction (XPS results, Fig. S3).UV-Vis indicates a narrowing of the Au plasmon for Au/Ti/SBA-15 after reaction, which may be caused by different Ti-Au interactions (Fig. 5).One has to keep in mind that TiO x -species have the potential to alter the local environment of the Au particles 16,17.A narrowing of the Au plasmon peak was also observed in the Au/Ti/ SBA-15-C sample accompanied by an increase in intensity and a shift in the plasmon peak maximum to higher wavelength.This indicates a particle growth due to calcination (not shown).Therefore, the changes observed by UV-Vis spectroscopy might partially explain the activity decrease in Au/Ti/SBA-15. Difference IR spectra of the reacted and the fresh Ti/SBA-15 catalyst revealed that formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were present at the surface of Ti/SBA-15 after CO 2 reduction reaction (Fig. 6).The bands observed at 1685 and 2853 cm A1 are in good agreement with values of the m(CO) and m(CH 2 ) stretching modes of formaldehyde adsorbed at different surfaces 25262728. The intense band at 2972 cm A1 is representative for the asymmetric stretching (m a (CH 2 )) of paraformaldehyde, which is known to be obtained by the polymerization of formaldehyde at low temperatures 25,26,28.The assignment of the bands is clearly verified by the thermal stability of paraformaldehyde.Interestingly, less formaldehyde was detected for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, and the signals assigned to paraformaldehyde are shifted to higher wavenumbers (Fig. S4).Assuming that paraformaldehyde is the intermediate of higher hydrocarbon formation, it is likely that it is immediately available at the surface of the Au/Ti/SBA-15, catalyst and higher hydrocarbons can be produced, whereas at Ti/ SBA-15, paraformaldehyde is formed upon accumulation of formaldehyde at the surface and is not hydrogenated further.This may explain the inhibition of ethane production on Ti/SBA-15, as observed during the first reaction run.Nevertheless, the IR spectroscopic results indicate that the carbon pool most likely consists of adsorbed (para-)formaldehyde. In the literature, different reaction mechanisms are proposed for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Anpo et al. 4 propose a mechanism in which CO 2 and H 2 O decompose competitively into C-and OH-radicals at the excited Ti-O centers, presumably with CO as an intermediate species.Similar observations were recently reported for crystalline TiO 2 by Zapol et al. 29.Mul et al. 7 followed the proposed route by Frei et al. 6 who suggested a mechanism involving CO in the initial state and formaldehyde, which is converted to CH 4 and longer-chain hydrocarbons in the presence of water.A Ti-hydroperoxide species is assumed to be essential in this process.Based on the results obtained within this study, the mechanism proposed by Mul et al. 7 and Frei et al. 6 is considered more likely as (1) formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were observed by diffuse reflectance IR measurements, (2) higher CH 4 yields are observed for water-poor reaction conditions, and (3) CO 2 is weakly interacting with isolated Ti-species 13, whereas water is strongly bound to the surface."}, {"llm generation": "water-free gasphase", "source": "However, an option that should be considered is the inhibition of a subsequent photo-reforming reaction of the produced CH 4 in a water-free gasphase that may occur in the presence of gas-phase H 2 O.", "context": "The preparation and in-depth characterization of the Ti/SBA-15 material was described in detail elsewhere 13.In short, it was proven by UV-Vis, X-ray photoelectron, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy that tetrahedrally coordinated TiO 4 -species were obtained within the mesoporous SBA-15 matrix.The Ti-content was confirmed to be 2 wt resulting in a coverage of 0.3 Ti/nm 2 . The evolution of H 2 was constantly measured during the photodeposition of Au revealing that hydrogen evolution took place only in the presence of auric acid (Fig. 1).During irradiation, the Au precursor is reduced to metallic Au, which can be considered as a fast reaction.In the presence of metallic Au, H 2 is produced due to the photocatalytic reforming of aqueous methanol, in which methanol acts as hole scavenger.Presumably, metallic Au is the hydrogen evolution site.Therefore, this observation is a first indication for the successful deposition of Au nanoparticles onto Ti/SBA-15.However, to further prove the existence of Au nanoparticles, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy was employed showing a characteristic plasmon absorption peak of metallic Au at 550 nm 16,17 (for details see Section 3.5).From the plasmon maximum position, it can be assumed that the Au nanoparticles are smaller than or similar to 10 nm in size 17.Elemental analysis revealed that the obtained Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample contains 0.25 wt of Au corresponding to the amount supplied during photoassisted deposition. Therefore, all the supplied Au ions were successfully deposited onto the support material. The two different materials Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 were thoroughly cleaned by illumination in humid He under static conditions in the fully metal-sealed gas-phase photoreactor.Recently, Mul et al. showed that this pre-illumination procedure in the presence of water vapor is mandatory to achieve reliable results in the photocatalytic activity in gas-phase CO 2 reduction 7,18.During the cleaning procedure in humid He, mainly CH 4 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 were detected (Fig. 2), which is in good agreement with the carbon contaminations observed by Mul et al. 7.In addition to these hydrocarbons, methanol was observed for Au/Ti/SBA-15, which is most likely a result of the photodeposition procedure, in which methanol was used as sacrificial electron donor.However, the methanol signal decreased throughout prolonged irradiation, and it is likely that methanol was converted to CO 2 , which was also detected throughout prolonged irradiation in the Au photodeposition procedure. It is remarkable to note that the overall amount of carbon contaminations was higher than the contamination previously observed by Mul et al. 7.Therefore, subsequent cleaning steps were necessary to obtain a clean catalyst surface.In case of Ti/ SBA-15, four subsequent cleaning steps were conducted, whereas the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample was cleaned seven times for 7 h each.Additionally, Au/Ti/SBA-15-C was prepared by calcination at 250 C in synthetic air with the aim to reduce the number of necessary cleaning steps.This calcination temperature has previously been chosen for the calcination of PVA-protected gold colloids on metal oxides 19.However, four additional cleaning steps in humid He were still necessary to sufficiently remove the carbon contaminations.The decrease in the concentration of the three main contaminants CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 of each cleaning step can be represented with high accuracy as an exponential decay curve in case of the Au/Ti/SBA-15.This might be rationalized by the decreasing surface coverage of methanol in the subsequent cleaning steps which can be converted into methane in a two electron process. The hydrocarbon formation during photocatalytic CO 2 reduction within 7 h of illumination for Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15 is shown in Fig. 3a.Except for the presence of CO 2 , the conditions of the photocatalytic process were similar to the conditions applied during the cleaning procedure (1500 mbar, 6000 ppm H 2 O, 200 W Hg/Xe lamp), and it can be assumed that no more contaminants desorb during the actual CO 2 reduction experiments.Thus, the detected hydrocarbons were unambiguously formed from CO 2 as carbon source. Obviously, in the first reaction run, the yield of CH 4 is significantly higher for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample which is in good agreement with observations by Anpo et al. 12, who detected higher methane yields in the presence of Pt co-catalysts.However, a subsequent reaction period without further pre-treatment revealed that a threefold increase in the CH 4 yield is observed for the Ti/SBA-15 sample, whereas the overall yield for the Au/Ti/ SBA-15 material is almost comparable to the first reaction run, and only a slightly lower yield was observed.Furthermore, it is evident that the yield of CH 4 after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15 resembles the value obtained after 7 h of irradiation in the first reaction run.The comparison between the Au/Ti/SBA-15 and the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample shows that the CH 4 yield is significantly lower for the calcined Au/Ti/SBA-15-C sample (Fig. S2).Consequently, since calcinations affect the photocatalytic performance in a negative way, it is not possible to shorten the photocatalytic cleaning procedure by this means. After an additional surface cleaning of all samples in humid He, the performances of the different materials were reproduced.The CH 4 yields were similar for two subsequently performed reactions on Au/Ti/SBA-15 and Au/Ti/SBA-15-C.An increase in the CH 4 yield was again observed in the second reaction run for Ti/SBA-15.However, it has to be noted that the overall yield was lower, indicating that both the gold-containing and the gold-free catalyst deactivated during prolonged irradiation (Fig. S2).In addition to CH 4 , longer-chain hydrocarbons were produced in different quantities with both catalysts.While C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 were produced in the two subsequent reactions using the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, negligible amounts of longer-chain hydrocarbons were detected with Ti/SBA-15 in the first run (Fig. 3b).However, after deactivation of Ti/SBA-15, longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was also observed during the first reaction run (Fig. S2).In addition to the threefold increase in the yield of CH 4 , a threefold increase in ethane formation was observed in the subsequent reaction using Ti/SBA-15 (Fig. 3b).Again, these observations were reproducible in two consecutive runs after additional surface cleaning in humid He.We therefore suppose that under the present reaction conditions, a carbon pool is reproducibly built up during the first reaction run on the Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which cannot be removed by evacuation.This carbon pool can then participate in the product formation at the beginning of the second run.As a consequence, no time for the accumulation of intermediates is required in the second run, product formation starts earlier, and the total yield is higher.It is assumed that saturation of the catalyst surface with these less reactive carbon species is required to achieve high hydrocarbon yields.On the other hand, in the presence of Au, this carbon accumulation does not seem to occur and is either removed by evacuation or these carbon species are not reactive in subsequent reaction runs.Consequently, the yields observed in the second run are similar to the first ones.It is reasonable to assume that a higher hydrogenation rate in the presence of Au is responsible for the observed behavior of Au/Ti/SBA-15 after the first reaction run.In general, noble metals usually show high activity in hydrogenation reactions 20,21.In photocatalytic reactions, it is accepted that H 2 formation occurs at these electron-trapping sites, and more hydrogen is available in close proximity to gold facilitating hydrogenation 22,23.It should be noted that this is in agreement with the higher yield of H 2 that has been observed during photodeposition experiments.Visible-light assisted photoreactions in the presence of Au as the cause of the higher activity can be excluded as no product formation was observed when the samples were irradiated with Vis light. The 30 ppm of CH 4 produced within 5 h of irradiation in the presence of Au/Ti/SBA-15 is equivalent to 0.047 lmol resulting in 0.188 lmol/g cat /h or 9.4 lmol/g Ti /h.For Ti/SBA-15, the yield in the second run can be calculated to amount to 12.1 lmol/g Ti /h.The photon flux entering the reactor can be estimated, and thus, an apparent quantum yield for CH 4 for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 material can be calculated.In the range from 200 to 320 nm, the AQY is calculated to be 1.13 A 10 A3 , which appears to be low but is still in good agreement with values reported in the literature (Supporting information). To get further insight into the formation of the carbon pool, two consecutive reaction cycles were performed followed by irradiation of the photocatalysts in humid He.Surprisingly, on both catalyst systems, evolution of hydrocarbons was observed under irradiation in humid He (Fig. 4a).A steep increase in methane and longer-chain hydrocarbon formation was observed after 1 h of irradiation for Ti/SBA-15.This is in line with the proposed formation of a carbon pool.For the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, a slower formation of C x H y is characteristic.The formation of hydrocarbons during irradiation in humid He, however, is a clear indication that a carbon pool is also created on Au/Ti/SBA-15, but to a lower extent, and its effects on hydrocarbon formation are less pronounced.Possibly, the nature or location of these carbon species is different. Finally, the influence of the water content on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction was investigated using a reaction gas mixture containing 5 CO 2 /He only.Consequently, just pre-adsorbed water in the pores of the catalysts was available as reducing agent.The results of these water-free reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 4b.Prior and subsequent to these experiments, CO 2 reduction was performed using the reaction gas mixture containing gasphase water.These results are also included in Fig. 4b.Unexpectedly, less longer-chain hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of gas-phase water on both catalysts systems (Fig. 4c).The CH 4 yield is significantly higher for both catalysts.It should be noted that the carbon pool was already formed on the Ti/SBA-15 surface during a previously performed experiment with CO 2 and gas-phase water.Considering the overall produced carbon content (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , and C 4 H 10 ), the carbon yield (C A ) increased by about 20 in the absence of water, which was mainly due to the higher CH 4 yields compensating the decrease in longer-chain hydrocarbon yields.The overall hydrocarbon yield was even increased in the consecutive experiment performed with the CO 2 /H 2 O mixture.For Ti/SBA-15, the CH 4 yield decreased, but the C 2 H 6 yield was drastically increased (Fig. 4c).A higher ethane yield and a higher methane yield were observed for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 catalyst, which might indicate that a carbon pool was formed on its surface under water-free feed conditions.Furthermore, these experiments show that the water content on the sample surface is sufficient to perform photocatalytic CO 2 reduction for at least 5 h of irradiation with both photocatalysts.In contrast to these observations, Anpo et al. observed the formation of larger quantities of CH 4 for high H 2 O/CO 2 ratios, and only small quantities of CH 4 were produced in the absence of gas-phase water 3.However, it is well known that water strongly binds to isolated Ti-species, and high temperatures are required to remove water effectively 24.Therefore, the surface of the photocatalysts should be saturated with H 2 O and, as a result, CO 2 reduction is feasible.In addition, high methane yields in water-poor conditions are in agreement with a C 2 H 6 /CH 4 ratio exceeding 1 for stoichiometric CO 2 /H 2 O mixtures observed by Mul et al. 7 and increasing ethane yield for higher water content reaction gas-mixtures as observed by Anpo et al. 3.Further studies are required to fully explain these observations.However, an option that should be considered is the inhibition of a subsequent photo-reforming reaction of the produced CH 4 in a water-free gasphase that may occur in the presence of gas-phase H 2 O. CO and H 2 may be produced due to this process, which then might be in-volved in the formation of higher hydrocarbons.Unfortunately, small amounts of CO and H 2 cannot be detected by the GC application used here.In terms of irradiation in water-free CO 2 , a lack of CO and H 2 could diminish the formation of higher hydrocarbons.

Difference IR spectra of the reacted and the fresh Ti/SBA-15 catalyst revealed that formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were present at the surface of Ti/SBA-15 after CO 2 reduction reaction (Fig. 6).The bands observed at 1685 and 2853 cm A1 are in good agreement with values of the m(CO) and m(CH 2 ) stretching modes of formaldehyde adsorbed at different surfaces 25262728. The intense band at 2972 cm A1 is representative for the asymmetric stretching (m a (CH 2 )) of paraformaldehyde, which is known to be obtained by the polymerization of formaldehyde at low temperatures 25,26,28.The assignment of the bands is clearly verified by the thermal stability of paraformaldehyde.Interestingly, less formaldehyde was detected for the Au/Ti/SBA-15 sample, and the signals assigned to paraformaldehyde are shifted to higher wavenumbers (Fig. S4).Assuming that paraformaldehyde is the intermediate of higher hydrocarbon formation, it is likely that it is immediately available at the surface of the Au/Ti/SBA-15, catalyst and higher hydrocarbons can be produced, whereas at Ti/ SBA-15, paraformaldehyde is formed upon accumulation of formaldehyde at the surface and is not hydrogenated further.This may explain the inhibition of ethane production on Ti/SBA-15, as observed during the first reaction run.Nevertheless, the IR spectroscopic results indicate that the carbon pool most likely consists of adsorbed (para-)formaldehyde. In the literature, different reaction mechanisms are proposed for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Anpo et al. 4 propose a mechanism in which CO 2 and H 2 O decompose competitively into C-and OH-radicals at the excited Ti-O centers, presumably with CO as an intermediate species.Similar observations were recently reported for crystalline TiO 2 by Zapol et al. 29.Mul et al. 7 followed the proposed route by Frei et al. 6 who suggested a mechanism involving CO in the initial state and formaldehyde, which is converted to CH 4 and longer-chain hydrocarbons in the presence of water.A Ti-hydroperoxide species is assumed to be essential in this process.Based on the results obtained within this study, the mechanism proposed by Mul et al. 7 and Frei et al. 6 is considered more likely as (1) formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde were observed by diffuse reflectance IR measurements, (2) higher CH 4 yields are observed for water-poor reaction conditions, and (3) CO 2 is weakly interacting with isolated Ti-species 13, whereas water is strongly bound to the surface."}, {"llm generation": "Gas", "source": "Experiments with varying water content indicate that the gas-phase water content significantly affects the carbon chain growth, and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is possible using only adsorbed water in the pores of the material.", "context": "Ti/SBA-15 and Au nanoparticles embedded into Ti/SBA-15 were studied in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and were both found to be active in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.An increase in the rate of reduction of the Au-containing catalyst was found leading to a higher hydrocarbon yield, whereas the formation of an active carbon pool was observed on Ti/SBA-15.Formaldehyde/paraformaldehyde was identified as likely reaction intermediates by infrared spectroscopy.Unlike the less reactive carbon pool formed on Au/ Ti/SBA-15, the carbon pool on Ti/SBA-15 can participate in subsequent reactions.Experiments with varying water content indicate that the gas-phase water content significantly affects the carbon chain growth, and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction is possible using only adsorbed water in the pores of the material.

Photodeposition of Au was performed in a continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor equipped with a 700 W Hg immersion lamp cooled by water circulating in a double wall jacket 11.During photodeposition, the concentration of CO 2 , O 2 , and H 2 was analyzed with a non-dispersive IR photometer, a paramagnetic and a thermal conductivity detector (XStream, Emerson Process Management), respectively.350 mg of catalyst was dispersed in a solution of 550 ml dest.H 2 O and 50 ml methanol.The reactor was deaerated for 60 min using pure N 2 prior to irradiation to obtain reliable H 2 concentrations due to the photocatalytic methanol reforming and to avoid the reverse reaction of hydrogen and oxygen.The activity of Ti/SBA was evaluated by irradiation for 60 min in the absence of the Au precursor.3.5 ml of a 1.5 A 10 A3 molar auric acid solution (HAuCl 4 99.9,Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the suspension, and the reactor was again deaerated for 60 min using pure N 2 .Photodeposition was performed at 30 C with 50 irradiation power (350 W) for 2.5 h.After successful photodeposition, the materials were filtered and freeze-dried over night. The flow scheme of the CO 2 photoreactor setup is presented in Fig. S1.The main elements of this setup are the gas supply, the saturator, the reactor, the analysis devices (GC and QMS), and the pumping system.The home-made gas-phase photoreactor with a volume of approximately 27 ml is constructed on the basis of the design presented by Grimes et al. 14,15.The reactor is fully metal-sealed and can be pumped down to a pressure of 10 A8 mbar.While two separate cooling water circuits control the reactor and the saturator temperature, the gas lines can be heated to avoid water condensation.A sample is spread on glass tray on the bottom of the reactor to obtain a homogeneous light distribution.A 200 W Hg/Xe (Newport Oriel) lamp is used to irradiate the sample through a quartz window allowing for high transmissions of high-energy UV light.Thus, the light irradiance at the sample is 200 mW/cm 2 or 110 mW/cm 2 when a 320 nm cutoff filter is used.Reactions can be performed either in continuous or in batch mode.For this purpose, product gases can be analyzed by QMS (Balzers, Omnistar) in continuous mode and by a GC (Shimadzu 14B) in batch mode.Trace gas analysis is performed with the GC, which is equipped with TCD and FID detectors.Two Porapak N columns and one molecular sieve column are used for separation.Calibration of the GC was performed using a standard gas mixture containing 1000 ppm C 1 -C 5 hydrocarbons and 10 of nitrogen balanced by He (Air Liquide).It was confirmed that the concentration of C1-C4 hydrocarbons can be analyzed reliably down to a concentration of 1 ppm, and the standard deviation for the different hydrocarbon compounds was derived to be below 5. The samples were thoroughly pre-treated in humid He under UV irradiation to remove surface contaminations.The cleaning procedure was repeated until carbon contaminations were sufficiently removed (5 ppm) from the sample surface. CO 2 reduction experiments were performed under static conditions in an atmosphere of 5 CO 2 and 6000 ppm water, which was balanced by He.These conditions were achieved by saturating a CO 2 /He stream with water at 273 K.A CO 2 excess was chosen because of the unfavorable interaction of CO 2 with the isolated titanate species.The initial pressure was adjusted to 1500 mbar.The hydrocarbon formation under illumination with a 200 W Hg/ Xe lamp was monitored during a period of 7 h.For this purpose, samples were taken for GC analysis after 1, 5, and 7 h.The decrease in pressure during sampling was taken into account by normalization of the obtained signals to N 2 used as an internal standard.After reaction, the reactor was pumped down to 5 A 10 A2 mbar and flushed with high purity He.Blank experiments revealed that no hydrocarbons are formed in the absence of a photocatalyst or in absence of high-energy UV light, which was excluded using a 435 nm cutoff filter. Characterization of the samples by UV-Vis spectroscopy and XPS was performed according to previous measurements described in detail elsewhere 13. DRIFT spectra of the samples were recorded at different temperatures between RT and 400 C to remove surface-bound water.Samples were heated with a rate of 5 K/min.At 120 C, the temperature was kept constant, while the spectra were measured.The obtained spectra were first converted to log(1/R) and then normalized to the absorption of the harmonic vibration of SiO 2 , which can be found in the region between 2100 cm A1 and 1700 cm A1 .Diamond powder was used as diluent due to its chemical inertness in a 1:1 ratio (by weight) for the IR spectroscopic measurements (particle size 30-40 lm, Winter Quality Tools)."}]}}
