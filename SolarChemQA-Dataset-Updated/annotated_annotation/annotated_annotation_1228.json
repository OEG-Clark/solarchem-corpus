reduction reaction of BiOBr series samples were performed to investigate the relationship between exposed facets and photocatalytic activity as presented in Fig. 3b.", "context": "The structural investigation of BiOBr series samples is shown in the Fig. 1a, where all the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns can be indexed to the high purity tetragonal BiOBr (JCPDS card No. 73-2061).Although the samples of BiOBr-1, BiOBr-2 and BiOBr-3 possess the same highly exposed (001) facet, the peak intensity variation of (004) facet and the appearance of (010) facet can be identified, indicating that the samples with the same dominantly exposed facet and different exposed lateral facets are obtained.Likewise, the different peak intensities of the (001) facet and (200) facet can be observed in the samples BiOBr-4, BiOBr-5, BiOBr-6 with the same dominantly exposed (010) facet.BiOBr-1, BiOBr-2 and BiOBr-3 show a similar nanosheet morphology and various exposure ratios of lateral facet as demonstrated in Figs.1b andS1a-b (Supporting Information).Further high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image conducted on top (001) facet of BiOBr-1 shows the lattice fringe with spacing of 2.7 A, corresponding to the (110) and (110) planes of BiOBr-1, respectively (Fig. 1c).Meanwhile the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shows symmetrical diffractions pots with identified diffraction planes of (110), (110) and a cross angle of 90 , which is identical to the theoretical value of tetragonal BiOBr.The SEM image of BiOBr-5 reveals its nanoflower morphology stacked by thinner irregular polygonal nanosheets (Fig. 1d).Similar nanoflower morphologies are also observed in BiOBr-4 and BiOBr-6 (Fig. S1c-d).The HRTEM carried out on top (010) facet of BiOBr-5 shows a lattice fringe with spacing of 2.8 A, corresponding to the (102) plane of BiOBr-5 (Fig. 1e).The above results suggest that the as-synthesized BiOBr series samples consist of dominantly exposed (001), (010) facets and diverse exposure ratios of lateral facets. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the surface composition and chemical states of BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5 as shown in Fig. S2, where the high-resolution XPS spectra of the Bi 4f, Br 3d and O 1s are presented.For the BiOBr-1, the two peaks at the binding energies of 159.3 and 164.6 eV can be assigned to Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 , respectively (Fig. S2a).By contrast, slight shift of these two binding energies is found for the BiOBr-5, which signifies the different chemical coordination of surface Bi and O atoms on the (001) and (010) planes of BiOBr 47.The peaks located at 68.6 and 69.6 eV are correspondingly ascribed to Br 3d 5/2 and Br 3d 3/2 of the BiOBr-1 (Fig. S2b). The slight shift at the binding energies of Br is also noticed in BiOBr-5.The two peaks at 529.9 and 531.3 eV occurred in both BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5, which correspond to lattice oxygen and surface hydroxyls, respectively.Compared with BiOBr-1, BiOBr-5 has an obviously larger OH amount (Fig. S2c), which may be due to the partial absence of surface Br atoms, resulting in more exposure of Bi atoms 47.The peak at 532.7 eV appeared in BiOBr-1 is assigned to the adsorbed water caused by the strong interaction between surrounding water and open metal sites on the surface 48.The XPS spectra of BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5 demonstrate similar peak intensities and binding energies, which indicates that they possess the resembling elemental composition and surficial structure. To explore the photogenerated carriers' distribution and the mechanism of internal carrier transfer, the photochemical deposition of metals/metal oxides were implemented, as shown in Fig. 2. It is observed from the SEM images that photo-reduced noble metals Pt and Au are mainly deposited on lateral facets of the BiOBr-1 (Fig. 2a,b) and BiOBr-5 (Fig. 2e,f).The metal depotion form ions metal ions form is described by equation S1 and subsequently confirmed via XPS technique (Figs.S3a, b andS4a, b).As a comparison, one can see that the photooxidation deposition of MnO x and Co 3 O 4 occurs on the dominantly exposed facets of BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5 from the SEM images (Fig. 2c, d and2g, h).The conversion process can be expressed by equation S3 and verified through XPS spectra (Figs.S3c, d andS4c, d), where x of MnO x is estimated to be from 1.5 to 2.0 because the observed binding energies are between those of Mn 2 O 3 and MnO 2 .Metals and metal oxides are separately distributed on the distinct areas of BiOBr surface by photochemical deposition.The results indicate that lateral facets are preferable for electron accumulation while the dominantly exposed facets are beneficial for hole accumulation.Such carrier distribution implies that the electrons and holes may transfer to the lateral facets and dominantly exposed facets upon light illumination, respectively.Additionally, a comparative study of chemical deposition without light irradiation (Fig. S5) indicated that there was no deposition of metals on the surfaces of the sample.This result clearly validates the reaction between photogenerated electron/hole and metal ions. The effects of exposed facets on the optical absorption and band structure of BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5 were examined by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and Mott-Schottky measurements as shown in Figs.S6 andS7.The UV-vis DRS of BiOBr series samples (Fig. S6a) show the similar photoabsorption edge of 370 nm.Based on the plots of (Ah) 1/2 versus photon energy (h), the band gap energies (E g ) of BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5 are calculated to be 2.72 eV and 2.68 eV, respectively (Fig. S6b).Additionally, the positive slope of the Mott-Schottky plots for BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5 indicates the n-type characteristics and the corresponding flat band potentials are measured to be -0.25 V and -0.29 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively (Fig. S7).Then the corresponding band structures of BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5 can be determined as shown in Fig. 3a, the appropriate band structures are thermodynamically favor of both carbon dioxide reduction and water oxidation.Consequently, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction of BiOBr series samples were performed to investigate the relationship between exposed facets and photocatalytic activity as presented in Fig. 3b.Under simulated sunlight irradiation, all BiOBr samples are able to achieve the reduction of CO 2 to photoproduct CO without other reduction products detected, and exhibit relatively steady CO yields as a function of irradiation time.Meanwhile, O 2 was generated during the reaction because the amount of O 2 increased as the reaction proceeded (Fig. S8).In order to compare the performance, the average yields of CO in 2 h on BiOBr series samples are calculated (Fig. 3c), it can be found the activity trend is as follows, i.e., BiOBr-5 BiOBr-4 BiOBr-6 BiOBr-3 BiOBr-2 BiOBr-1.Moreover, the CO yield rate of BiOBr-5 (6.50 mol g -1 h -1 ) is approximately twice as much as that of BiOBr-1 (3.09 mol g -1 h -1 ).Although (010)/(102) facets are exposed in BiOBr-4 and BiOBr-6, their ratios are expected to be much lower than that in BiOBr-5.As a result, BiOBr-4 and BiOBr-6 shows slower CO yields, which are coincidently close to those obtained on BiOBr-1 to BiOBr-3.Similar results have been also reported in Ref. 49.The cycling photocatalytic experiments of BiOBr-5 show no obvious decay in CO yield after five consecutive cycles (Fig. 3d), indicating good stability of the BiOBr-5 catalyst.Furthermore, the XPS and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) were conducted.Although BiOBr-5 was irradiated for a long time, there exited no reduced-state Bi and oxygen vacancies, indicating a good structural stability of BiOBr-5 (Fig. S9).The wavelength-dependent photoreduction CO 2 experiments were conducted.As shown in Fig. S10 and Table S1, the trend of the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of BiOBr-5 is well consistent with its photo-absorption curve, demonstrating that the photo-catalytic CO 2 reduction reaction of BiOBr-5 is driven by the incident photons 50. In order to explore the reasons for the facet-dependent CO 2 photoreduction activity, the fundamental process of photogenerated carriers was investigated.The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra in Fig. 4a demonstrates that the sequentially decreased PL intensity of BiOBr-1 to BiOBr-5 followed by the increased PL intensity of the BiOBr-6.The weakened PL intensity observed in BiOBr-5 indicates its low recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Moreover, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was employed to reveal the lifetime and transfer kinetic of photoelectron as shown in Fig. 4b, it is found that the PL signal of BiOBr-5 exhibits slower decay than the counterpart of BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-6.Further analysis of the curves with re-convolution fitting reveals that the decays of all the samples follow a biexponential decay function.The fitting parameters are listed in Table S2, from which the average lifetime ( ave ) of carrier in BiOBr-5 is more than twice as that in BiOBr-1 and 30 higher than that in BiOBr-6.Electron transfer rate (k ET ) and efficiency ( ET ) are calculated by using equation S5 and S6.As to BiOBr-5, the k ET and ET are 3.658 10 6 s -1 and 54.09, respectively.Strikingly, the ET value of BiOBr-5 is more favorable as compared to that of remaining BiOBr samples as shown in Fig. 4c, indicating that the faster electron transfer rate and higher transfer efficiency exist in BiOBr-5.Further, a much higher photocurrent density observed in BiOBr-5 signifies its improved separation ability of photogenerated electron-hole pairs (Fig. S11a).Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) show that the ranking of EIS arc radius follows the trend of R (BiOBr-5) R (BiOBr-6) R (BiOBr-1) , indicating that the interfacial charge transfer of BiOBr-5 is the fastest (Fig. S11b).The above mentioned findings illustrate that diverse dominantly exposed facets and lateral facets influence the photogenerated carriers involving their separation and transfer.Photogenerated carriers play a crucial role in the photocatalytic activity, so there is a facet-dependent CO 2 photoreduction activity. To uncover the underlying mechanism of facet junctions in CO 2 photoreduction, density functional theory calculations were performed.According to the experimental observations in Figs. 1 andS1, the samples can be categorized into two groups, i.e., from BiOBr-1 to BiOBr-3 and from BiOBr-4 to BiOBr-6.The (001) facet is dominantly exposed with the (110) facet co-exposed in the lateral in the former, suggesting a (001)/(110) facet junction.In comparison, the later shows dominantly (010) facet on the surface and (102) in the lateral, indicating a (010)/ (102) facet junction.Therefore, the (010), ( 102), ( 001) and (110) surface models were adopted to explore the electronic behaviors upon the formation of BiOBr facet junctions.The density of states and the derived band edge positions are shown in Fig. S12 and Table S3, respectively.Accordingly, the band alignments are presented in Fig. 4d.It is found that the band edges of (001) and (010) are higher than those of (110) and (102), respectively.This result indicates the formation of type-II band alignment in both facet junctions, which enables high efficiency of photogenerated charge separation.Clearly, the difference between the two conduction band edges is 1.53 eV in (001)/(110).In contrast, the (010)/(102) junction shows a significantly smaller difference of 0.60 eV, suggesting potentially a much faster charge transfer at the junction 51.In addition, the valence band edge of (001) is only 0.70 eV lower than the conduction band edge of (110) in (001)/(110), implying an enhanced recombination probability of photo-generated carrier.Fig. 4e and f further comparatively visualize the conduction band edges of (110) and (102).Notably, the electronic states are remarkably larger on (102) than on (110), revealing a substantial larger ability of the former to accumulate photogenerated electrons under irradiation.As a result of the features, the (010)/(102) junction allows a higher charge separation and transfer efficiency than (001)/(110), rationalizing the superior photocatalytic performance in BiOBr-5 sample. Understanding the reaction intermediate steps for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process is vital for revealing the mechanism of the observed enhanced activity.Therefore, the in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (in-situ DRIFTS) were measured, which was carried out in a sealed chamber, filled with CO 2 and H 2 O vapor.As shown in Fig. 5, the real-time infrared signals of intermediates on BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5 catalyst surface were recorded every 5 min in the absence or presence of simulated sunlight irradiation after the adsorption equilibrium is reached.It is noted that the infrared signals increase with increasing absorption time and eventually reach saturation, among which the peaks at 1650, 1610, 1560 and 1416 cm -1 correspond to the adsorbed species bidentate carbonates (b-CO 3 ) and bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) (Fig. 5a andc) 52,53, respectively.During the reaction process, a new peak was obtained at 1360 cm -1 , as shown in Fig. 5b andd (the details of in-situ DRIFTS curves in wavelength range of 14201300 cm -1 were provided in Fig. S13), which is ascribed to the specie formate (HCO 2 -) 54.Furthermore, the obvious increase of peaks intensity for m-CO 3 2-and HCO 2 -are further observed in BiOBr-5 (Fig. 5b andd) and may be the reason for the improvement of CO yield.Based on the above in-situ DRIFTS results, the possible two-electron paths of CO 2 photoreduction to CO are proposed in Fig. 5e.CO 2 chemically absorbed on BiOBr firstly converts to bridge carbonate through dehydrogenation, subsequently monodentate carbonate via reacting with OH -and eventually bicarbonate by hydrogenation.Afterwards, it is inferred that two paths exist under the light irradiation, i.e., formate channel (path I) and direct reduction channel (path II)."}, {"llm generation": "BiOBr", "source": "The BiOBr-5 exhibits higher CO 2 photoreduction performance than that of the remaining BiOBr photocatalysts.", "context": "In conclusion, BiOBr nanosheets composed of dominantly exposed facets of (001) and (010) with different exposure ratios are prepared via a hydrothermal strategy under different acid environment.The BiOBr-5 exhibits higher CO 2 photoreduction performance than that of the remaining BiOBr photocatalysts.Such enhancement is caused by the facet junction rather than the dominantly exposed facet, leading to the improved photogenerated carrier separation.The facet junction guarantees that the spatial charge separation occurs on both sides of the facet junction and allows oxidation and reduction reactions to take place independently.Besides, both fast transfer rate and high transfer efficiency is found between the exposed facets as their conduction (valence) band edges approach.This work paves a new way for governing charge transport behaviors via the synergistic engineering of exposing facets.

The effects of exposed facets on the optical absorption and band structure of BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5 were examined by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and Mott-Schottky measurements as shown in Figs.S6 andS7.The UV-vis DRS of BiOBr series samples (Fig. S6a) show the similar photoabsorption edge of 370 nm.Based on the plots of (Ah) 1/2 versus photon energy (h), the band gap energies (E g ) of BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5 are calculated to be 2.72 eV and 2.68 eV, respectively (Fig. S6b).Additionally, the positive slope of the Mott-Schottky plots for BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5 indicates the n-type characteristics and the corresponding flat band potentials are measured to be -0.25 V and -0.29 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively (Fig. S7).Then the corresponding band structures of BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5 can be determined as shown in Fig. 3a, the appropriate band structures are thermodynamically favor of both carbon dioxide reduction and water oxidation.Consequently, photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction of BiOBr series samples were performed to investigate the relationship between exposed facets and photocatalytic activity as presented in Fig. 3b.Under simulated sunlight irradiation, all BiOBr samples are able to achieve the reduction of CO 2 to photoproduct CO without other reduction products detected, and exhibit relatively steady CO yields as a function of irradiation time.Meanwhile, O 2 was generated during the reaction because the amount of O 2 increased as the reaction proceeded (Fig. S8).In order to compare the performance, the average yields of CO in 2 h on BiOBr series samples are calculated (Fig. 3c), it can be found the activity trend is as follows, i.e., BiOBr-5 BiOBr-4 BiOBr-6 BiOBr-3 BiOBr-2 BiOBr-1.Moreover, the CO yield rate of BiOBr-5 (6.50 mol g -1 h -1 ) is approximately twice as much as that of BiOBr-1 (3.09 mol g -1 h -1 ).Although (010)/(102) facets are exposed in BiOBr-4 and BiOBr-6, their ratios are expected to be much lower than that in BiOBr-5.As a result, BiOBr-4 and BiOBr-6 shows slower CO yields, which are coincidently close to those obtained on BiOBr-1 to BiOBr-3.Similar results have been also reported in Ref. 49.The cycling photocatalytic experiments of BiOBr-5 show no obvious decay in CO yield after five consecutive cycles (Fig. 3d), indicating good stability of the BiOBr-5 catalyst.Furthermore, the XPS and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) were conducted.Although BiOBr-5 was irradiated for a long time, there exited no reduced-state Bi and oxygen vacancies, indicating a good structural stability of BiOBr-5 (Fig. S9).The wavelength-dependent photoreduction CO 2 experiments were conducted.As shown in Fig. S10 and Table S1, the trend of the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of BiOBr-5 is well consistent with its photo-absorption curve, demonstrating that the photo-catalytic CO 2 reduction reaction of BiOBr-5 is driven by the incident photons 50. In order to explore the reasons for the facet-dependent CO 2 photoreduction activity, the fundamental process of photogenerated carriers was investigated.The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra in Fig. 4a demonstrates that the sequentially decreased PL intensity of BiOBr-1 to BiOBr-5 followed by the increased PL intensity of the BiOBr-6.The weakened PL intensity observed in BiOBr-5 indicates its low recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Moreover, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was employed to reveal the lifetime and transfer kinetic of photoelectron as shown in Fig. 4b, it is found that the PL signal of BiOBr-5 exhibits slower decay than the counterpart of BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-6.Further analysis of the curves with re-convolution fitting reveals that the decays of all the samples follow a biexponential decay function.The fitting parameters are listed in Table S2, from which the average lifetime ( ave ) of carrier in BiOBr-5 is more than twice as that in BiOBr-1 and 30 higher than that in BiOBr-6.Electron transfer rate (k ET ) and efficiency ( ET ) are calculated by using equation S5 and S6.As to BiOBr-5, the k ET and ET are 3.658 10 6 s -1 and 54.09, respectively.Strikingly, the ET value of BiOBr-5 is more favorable as compared to that of remaining BiOBr samples as shown in Fig. 4c, indicating that the faster electron transfer rate and higher transfer efficiency exist in BiOBr-5.Further, a much higher photocurrent density observed in BiOBr-5 signifies its improved separation ability of photogenerated electron-hole pairs (Fig. S11a).Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) show that the ranking of EIS arc radius follows the trend of R (BiOBr-5) R (BiOBr-6) R (BiOBr-1) , indicating that the interfacial charge transfer of BiOBr-5 is the fastest (Fig. S11b).The above mentioned findings illustrate that diverse dominantly exposed facets and lateral facets influence the photogenerated carriers involving their separation and transfer.Photogenerated carriers play a crucial role in the photocatalytic activity, so there is a facet-dependent CO 2 photoreduction activity. To uncover the underlying mechanism of facet junctions in CO 2 photoreduction, density functional theory calculations were performed.According to the experimental observations in Figs. 1 andS1, the samples can be categorized into two groups, i.e., from BiOBr-1 to BiOBr-3 and from BiOBr-4 to BiOBr-6.The (001) facet is dominantly exposed with the (110) facet co-exposed in the lateral in the former, suggesting a (001)/(110) facet junction.In comparison, the later shows dominantly (010) facet on the surface and (102) in the lateral, indicating a (010)/ (102) facet junction.Therefore, the (010), ( 102), ( 001) and (110) surface models were adopted to explore the electronic behaviors upon the formation of BiOBr facet junctions.The density of states and the derived band edge positions are shown in Fig. S12 and Table S3, respectively.Accordingly, the band alignments are presented in Fig. 4d.It is found that the band edges of (001) and (010) are higher than those of (110) and (102), respectively.This result indicates the formation of type-II band alignment in both facet junctions, which enables high efficiency of photogenerated charge separation.Clearly, the difference between the two conduction band edges is 1.53 eV in (001)/(110).In contrast, the (010)/(102) junction shows a significantly smaller difference of 0.60 eV, suggesting potentially a much faster charge transfer at the junction 51.In addition, the valence band edge of (001) is only 0.70 eV lower than the conduction band edge of (110) in (001)/(110), implying an enhanced recombination probability of photo-generated carrier.Fig. 4e and f further comparatively visualize the conduction band edges of (110) and (102).Notably, the electronic states are remarkably larger on (102) than on (110), revealing a substantial larger ability of the former to accumulate photogenerated electrons under irradiation.As a result of the features, the (010)/(102) junction allows a higher charge separation and transfer efficiency than (001)/(110), rationalizing the superior photocatalytic performance in BiOBr-5 sample. Understanding the reaction intermediate steps for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction process is vital for revealing the mechanism of the observed enhanced activity.Therefore, the in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (in-situ DRIFTS) were measured, which was carried out in a sealed chamber, filled with CO 2 and H 2 O vapor.As shown in Fig. 5, the real-time infrared signals of intermediates on BiOBr-1 and BiOBr-5 catalyst surface were recorded every 5 min in the absence or presence of simulated sunlight irradiation after the adsorption equilibrium is reached.It is noted that the infrared signals increase with increasing absorption time and eventually reach saturation, among which the peaks at 1650, 1610, 1560 and 1416 cm -1 correspond to the adsorbed species bidentate carbonates (b-CO 3 ) and bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) (Fig. 5a andc) 52,53, respectively.During the reaction process, a new peak was obtained at 1360 cm -1 , as shown in Fig. 5b andd (the details of in-situ DRIFTS curves in wavelength range of 14201300 cm -1 were provided in Fig. S13), which is ascribed to the specie formate (HCO 2 -) 54.Furthermore, the obvious increase of peaks intensity for m-CO 3 2-and HCO 2 -are further observed in BiOBr-5 (Fig. 5b andd) and may be the reason for the improvement of CO yield.Based on the above in-situ DRIFTS results, the possible two-electron paths of CO 2 photoreduction to CO are proposed in Fig. 5e.CO 2 chemically absorbed on BiOBr firstly converts to bridge carbonate through dehydrogenation, subsequently monodentate carbonate via reacting with OH -and eventually bicarbonate by hydrogenation.Afterwards, it is inferred that two paths exist under the light irradiation, i.e., formate channel (path I) and direct reduction channel (path II)."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "A 300W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300/UV, PerfectLight) with a AM1.5 cut-off filter was used as a simulated sun light source.", "context": "All chemicals used in this study were of commercially available analytical grade and used without further purification.1 mmol of Bi (NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O was respectively added to six beakers containing 15 mL distilled water with continuous stirring for 30 min, which was termed as solution A. 6 mmol of KBr were dissolved in 90 mL distilled water under vigorous stirring, and then divided equally into six parts, which was termed as solution B.
