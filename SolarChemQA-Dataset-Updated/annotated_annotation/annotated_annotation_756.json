The absorption performances of as-prepared C 3 N 4 and C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composite photocatalysts were investigated via UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (UV-vis DRS), and the results are presented in Fig. 5.As exhibited in Fig. 5, the as-prepared C 3 N 4 shows higher absorption performance which the fundamental absorption edge located at 475 nm.However, the fundamental absorption edges of as-prepared C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composites show a gradual blue shift with increasing the amounts of TiO 2 , which located at 460 nm (C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 with weight ratio of 2:1), 430 nm (C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 with weight ratio of 1:1) and 410 nm (C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 with weight ratio of 1:2), respectively.The band gap values can be estimated by the formula 50: And the values are 2.61, 2.70, 2.88 and 3.02 eV for C 3 N 4 , C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 (2:1), C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 (1:1) and C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 (1:2), respectively.In addition, the potentials of the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) for asprepared photocatalysts can be calculated by formulas (2) and (3) 51: X is the Sanderson electronegativity defined as the geometric mean of the electronegativity of the constituent atoms, which the X values of C 3 N 4 is 4.73.E is the energy of electrons on the hydrogen scale and the value is 4.5 eV.The calculated results of as-prepared photocatalysts are showed in Table 1.

In order to obtain the recombination of excited electrons and holes, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of as-prepared photocatalysts were used to recorded, the results are showed in Fig. 6.As illustrated in Fig. 6, it is clearly found that the C 3 N 4 shows strongest emission peak, after modification of TiO 2 , the intensity of composite photocatalyst is obviously low, even the low amounts of TiO 2 coupled into the composite, and the intensity of composite decreases with increasing the amounts of TiO 2 .It is well known that the intensity of PL depends on the recombination of electrons and holes, the higher intensity is, the higher recombination is generated 52,53.According to this, it can be understood that the composite photocatalyst has higher electrons transfer, indicating that there will be strong junction between C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 , and the junction structure can be effectively separate the electrons and holes, which led to lower emission peaks of composite photocatalysts. To further understand the charge transfer of as-prepared photocatalysts, the transient photocurrents were obtained via the photoelectrochemical measurement with I-t curves under several on-off cycles, the results shown in Fig. 7.As exhibited in Fig. 7, it can be clearly found that the photocurrent intensity of as-prepared photocatalysts obviously increases with improving the amounts of TiO 2 .It is best known that the higher photocurrent value corresponds to a higher charges transfer, which indicted higher separation of electrons and holes 54,55.The composite photocatalyst of C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 (1:2) shows highest photocurrent intensity, indicating that the composite photocatalyst possesses highest separation of electrons and holes, which the results agree with that of PL.The reason may be due to that the strong junction of C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 could effectively transfer the photogenerated charge carriers.

In order to examine the element composition and chemical state of the as-prepared TiO 2 /C 3 N 4 composite photocatalyst, XPS was used to further investigate the sample.Fig. 2(A) shows the high-resolution of C1s, it can be observed four peaks located at 284.6 eV, 285.8 eV, 288 eV and 288.9 eV which could index to C--C, C-N, (N)2-C--N and O-C--O, respectively 43.In Fig. 2(B), the N1s peaks for TiO 2 /C 3 N 4 hybrid composite at 398.6, 399.4,and 400.9 eV can be assigned to C-N--C, N-(C)3 and H-N-H, respectively 44.Fig. 2(C) shows the O1s high resolution spectrum, it can be fitted into two peaks at 530.2 eV and 532.7 eV which ascribed to Ti-O and surface -OH, respectively 45,46.Fig. 2(D) shows the high-resolution of Ti 2p, it can be clearly found two major peaks at 459.1 eV and 465.0 eV which can be assigned to the Ti 4 2p3/2 and Ti 4 2p1/2 peaks of TiO 2 47.According to the results, it can be confirmed that the composite photocatalyst contains TiO 2 and C 3 N 4 . Fig. 3 shows the morphologies of as-prepared pure C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 / C 3 N 4 composite photocatalysts (Fig. 3(b)) with the mass ratio of 1:2, it can be found that the morphologies of as-prepared photocatalysts 48.The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is showed in Fig. 4(b), It can be obviously seen the ring type structure with bright spots, indicating the random orientation of crystalline TiO 2 in the obtained composite photocatalyst 49, which corresponded to the results of XRD. The absorption performances of as-prepared C 3 N 4 and C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composite photocatalysts were investigated via UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (UV-vis DRS), and the results are presented in Fig. 5.As exhibited in Fig. 5, the as-prepared C 3 N 4 shows higher absorption performance which the fundamental absorption edge located at 475 nm.However, the fundamental absorption edges of as-prepared C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composites show a gradual blue shift with increasing the amounts of TiO 2 , which located at 460 nm (C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 with weight ratio of 2:1), 430 nm (C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 with weight ratio of 1:1) and 410 nm (C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 with weight ratio of 1:2), respectively.The band gap values can be estimated by the formula 50: And the values are 2.61, 2.70, 2.88 and 3.02 eV for C 3 N 4 , C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 (2:1), C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 (1:1) and C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 (1:2), respectively.In addition, the potentials of the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) for asprepared photocatalysts can be calculated by formulas (2) and (3) 51: X is the Sanderson electronegativity defined as the geometric mean of the electronegativity of the constituent atoms, which the X values of C 3 N 4 is 4.73.E is the energy of electrons on the hydrogen scale and the value is 4.5 eV.The calculated results of as-prepared photocatalysts are showed in Table 1. Clearly, the E CB of composite photocatalyst changes more negative The calculated parameters of as-obtained photocatalysts.with increasing the amounts of TiO 2 , suggesting that the as-prepared composite photocatalysts will have more reduction performance for CO 2 . In order to obtain the recombination of excited electrons and holes, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of as-prepared photocatalysts were used to recorded, the results are showed in Fig. 6.As illustrated in Fig. 6, it is clearly found that the C 3 N 4 shows strongest emission peak, after modification of TiO 2 , the intensity of composite photocatalyst is obviously low, even the low amounts of TiO 2 coupled into the composite, and the intensity of composite decreases with increasing the amounts of TiO 2 .It is well known that the intensity of PL depends on the recombination of electrons and holes, the higher intensity is, the higher recombination is generated 52,53.According to this, it can be understood that the composite photocatalyst has higher electrons transfer, indicating that there will be strong junction between C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 , and the junction structure can be effectively separate the electrons and holes, which led to lower emission peaks of composite photocatalysts. To further understand the charge transfer of as-prepared photocatalysts, the transient photocurrents were obtained via the photoelectrochemical measurement with I-t curves under several on-off cycles, the results shown in Fig. 7.As exhibited in Fig. 7, it can be clearly found that the photocurrent intensity of as-prepared photocatalysts obviously increases with improving the amounts of TiO 2 .It is best known that the higher photocurrent value corresponds to a higher charges transfer, which indicted higher separation of electrons and holes 54,55.The composite photocatalyst of C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 (1:2) shows highest photocurrent intensity, indicating that the composite photocatalyst possesses highest separation of electrons and holes, which the results agree with that of PL.The reason may be due to that the strong junction of C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 could effectively transfer the photogenerated charge carriers. The photocatalytic reductions of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO were investigated with different photocatalyts under 8 W UV lamp, the results followed in Fig. 8.For the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 (Fig. 8 (1:1) and C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 (1:2), respectively.Clearly, the composite photocatalyts could significantly enhance photocatalytic reduction may be the results of the strong junction of C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 can improve the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and the electrons could further active the CO 2 and enhance the photocatalytic reduction.Fig. 8 (b) shows the reduction of CO 2 to CO, the highest reduction efficiency of the as-prepared photocatalyst is same to that of CH 4 , the CO yields with C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 (2:1) photocatalyst could reach 56.2 mol g A 1 , the other CO yields are 29.9, 31.0 and 23.5 mol g A 1 for C 3 N 4 , C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 (1:1) and C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 (1:2), respectively.Meanwhile, the H 2 yield is not detected in the photocatalytic reduction proceeded under our test system.Therefore, it could be inferred that the production of CH 4 and CO is from CO 2 reduction with the as-prepared photocatalysts.Compared with the pure C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, the composite C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 on reduction of CO 2 is clearly enhanced, the reason can be attributed to the hetterjunctions between C 3 N 4 and TiO 2 , which could improve the charges transfer, the separation rate of photogenerated electrons and holes is effectively promoted and the photocatalytic reduction is further enhanced.According to our work, we further summarize some works about metal oxide coupling with g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the results show in Table 2.It can be clearly found that the products with different reaction system are also variant.Although the irradiation condition same, the different catalysts and reaction system could generate the different products.The most reasons mainly attribute to the reaction system, even the reactor.Therefore, the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is really complex processes, especially the reaction conditions have small changes, the results could change a lots.In our work, the irradiation condition is under UV lamp, clearly the power is small and it can analyze two products in the reduction processes, the yields of CH 4 and CO are not too low.Indicating that this reaction system may be used to further investigate for the reduction of CO 2 . According to our experimental results, the charges transfer pathways of the composite photocatalyst can be figured out in Fig. 9.As exhibited in Fig. 9, it can be clearly found that the position of CB is obviously raised after coupling TiO 2 , corresponding to the position of VB is decreased.Therefore, the redox performance of composite photocatalyst can be enhanced and the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO is improved.And all the processes can be followed the equations of ( 4) to (8), it can be further detail illustration that the electrons and holes are generated by enough light energy excited on C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 composite photocatalyst, the electrons can directly act on CO 2 under light irradiation and further form CO 2 -species; Meanwhile, the holes could act to H 2 O and further generate H .At this time the species of species could further act on the H with different electrons and form the CO and CH 4 656667."}, {"llm generation": "UV", "source": "And the highest CH 4 and CO yields of 72.2 and 56.2 mol g A 1 have been obtained at an optimized modified amounts of TiO 2 under 4 h irradiation of 8 W UV lamp, respectively.", "context": "In summary, the TiO 2 /C 3 N 4 composite photocatalysts with different amounts of TiO 2 have been successfully fabricated by ball-milling method combined with calcination process.With the different amounts of TiO 2 in the composite photocatalysts, the positions of CB and VB have been changed, and compared to the pure C 3 N 4 , the photoreduction of CO 2 is obviously enhanced.The reason is mainly owed to the heterostructure between TiO 2 and C 3 N 4 which could effectively promote the separation of electrons and holes.And the highest CH 4 and CO yields of 72.2 and 56.2 mol g A 1 have been obtained at an optimized modified amounts of TiO 2 under 4 h irradiation of 8 W UV lamp, respectively.This work has the potential to provide a new way to obtain the composite photocatalyst for the conversion of CO 2 .
