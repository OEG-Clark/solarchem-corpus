In addition, a broad peak in the range of 25 35was observed in the XRD pattern, which can be attributed to the amorphous BiVO 4 (a-BiVO 4 ) phase 23,34.Fig. 1b-d show the XRD patterns of Bi/BiVO 4 composites after reaction with different amount of AgNO 3 .Obviously, the intensity of the (012) diffraction peak decreases gradually with increasing the amount of AgNO 3 , suggesting more metallic Bi was oxidized by Ag ions.Careful comparison reveals that the position of (012) diffraction peak maintains unchanged, suggesting no Bi-Ag alloy was formed.It is also found that, after hydrothermal treatment in AgNO 3 aqueous solution, a weak peak at 2 28.71emerges,which can be assigned to the reflection of (121) plane of monoclinic BiVO 4 phase (JCPDS No. 14-0688), indicating the a-BiVO 4 was transformed to crystalline BiVO 4 (c-BiVO 4 ) under the hydrothermal condition.The diffraction peaks located at 2 38.01,44.37, 64.48, and 77.44also can be assigned to (111), (200), (220), and (311) reflections of Ag phase (JCPDS No. 65-2871) 35, respectively.Moreover, the intensities of these diffraction peaks increase with the increase in the amount of AgNO 3 , suggesting that Ag content in the products can be easily controlled by tuning the AgNO 3 concentration.Metallic Ag was derived from the oxidation-reduction reaction between metal Bi and AgNO 3 .Because the standard electrode potential of the Ag /Ag pair (0.7996 V) is higher than that of Bi 3 /Bi (0.308 V), Ag can be reduced by metal Bi to form Ag 35,36.The reaction may be formulated as: The SEM characterization was utilized to investigate their morphology, crystal structure, and particle size of the Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 samples.Typical SEM images of these samples were displayed in Fig. 2. The SEM image in Fig. 2a shows that the BBV sample is composed of chain-like microstructures assembled by microspheres with smooth surface.The diameter of these microspheres is in the range of 300 600 nm.The broken sites in some microspheres suggest that the chain-like microstructures possess a hollow interior structure.The EDX analysis (Fig. S4a) reveals that BBV sample contains O, V, and Bi elements, and the content of metal Bi in BBV is about 39.4 wt.Fig. 2b-d shows the SEM images of BBV after reaction with different amount of AgNO 3 .Generally, these samples still take on chain-like morphology though they were hydrothermally treated in AgNO 3 aqueous solution.Nevertheless, some flake-like nanoparticles were decorated on the surface of the chain-like microstructures, leading to a rougher surface in comparison with that of BBV sample.The amount and size of these nanoflakes increase gradually with increasing the AgNO 3 concentration in the reaction solution.The EDX spectrum in Fig. S4b displays the existence of O, V, Bi, and Ag elements in ABBV-2 sample.The contents of metallic Ag and Bi in different Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 samples were further analyzed using ICP-MS, as shown in Table 1.It can be found that the amount of Ag in the composites can be tuned by adjusting the AgNO 3 concentration in the reaction solution, which is in well accordance with the XRD results. To investigate the detailed microstructure of the Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, TEM and HRTEM characterizations were utilized.Fig. 3a shows a typical TEM image of BBV sample.Similar to the results from the SEM characterization, the chain-like microstructures in BBV have smooth surface.The center of the chain-like microstructures is brighter than their periphery, demonstrating the hollow interior structure of these microstructures once again.Fig. 3b displays a typical HRTEM image obtained from the chain-like microstructures, indicating the co-existence of both crystal nanoparticles and amorphous phases.The lattice intervals of 0.330 and 0.238 nm are in consistence with the (012) and (104) crystalline plane of metallic Bi 23,24.The amorphous phase can be assigned to the BiVO 4 , consistent with the XRD results.The TEM images of ABBV-2 shown in Figs.3c and S5a reveal that a large number of nanoflakes were grown on the surface of microspheres, giving rise to a relatively rougher surface compared to that of BBV sample.The typical HRTEM image of the nanoflakes was presented in Fig. 3d.The lattice distance of 0.236 nm corresponds to the (111) crystalline plane of Ag, indicating the formation of metallic Ag nanoflakes 35.The HRTEM image in Fig. S5b XPS characterization of the BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples was performed to identify the elemental compositions and their oxidation states.The curve (I) in Fig. 4a presents the high resolution Bi 4f XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The strong peaks located at 159.4 and 164.6 eV are attributed to Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 of Bi 3 , respectively, while the weak signals at 157.8 and 163.0 eV can be assigned to the metallic Biin ABBV-2.37 Fig. 4b displays the Ag 3d regional XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The two peaks centered at 374.1 and 368.0 eV can be ascribed to the metallic Ag in ABBV-2 38.The curve (I) in Fig. 4c displays the V 2p XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The peaks located at 516.6 and 524.2 eV belong to the V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 binding energies of V 5 in BiVO 4 39, respectively.The O 1s XPS spectrum of ABBV-2 (Fig. 4d) shows three strong peaks centered at 528.9, 531.5 and 532.9 eV, which Scheme 1. Schematic procedure for the construction of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 chain-like hollow microstructures.correspond to the crystal lattice oxygen (O latt ), dangling bonds (B dan ), and adsorbed oxygen (O ads ) species 12, respectively.The dangling bonds and adsorbed oxygen species in the XPS spectrum usually mean the formation of OVs in the material surface, and a larger number of dangling bonds and adsorbed oxygen species imply a higher OVs concentration 40.The relative intensity ratio (R int ) of O latt /(B dan O ads ) can roughly reflect the relative OVs concentration 41.According to the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4d), the R int values of BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 were estimated to be 3.20, 1.28, 1.35, and 1.40, respectively, indicating that the OVs concentrations of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 are The Ag content, E g value, S BET , and CO evolution rate of different samples.much higher than that of BV-1.In addition, it is also found that the Bi 4f, V 2p and O 1s peaks of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 are slightly shifted to higher binding energies compared to those of BV-1, which may be ascribed to the higher OVs concentrations in these samples 42. To identify the existence of surface OVs in BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples, the EPR spectra of these samples were carried out, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Obviously, nearly no EPR signals were observed for BV-1.On the contrary, the EPR spectra of BV-2 and BBV samples display strong signals at g 1.966, which may originate from the surface OVs 32,43.As the Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of Bi/BiVO 4 , the intensity of EPR signal decreased slightly, implying the decreased OVs concentration in the composites, which may be mainly caused by the oxidation of partial OVs by the oxygen in the reaction solution under the hydrothermal condition 44. UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra ranging from 200 700 nm were employed to probe the light absorption properties of and band-gap energies (E g ) of the pure BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, as displayed in Fig. 6a.The absorption edge of BV-2 sample is determined to be around 450 nm, suggesting that the BV-2 has a weak absorption property for visible-light.Moreover, an weak absorption tail in the range of 450 700 nm was observed, which may be induced by the surface OVs in BV-2 44.For Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, they have similar absorption edges (465, 469, 470, and 473 nm for BBV, ABBV-1, ABBV-2, and ABBV-3 sample, respectively) though the metallic Bi or Ag contents in these samples are different.However, their absorption intensities in the range of 450 700 nm are quite different.The BBV sample shows a remarkebly enhanced light absorption in the range of 450 700 nm compared to BV-2 sample.The enhancement in light absorption could be caused by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of metallic Bi nanoparticles 23,24.For Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, their absorption intensities in the visiblelight region increased along with increasing the Ag content, which can be ascribed to the SPR effect of Ag nanoflakes 20.It is expected that the enhanced visible-light absorption would lead to a boosted photocatalytic performance of the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites.The E g values of the BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 , and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 were determined by using the equation: E g 1240/ g 45, and presented in Table 1.It is clear that the metallic Bi and Ag nanoparticles have little influence in the E g of BiVO 4 .Fig. 6b displays the PL emission spectra of BV-2, BBV and ABBV-2 samples.Obviously, the PL intensity of ABBV-2 decreases significantly compared to both BV-2 and BBV, which is attributed to the higher delocalization of photoexcited charge pairs giving rise to a lower recombination rate 46. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed to identify the 47.Fig. 7B illustrates the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites.It can be seen that the arc radius in EIS Nynquist plots of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites are much smaller than that of Bi/BiVO 4 .The radius of the circular arc increase in the following order: ABBV-2 ABBV-3 ABBV-1 BBV, which is in agreement with the variation trend of photocurrent density.It has been well demonstrated that the smaller radius of the circular arc represents the higher charge-separation efficiency 48.Therefore, the ABBV-2 possess a faster interfacial charge migration and retarded recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in comparison with other samples.The primary cause for this phenomenon is that the proper amount of Ag nanoparticles can accelerate charge-transfer and electron collection, while excessive Ag nanoparticles would facilitate the recombination of photoexited charge pairs, leading to a higher interfacial charge transfer resistance.The consistent variation trend of photocurrent and EIS strongly confirms that the loading a proper amount of metal Ag can effectively restrain the recombination of photoinduced charge pairs. The photocatalytic performances of pure BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 , and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 were evaluated through the CO 2 photocatalytic conversion under the visible-light irradiation.Analytical detection of the gassous products revealed that CO was detected as the only carbonaceous gas products during the process of CO 2 photoreduction.For comparison, control experiments were carried out only in the presence of illumination, catalysts, CO 2 , or H 2 O, in which no CO products were detectable.In contrast, in the presence of illumination, catalysts, CO 2 , and H 2 O, detectable CO was obtained, confirming that the CO gas really originated from the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.The CO production rate of these samples after 4 h' light irradiation was displayed in Fig. 8a.As can be seen, in the presence of BV-1 and BV-2 samples, only a trace or small amount of CO was obtained, indicating that the pure BiVO 4 nearly exhibits no or very weak photocatalytic activity toward CO reduction.However, a relatively high evolution rate ( 1.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) can be obtained in the presence of BBV sample.The dual contribution of metal Bi nanoparticles and surface OVs may give rise to the enhanced photocatalytic performance of BBV sample 49.It is worth noting that the metal Bi content can affect the photocatalytic activity of BBV catalyst and the optimal content of metal Bi in BBV is 39.4 wt , as show in table S1.Consequently, the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composite photocatalysts were constructed using the BBV sample with 39.4 wt metal Bi as template.After being loaded with Ag nanoparticles, the CO production rate is further increased greatly, indicating that metallic Ag can boost the photocatalytic performance of Bi/BiVO 4 composites.Moreover, the CO evolution rate largely depends on the metal Ag content.The CO-yielding rate of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites initially increases with enhancing Ag loading and then decreases gradually.The variation trend of the CO evolution rate is in agreement with that of photocurrent and EIS of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 .With increasing the amount of Ag nanoparticles till reaching an optimal amount, the separation efficiency of photoexcited charge pairs was enhanced gradually, resulting in a gradually improved photocatalytic activity of Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 .However, excessive metal Ag would boost the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, giving rise to an impaired enhancement of photocatalytic activity.ABBV-2 sample displays the highest CO evolution rate ( 5.19 mol g -1 h -1 ), which is much higher than that of BBV.The present CO production rate is better than that of Ag/ Na 2 Ti 6 O 13 catalysts applied in CO 2 photoreduction toward CO 50.The recycling stability of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 photocatalysts was also studied, as shown in Fig. 8b.Obviously, the photocatalytic activity of these photocatalysts only decreases slightly after five continuous cycles under the identical conditions.The XRD pattern and SEM image (as shown in Fig. S6) of the ABBV-2 sample after successive photocatalytic reactions demonstrate that the crystal phase and shape of ABBV-2 is still preserved after the photocatalytic reactions.The TEM and HRTEM images of ABBV-2 after photocatalytic reaction are given in Fig. S7.No lattice fringes corresponding to the planes of Ag 2 O and Bi 2 O 3 were observed in the HREM image, suggesting that the metal Ag and Bi are not oxidized during photocatalytic reaction.Moreover, the distribution and morphology of Ag nanoflakes and metal Bi nanoparticles in ABBV-2 after photocatalytic reaction nearly maintain unchanged.The stability of surface OVs in ABBV-2 was also examined, as shown in Fig. S8.Apparently, ABBV-2 sample after photocatalytic reaction still displays a strong EPR signal at g 1.966, indicating that the surface OVs in ABBV-2 are stable at room temperature.All of above results confirm the high stability of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 photocatalysts, which accounts for why Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 has the sustained photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion after five continuous cycles. To explore the charge-transfer mechanism of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 composites, the band-edge positions of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples were predicted based on their flat-band potentials (E fb ) and E g values.By the means of Mott-Schottky analysis (Fig. 8c), the E fb values for BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 were determined to be -0.648,-0.601, and -0.596 V vs. SCE at pH 7, respectively.The E fb can be further converted into normal hydrogen electrode potential (NHE) according to the formula: E NHE E SCE E SCE 0.059 pH 51, where E SCE is the potential of SCE, E SCE is 0.2415 V, and pH is about 7.0.The CB of VB-2 sample is determined to be -0.477V. Usually, the CB should be more negative by 0.2 V than the E fb 52, and thus the CB of VB-2 should be about -0.677 V, which is much higher than the previously reported CB edge position of BiVO 4 53.The elevated CB potential of BV-2 may be caused by the surface OVs 54,55.Similarly, the CB values of BBV and ABBV-2 samples are calculated to be -0.630, and -0.625 V, respectively, indicating that metallic Bi and Ag nanoparticles can slightly alter the CB of BV-2.Combining the E g of BV-2 (2.76 eV), the valance band (VB) of BV-2 can be determined by the equation: E CB E VB -E g , where E CB and E VB are the CB potential and VB potential, respectively.Thus, the VB value of BV-2 is calculated to be 2.10 eV.To further confirm this band structure, the XPS VB spectrum of BV-2 was also carried out, as illustrated in Fig. 8d.According to the linear intersection method 56, E VB of BV-2 is estimated to be 2.17 eV, which is very close to the value (2.10 eV) determined by Mott-Schottky analysis. Taking the above results and analysis into consideration, a possible charge transfer and separation process, and enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites were proposed as displayed in Fig. 9.Under visible-light illumination, BiVO 4 is excited to produce potogenerated electrons and holes.Due to the formed surface OVs, most of photoinduced electrons would be captured by OVs states 57.Because the Fermi level of metallic Bi is lower than the OVs states and CB of BiVO 4 , the photoinduced electrons would transfer from BiVO 4 to metallic Bi.Therefore, the surface OVs and Bi nanoparticles would boost the separation and migration efficiencies of photogenerated charge carriers in the surface of BiVO 4 , and hence improve the photocatalytic performance.Besides, metallic Bi nanoparticles also can be excited to generate electron-hole pairs.After loading of metal Ag on The hot electrons would occupy the empty states in the CB of Ag and energetically transfer to the CB of BiVO 4 , with the hot holes left on Ag 58.Subsequently, BiVO 4 would rapidly transport the hot electrons to the Bi nanoparticles due to the low resistance of photoexcited BiVO 4 .As a result, the electron density on the surface of metallic Bi is significantly increased, which would facilitate the photoreduction of CO 2 .In general, the enhancement of photocatalytic performance of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 is mainly attributed to the improved light absorption owing to the SPR effect of Ag and the enhanced charge-separation efficiency caused by surface OVs and metal Bi."}, {"llm generation": "Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 photocatalysts", "source": "The recycling stability of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 photocatalysts was also studied, as shown in Fig. 8b.", "context": "The crystal structures of as-synthesized products were analyzed through XRD characterization.Fig. 1a displays the XRD pattern of BBV sample.The narrow and sharp diffraction peaks located at 2 27.20, 38.01, 39.63, 44.37, 45.82, 48.52, 55.88, 62.29, 64.48, and 70.61can be indexed to the reflection of ( 012), ( 104), ( 110), ( 015), ( 024), ( 116), (122), and (214) planes of Bi phase (JCPDS No. 44-1246), respectively. In addition, a broad peak in the range of 25 35was observed in the XRD pattern, which can be attributed to the amorphous BiVO 4 (a-BiVO 4 ) phase 23,34.Fig. 1b-d show the XRD patterns of Bi/BiVO 4 composites after reaction with different amount of AgNO 3 .Obviously, the intensity of the (012) diffraction peak decreases gradually with increasing the amount of AgNO 3 , suggesting more metallic Bi was oxidized by Ag ions.Careful comparison reveals that the position of (012) diffraction peak maintains unchanged, suggesting no Bi-Ag alloy was formed.It is also found that, after hydrothermal treatment in AgNO 3 aqueous solution, a weak peak at 2 28.71emerges,which can be assigned to the reflection of (121) plane of monoclinic BiVO 4 phase (JCPDS No. 14-0688), indicating the a-BiVO 4 was transformed to crystalline BiVO 4 (c-BiVO 4 ) under the hydrothermal condition.The diffraction peaks located at 2 38.01,44.37, 64.48, and 77.44also can be assigned to (111), (200), (220), and (311) reflections of Ag phase (JCPDS No. 65-2871) 35, respectively.Moreover, the intensities of these diffraction peaks increase with the increase in the amount of AgNO 3 , suggesting that Ag content in the products can be easily controlled by tuning the AgNO 3 concentration.Metallic Ag was derived from the oxidation-reduction reaction between metal Bi and AgNO 3 .Because the standard electrode potential of the Ag /Ag pair (0.7996 V) is higher than that of Bi 3 /Bi (0.308 V), Ag can be reduced by metal Bi to form Ag 35,36.The reaction may be formulated as: The SEM characterization was utilized to investigate their morphology, crystal structure, and particle size of the Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 samples.Typical SEM images of these samples were displayed in Fig. 2. The SEM image in Fig. 2a shows that the BBV sample is composed of chain-like microstructures assembled by microspheres with smooth surface.The diameter of these microspheres is in the range of 300 600 nm.The broken sites in some microspheres suggest that the chain-like microstructures possess a hollow interior structure.The EDX analysis (Fig. S4a) reveals that BBV sample contains O, V, and Bi elements, and the content of metal Bi in BBV is about 39.4 wt.Fig. 2b-d shows the SEM images of BBV after reaction with different amount of AgNO 3 .Generally, these samples still take on chain-like morphology though they were hydrothermally treated in AgNO 3 aqueous solution.Nevertheless, some flake-like nanoparticles were decorated on the surface of the chain-like microstructures, leading to a rougher surface in comparison with that of BBV sample.The amount and size of these nanoflakes increase gradually with increasing the AgNO 3 concentration in the reaction solution.The EDX spectrum in Fig. S4b displays the existence of O, V, Bi, and Ag elements in ABBV-2 sample.The contents of metallic Ag and Bi in different Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 samples were further analyzed using ICP-MS, as shown in Table 1.It can be found that the amount of Ag in the composites can be tuned by adjusting the AgNO 3 concentration in the reaction solution, which is in well accordance with the XRD results. To investigate the detailed microstructure of the Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, TEM and HRTEM characterizations were utilized.Fig. 3a shows a typical TEM image of BBV sample.Similar to the results from the SEM characterization, the chain-like microstructures in BBV have smooth surface.The center of the chain-like microstructures is brighter than their periphery, demonstrating the hollow interior structure of these microstructures once again.Fig. 3b displays a typical HRTEM image obtained from the chain-like microstructures, indicating the co-existence of both crystal nanoparticles and amorphous phases.The lattice intervals of 0.330 and 0.238 nm are in consistence with the (012) and (104) crystalline plane of metallic Bi 23,24.The amorphous phase can be assigned to the BiVO 4 , consistent with the XRD results.The TEM images of ABBV-2 shown in Figs.3c and S5a reveal that a large number of nanoflakes were grown on the surface of microspheres, giving rise to a relatively rougher surface compared to that of BBV sample.The typical HRTEM image of the nanoflakes was presented in Fig. 3d.The lattice distance of 0.236 nm corresponds to the (111) crystalline plane of Ag, indicating the formation of metallic Ag nanoflakes 35.The HRTEM image in Fig. S5b XPS characterization of the BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples was performed to identify the elemental compositions and their oxidation states.The curve (I) in Fig. 4a presents the high resolution Bi 4f XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The strong peaks located at 159.4 and 164.6 eV are attributed to Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 of Bi 3 , respectively, while the weak signals at 157.8 and 163.0 eV can be assigned to the metallic Biin ABBV-2.37 Fig. 4b displays the Ag 3d regional XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The two peaks centered at 374.1 and 368.0 eV can be ascribed to the metallic Ag in ABBV-2 38.The curve (I) in Fig. 4c displays the V 2p XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The peaks located at 516.6 and 524.2 eV belong to the V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 binding energies of V 5 in BiVO 4 39, respectively.The O 1s XPS spectrum of ABBV-2 (Fig. 4d) shows three strong peaks centered at 528.9, 531.5 and 532.9 eV, which Scheme 1. Schematic procedure for the construction of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 chain-like hollow microstructures.correspond to the crystal lattice oxygen (O latt ), dangling bonds (B dan ), and adsorbed oxygen (O ads ) species 12, respectively.The dangling bonds and adsorbed oxygen species in the XPS spectrum usually mean the formation of OVs in the material surface, and a larger number of dangling bonds and adsorbed oxygen species imply a higher OVs concentration 40.The relative intensity ratio (R int ) of O latt /(B dan O ads ) can roughly reflect the relative OVs concentration 41.According to the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4d), the R int values of BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 were estimated to be 3.20, 1.28, 1.35, and 1.40, respectively, indicating that the OVs concentrations of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 are The Ag content, E g value, S BET , and CO evolution rate of different samples.much higher than that of BV-1.In addition, it is also found that the Bi 4f, V 2p and O 1s peaks of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 are slightly shifted to higher binding energies compared to those of BV-1, which may be ascribed to the higher OVs concentrations in these samples 42. To identify the existence of surface OVs in BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples, the EPR spectra of these samples were carried out, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Obviously, nearly no EPR signals were observed for BV-1.On the contrary, the EPR spectra of BV-2 and BBV samples display strong signals at g 1.966, which may originate from the surface OVs 32,43.As the Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of Bi/BiVO 4 , the intensity of EPR signal decreased slightly, implying the decreased OVs concentration in the composites, which may be mainly caused by the oxidation of partial OVs by the oxygen in the reaction solution under the hydrothermal condition 44. UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra ranging from 200 700 nm were employed to probe the light absorption properties of and band-gap energies (E g ) of the pure BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, as displayed in Fig. 6a.The absorption edge of BV-2 sample is determined to be around 450 nm, suggesting that the BV-2 has a weak absorption property for visible-light.Moreover, an weak absorption tail in the range of 450 700 nm was observed, which may be induced by the surface OVs in BV-2 44.For Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, they have similar absorption edges (465, 469, 470, and 473 nm for BBV, ABBV-1, ABBV-2, and ABBV-3 sample, respectively) though the metallic Bi or Ag contents in these samples are different.However, their absorption intensities in the range of 450 700 nm are quite different.The BBV sample shows a remarkebly enhanced light absorption in the range of 450 700 nm compared to BV-2 sample.The enhancement in light absorption could be caused by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of metallic Bi nanoparticles 23,24.For Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, their absorption intensities in the visiblelight region increased along with increasing the Ag content, which can be ascribed to the SPR effect of Ag nanoflakes 20.It is expected that the enhanced visible-light absorption would lead to a boosted photocatalytic performance of the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites.The E g values of the BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 , and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 were determined by using the equation: E g 1240/ g 45, and presented in Table 1.It is clear that the metallic Bi and Ag nanoparticles have little influence in the E g of BiVO 4 .Fig. 6b displays the PL emission spectra of BV-2, BBV and ABBV-2 samples.Obviously, the PL intensity of ABBV-2 decreases significantly compared to both BV-2 and BBV, which is attributed to the higher delocalization of photoexcited charge pairs giving rise to a lower recombination rate 46. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed to identify the 47.Fig. 7B illustrates the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites.It can be seen that the arc radius in EIS Nynquist plots of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites are much smaller than that of Bi/BiVO 4 .The radius of the circular arc increase in the following order: ABBV-2 ABBV-3 ABBV-1 BBV, which is in agreement with the variation trend of photocurrent density.It has been well demonstrated that the smaller radius of the circular arc represents the higher charge-separation efficiency 48.Therefore, the ABBV-2 possess a faster interfacial charge migration and retarded recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in comparison with other samples.The primary cause for this phenomenon is that the proper amount of Ag nanoparticles can accelerate charge-transfer and electron collection, while excessive Ag nanoparticles would facilitate the recombination of photoexited charge pairs, leading to a higher interfacial charge transfer resistance.The consistent variation trend of photocurrent and EIS strongly confirms that the loading a proper amount of metal Ag can effectively restrain the recombination of photoinduced charge pairs. The photocatalytic performances of pure BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 , and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 were evaluated through the CO 2 photocatalytic conversion under the visible-light irradiation.Analytical detection of the gassous products revealed that CO was detected as the only carbonaceous gas products during the process of CO 2 photoreduction.For comparison, control experiments were carried out only in the presence of illumination, catalysts, CO 2 , or H 2 O, in which no CO products were detectable.In contrast, in the presence of illumination, catalysts, CO 2 , and H 2 O, detectable CO was obtained, confirming that the CO gas really originated from the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.The CO production rate of these samples after 4 h' light irradiation was displayed in Fig. 8a.As can be seen, in the presence of BV-1 and BV-2 samples, only a trace or small amount of CO was obtained, indicating that the pure BiVO 4 nearly exhibits no or very weak photocatalytic activity toward CO reduction.However, a relatively high evolution rate ( 1.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) can be obtained in the presence of BBV sample.The dual contribution of metal Bi nanoparticles and surface OVs may give rise to the enhanced photocatalytic performance of BBV sample 49.It is worth noting that the metal Bi content can affect the photocatalytic activity of BBV catalyst and the optimal content of metal Bi in BBV is 39.4 wt , as show in table S1.Consequently, the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composite photocatalysts were constructed using the BBV sample with 39.4 wt metal Bi as template.After being loaded with Ag nanoparticles, the CO production rate is further increased greatly, indicating that metallic Ag can boost the photocatalytic performance of Bi/BiVO 4 composites.Moreover, the CO evolution rate largely depends on the metal Ag content.The CO-yielding rate of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites initially increases with enhancing Ag loading and then decreases gradually.The variation trend of the CO evolution rate is in agreement with that of photocurrent and EIS of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 .With increasing the amount of Ag nanoparticles till reaching an optimal amount, the separation efficiency of photoexcited charge pairs was enhanced gradually, resulting in a gradually improved photocatalytic activity of Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 .However, excessive metal Ag would boost the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, giving rise to an impaired enhancement of photocatalytic activity.ABBV-2 sample displays the highest CO evolution rate ( 5.19 mol g -1 h -1 ), which is much higher than that of BBV.The present CO production rate is better than that of Ag/ Na 2 Ti 6 O 13 catalysts applied in CO 2 photoreduction toward CO 50.The recycling stability of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 photocatalysts was also studied, as shown in Fig. 8b.Obviously, the photocatalytic activity of these photocatalysts only decreases slightly after five continuous cycles under the identical conditions.The XRD pattern and SEM image (as shown in Fig. S6) of the ABBV-2 sample after successive photocatalytic reactions demonstrate that the crystal phase and shape of ABBV-2 is still preserved after the photocatalytic reactions.The TEM and HRTEM images of ABBV-2 after photocatalytic reaction are given in Fig. S7.No lattice fringes corresponding to the planes of Ag 2 O and Bi 2 O 3 were observed in the HREM image, suggesting that the metal Ag and Bi are not oxidized during photocatalytic reaction.Moreover, the distribution and morphology of Ag nanoflakes and metal Bi nanoparticles in ABBV-2 after photocatalytic reaction nearly maintain unchanged.The stability of surface OVs in ABBV-2 was also examined, as shown in Fig. S8.Apparently, ABBV-2 sample after photocatalytic reaction still displays a strong EPR signal at g 1.966, indicating that the surface OVs in ABBV-2 are stable at room temperature.All of above results confirm the high stability of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 photocatalysts, which accounts for why Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 has the sustained photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion after five continuous cycles. To explore the charge-transfer mechanism of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 composites, the band-edge positions of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples were predicted based on their flat-band potentials (E fb ) and E g values.By the means of Mott-Schottky analysis (Fig. 8c), the E fb values for BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 were determined to be -0.648,-0.601, and -0.596 V vs. SCE at pH 7, respectively.The E fb can be further converted into normal hydrogen electrode potential (NHE) according to the formula: E NHE E SCE E SCE 0.059 pH 51, where E SCE is the potential of SCE, E SCE is 0.2415 V, and pH is about 7.0.The CB of VB-2 sample is determined to be -0.477V. Usually, the CB should be more negative by 0.2 V than the E fb 52, and thus the CB of VB-2 should be about -0.677 V, which is much higher than the previously reported CB edge position of BiVO 4 53.The elevated CB potential of BV-2 may be caused by the surface OVs 54,55.Similarly, the CB values of BBV and ABBV-2 samples are calculated to be -0.630, and -0.625 V, respectively, indicating that metallic Bi and Ag nanoparticles can slightly alter the CB of BV-2.Combining the E g of BV-2 (2.76 eV), the valance band (VB) of BV-2 can be determined by the equation: E CB E VB -E g , where E CB and E VB are the CB potential and VB potential, respectively.Thus, the VB value of BV-2 is calculated to be 2.10 eV.To further confirm this band structure, the XPS VB spectrum of BV-2 was also carried out, as illustrated in Fig. 8d.According to the linear intersection method 56, E VB of BV-2 is estimated to be 2.17 eV, which is very close to the value (2.10 eV) determined by Mott-Schottky analysis. Taking the above results and analysis into consideration, a possible charge transfer and separation process, and enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites were proposed as displayed in Fig. 9.Under visible-light illumination, BiVO 4 is excited to produce potogenerated electrons and holes.Due to the formed surface OVs, most of photoinduced electrons would be captured by OVs states 57.Because the Fermi level of metallic Bi is lower than the OVs states and CB of BiVO 4 , the photoinduced electrons would transfer from BiVO 4 to metallic Bi.Therefore, the surface OVs and Bi nanoparticles would boost the separation and migration efficiencies of photogenerated charge carriers in the surface of BiVO 4 , and hence improve the photocatalytic performance.Besides, metallic Bi nanoparticles also can be excited to generate electron-hole pairs.After loading of metal Ag on The hot electrons would occupy the empty states in the CB of Ag and energetically transfer to the CB of BiVO 4 , with the hot holes left on Ag 58.Subsequently, BiVO 4 would rapidly transport the hot electrons to the Bi nanoparticles due to the low resistance of photoexcited BiVO 4 .As a result, the electron density on the surface of metallic Bi is significantly increased, which would facilitate the photoreduction of CO 2 .In general, the enhancement of photocatalytic performance of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 is mainly attributed to the improved light absorption owing to the SPR effect of Ag and the enhanced charge-separation efficiency caused by surface OVs and metal Bi."}, {"llm generation": "Ag-Bi/BiVO 4", "source": "In general, the enhancement of photocatalytic performance of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 is mainly attributed to the improved light absorption owing to the SPR effect of Ag and the enhanced charge-separation efficiency caused by surface OVs and metal Bi.", "context": "The crystal structures of as-synthesized products were analyzed through XRD characterization.Fig. 1a displays the XRD pattern of BBV sample.The narrow and sharp diffraction peaks located at 2 27.20, 38.01, 39.63, 44.37, 45.82, 48.52, 55.88, 62.29, 64.48, and 70.61can be indexed to the reflection of ( 012), ( 104), ( 110), ( 015), ( 024), ( 116), (122), and (214) planes of Bi phase (JCPDS No. 44-1246), respectively. In addition, a broad peak in the range of 25 35was observed in the XRD pattern, which can be attributed to the amorphous BiVO 4 (a-BiVO 4 ) phase 23,34.Fig. 1b-d show the XRD patterns of Bi/BiVO 4 composites after reaction with different amount of AgNO 3 .Obviously, the intensity of the (012) diffraction peak decreases gradually with increasing the amount of AgNO 3 , suggesting more metallic Bi was oxidized by Ag ions.Careful comparison reveals that the position of (012) diffraction peak maintains unchanged, suggesting no Bi-Ag alloy was formed.It is also found that, after hydrothermal treatment in AgNO 3 aqueous solution, a weak peak at 2 28.71emerges,which can be assigned to the reflection of (121) plane of monoclinic BiVO 4 phase (JCPDS No. 14-0688), indicating the a-BiVO 4 was transformed to crystalline BiVO 4 (c-BiVO 4 ) under the hydrothermal condition.The diffraction peaks located at 2 38.01,44.37, 64.48, and 77.44also can be assigned to (111), (200), (220), and (311) reflections of Ag phase (JCPDS No. 65-2871) 35, respectively.Moreover, the intensities of these diffraction peaks increase with the increase in the amount of AgNO 3 , suggesting that Ag content in the products can be easily controlled by tuning the AgNO 3 concentration.Metallic Ag was derived from the oxidation-reduction reaction between metal Bi and AgNO 3 .Because the standard electrode potential of the Ag /Ag pair (0.7996 V) is higher than that of Bi 3 /Bi (0.308 V), Ag can be reduced by metal Bi to form Ag 35,36.The reaction may be formulated as: The SEM characterization was utilized to investigate their morphology, crystal structure, and particle size of the Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 samples.Typical SEM images of these samples were displayed in Fig. 2. The SEM image in Fig. 2a shows that the BBV sample is composed of chain-like microstructures assembled by microspheres with smooth surface.The diameter of these microspheres is in the range of 300 600 nm.The broken sites in some microspheres suggest that the chain-like microstructures possess a hollow interior structure.The EDX analysis (Fig. S4a) reveals that BBV sample contains O, V, and Bi elements, and the content of metal Bi in BBV is about 39.4 wt.Fig. 2b-d shows the SEM images of BBV after reaction with different amount of AgNO 3 .Generally, these samples still take on chain-like morphology though they were hydrothermally treated in AgNO 3 aqueous solution.Nevertheless, some flake-like nanoparticles were decorated on the surface of the chain-like microstructures, leading to a rougher surface in comparison with that of BBV sample.The amount and size of these nanoflakes increase gradually with increasing the AgNO 3 concentration in the reaction solution.The EDX spectrum in Fig. S4b displays the existence of O, V, Bi, and Ag elements in ABBV-2 sample.The contents of metallic Ag and Bi in different Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 samples were further analyzed using ICP-MS, as shown in Table 1.It can be found that the amount of Ag in the composites can be tuned by adjusting the AgNO 3 concentration in the reaction solution, which is in well accordance with the XRD results. To investigate the detailed microstructure of the Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, TEM and HRTEM characterizations were utilized.Fig. 3a shows a typical TEM image of BBV sample.Similar to the results from the SEM characterization, the chain-like microstructures in BBV have smooth surface.The center of the chain-like microstructures is brighter than their periphery, demonstrating the hollow interior structure of these microstructures once again.Fig. 3b displays a typical HRTEM image obtained from the chain-like microstructures, indicating the co-existence of both crystal nanoparticles and amorphous phases.The lattice intervals of 0.330 and 0.238 nm are in consistence with the (012) and (104) crystalline plane of metallic Bi 23,24.The amorphous phase can be assigned to the BiVO 4 , consistent with the XRD results.The TEM images of ABBV-2 shown in Figs.3c and S5a reveal that a large number of nanoflakes were grown on the surface of microspheres, giving rise to a relatively rougher surface compared to that of BBV sample.The typical HRTEM image of the nanoflakes was presented in Fig. 3d.The lattice distance of 0.236 nm corresponds to the (111) crystalline plane of Ag, indicating the formation of metallic Ag nanoflakes 35.The HRTEM image in Fig. S5b XPS characterization of the BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples was performed to identify the elemental compositions and their oxidation states.The curve (I) in Fig. 4a presents the high resolution Bi 4f XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The strong peaks located at 159.4 and 164.6 eV are attributed to Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 of Bi 3 , respectively, while the weak signals at 157.8 and 163.0 eV can be assigned to the metallic Biin ABBV-2.37 Fig. 4b displays the Ag 3d regional XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The two peaks centered at 374.1 and 368.0 eV can be ascribed to the metallic Ag in ABBV-2 38.The curve (I) in Fig. 4c displays the V 2p XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The peaks located at 516.6 and 524.2 eV belong to the V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 binding energies of V 5 in BiVO 4 39, respectively.The O 1s XPS spectrum of ABBV-2 (Fig. 4d) shows three strong peaks centered at 528.9, 531.5 and 532.9 eV, which Scheme 1. Schematic procedure for the construction of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 chain-like hollow microstructures.correspond to the crystal lattice oxygen (O latt ), dangling bonds (B dan ), and adsorbed oxygen (O ads ) species 12, respectively.The dangling bonds and adsorbed oxygen species in the XPS spectrum usually mean the formation of OVs in the material surface, and a larger number of dangling bonds and adsorbed oxygen species imply a higher OVs concentration 40.The relative intensity ratio (R int ) of O latt /(B dan O ads ) can roughly reflect the relative OVs concentration 41.According to the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4d), the R int values of BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 were estimated to be 3.20, 1.28, 1.35, and 1.40, respectively, indicating that the OVs concentrations of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 are The Ag content, E g value, S BET , and CO evolution rate of different samples.much higher than that of BV-1.In addition, it is also found that the Bi 4f, V 2p and O 1s peaks of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 are slightly shifted to higher binding energies compared to those of BV-1, which may be ascribed to the higher OVs concentrations in these samples 42. To identify the existence of surface OVs in BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples, the EPR spectra of these samples were carried out, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Obviously, nearly no EPR signals were observed for BV-1.On the contrary, the EPR spectra of BV-2 and BBV samples display strong signals at g 1.966, which may originate from the surface OVs 32,43.As the Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of Bi/BiVO 4 , the intensity of EPR signal decreased slightly, implying the decreased OVs concentration in the composites, which may be mainly caused by the oxidation of partial OVs by the oxygen in the reaction solution under the hydrothermal condition 44. UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra ranging from 200 700 nm were employed to probe the light absorption properties of and band-gap energies (E g ) of the pure BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, as displayed in Fig. 6a.The absorption edge of BV-2 sample is determined to be around 450 nm, suggesting that the BV-2 has a weak absorption property for visible-light.Moreover, an weak absorption tail in the range of 450 700 nm was observed, which may be induced by the surface OVs in BV-2 44.For Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, they have similar absorption edges (465, 469, 470, and 473 nm for BBV, ABBV-1, ABBV-2, and ABBV-3 sample, respectively) though the metallic Bi or Ag contents in these samples are different.However, their absorption intensities in the range of 450 700 nm are quite different.The BBV sample shows a remarkebly enhanced light absorption in the range of 450 700 nm compared to BV-2 sample.The enhancement in light absorption could be caused by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of metallic Bi nanoparticles 23,24.For Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, their absorption intensities in the visiblelight region increased along with increasing the Ag content, which can be ascribed to the SPR effect of Ag nanoflakes 20.It is expected that the enhanced visible-light absorption would lead to a boosted photocatalytic performance of the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites.The E g values of the BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 , and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 were determined by using the equation: E g 1240/ g 45, and presented in Table 1.It is clear that the metallic Bi and Ag nanoparticles have little influence in the E g of BiVO 4 .Fig. 6b displays the PL emission spectra of BV-2, BBV and ABBV-2 samples.Obviously, the PL intensity of ABBV-2 decreases significantly compared to both BV-2 and BBV, which is attributed to the higher delocalization of photoexcited charge pairs giving rise to a lower recombination rate 46. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed to identify the 47.Fig. 7B illustrates the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites.It can be seen that the arc radius in EIS Nynquist plots of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites are much smaller than that of Bi/BiVO 4 .The radius of the circular arc increase in the following order: ABBV-2 ABBV-3 ABBV-1 BBV, which is in agreement with the variation trend of photocurrent density.It has been well demonstrated that the smaller radius of the circular arc represents the higher charge-separation efficiency 48.Therefore, the ABBV-2 possess a faster interfacial charge migration and retarded recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in comparison with other samples.The primary cause for this phenomenon is that the proper amount of Ag nanoparticles can accelerate charge-transfer and electron collection, while excessive Ag nanoparticles would facilitate the recombination of photoexited charge pairs, leading to a higher interfacial charge transfer resistance.The consistent variation trend of photocurrent and EIS strongly confirms that the loading a proper amount of metal Ag can effectively restrain the recombination of photoinduced charge pairs. The photocatalytic performances of pure BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 , and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 were evaluated through the CO 2 photocatalytic conversion under the visible-light irradiation.Analytical detection of the gassous products revealed that CO was detected as the only carbonaceous gas products during the process of CO 2 photoreduction.For comparison, control experiments were carried out only in the presence of illumination, catalysts, CO 2 , or H 2 O, in which no CO products were detectable.In contrast, in the presence of illumination, catalysts, CO 2 , and H 2 O, detectable CO was obtained, confirming that the CO gas really originated from the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.The CO production rate of these samples after 4 h' light irradiation was displayed in Fig. 8a.As can be seen, in the presence of BV-1 and BV-2 samples, only a trace or small amount of CO was obtained, indicating that the pure BiVO 4 nearly exhibits no or very weak photocatalytic activity toward CO reduction.However, a relatively high evolution rate ( 1.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) can be obtained in the presence of BBV sample.The dual contribution of metal Bi nanoparticles and surface OVs may give rise to the enhanced photocatalytic performance of BBV sample 49.It is worth noting that the metal Bi content can affect the photocatalytic activity of BBV catalyst and the optimal content of metal Bi in BBV is 39.4 wt , as show in table S1.Consequently, the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composite photocatalysts were constructed using the BBV sample with 39.4 wt metal Bi as template.After being loaded with Ag nanoparticles, the CO production rate is further increased greatly, indicating that metallic Ag can boost the photocatalytic performance of Bi/BiVO 4 composites.Moreover, the CO evolution rate largely depends on the metal Ag content.The CO-yielding rate of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites initially increases with enhancing Ag loading and then decreases gradually.The variation trend of the CO evolution rate is in agreement with that of photocurrent and EIS of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 .With increasing the amount of Ag nanoparticles till reaching an optimal amount, the separation efficiency of photoexcited charge pairs was enhanced gradually, resulting in a gradually improved photocatalytic activity of Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 .However, excessive metal Ag would boost the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, giving rise to an impaired enhancement of photocatalytic activity.ABBV-2 sample displays the highest CO evolution rate ( 5.19 mol g -1 h -1 ), which is much higher than that of BBV.The present CO production rate is better than that of Ag/ Na 2 Ti 6 O 13 catalysts applied in CO 2 photoreduction toward CO 50.The recycling stability of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 photocatalysts was also studied, as shown in Fig. 8b.Obviously, the photocatalytic activity of these photocatalysts only decreases slightly after five continuous cycles under the identical conditions.The XRD pattern and SEM image (as shown in Fig. S6) of the ABBV-2 sample after successive photocatalytic reactions demonstrate that the crystal phase and shape of ABBV-2 is still preserved after the photocatalytic reactions.The TEM and HRTEM images of ABBV-2 after photocatalytic reaction are given in Fig. S7.No lattice fringes corresponding to the planes of Ag 2 O and Bi 2 O 3 were observed in the HREM image, suggesting that the metal Ag and Bi are not oxidized during photocatalytic reaction.Moreover, the distribution and morphology of Ag nanoflakes and metal Bi nanoparticles in ABBV-2 after photocatalytic reaction nearly maintain unchanged.The stability of surface OVs in ABBV-2 was also examined, as shown in Fig. S8.Apparently, ABBV-2 sample after photocatalytic reaction still displays a strong EPR signal at g 1.966, indicating that the surface OVs in ABBV-2 are stable at room temperature.All of above results confirm the high stability of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 photocatalysts, which accounts for why Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 has the sustained photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion after five continuous cycles. To explore the charge-transfer mechanism of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 composites, the band-edge positions of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples were predicted based on their flat-band potentials (E fb ) and E g values.By the means of Mott-Schottky analysis (Fig. 8c), the E fb values for BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 were determined to be -0.648,-0.601, and -0.596 V vs. SCE at pH 7, respectively.The E fb can be further converted into normal hydrogen electrode potential (NHE) according to the formula: E NHE E SCE E SCE 0.059 pH 51, where E SCE is the potential of SCE, E SCE is 0.2415 V, and pH is about 7.0.The CB of VB-2 sample is determined to be -0.477V. Usually, the CB should be more negative by 0.2 V than the E fb 52, and thus the CB of VB-2 should be about -0.677 V, which is much higher than the previously reported CB edge position of BiVO 4 53.The elevated CB potential of BV-2 may be caused by the surface OVs 54,55.Similarly, the CB values of BBV and ABBV-2 samples are calculated to be -0.630, and -0.625 V, respectively, indicating that metallic Bi and Ag nanoparticles can slightly alter the CB of BV-2.Combining the E g of BV-2 (2.76 eV), the valance band (VB) of BV-2 can be determined by the equation: E CB E VB -E g , where E CB and E VB are the CB potential and VB potential, respectively.Thus, the VB value of BV-2 is calculated to be 2.10 eV.To further confirm this band structure, the XPS VB spectrum of BV-2 was also carried out, as illustrated in Fig. 8d.According to the linear intersection method 56, E VB of BV-2 is estimated to be 2.17 eV, which is very close to the value (2.10 eV) determined by Mott-Schottky analysis. Taking the above results and analysis into consideration, a possible charge transfer and separation process, and enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites were proposed as displayed in Fig. 9.Under visible-light illumination, BiVO 4 is excited to produce potogenerated electrons and holes.Due to the formed surface OVs, most of photoinduced electrons would be captured by OVs states 57.Because the Fermi level of metallic Bi is lower than the OVs states and CB of BiVO 4 , the photoinduced electrons would transfer from BiVO 4 to metallic Bi.Therefore, the surface OVs and Bi nanoparticles would boost the separation and migration efficiencies of photogenerated charge carriers in the surface of BiVO 4 , and hence improve the photocatalytic performance.Besides, metallic Bi nanoparticles also can be excited to generate electron-hole pairs.After loading of metal Ag on The hot electrons would occupy the empty states in the CB of Ag and energetically transfer to the CB of BiVO 4 , with the hot holes left on Ag 58.Subsequently, BiVO 4 would rapidly transport the hot electrons to the Bi nanoparticles due to the low resistance of photoexcited BiVO 4 .As a result, the electron density on the surface of metallic Bi is significantly increased, which would facilitate the photoreduction of CO 2 .In general, the enhancement of photocatalytic performance of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 is mainly attributed to the improved light absorption owing to the SPR effect of Ag and the enhanced charge-separation efficiency caused by surface OVs and metal Bi."}, {"llm generation": "Ag-Bi/BiVO 4, BiVO 4, Bi/BiVO 4", "source": "As-fabricated Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites display a higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion compared to the pristine BiVO 4 and Bi/BiVO 4 composites.", "context": "Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 chain-like microstructures were constructed via a mild solvothermal process and galvanic replacement reaction.It was demonstrated that the content of metallic Ag in the composites can be easily adjusted by varying the amount of AgNO 3 in the reaction solution.As-fabricated Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites display a higher photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion compared to the pristine BiVO 4 and Bi/BiVO 4 composites.The following several aspects may account for the enhancement in photocatalytic performance: (1) the solvothermal process enable BiVO 4 to possess a more negative CB potential for strong reducing ability; (2) the surface OVs serve as trapping centers to promote the separation of the photoexcited charge pairs in BiVO 4 ; (3) Ag nanoparticles can extend the light response range and produce oscillating hot electrons to enhance the electron density; (4) Bi nanoparticles can trap the transferred electrons and boost the charge separation and transfer.This work may provide a promising strategy to design plasmonic photocatalysts with superior photoreduction CO 2 efficiency. displays the (200) plane of BiVO 4 with a fringe of d 0.260 nm, further confirming the amorphous-to-crystalline transition of BiVO 4 .Fig. 3e-f shows the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image and the STEM-EDX chemical mapping images of ABBV-2, which depict the uniform distributions of O, V, Bi, and Ag elements in the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites.The S BET values of the Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 samples were measured and summarized in Table 1.It can be seen that the content of Ag in the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites has a little effect on their S BET values.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-synthesized products were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker/AXS D8 Advance) equipped with Cu K radiation ( 0.15406 nm).The morphology and microstructure of all products were analyzed with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips CM200), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Tecnai G2).The contents of metallic Ag and Bi in the composites were measured by using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).The detailed calculation of metal Bi content in the composites was presented in supporting information.X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) of Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 composites was recorded on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using Mg K irradiation (h 1253.6 eV) as an excitation source.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was conducted on a Bruker A300 spectrometer.Photoluminescence (PL) properties of BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 were examined with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu RF-5301).The ultraviolet (UV) -visible (vis) diffuse absorption spectroscopy was carried out using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) with BaSO 4 as a reflectance.The Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface area (S BET ) of the products was measured on an adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020).Photoelectrochemical tests were carried out on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation.F-doped SnO 2 (FTO) substrate (0.5 cm 3.0 cm) coated with sample powders, Pt wire, and saturated calomel electrode (SCE, Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 ) were employed as working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively.The aqueous Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.20 M, pH 6.8) was used as the electrolyte. The typical experiments of CO 2 photoreduction were conducted in home-made glass reactor (200 mL in volume) at 1 atm CO 2 partial pressure and normal temperature.A 300 W Xe-illuminator (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Pofiley technology Co., Ltd.) with a light cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was utilized as simulated sun-light source and the light intensity was about 123 mWcm -2 .The distance between the reactor and the illuminator is 10 cm.In each test, 10 mg of powders were uniformly dispersed on a quartz disk to obtain a smooth film.Then the quartz disk was fixed in the middle of the glass reactor.After that, the reactor was evacuated and purged with high purity CO 2 (99.99 ) for 30 min to obtain an anaerobic condition for the reaction system.Before light irradiation, 0.5 mL H 2 O deionized water was injected to the bottom of the reactor.During the reaction, 1.0 mL of gaseous product was taken out of the glass reactor using a gastight syringe at the predetermined time interval and examined by a Ruihong GC-SP7890 gas chromatography.In the process of the reaction, the temperature of the glass reactor was kept at 10 C by cooling the water circulation system."}, {"llm generation": "Light", "source": "The CO production rate of these samples after 4 h' light irradiation was displayed in Fig. 8a.", "context": "The crystal structures of as-synthesized products were analyzed through XRD characterization.Fig. 1a displays the XRD pattern of BBV sample.The narrow and sharp diffraction peaks located at 2 27.20, 38.01, 39.63, 44.37, 45.82, 48.52, 55.88, 62.29, 64.48, and 70.61can be indexed to the reflection of ( 012), ( 104), ( 110), ( 015), ( 024), ( 116), (122), and (214) planes of Bi phase (JCPDS No. 44-1246), respectively. In addition, a broad peak in the range of 25 35was observed in the XRD pattern, which can be attributed to the amorphous BiVO 4 (a-BiVO 4 ) phase 23,34.Fig. 1b-d show the XRD patterns of Bi/BiVO 4 composites after reaction with different amount of AgNO 3 .Obviously, the intensity of the (012) diffraction peak decreases gradually with increasing the amount of AgNO 3 , suggesting more metallic Bi was oxidized by Ag ions.Careful comparison reveals that the position of (012) diffraction peak maintains unchanged, suggesting no Bi-Ag alloy was formed.It is also found that, after hydrothermal treatment in AgNO 3 aqueous solution, a weak peak at 2 28.71emerges,which can be assigned to the reflection of (121) plane of monoclinic BiVO 4 phase (JCPDS No. 14-0688), indicating the a-BiVO 4 was transformed to crystalline BiVO 4 (c-BiVO 4 ) under the hydrothermal condition.The diffraction peaks located at 2 38.01,44.37, 64.48, and 77.44also can be assigned to (111), (200), (220), and (311) reflections of Ag phase (JCPDS No. 65-2871) 35, respectively.Moreover, the intensities of these diffraction peaks increase with the increase in the amount of AgNO 3 , suggesting that Ag content in the products can be easily controlled by tuning the AgNO 3 concentration.Metallic Ag was derived from the oxidation-reduction reaction between metal Bi and AgNO 3 .Because the standard electrode potential of the Ag /Ag pair (0.7996 V) is higher than that of Bi 3 /Bi (0.308 V), Ag can be reduced by metal Bi to form Ag 35,36.The reaction may be formulated as: The SEM characterization was utilized to investigate their morphology, crystal structure, and particle size of the Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 samples.Typical SEM images of these samples were displayed in Fig. 2. The SEM image in Fig. 2a shows that the BBV sample is composed of chain-like microstructures assembled by microspheres with smooth surface.The diameter of these microspheres is in the range of 300 600 nm.The broken sites in some microspheres suggest that the chain-like microstructures possess a hollow interior structure.The EDX analysis (Fig. S4a) reveals that BBV sample contains O, V, and Bi elements, and the content of metal Bi in BBV is about 39.4 wt.Fig. 2b-d shows the SEM images of BBV after reaction with different amount of AgNO 3 .Generally, these samples still take on chain-like morphology though they were hydrothermally treated in AgNO 3 aqueous solution.Nevertheless, some flake-like nanoparticles were decorated on the surface of the chain-like microstructures, leading to a rougher surface in comparison with that of BBV sample.The amount and size of these nanoflakes increase gradually with increasing the AgNO 3 concentration in the reaction solution.The EDX spectrum in Fig. S4b displays the existence of O, V, Bi, and Ag elements in ABBV-2 sample.The contents of metallic Ag and Bi in different Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 samples were further analyzed using ICP-MS, as shown in Table 1.It can be found that the amount of Ag in the composites can be tuned by adjusting the AgNO 3 concentration in the reaction solution, which is in well accordance with the XRD results. To investigate the detailed microstructure of the Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, TEM and HRTEM characterizations were utilized.Fig. 3a shows a typical TEM image of BBV sample.Similar to the results from the SEM characterization, the chain-like microstructures in BBV have smooth surface.The center of the chain-like microstructures is brighter than their periphery, demonstrating the hollow interior structure of these microstructures once again.Fig. 3b displays a typical HRTEM image obtained from the chain-like microstructures, indicating the co-existence of both crystal nanoparticles and amorphous phases.The lattice intervals of 0.330 and 0.238 nm are in consistence with the (012) and (104) crystalline plane of metallic Bi 23,24.The amorphous phase can be assigned to the BiVO 4 , consistent with the XRD results.The TEM images of ABBV-2 shown in Figs.3c and S5a reveal that a large number of nanoflakes were grown on the surface of microspheres, giving rise to a relatively rougher surface compared to that of BBV sample.The typical HRTEM image of the nanoflakes was presented in Fig. 3d.The lattice distance of 0.236 nm corresponds to the (111) crystalline plane of Ag, indicating the formation of metallic Ag nanoflakes 35.The HRTEM image in Fig. S5b XPS characterization of the BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples was performed to identify the elemental compositions and their oxidation states.The curve (I) in Fig. 4a presents the high resolution Bi 4f XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The strong peaks located at 159.4 and 164.6 eV are attributed to Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 of Bi 3 , respectively, while the weak signals at 157.8 and 163.0 eV can be assigned to the metallic Biin ABBV-2.37 Fig. 4b displays the Ag 3d regional XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The two peaks centered at 374.1 and 368.0 eV can be ascribed to the metallic Ag in ABBV-2 38.The curve (I) in Fig. 4c displays the V 2p XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The peaks located at 516.6 and 524.2 eV belong to the V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 binding energies of V 5 in BiVO 4 39, respectively.The O 1s XPS spectrum of ABBV-2 (Fig. 4d) shows three strong peaks centered at 528.9, 531.5 and 532.9 eV, which Scheme 1. Schematic procedure for the construction of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 chain-like hollow microstructures.correspond to the crystal lattice oxygen (O latt ), dangling bonds (B dan ), and adsorbed oxygen (O ads ) species 12, respectively.The dangling bonds and adsorbed oxygen species in the XPS spectrum usually mean the formation of OVs in the material surface, and a larger number of dangling bonds and adsorbed oxygen species imply a higher OVs concentration 40.The relative intensity ratio (R int ) of O latt /(B dan O ads ) can roughly reflect the relative OVs concentration 41.According to the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4d), the R int values of BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 were estimated to be 3.20, 1.28, 1.35, and 1.40, respectively, indicating that the OVs concentrations of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 are The Ag content, E g value, S BET , and CO evolution rate of different samples.much higher than that of BV-1.In addition, it is also found that the Bi 4f, V 2p and O 1s peaks of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 are slightly shifted to higher binding energies compared to those of BV-1, which may be ascribed to the higher OVs concentrations in these samples 42. To identify the existence of surface OVs in BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples, the EPR spectra of these samples were carried out, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Obviously, nearly no EPR signals were observed for BV-1.On the contrary, the EPR spectra of BV-2 and BBV samples display strong signals at g 1.966, which may originate from the surface OVs 32,43.As the Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of Bi/BiVO 4 , the intensity of EPR signal decreased slightly, implying the decreased OVs concentration in the composites, which may be mainly caused by the oxidation of partial OVs by the oxygen in the reaction solution under the hydrothermal condition 44. UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra ranging from 200 700 nm were employed to probe the light absorption properties of and band-gap energies (E g ) of the pure BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, as displayed in Fig. 6a.The absorption edge of BV-2 sample is determined to be around 450 nm, suggesting that the BV-2 has a weak absorption property for visible-light.Moreover, an weak absorption tail in the range of 450 700 nm was observed, which may be induced by the surface OVs in BV-2 44.For Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, they have similar absorption edges (465, 469, 470, and 473 nm for BBV, ABBV-1, ABBV-2, and ABBV-3 sample, respectively) though the metallic Bi or Ag contents in these samples are different.However, their absorption intensities in the range of 450 700 nm are quite different.The BBV sample shows a remarkebly enhanced light absorption in the range of 450 700 nm compared to BV-2 sample.The enhancement in light absorption could be caused by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of metallic Bi nanoparticles 23,24.For Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, their absorption intensities in the visiblelight region increased along with increasing the Ag content, which can be ascribed to the SPR effect of Ag nanoflakes 20.It is expected that the enhanced visible-light absorption would lead to a boosted photocatalytic performance of the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites.The E g values of the BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 , and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 were determined by using the equation: E g 1240/ g 45, and presented in Table 1.It is clear that the metallic Bi and Ag nanoparticles have little influence in the E g of BiVO 4 .Fig. 6b displays the PL emission spectra of BV-2, BBV and ABBV-2 samples.Obviously, the PL intensity of ABBV-2 decreases significantly compared to both BV-2 and BBV, which is attributed to the higher delocalization of photoexcited charge pairs giving rise to a lower recombination rate 46. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed to identify the 47.Fig. 7B illustrates the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites.It can be seen that the arc radius in EIS Nynquist plots of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites are much smaller than that of Bi/BiVO 4 .The radius of the circular arc increase in the following order: ABBV-2 ABBV-3 ABBV-1 BBV, which is in agreement with the variation trend of photocurrent density.It has been well demonstrated that the smaller radius of the circular arc represents the higher charge-separation efficiency 48.Therefore, the ABBV-2 possess a faster interfacial charge migration and retarded recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in comparison with other samples.The primary cause for this phenomenon is that the proper amount of Ag nanoparticles can accelerate charge-transfer and electron collection, while excessive Ag nanoparticles would facilitate the recombination of photoexited charge pairs, leading to a higher interfacial charge transfer resistance.The consistent variation trend of photocurrent and EIS strongly confirms that the loading a proper amount of metal Ag can effectively restrain the recombination of photoinduced charge pairs. The photocatalytic performances of pure BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 , and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 were evaluated through the CO 2 photocatalytic conversion under the visible-light irradiation.Analytical detection of the gassous products revealed that CO was detected as the only carbonaceous gas products during the process of CO 2 photoreduction.For comparison, control experiments were carried out only in the presence of illumination, catalysts, CO 2 , or H 2 O, in which no CO products were detectable.In contrast, in the presence of illumination, catalysts, CO 2 , and H 2 O, detectable CO was obtained, confirming that the CO gas really originated from the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.The CO production rate of these samples after 4 h' light irradiation was displayed in Fig. 8a.As can be seen, in the presence of BV-1 and BV-2 samples, only a trace or small amount of CO was obtained, indicating that the pure BiVO 4 nearly exhibits no or very weak photocatalytic activity toward CO reduction.However, a relatively high evolution rate ( 1.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) can be obtained in the presence of BBV sample.The dual contribution of metal Bi nanoparticles and surface OVs may give rise to the enhanced photocatalytic performance of BBV sample 49.It is worth noting that the metal Bi content can affect the photocatalytic activity of BBV catalyst and the optimal content of metal Bi in BBV is 39.4 wt , as show in table S1.Consequently, the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composite photocatalysts were constructed using the BBV sample with 39.4 wt metal Bi as template.After being loaded with Ag nanoparticles, the CO production rate is further increased greatly, indicating that metallic Ag can boost the photocatalytic performance of Bi/BiVO 4 composites.Moreover, the CO evolution rate largely depends on the metal Ag content.The CO-yielding rate of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites initially increases with enhancing Ag loading and then decreases gradually.The variation trend of the CO evolution rate is in agreement with that of photocurrent and EIS of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 .With increasing the amount of Ag nanoparticles till reaching an optimal amount, the separation efficiency of photoexcited charge pairs was enhanced gradually, resulting in a gradually improved photocatalytic activity of Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 .However, excessive metal Ag would boost the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, giving rise to an impaired enhancement of photocatalytic activity.ABBV-2 sample displays the highest CO evolution rate ( 5.19 mol g -1 h -1 ), which is much higher than that of BBV.The present CO production rate is better than that of Ag/ Na 2 Ti 6 O 13 catalysts applied in CO 2 photoreduction toward CO 50.The recycling stability of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 photocatalysts was also studied, as shown in Fig. 8b.Obviously, the photocatalytic activity of these photocatalysts only decreases slightly after five continuous cycles under the identical conditions.The XRD pattern and SEM image (as shown in Fig. S6) of the ABBV-2 sample after successive photocatalytic reactions demonstrate that the crystal phase and shape of ABBV-2 is still preserved after the photocatalytic reactions.The TEM and HRTEM images of ABBV-2 after photocatalytic reaction are given in Fig. S7.No lattice fringes corresponding to the planes of Ag 2 O and Bi 2 O 3 were observed in the HREM image, suggesting that the metal Ag and Bi are not oxidized during photocatalytic reaction.Moreover, the distribution and morphology of Ag nanoflakes and metal Bi nanoparticles in ABBV-2 after photocatalytic reaction nearly maintain unchanged.The stability of surface OVs in ABBV-2 was also examined, as shown in Fig. S8.Apparently, ABBV-2 sample after photocatalytic reaction still displays a strong EPR signal at g 1.966, indicating that the surface OVs in ABBV-2 are stable at room temperature.All of above results confirm the high stability of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 photocatalysts, which accounts for why Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 has the sustained photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion after five continuous cycles. To explore the charge-transfer mechanism of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 composites, the band-edge positions of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples were predicted based on their flat-band potentials (E fb ) and E g values.By the means of Mott-Schottky analysis (Fig. 8c), the E fb values for BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 were determined to be -0.648,-0.601, and -0.596 V vs. SCE at pH 7, respectively.The E fb can be further converted into normal hydrogen electrode potential (NHE) according to the formula: E NHE E SCE E SCE 0.059 pH 51, where E SCE is the potential of SCE, E SCE is 0.2415 V, and pH is about 7.0.The CB of VB-2 sample is determined to be -0.477V. Usually, the CB should be more negative by 0.2 V than the E fb 52, and thus the CB of VB-2 should be about -0.677 V, which is much higher than the previously reported CB edge position of BiVO 4 53.The elevated CB potential of BV-2 may be caused by the surface OVs 54,55.Similarly, the CB values of BBV and ABBV-2 samples are calculated to be -0.630, and -0.625 V, respectively, indicating that metallic Bi and Ag nanoparticles can slightly alter the CB of BV-2.Combining the E g of BV-2 (2.76 eV), the valance band (VB) of BV-2 can be determined by the equation: E CB E VB -E g , where E CB and E VB are the CB potential and VB potential, respectively.Thus, the VB value of BV-2 is calculated to be 2.10 eV.To further confirm this band structure, the XPS VB spectrum of BV-2 was also carried out, as illustrated in Fig. 8d.According to the linear intersection method 56, E VB of BV-2 is estimated to be 2.17 eV, which is very close to the value (2.10 eV) determined by Mott-Schottky analysis. Taking the above results and analysis into consideration, a possible charge transfer and separation process, and enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites were proposed as displayed in Fig. 9.Under visible-light illumination, BiVO 4 is excited to produce potogenerated electrons and holes.Due to the formed surface OVs, most of photoinduced electrons would be captured by OVs states 57.Because the Fermi level of metallic Bi is lower than the OVs states and CB of BiVO 4 , the photoinduced electrons would transfer from BiVO 4 to metallic Bi.Therefore, the surface OVs and Bi nanoparticles would boost the separation and migration efficiencies of photogenerated charge carriers in the surface of BiVO 4 , and hence improve the photocatalytic performance.Besides, metallic Bi nanoparticles also can be excited to generate electron-hole pairs.After loading of metal Ag on The hot electrons would occupy the empty states in the CB of Ag and energetically transfer to the CB of BiVO 4 , with the hot holes left on Ag 58.Subsequently, BiVO 4 would rapidly transport the hot electrons to the Bi nanoparticles due to the low resistance of photoexcited BiVO 4 .As a result, the electron density on the surface of metallic Bi is significantly increased, which would facilitate the photoreduction of CO 2 .In general, the enhancement of photocatalytic performance of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 is mainly attributed to the improved light absorption owing to the SPR effect of Ag and the enhanced charge-separation efficiency caused by surface OVs and metal Bi."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "A 300 W Xe-illuminator (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Pofiley technology Co., Ltd.) with a light cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was utilized as simulated sun-light source and the light intensity was about 123 mWcm -2 .", "context": "Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 hollow composite microstructures were constructed through a chemical approach comprising two steps.Firstly, hollow Bi/ BiVO 4 microstructures were prepared according to our previously reported method 23, in which ethylene glycol was used as solvent and reducing agent.As-obtained products were denoted as BBV.Secondly, a certain amount of BBV products were added into AgNO 3 aqueous solution and stirred at room temperature for 30 min.The molar ratios of AgNO 3 to metallic Bi (denoted as Ag/Bi) in three different reaction systems were 0.30, 0.60 and 0.90, respectively.The suspensions were then poured into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was kept at 120 C for 6 h to perform a galvanic replacement reaction between Bi and AgNO 3 .After reaction, the obtained products were collected via centrifugation, rinsed with ion-exchanged water, and then placed in a vacuum oven at 60 C for drying.Scheme 1 illustrates the synthesis process of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites.As-constructed Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 samples were denoted as ABBV-1, ABBV-2, and ABBV-3 when the molar ratios of Ag/Bi in the reaction system are 0.30, 0.60 and 0.90, respectively.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-synthesized products were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker/AXS D8 Advance) equipped with Cu K radiation ( 0.15406 nm).The morphology and microstructure of all products were analyzed with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips CM200), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Tecnai G2).The contents of metallic Ag and Bi in the composites were measured by using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).The detailed calculation of metal Bi content in the composites was presented in supporting information.X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) of Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 composites was recorded on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using Mg K irradiation (h 1253.6 eV) as an excitation source.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was conducted on a Bruker A300 spectrometer.Photoluminescence (PL) properties of BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 were examined with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu RF-5301).The ultraviolet (UV) -visible (vis) diffuse absorption spectroscopy was carried out using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) with BaSO 4 as a reflectance.The Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface area (S BET ) of the products was measured on an adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020).Photoelectrochemical tests were carried out on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation.F-doped SnO 2 (FTO) substrate (0.5 cm 3.0 cm) coated with sample powders, Pt wire, and saturated calomel electrode (SCE, Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 ) were employed as working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively.The aqueous Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.20 M, pH 6.8) was used as the electrolyte. The typical experiments of CO 2 photoreduction were conducted in home-made glass reactor (200 mL in volume) at 1 atm CO 2 partial pressure and normal temperature.A 300 W Xe-illuminator (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Pofiley technology Co., Ltd.) with a light cutoff filter ( 420 nm) was utilized as simulated sun-light source and the light intensity was about 123 mWcm -2 .The distance between the reactor and the illuminator is 10 cm.In each test, 10 mg of powders were uniformly dispersed on a quartz disk to obtain a smooth film.Then the quartz disk was fixed in the middle of the glass reactor.After that, the reactor was evacuated and purged with high purity CO 2 (99.99 ) for 30 min to obtain an anaerobic condition for the reaction system.Before light irradiation, 0.5 mL H 2 O deionized water was injected to the bottom of the reactor.During the reaction, 1.0 mL of gaseous product was taken out of the glass reactor using a gastight syringe at the predetermined time interval and examined by a Ruihong GC-SP7890 gas chromatography.In the process of the reaction, the temperature of the glass reactor was kept at 10 C by cooling the water circulation system."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "As the Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of Bi/BiVO 4 , the intensity of EPR signal decreased slightly, implying the decreased OVs concentration in the composites, which may be mainly caused by the oxidation of partial OVs by the oxygen in the reaction solution under the hydrothermal condition 44.", "context": "The crystal structures of as-synthesized products were analyzed through XRD characterization.Fig. 1a displays the XRD pattern of BBV sample.The narrow and sharp diffraction peaks located at 2 27.20, 38.01, 39.63, 44.37, 45.82, 48.52, 55.88, 62.29, 64.48, and 70.61can be indexed to the reflection of ( 012), ( 104), ( 110), ( 015), ( 024), ( 116), (122), and (214) planes of Bi phase (JCPDS No. 44-1246), respectively. In addition, a broad peak in the range of 25 35was observed in the XRD pattern, which can be attributed to the amorphous BiVO 4 (a-BiVO 4 ) phase 23,34.Fig. 1b-d show the XRD patterns of Bi/BiVO 4 composites after reaction with different amount of AgNO 3 .Obviously, the intensity of the (012) diffraction peak decreases gradually with increasing the amount of AgNO 3 , suggesting more metallic Bi was oxidized by Ag ions.Careful comparison reveals that the position of (012) diffraction peak maintains unchanged, suggesting no Bi-Ag alloy was formed.It is also found that, after hydrothermal treatment in AgNO 3 aqueous solution, a weak peak at 2 28.71emerges,which can be assigned to the reflection of (121) plane of monoclinic BiVO 4 phase (JCPDS No. 14-0688), indicating the a-BiVO 4 was transformed to crystalline BiVO 4 (c-BiVO 4 ) under the hydrothermal condition.The diffraction peaks located at 2 38.01,44.37, 64.48, and 77.44also can be assigned to (111), (200), (220), and (311) reflections of Ag phase (JCPDS No. 65-2871) 35, respectively.Moreover, the intensities of these diffraction peaks increase with the increase in the amount of AgNO 3 , suggesting that Ag content in the products can be easily controlled by tuning the AgNO 3 concentration.Metallic Ag was derived from the oxidation-reduction reaction between metal Bi and AgNO 3 .Because the standard electrode potential of the Ag /Ag pair (0.7996 V) is higher than that of Bi 3 /Bi (0.308 V), Ag can be reduced by metal Bi to form Ag 35,36.The reaction may be formulated as: The SEM characterization was utilized to investigate their morphology, crystal structure, and particle size of the Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 samples.Typical SEM images of these samples were displayed in Fig. 2. The SEM image in Fig. 2a shows that the BBV sample is composed of chain-like microstructures assembled by microspheres with smooth surface.The diameter of these microspheres is in the range of 300 600 nm.The broken sites in some microspheres suggest that the chain-like microstructures possess a hollow interior structure.The EDX analysis (Fig. S4a) reveals that BBV sample contains O, V, and Bi elements, and the content of metal Bi in BBV is about 39.4 wt.Fig. 2b-d shows the SEM images of BBV after reaction with different amount of AgNO 3 .Generally, these samples still take on chain-like morphology though they were hydrothermally treated in AgNO 3 aqueous solution.Nevertheless, some flake-like nanoparticles were decorated on the surface of the chain-like microstructures, leading to a rougher surface in comparison with that of BBV sample.The amount and size of these nanoflakes increase gradually with increasing the AgNO 3 concentration in the reaction solution.The EDX spectrum in Fig. S4b displays the existence of O, V, Bi, and Ag elements in ABBV-2 sample.The contents of metallic Ag and Bi in different Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 samples were further analyzed using ICP-MS, as shown in Table 1.It can be found that the amount of Ag in the composites can be tuned by adjusting the AgNO 3 concentration in the reaction solution, which is in well accordance with the XRD results. To investigate the detailed microstructure of the Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, TEM and HRTEM characterizations were utilized.Fig. 3a shows a typical TEM image of BBV sample.Similar to the results from the SEM characterization, the chain-like microstructures in BBV have smooth surface.The center of the chain-like microstructures is brighter than their periphery, demonstrating the hollow interior structure of these microstructures once again.Fig. 3b displays a typical HRTEM image obtained from the chain-like microstructures, indicating the co-existence of both crystal nanoparticles and amorphous phases.The lattice intervals of 0.330 and 0.238 nm are in consistence with the (012) and (104) crystalline plane of metallic Bi 23,24.The amorphous phase can be assigned to the BiVO 4 , consistent with the XRD results.The TEM images of ABBV-2 shown in Figs.3c and S5a reveal that a large number of nanoflakes were grown on the surface of microspheres, giving rise to a relatively rougher surface compared to that of BBV sample.The typical HRTEM image of the nanoflakes was presented in Fig. 3d.The lattice distance of 0.236 nm corresponds to the (111) crystalline plane of Ag, indicating the formation of metallic Ag nanoflakes 35.The HRTEM image in Fig. S5b XPS characterization of the BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples was performed to identify the elemental compositions and their oxidation states.The curve (I) in Fig. 4a presents the high resolution Bi 4f XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The strong peaks located at 159.4 and 164.6 eV are attributed to Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 of Bi 3 , respectively, while the weak signals at 157.8 and 163.0 eV can be assigned to the metallic Biin ABBV-2.37 Fig. 4b displays the Ag 3d regional XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The two peaks centered at 374.1 and 368.0 eV can be ascribed to the metallic Ag in ABBV-2 38.The curve (I) in Fig. 4c displays the V 2p XPS spectrum of ABBV-2.The peaks located at 516.6 and 524.2 eV belong to the V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 binding energies of V 5 in BiVO 4 39, respectively.The O 1s XPS spectrum of ABBV-2 (Fig. 4d) shows three strong peaks centered at 528.9, 531.5 and 532.9 eV, which Scheme 1. Schematic procedure for the construction of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 chain-like hollow microstructures.correspond to the crystal lattice oxygen (O latt ), dangling bonds (B dan ), and adsorbed oxygen (O ads ) species 12, respectively.The dangling bonds and adsorbed oxygen species in the XPS spectrum usually mean the formation of OVs in the material surface, and a larger number of dangling bonds and adsorbed oxygen species imply a higher OVs concentration 40.The relative intensity ratio (R int ) of O latt /(B dan O ads ) can roughly reflect the relative OVs concentration 41.According to the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4d), the R int values of BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 were estimated to be 3.20, 1.28, 1.35, and 1.40, respectively, indicating that the OVs concentrations of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 are The Ag content, E g value, S BET , and CO evolution rate of different samples.much higher than that of BV-1.In addition, it is also found that the Bi 4f, V 2p and O 1s peaks of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 are slightly shifted to higher binding energies compared to those of BV-1, which may be ascribed to the higher OVs concentrations in these samples 42. To identify the existence of surface OVs in BV-1, BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples, the EPR spectra of these samples were carried out, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Obviously, nearly no EPR signals were observed for BV-1.On the contrary, the EPR spectra of BV-2 and BBV samples display strong signals at g 1.966, which may originate from the surface OVs 32,43.As the Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of Bi/BiVO 4 , the intensity of EPR signal decreased slightly, implying the decreased OVs concentration in the composites, which may be mainly caused by the oxidation of partial OVs by the oxygen in the reaction solution under the hydrothermal condition 44. UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra ranging from 200 700 nm were employed to probe the light absorption properties of and band-gap energies (E g ) of the pure BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, as displayed in Fig. 6a.The absorption edge of BV-2 sample is determined to be around 450 nm, suggesting that the BV-2 has a weak absorption property for visible-light.Moreover, an weak absorption tail in the range of 450 700 nm was observed, which may be induced by the surface OVs in BV-2 44.For Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, they have similar absorption edges (465, 469, 470, and 473 nm for BBV, ABBV-1, ABBV-2, and ABBV-3 sample, respectively) though the metallic Bi or Ag contents in these samples are different.However, their absorption intensities in the range of 450 700 nm are quite different.The BBV sample shows a remarkebly enhanced light absorption in the range of 450 700 nm compared to BV-2 sample.The enhancement in light absorption could be caused by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of metallic Bi nanoparticles 23,24.For Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites, their absorption intensities in the visiblelight region increased along with increasing the Ag content, which can be ascribed to the SPR effect of Ag nanoflakes 20.It is expected that the enhanced visible-light absorption would lead to a boosted photocatalytic performance of the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites.The E g values of the BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 , and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 were determined by using the equation: E g 1240/ g 45, and presented in Table 1.It is clear that the metallic Bi and Ag nanoparticles have little influence in the E g of BiVO 4 .Fig. 6b displays the PL emission spectra of BV-2, BBV and ABBV-2 samples.Obviously, the PL intensity of ABBV-2 decreases significantly compared to both BV-2 and BBV, which is attributed to the higher delocalization of photoexcited charge pairs giving rise to a lower recombination rate 46. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed to identify the 47.Fig. 7B illustrates the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites.It can be seen that the arc radius in EIS Nynquist plots of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites are much smaller than that of Bi/BiVO 4 .The radius of the circular arc increase in the following order: ABBV-2 ABBV-3 ABBV-1 BBV, which is in agreement with the variation trend of photocurrent density.It has been well demonstrated that the smaller radius of the circular arc represents the higher charge-separation efficiency 48.Therefore, the ABBV-2 possess a faster interfacial charge migration and retarded recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in comparison with other samples.The primary cause for this phenomenon is that the proper amount of Ag nanoparticles can accelerate charge-transfer and electron collection, while excessive Ag nanoparticles would facilitate the recombination of photoexited charge pairs, leading to a higher interfacial charge transfer resistance.The consistent variation trend of photocurrent and EIS strongly confirms that the loading a proper amount of metal Ag can effectively restrain the recombination of photoinduced charge pairs. The photocatalytic performances of pure BiVO 4 , Bi/BiVO 4 , and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 were evaluated through the CO 2 photocatalytic conversion under the visible-light irradiation.Analytical detection of the gassous products revealed that CO was detected as the only carbonaceous gas products during the process of CO 2 photoreduction.For comparison, control experiments were carried out only in the presence of illumination, catalysts, CO 2 , or H 2 O, in which no CO products were detectable.In contrast, in the presence of illumination, catalysts, CO 2 , and H 2 O, detectable CO was obtained, confirming that the CO gas really originated from the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.The CO production rate of these samples after 4 h' light irradiation was displayed in Fig. 8a.As can be seen, in the presence of BV-1 and BV-2 samples, only a trace or small amount of CO was obtained, indicating that the pure BiVO 4 nearly exhibits no or very weak photocatalytic activity toward CO reduction.However, a relatively high evolution rate ( 1.3 mol g -1 h -1 ) can be obtained in the presence of BBV sample.The dual contribution of metal Bi nanoparticles and surface OVs may give rise to the enhanced photocatalytic performance of BBV sample 49.It is worth noting that the metal Bi content can affect the photocatalytic activity of BBV catalyst and the optimal content of metal Bi in BBV is 39.4 wt , as show in table S1.Consequently, the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composite photocatalysts were constructed using the BBV sample with 39.4 wt metal Bi as template.After being loaded with Ag nanoparticles, the CO production rate is further increased greatly, indicating that metallic Ag can boost the photocatalytic performance of Bi/BiVO 4 composites.Moreover, the CO evolution rate largely depends on the metal Ag content.The CO-yielding rate of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites initially increases with enhancing Ag loading and then decreases gradually.The variation trend of the CO evolution rate is in agreement with that of photocurrent and EIS of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 .With increasing the amount of Ag nanoparticles till reaching an optimal amount, the separation efficiency of photoexcited charge pairs was enhanced gradually, resulting in a gradually improved photocatalytic activity of Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 .However, excessive metal Ag would boost the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, giving rise to an impaired enhancement of photocatalytic activity.ABBV-2 sample displays the highest CO evolution rate ( 5.19 mol g -1 h -1 ), which is much higher than that of BBV.The present CO production rate is better than that of Ag/ Na 2 Ti 6 O 13 catalysts applied in CO 2 photoreduction toward CO 50.The recycling stability of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 photocatalysts was also studied, as shown in Fig. 8b.Obviously, the photocatalytic activity of these photocatalysts only decreases slightly after five continuous cycles under the identical conditions.The XRD pattern and SEM image (as shown in Fig. S6) of the ABBV-2 sample after successive photocatalytic reactions demonstrate that the crystal phase and shape of ABBV-2 is still preserved after the photocatalytic reactions.The TEM and HRTEM images of ABBV-2 after photocatalytic reaction are given in Fig. S7.No lattice fringes corresponding to the planes of Ag 2 O and Bi 2 O 3 were observed in the HREM image, suggesting that the metal Ag and Bi are not oxidized during photocatalytic reaction.Moreover, the distribution and morphology of Ag nanoflakes and metal Bi nanoparticles in ABBV-2 after photocatalytic reaction nearly maintain unchanged.The stability of surface OVs in ABBV-2 was also examined, as shown in Fig. S8.Apparently, ABBV-2 sample after photocatalytic reaction still displays a strong EPR signal at g 1.966, indicating that the surface OVs in ABBV-2 are stable at room temperature.All of above results confirm the high stability of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 photocatalysts, which accounts for why Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 has the sustained photocatalytic activity for CO 2 conversion after five continuous cycles. To explore the charge-transfer mechanism of Bi/BiVO 4 and Ag-Bi/ BiVO 4 composites, the band-edge positions of BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 samples were predicted based on their flat-band potentials (E fb ) and E g values.By the means of Mott-Schottky analysis (Fig. 8c), the E fb values for BV-2, BBV, and ABBV-2 were determined to be -0.648,-0.601, and -0.596 V vs. SCE at pH 7, respectively.The E fb can be further converted into normal hydrogen electrode potential (NHE) according to the formula: E NHE E SCE E SCE 0.059 pH 51, where E SCE is the potential of SCE, E SCE is 0.2415 V, and pH is about 7.0.The CB of VB-2 sample is determined to be -0.477V. Usually, the CB should be more negative by 0.2 V than the E fb 52, and thus the CB of VB-2 should be about -0.677 V, which is much higher than the previously reported CB edge position of BiVO 4 53.The elevated CB potential of BV-2 may be caused by the surface OVs 54,55.Similarly, the CB values of BBV and ABBV-2 samples are calculated to be -0.630, and -0.625 V, respectively, indicating that metallic Bi and Ag nanoparticles can slightly alter the CB of BV-2.Combining the E g of BV-2 (2.76 eV), the valance band (VB) of BV-2 can be determined by the equation: E CB E VB -E g , where E CB and E VB are the CB potential and VB potential, respectively.Thus, the VB value of BV-2 is calculated to be 2.10 eV.To further confirm this band structure, the XPS VB spectrum of BV-2 was also carried out, as illustrated in Fig. 8d.According to the linear intersection method 56, E VB of BV-2 is estimated to be 2.17 eV, which is very close to the value (2.10 eV) determined by Mott-Schottky analysis. Taking the above results and analysis into consideration, a possible charge transfer and separation process, and enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for the Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 composites were proposed as displayed in Fig. 9.Under visible-light illumination, BiVO 4 is excited to produce potogenerated electrons and holes.Due to the formed surface OVs, most of photoinduced electrons would be captured by OVs states 57.Because the Fermi level of metallic Bi is lower than the OVs states and CB of BiVO 4 , the photoinduced electrons would transfer from BiVO 4 to metallic Bi.Therefore, the surface OVs and Bi nanoparticles would boost the separation and migration efficiencies of photogenerated charge carriers in the surface of BiVO 4 , and hence improve the photocatalytic performance.Besides, metallic Bi nanoparticles also can be excited to generate electron-hole pairs.After loading of metal Ag on The hot electrons would occupy the empty states in the CB of Ag and energetically transfer to the CB of BiVO 4 , with the hot holes left on Ag 58.Subsequently, BiVO 4 would rapidly transport the hot electrons to the Bi nanoparticles due to the low resistance of photoexcited BiVO 4 .As a result, the electron density on the surface of metallic Bi is significantly increased, which would facilitate the photoreduction of CO 2 .In general, the enhancement of photocatalytic performance of Ag-Bi/BiVO 4 is mainly attributed to the improved light absorption owing to the SPR effect of Ag and the enhanced charge-separation efficiency caused by surface OVs and metal Bi."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
