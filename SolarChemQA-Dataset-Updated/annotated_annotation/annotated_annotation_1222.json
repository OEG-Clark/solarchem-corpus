High-resolution XPS spectra shown in Fig. 3(b) displays two XPS peaks at binding energies of 931.7 eV and 951.6 eV, which can be related to Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 , respectively, and no Cu 2p satellite peak appears in the region of 940-945 eV, further confirming the formation of Cu 2 O 55.The binding energies of O 1 s at 529.4 eV and 531.1 eV in Fig. 3(c) can be ascribed to the lattice oxygen in the P25 and Cu 2 O and the chemisorbed oxygen, respectively.The peaks located at 367.1 eV and 373.2 eV in Fig. 3(d) were characteristic of Ag 3d in metallic Ag 52,56.These results further indicated that metal Ag and Cu 2 O were deposited successfully on the surface of P25.Fig. 4(a, b) displayed the UV-Vis DRS of P25, 1Cu 2 O/TiO 2 , 0.5Ag-0.5Cu 2 O/TiO 2 and 1Ag/TiO 2 .Obviously, it can be seen from Fig. 4(a) that the absorption edge of P25 was close to 400 nm, which showed that P25 only absorbs light in the UV region.After the loading of Cu 2 O or Ag, the absorption edge of the sample presented a slight red shift, and the light absorption in visible region obviously increased.As shown in Fig. 4(b), when only Cu 2 O was deposited on the surface of P25, a new absorption peak appeared in the range of 400-500 nm, which can be attributed to the interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) 57 and the narrow band gap of Cu 2 O.With the addition of Ag Fig. 1.XRD patterns of P25, 1Cu 2 O/TiO 2 , Ag-Cu 2 O/TiO 2 and 1Ag/TiO 2 .

P25 and Cu 2 O were concurrently photoexcited with the irradiation of simulated sunlight and the photoelectrons can transfer from the CB of P25 to the VB of Cu 2 O to recombine with the holes, which followed the Z-scheme charge transfer pathway.The holes enriched in the VB of P25 were used for the oxidation of H 2 O to generate O 2 and the electrons preserved in the CB of Cu 2 O were used for the reduction of CO 2 to form CO and CH 4 .Subsequently, the deposited Ag can further capture the electrons from the CB of Cu 2 O so that the self-reduction of Cu 2 O can be inhibited 57.In addition, the surface plasmon resonance effect of Ag nanoparticles can also improve the absorption of visible light.The synergistic effects of Cu 2 O and Ag promoted the stability and photoactivity of Ag-Cu 2 O/TiO 2 for CO 2 reduction under simulated sunlight irradiation.

P25 and Cu 2 O were concurrently photoexcited with the irradiation of simulated sunlight and the photoelectrons can transfer from the CB of P25 to the VB of Cu 2 O to recombine with the holes, which followed the Z-scheme charge transfer pathway.The holes enriched in the VB of P25 were used for the oxidation of H 2 O to generate O 2 and the electrons preserved in the CB of Cu 2 O were used for the reduction of CO 2 to form CO and CH 4 .Subsequently, the deposited Ag can further capture the electrons from the CB of Cu 2 O so that the self-reduction of Cu 2 O can be inhibited 57.In addition, the surface plasmon resonance effect of Ag nanoparticles can also improve the absorption of visible light.The synergistic effects of Cu 2 O and Ag promoted the stability and photoactivity of Ag-Cu 2 O/TiO 2 for CO 2 reduction under simulated sunlight irradiation.
