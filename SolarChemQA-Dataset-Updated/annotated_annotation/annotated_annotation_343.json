The microstructure of the ZnO-rGO composites and GO was characterized using TEM in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2(a), GO has 2D structure consisting of sheets with many wrinkles.From Fig. 2(b,c), numerous ZnO nanoparticles are observed on the surface of rGO sheets, which reveals a good combination of rGO and ZnO.Moreover, the profile of a single ZnO nanoparticle could be clearly distinguished, and ZnO nanoparticles are dispersed uniformly.Fig. 2(d) indicates that the obtained ZnO nanocrystals with the average diameter around 10.5 nm.The EDX spectrum of the ZnO-rGO composite (Fig. 2e) exhibits the presence of Zn, O and C in the material composition, which confirms the successful formation of ZnO-rGO composite 29. The XPS spectrum was applied to investigate the surface chemical states, composition change and interaction of ZnO with graphene.Fig. 3a shows the C1s spectra of GO and ZnO-rGO composites.The deconvoluted C1s XPS spectra of GO shows four different peaks located at 284.6 eV (C-C bonds), 286.7 eV (C-O bonds), 287.5 eV (C 14 O bonds), and 288.3 eV (O-C 14 O groups) 3,30.In contrast, the extremely loss of oxygen-containing carbonaceous peaks in ZnO-rGO composite is observed.This suggests that the GO was reduced after hydrothermal reaction 31.From Fig. 3b, compared to the Zn 2p 3/2 peak in pure ZnO, a shift towards higher binding energy of 1022.2 eV is observed in ZnO-rGO composite.This shift shows the absence of electrochemical interaction between ZnO and rGO, which can improve the catalytic activity of ZnO nanocrystal 29,30. The molecular structures of the prepared GO and ZnO-10 rGO were characterized by FTIR spectra, as shown in Fig. 4. For GO, the peaks at 3407, 1730, 1625, 1399, 1245, 1107 cm A 1 are due to the -OH stretching vibrations, C 14 O stretching vibrations, C 14 C configurable vibrations from the aromatic zooms, C-OH stretching vibrations, C-O stretching vibrations of epoxy, C-OH stretching vibrations 19,21.In ZnO-rGO, the intensities of these peaks decreased distinctly and even disappeared partly, which confirmed that most of oxygen-containing groups were removed.This result also indicates that GO was reduced effectively through hydrothermal process.The absorption peak of CC appears around 1565 cm A 1 was the skeletal vibration of graphene 32.And the obvious peak at 460 cm A 1 can be ascribed to the stretching vibration of Zn-O 19. The N 2 adsorption A desorption isotherms(in Fig. 5) were recorded to investigate the BET surface area and pore structure of ZnO and ZnO-rGO composite.In Fig. 5a the isotherm of ZnO is of type II (BDDT) with a wide pore size distribution in the mesoporous and macroporous regions 32.The specific surface area of ZnO is calculated to be 2.7989 m 2 g A 1 .For comparison, the isotherm of ZnO-rGO composite (in Fig. 5b) shows typical type IV behavior with H 3 hysteresis-loop, which is associated with slit-like pores formed by the stacking of the ZnO-rGO composite sheets 33.According to the pore size distribution (inset), the ZnO-rGO composite has obvious mesopores with a peak pore diameter of around 3 nm and decreased amount of macropores compared with pure ZnO.The porous structure of ZnO-rGO composite can facilitate the adsorption of reactants and transportation of products.The BET specific surface area of ZnO-rGO composite can reach up to 23.6863 m 2 g A 1 , which is much higher than that of the pure ZnO.The larger specific surface area can provide more surface active sites and facilitate the migration of charge carriers, which is remarkable useful to improve the photocatalytic performance 3. The change of electron or energy transfer between ZnO and rGO was detected by photoluminescence (PL) measurements.Fig. 6(a) shows the PL spectra of ZnO and ZnO-10rGO.ZnO displays a broad PL emission peak at around 603 nm.As expected, ZnO-10rGO shows a significant decrease in the intensity of PL compared to ZnO.The weaker intensity of the peak represents the lower recombination probability of free charges, which indicates that coupling with rGO can effectively mitigate the recombination of photogenerated electronhole pairs of ZnO 20,29. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured to investigate the optical properties of synthesized samples, as shown in Fig. 6(b).It is clear that pure ZnO can mainly absorb ultraviolet light.However, all ZnO-rGO samples present an enhanced absorption over pure ZnO in the visible light region, and the characteristic absorption edges display a slight red shift.The results show that the introduction of rGO extends the light response range and enhances the utilization of solar energy 29.The similar phenomenon also can be observed from other graphene-based semiconductor nanomaterials 3,21. ZnO-rGO nanocomposites and pure ZnO are used as photocatalysts to evaluate the photocatalytic activity by photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into methanol.The charge separation and transfer in the reaction system was shown in Fig. 7.Under UV-vis light irradiation, the excited electrons jump from the valence band (VB) of ZnO nanocrystal to its conduction band (CB), but these electrons can combine with holes quickly.In ZnO-rGO nanocomposites, due to the interaction between ZnO nanocrystal and graphene nanosheet, the electrons from ZnO can easily transfer to the surface of graphene and delay the combination of electron and hole.Holes in the valence band of ZnO react with water producing O 2 and H .Absorbed CO 2 molecules are reduced to methanol by enriched electrons on the graphene surface.During the reduction process, the major reaction steps were described briefly as follows. From Fig. 8(a), the content of rGO has an significant effect on the photocatalytic activity of ZnO nanocrystal.The order of methanol yield depended on the content of GO was ZnO-10 rGO4ZnO-5rGO4ZnO-20rGO4ZnO-1rGO.The highest yield of methanol over ZnO-rGO was 263.17 mol/g cat when the mass fraction of GO in composite was 10.Further increasing the content of GO, the catalytic activity decreased, which was probably due to the fact that more graphene would prevent light from reaching surface of ZnO nanoparticles and reduce the generation of electrons and holes, thereby decreasing the reduction of CO 2 34.shows the yield of methanol on ZnO and ZnO-10 rGO catalysts under UV-vis light irradiation.It can be seen that, without rGO, pure ZnO has a lower property on methanol generation in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 compare with ZnO-10rGO.After three hours, the methanol yield of ZnO-10 rGO (263.17mol/g cat ) was about five times higher than that of pure ZnO (52.36 mol/g cat ).From above results, graphene have a positive impact on the photocatalytic performance of ZnO, which is attributed to the synergetic effects between ZnO nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets, this synergetic effect can improve the charge separation and the photocatalytic activity 19,20. The amount of photocatalyst has a great effect on the photocatalytic activity for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .Different concentration of ZnO-10rGO catalyst (1 g/L, 1.5 g/L, 2 g/L, 2.5 g/L, 3 g/L) were investigated.As shown in Fig. 8(c), the methanol yield increased gradually with increasing the concentration of ZnO-10rGO catalyst from 1 g/L to 2 g/L.It was reasonable that higher amount of photocatalyst can provide more active sites and absorb more light.However, further increase the concentration of ZnO-10rGO catalyst above 2 g/L, the methanol yield was decreased.Above result could conclude that excess photocatalysts will block the light penetration, consequently decreasing the photocatalytic activity. The stability of ZnO-rGO was researched by performing the photocatalytic reduction experiment repeatedly three times under the same reaction condition.As shown in Fig. 8(d), there was a little change in amount of obtained methanol, and the total yield of methanol on ZnO-10rGO was decreased only 5.The results demonstrated that this kind of photocatalyst is a promising candidate for environmental management."}, {"llm generation": "UV-vis light", "source": "Under UV-vis light irradiation, the assynthesized ZnO-rGO nanocomposite exhibits higher photocatalytic reduction efficiency than ZnO itself, in which the graphene sheets play an important role.", "context": "The ZnO nanoparticles with a size of 5 25 nm are uniformly decorated on the rGO nanosheets through one-pot hydrothermal process.Under UV-vis light irradiation, the assynthesized ZnO-rGO nanocomposite exhibits higher photocatalytic reduction efficiency than ZnO itself, in which the graphene sheets play an important role.When the content of rGO was 10 and the dosage of photocatalyst was 2.0 g/L, ZnO-rGO nanocomposite displays the highest photocatalytic reduction activity.This work indicates that this sort of material could be used as a promising photocatalyst for the photoreduction of carbon dioxide.

The microstructure of the ZnO-rGO composites and GO was characterized using TEM in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2(a), GO has 2D structure consisting of sheets with many wrinkles.From Fig. 2(b,c), numerous ZnO nanoparticles are observed on the surface of rGO sheets, which reveals a good combination of rGO and ZnO.Moreover, the profile of a single ZnO nanoparticle could be clearly distinguished, and ZnO nanoparticles are dispersed uniformly.Fig. 2(d) indicates that the obtained ZnO nanocrystals with the average diameter around 10.5 nm.The EDX spectrum of the ZnO-rGO composite (Fig. 2e) exhibits the presence of Zn, O and C in the material composition, which confirms the successful formation of ZnO-rGO composite 29. The XPS spectrum was applied to investigate the surface chemical states, composition change and interaction of ZnO with graphene.Fig. 3a shows the C1s spectra of GO and ZnO-rGO composites.The deconvoluted C1s XPS spectra of GO shows four different peaks located at 284.6 eV (C-C bonds), 286.7 eV (C-O bonds), 287.5 eV (C 14 O bonds), and 288.3 eV (O-C 14 O groups) 3,30.In contrast, the extremely loss of oxygen-containing carbonaceous peaks in ZnO-rGO composite is observed.This suggests that the GO was reduced after hydrothermal reaction 31.From Fig. 3b, compared to the Zn 2p 3/2 peak in pure ZnO, a shift towards higher binding energy of 1022.2 eV is observed in ZnO-rGO composite.This shift shows the absence of electrochemical interaction between ZnO and rGO, which can improve the catalytic activity of ZnO nanocrystal 29,30. The molecular structures of the prepared GO and ZnO-10 rGO were characterized by FTIR spectra, as shown in Fig. 4. For GO, the peaks at 3407, 1730, 1625, 1399, 1245, 1107 cm A 1 are due to the -OH stretching vibrations, C 14 O stretching vibrations, C 14 C configurable vibrations from the aromatic zooms, C-OH stretching vibrations, C-O stretching vibrations of epoxy, C-OH stretching vibrations 19,21.In ZnO-rGO, the intensities of these peaks decreased distinctly and even disappeared partly, which confirmed that most of oxygen-containing groups were removed.This result also indicates that GO was reduced effectively through hydrothermal process.The absorption peak of CC appears around 1565 cm A 1 was the skeletal vibration of graphene 32.And the obvious peak at 460 cm A 1 can be ascribed to the stretching vibration of Zn-O 19. The N 2 adsorption A desorption isotherms(in Fig. 5) were recorded to investigate the BET surface area and pore structure of ZnO and ZnO-rGO composite.In Fig. 5a the isotherm of ZnO is of type II (BDDT) with a wide pore size distribution in the mesoporous and macroporous regions 32.The specific surface area of ZnO is calculated to be 2.7989 m 2 g A 1 .For comparison, the isotherm of ZnO-rGO composite (in Fig. 5b) shows typical type IV behavior with H 3 hysteresis-loop, which is associated with slit-like pores formed by the stacking of the ZnO-rGO composite sheets 33.According to the pore size distribution (inset), the ZnO-rGO composite has obvious mesopores with a peak pore diameter of around 3 nm and decreased amount of macropores compared with pure ZnO.The porous structure of ZnO-rGO composite can facilitate the adsorption of reactants and transportation of products.The BET specific surface area of ZnO-rGO composite can reach up to 23.6863 m 2 g A 1 , which is much higher than that of the pure ZnO.The larger specific surface area can provide more surface active sites and facilitate the migration of charge carriers, which is remarkable useful to improve the photocatalytic performance 3. The change of electron or energy transfer between ZnO and rGO was detected by photoluminescence (PL) measurements.Fig. 6(a) shows the PL spectra of ZnO and ZnO-10rGO.ZnO displays a broad PL emission peak at around 603 nm.As expected, ZnO-10rGO shows a significant decrease in the intensity of PL compared to ZnO.The weaker intensity of the peak represents the lower recombination probability of free charges, which indicates that coupling with rGO can effectively mitigate the recombination of photogenerated electronhole pairs of ZnO 20,29. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured to investigate the optical properties of synthesized samples, as shown in Fig. 6(b).It is clear that pure ZnO can mainly absorb ultraviolet light.However, all ZnO-rGO samples present an enhanced absorption over pure ZnO in the visible light region, and the characteristic absorption edges display a slight red shift.The results show that the introduction of rGO extends the light response range and enhances the utilization of solar energy 29.The similar phenomenon also can be observed from other graphene-based semiconductor nanomaterials 3,21.
