elemental Analyzer (vario EL CUBE).The steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra were obtained on a Steady State and Time Resolved Fluorescence Spectrometers (FLSP920) at 298 K.The surface area and pore size of catalysts was measured by a Tristar-3000 analyzer at 77 K.The XAFS spectra were collected at the 1W1B station of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), China.The storage ring of BSRF was operated at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA.N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured on an Autosorb-iQ2 adsorptometer (Quantachrome, USA) at 77 K. Electrochemical measurements were conducted in a three-electrode system (Pt sheet as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode).Typically, 8 mg catalysts and 15 L of Nafion solution (5 wt) were dispersed in 1 mL of water solution to form a homogeneous ink.Then, 20 L sample was loaded on to an ITO glass (1 cm 2 ).Linear sweep voltammetry was carried out in CO 2 -saturated 0.2 M NaHCO 3 solution (10 mV s -1 scan rate).For comparison, linear sweep voltammetry was also carried out in N 2 -saturated 0.2 M NaHCO 3 solution. Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments were conducted in an elevated-pressure cell using a Bruker TENSOR 27 FTIR spectrometer and a diffuse reflectance accessory (Harrick Scientific, DRP-PE9) with a reaction cell (Harrick Scientific, HVCDRP-3) at a wavenumber resolution of 4 cm -1 at 303 K.After flowing with 1 bar of Ar for 1 h, the background spectrum of the sample was acquired.Then, 1 bar of CO 2 and Ar was allowed to flow into the cell for 1.5 and 0.5 h, respectively.DRIFTS spectrum was obtained to detect the adsorbed CO 2 species on the sample. CO 2 temperature programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) was carried out on a Micromeritics Chemisorption Analyzer.Firstly, the 50 mg sample was heated at 300 C for 1 h under Ar atmosphere to remove impurities.Then, the sample was swept by CO 2 for 1 h when the temperature was lowered at 50 C.The gas was switched to Ar to remove the physisorbed CO 2 and un-adsorbed CO 2 molecules, until the baseline was flat.Finally, the temperature was heated to 350 C (10 C/min) to obtain the CO 2 -TPD result. The isotopic experiment was carried out by using high-pure 13 CO 2 .A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyze the generated 13 CO.

The QE for CO 2 reduction was measured by using monochromatic LED lamp with band pass filter of 450 nm.The irradiation area was 2 cm 2 .The light intensity was 11.5 mW cm -2 (ILT 950 spectroradiometer).The reaction contains Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (12 mg), catalysts (10 g), 1 mL TEOA and 5 mL solvent (3 mL acetonitrile and 2 mL H 2 O).The reactor was full of CO 2 to reach a pressure of 1 atm (80 mL in volume).The QE was calculated as AQY Ne/Np100 2 M NAhc/ SPt100 (M: the CO amount, NA: Avogadro constant, h: Planck constant, c: light speed, S: irradiation area, P: light intensity, t: reaction time, : the wavelength of light). DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Program (VASP) package.15 The projector-augmented wave method was used to create effective core potentials and plane waves for the core and valance electrons with a cutoff energy of 500 eV for the plane waves.16,17 The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchangecorrelation function was used.16 A vacuum layer of 15 A was added to avert the interaction between adjacent layers.A Monkhorst-Pack kpoint mesh of (3 31), an energy convergence of 5 10 -5 eV and a force convergence of 0.03 eV/A were employed for these calculations. Gibbs free energies for each gaseous and adsorbed species were calculated at 298.15 K, according to the expression: G E DFT E ZPE CpdT-TS (E DFT is the electronic energy calculated with VASP, E ZPE is the zero-point energy, CpdT is the enthalpic temperature correction, TS is the entropy contribution, C p dT is negligible and C p dT 0).The free energy changes (G) of each step can then be calculated via the difference of the free energies of products and reactants or simply with respect to the initial state of gaseous CO 2 and catalysts surface."}, {"llm generation": "pure Co 4 N", "source": "Additionally, we also synthesized pure Co 4 N nanocrystal and analyzed its CO 2 uptake ability and catalytic performance (Figure S12).", "context": "Recent studies have confirmed that photochemistry is an effective method to synthesize functional nanomaterials.18,19 Photochemical synthesis mainly relies on the photo-dissociation of photoactive species to generated high-energy fragments or radicals.And then, these fragments or radicals tend to spontaneously assemble into nanostructures in thermodynamics.20 Considering the advantages of photochemical synthesis (such as green, simple) and the light-sensitive properties of adenine, we also employed photochemistry to prepare the Co 4 N/NCs, as shown in Fig. 1a.Figs.1b and S1 showed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and element mapping test of the obtained Co 4 N/NCs.Results suggest that the Co 4 N nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the nitrogen-rich carbon matrix with an average size of approximately 1.7 nm.The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Co 4 N nanoparticles displayed a distinct lattice fringe of 0.207 nm (Fig. 1c), which corresponds to the (1 1 1) plane of Co 4 N. 21 The obtained sample was further investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure S2) to determine its structure.The diffraction peak at 26.8c orresponded to graphite-like carbon, agreeing with the Raman result (Figure S3).The diffraction peaks at 43.8and 51.03were ascribed to Co 4 N (JCPDS 41-0943), supporting the HRTEM observation.22,23 The XRD broadening may relate to the small size and the low-crystallinity of the Co 4 N/NCs.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to probe the coordination environment and compositions of catalysts.The XPS survey revealed the presence of C, N, O and Co elements (Figure S4).The contents of C, N, O and Co were calculated to be 53.9 at., 29.8 at., 13.6 at. and 2.7 at., respectively.The binding energies at 781 and 796.2 eV from XPS Co 2p were assigned to Co-N bonds (Fig. 1e), in agreement with those of the Co 4 N reported by Milad 24 and Yao 25.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory.The pore volume is approximately 0.299 cm 3 /g by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.The BJH pore size of Co 4 N/NCs is ranging from 2 to 70 nm (Fig. 3b). Motivated by the dispersibility of Co 4 N and the high nitrogen content of the Co 4 N/NCs catalysts, we investigated their catalytic performance in the CO 2 photoreduction reaction.The CO 2 photoreduction was performed using triethanolamine as an electron donor and Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (bpy 2, 2-bipyridine) as sensitizer.As displayed in Table S1, the Co 4 N/NCs exhibited impressive CO evolution (32.6 mol/30 min).In a system containing Co 4 N/NCs without Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , no CO was produced, indicating that the reaction was initialized by sensitizer.In the presence of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 without Co 4 N/NCs, trace H 2 was detected, suggesting the catalytic role of Co 4 N/NCs in CO 2 reduction.When the reaction was carried out under dark, no CO and H 2 were identified, confirming that the reaction was a light-triggered reaction.To determine the carbon source of produced CO, isotopic 13 CO 2 reduction experiment was performed.As shown in Fig. 4a, only 13 CO (m/ z 29) was observed, suggesting that the generated CO molecules were from CO 2 . The amount effect of Co 4 N/NCs catalysts on photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity was assessed, as shown in Fig. 4b.The CO yield gradually increased with increasing the amount of catalysts.When the amount of catalysts exceeded 10 g, the increase in CO yield is relatively small, which may relate to the light scatter effect by using excessive catalysts.The highest TOF per Co atom within Co 4 N/NCs achieved 6.7 s -1 (1 g Co 4 N/NCs catalysts, Figure S8), which was significantly higher than those of the reported values in Refs.5-7.The TOF per Co atom within Co 4 N/NCs highly reached 0.97 s -1 (10 g Co 4 N/NCs catalysts).Moreover, we further optimized the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 concentration to improve CO production activity (Fig. 4c).After 30 minutes of reaction, the optimized system produced 43 mol CO (10 g Co 4 N/ NCs catalysts; mass activity: 43 mmol/g), which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous photocatalytic CO 2 -to-CO systems under visible light (see Table S2 for detail).However, when the content As known, it is a universal phenomenon of the self-degradation of photosensitizer under light-irradiation conditions.Therefore, the decreased activity can be mainly attributed to the self-degradation of sensitizer.Additionally, we also synthesized pure Co 4 N nanocrystal and analyzed its CO 2 uptake ability and catalytic performance (Figure S12).The CO 2 uptake of the pure Co 4 N was only 3.06 cm 3 g -1 .The produced CO and H 2 were 0.6 mol and 0.16 mol, respectively.Noticeably, the catalytic activity of pure Co 4 N was far below the activity of the Co 4 N/NCs system, indicating that imbedding Co 4 N into carbon-based matrix was a commendable strategy to promote CO 2 reduction catalysis.In addition, a reduced semidiameter was observed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Figure S13), suggesting the fast charge transfer of Co 4 N/NCs. To explore the adsorption capacity and catalytic functions of the Co 4 N/NCs, CO 2 adsorption and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were carried out.Noticeably, the Co 4 N/NCs catalysts exhibited outstanding CO 2 adsorption capacity (Fig. 5a).The CO 2 uptake of Co 4 N/NCs highly reached 33.21 cm 3 g -1 , which may stem from the existence of abundant nitrogen species.As known, CO 2 adsorption is the first step and prominently govern the reaction kinetics of CO 2 reduction catalysis.31 Therefore, the admirable CO 2 uptake of the Co 4 N/NCs should partly account for its excellent catalytic performance.The adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the Co 4 N/NCs were further investigated by CO 2 temperature programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD), as shown in Fig. 5b.A predominant desorption peak of CO 2 at 220 C was observed, which can be attributed to the strong chemisorbed CO 2 molecules.32 This result suggested that the Co 4 N/NCs can effectively activate the adsorbed CO 2 molecules, thereby the energy barrier of this reaction will be lowered.The catalytic character of the Co 4 N/NCs was measured by LSV (Fig. 5c).In CO 2 -saturated solution, the current density of Co 4 N/NCs was higher than that in N 2 -saturated solution.Moreover, a positive shift in the onset potential under a CO 2 -saturated solution was observed.The above LSV results clearly suggested the catalytic roles of Co 4 N/NCs toward CO 2 reduction.33 The band structures of the Co 4 N and NCs were estimated by the Tauc equation and the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Figures S14-15).34 The band positions of the Co 4 N, NCs and Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 were schematically presented in Fig. 6.Apparently, it is thermodynamically feasible to transfer electrons from the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 to the Co 4 N.To estimate the charge-transfer kinetics between the Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 and the Co 4 N/NCs, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL were employed.Dramatically, the PL intensity of Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 was quenched by approximately 65 when the Co 4 N/NCs were introduced into the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution (Fig. 7a), suggesting the photogenerated electrons can effectively transfer from Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 to the Co 4 N/NCs.Besides, the electron lifetime of the Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 -Co 4 N/NCs system was shorter than that of the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , which confirmed a fast charge-transfer kinetics between the Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 and the Co 4 N/NCs, further supporting the PL and thermodynamic results (Fig. 7b).These findings reflected that the interfacial charge transfer between the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 and the Co 4 N/NCs is effective, which possibly stems from the fact that the NCs scaffold bridged the interface charge transfer between the catalytic centers and the lightharvesting antennas.35 To deeply understand the CO 2 reduction reaction processes over the Co 4 N/NCs, the reaction intermediates were monitored by diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS).When the Co 4 N/NCs was exposed to CO 2 atmosphere, some vibration signals appeared (Fig. 8a).The peaks at 2330-2360 cm -1 matched with the asymmetric stretching vibration modes of CO 2 .36,37 The peaks at 1395 and 1454 cm -1 corresponded to symmetric and asymmetric OCO stretching vibrations, respectively.36,37 The peaks at 1523 and 1540 cm -1 were attributed to COOH species.36,37 The peaks from 1650 to 1750 cm -1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of C O.Notably, the intensity of COOH markedly increased when the system was irradiated by visible light, signifying that the COOH was the main intermediates, consistent well with previous research.38 The DRIFTS spectrum of pure Co 4 N after the exposure to CO 2 was also analyzed, as shown in Figure S16.An obvious CO 2 adsorption peak at 2330-2360 cm -1 was observed.However, the signals at 1300-1750 cm -1 were almost negligible.This finding suggested the activation of CO 2 over the Co 4 N was very weak. To further study the reaction processes of CO 2 reduction over the Co 4 N/NCs, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out.Interestingly, the O C O bond on the Co 4 N surface was in a linear configuration (Figure S17), suggesting that sole Co 4 N cannot effectively activate CO 2 .Whereas, the O C O bond on the Co 4 N/ NCs surface became a V-type configuration with a bond angle of 146.26.This suggested that the hybrid configuration was beneficial to the activation of CO 2 , agreeing with the DRIFTS results.Optimized geometric structures of various states along the reaction pathway were depicted in Figs.8c-e.The adsorption of CO 2 occurred on Co site and the CO 2 protonation lead to the formation of COOH and CO.The calculated G was summarized in Fig. 8b and Tables S3-S4.The G for the CO formation was -0.2 eV, suggesting the CO formation was thermodynamically favorable.While, the G for the COOH formation was 0.88 eV, signifying the formation of COOH was the rate-limiting step.In addition, it can be seen that the CO desorption was mildly endothermic, implying that the catalytic performance can be further promoted by encouraging CO desorption.The possible reaction"}, {"llm generation": "Co 4 N/NCs", "source": "In summary, we found that the Co 4 N/NCs can act as a robust catalyst for CO 2 reduction reaction.", "context": "In summary, we found that the Co 4 N/NCs can act as a robust catalyst for CO 2 reduction reaction.The QE for CO production at 450 nm highly reached 7.2.The mass activity of Co 4 N/NCs is significantly higher than those of previously reported CO 2 photoreduction catalysts.The reaction mechanism was carefully investigated by in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.Results confirmed that the synergetic effects between the Co 4 N and the NCs can encourage the adsorption and activation of CO 2 and hasten the interfacial electron transfer between catalysts and light-harvesting antenna, leading to unexpected activity.This work offers a prototype to design highly-efficient Co-based catalysts for CO 2 reduction.Additionally, this Co-based host-guest topology might hold potential for other redox chemistries.

Motivated by the dispersibility of Co 4 N and the high nitrogen content of the Co 4 N/NCs catalysts, we investigated their catalytic performance in the CO 2 photoreduction reaction.The CO 2 photoreduction was performed using triethanolamine as an electron donor and Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (bpy 2, 2-bipyridine) as sensitizer.As displayed in Table S1, the Co 4 N/NCs exhibited impressive CO evolution (32.6 mol/30 min).In a system containing Co 4 N/NCs without Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , no CO was produced, indicating that the reaction was initialized by sensitizer.In the presence of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 without Co 4 N/NCs, trace H 2 was detected, suggesting the catalytic role of Co 4 N/NCs in CO 2 reduction.When the reaction was carried out under dark, no CO and H 2 were identified, confirming that the reaction was a light-triggered reaction.To determine the carbon source of produced CO, isotopic 13 CO 2 reduction experiment was performed.As shown in Fig. 4a, only 13 CO (m/ z 29) was observed, suggesting that the generated CO molecules were from CO 2 . The amount effect of Co 4 N/NCs catalysts on photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity was assessed, as shown in Fig. 4b.The CO yield gradually increased with increasing the amount of catalysts.When the amount of catalysts exceeded 10 g, the increase in CO yield is relatively small, which may relate to the light scatter effect by using excessive catalysts.The highest TOF per Co atom within Co 4 N/NCs achieved 6.7 s -1 (1 g Co 4 N/NCs catalysts, Figure S8), which was significantly higher than those of the reported values in Refs.5-7.The TOF per Co atom within Co 4 N/NCs highly reached 0.97 s -1 (10 g Co 4 N/NCs catalysts).Moreover, we further optimized the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 concentration to improve CO production activity (Fig. 4c).After 30 minutes of reaction, the optimized system produced 43 mol CO (10 g Co 4 N/ NCs catalysts; mass activity: 43 mmol/g), which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous photocatalytic CO 2 -to-CO systems under visible light (see Table S2 for detail).However, when the content As known, it is a universal phenomenon of the self-degradation of photosensitizer under light-irradiation conditions.Therefore, the decreased activity can be mainly attributed to the self-degradation of sensitizer.Additionally, we also synthesized pure Co 4 N nanocrystal and analyzed its CO 2 uptake ability and catalytic performance (Figure S12).The CO 2 uptake of the pure Co 4 N was only 3.06 cm 3 g -1 .The produced CO and H 2 were 0.6 mol and 0.16 mol, respectively.Noticeably, the catalytic activity of pure Co 4 N was far below the activity of the Co 4 N/NCs system, indicating that imbedding Co 4 N into carbon-based matrix was a commendable strategy to promote CO 2 reduction catalysis.In addition, a reduced semidiameter was observed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Figure S13), suggesting the fast charge transfer of Co 4 N/NCs. To explore the adsorption capacity and catalytic functions of the Co 4 N/NCs, CO 2 adsorption and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were carried out.Noticeably, the Co 4 N/NCs catalysts exhibited outstanding CO 2 adsorption capacity (Fig. 5a).The CO 2 uptake of Co 4 N/NCs highly reached 33.21 cm 3 g -1 , which may stem from the existence of abundant nitrogen species.As known, CO 2 adsorption is the first step and prominently govern the reaction kinetics of CO 2 reduction catalysis.31 Therefore, the admirable CO 2 uptake of the Co 4 N/NCs should partly account for its excellent catalytic performance.The adsorption and activation of CO 2 on the Co 4 N/NCs were further investigated by CO 2 temperature programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD), as shown in Fig. 5b.A predominant desorption peak of CO 2 at 220 C was observed, which can be attributed to the strong chemisorbed CO 2 molecules.32 This result suggested that the Co 4 N/NCs can effectively activate the adsorbed CO 2 molecules, thereby the energy barrier of this reaction will be lowered.The catalytic character of the Co 4 N/NCs was measured by LSV (Fig. 5c).In CO 2 -saturated solution, the current density of Co 4 N/NCs was higher than that in N 2 -saturated solution.Moreover, a positive shift in the onset potential under a CO 2 -saturated solution was observed.The above LSV results clearly suggested the catalytic roles of Co 4 N/NCs toward CO 2 reduction.33 The band structures of the Co 4 N and NCs were estimated by the Tauc equation and the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Figures S14-15).34 The band positions of the Co 4 N, NCs and Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 were schematically presented in Fig. 6.Apparently, it is thermodynamically feasible to transfer electrons from the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 to the Co 4 N.To estimate the charge-transfer kinetics between the Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 and the Co 4 N/NCs, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL were employed.Dramatically, the PL intensity of Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 was quenched by approximately 65 when the Co 4 N/NCs were introduced into the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 aqueous solution (Fig. 7a), suggesting the photogenerated electrons can effectively transfer from Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 to the Co 4 N/NCs.Besides, the electron lifetime of the Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 -Co 4 N/NCs system was shorter than that of the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , which confirmed a fast charge-transfer kinetics between the Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2 and the Co 4 N/NCs, further supporting the PL and thermodynamic results (Fig. 7b).These findings reflected that the interfacial charge transfer between the Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 and the Co 4 N/NCs is effective, which possibly stems from the fact that the NCs scaffold bridged the interface charge transfer between the catalytic centers and the lightharvesting antennas.35 To deeply understand the CO 2 reduction reaction processes over the Co 4 N/NCs, the reaction intermediates were monitored by diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS).When the Co 4 N/NCs was exposed to CO 2 atmosphere, some vibration signals appeared (Fig. 8a).The peaks at 2330-2360 cm -1 matched with the asymmetric stretching vibration modes of CO 2 .36,37 The peaks at 1395 and 1454 cm -1 corresponded to symmetric and asymmetric OCO stretching vibrations, respectively.36,37 The peaks at 1523 and 1540 cm -1 were attributed to COOH species.36,37 The peaks from 1650 to 1750 cm -1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of C O.Notably, the intensity of COOH markedly increased when the system was irradiated by visible light, signifying that the COOH was the main intermediates, consistent well with previous research.38 The DRIFTS spectrum of pure Co 4 N after the exposure to CO 2 was also analyzed, as shown in Figure S16.An obvious CO 2 adsorption peak at 2330-2360 cm -1 was observed.However, the signals at 1300-1750 cm -1 were almost negligible.This finding suggested the activation of CO 2 over the Co 4 N was very weak. To further study the reaction processes of CO 2 reduction over the Co 4 N/NCs, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out.Interestingly, the O C O bond on the Co 4 N surface was in a linear configuration (Figure S17), suggesting that sole Co 4 N cannot effectively activate CO 2 .Whereas, the O C O bond on the Co 4 N/ NCs surface became a V-type configuration with a bond angle of 146.26.This suggested that the hybrid configuration was beneficial to the activation of CO 2 , agreeing with the DRIFTS results.Optimized geometric structures of various states along the reaction pathway were depicted in Figs.8c-e.The adsorption of CO 2 occurred on Co site and the CO 2 protonation lead to the formation of COOH and CO.The calculated G was summarized in Fig. 8b and Tables S3-S4.The G for the CO formation was -0.2 eV, suggesting the CO formation was thermodynamically favorable.While, the G for the COOH formation was 0.88 eV, signifying the formation of COOH was the rate-limiting step.In addition, it can be seen that the CO desorption was mildly endothermic, implying that the catalytic performance can be further promoted by encouraging CO desorption.The possible reaction"}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The reaction containing Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (12 mg), catalysts (10 g) and solvent acetonitrile/TEOA/H 2 O 3:1:2 (vol/vol), 6 mL was stirred and irradiated under a 300 W Xenon lamp (420 nm cut-off filter).", "context": "Firstly, ammonium hydroxide (1 mL, 25-28 ) was added into deionized water (125 mL) and stir well.Then, adenine (1 g) and Co (NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (25 mg) were dissolved in the above solution.Finally, the above solution was irradiated with a 125 W high pressure Hg lamp at 20 C.After 24 h irradiation, black Co 4 N/NCs p was obtained.The obtained Co 4 N/NCs was washed with ethanol and then dried at 60 C for 12 h to get the final catalysts.The Co 4 N sample was prepared according to previous study.14 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were analyzed by a JEOL JEM-2010 microscope.Raman spectra were recorded on a LABRAM-HR in plus laser Raman spectrometer (325 nm excitation).Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed with a Nicolet Magna-IR 550-II spectrometer.UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy was obtained by using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and XPS valance band analyses were carried out on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 XPS spectrometer.The carbon with a binding energy 284.8 eV was used to eliminate the charging effect.X-ray powder diffraction pattern was conducted on a D8 Advance Bruker X-ray diffractometer with Cu K radiation ( 0.15406 nm) operating at 40 kV.CO 2 adsorption was measured on Micromeritics ASAP2020 equipment (273 K).Elemental analysis was carried out on an elemental Analyzer (vario EL CUBE).The steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra were obtained on a Steady State and Time Resolved Fluorescence Spectrometers (FLSP920) at 298 K.The surface area and pore size of catalysts was measured by a Tristar-3000 analyzer at 77 K.The XAFS spectra were collected at the 1W1B station of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), China.The storage ring of BSRF was operated at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA.N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured on an Autosorb-iQ2 adsorptometer (Quantachrome, USA) at 77 K.

Electrochemical measurements were conducted in a three-electrode system (Pt sheet as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode).Typically, 8 mg catalysts and 15 L of Nafion solution (5 wt) were dispersed in 1 mL of water solution to form a homogeneous ink.Then, 20 L sample was loaded on to an ITO glass (1 cm 2 ).Linear sweep voltammetry was carried out in CO 2 -saturated 0.2 M NaHCO 3 solution (10 mV s -1 scan rate).For comparison, linear sweep voltammetry was also carried out in N 2 -saturated 0.2 M NaHCO 3 solution. Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments were conducted in an elevated-pressure cell using a Bruker TENSOR 27 FTIR spectrometer and a diffuse reflectance accessory (Harrick Scientific, DRP-PE9) with a reaction cell (Harrick Scientific, HVCDRP-3) at a wavenumber resolution of 4 cm -1 at 303 K.After flowing with 1 bar of Ar for 1 h, the background spectrum of the sample was acquired.Then, 1 bar of CO 2 and Ar was allowed to flow into the cell for 1.5 and 0.5 h, respectively.DRIFTS spectrum was obtained to detect the adsorbed CO 2 species on the sample. CO 2 temperature programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) was carried out on a Micromeritics Chemisorption Analyzer.Firstly, the 50 mg sample was heated at 300 C for 1 h under Ar atmosphere to remove impurities.Then, the sample was swept by CO 2 for 1 h when the temperature was lowered at 50 C.The gas was switched to Ar to remove the physisorbed CO 2 and un-adsorbed CO 2 molecules, until the baseline was flat.Finally, the temperature was heated to 350 C (10 C/min) to obtain the CO 2 -TPD result. The isotopic experiment was carried out by using high-pure 13 CO 2 .A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyze the generated 13 CO. CO 2 reduction reactions were performed using a closed reaction system.The reaction containing Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (12 mg), catalysts (10 g) and solvent acetonitrile/TEOA/H 2 O 3:1:2 (vol/vol), 6 mL was stirred and irradiated under a 300 W Xenon lamp (420 nm cut-off filter).The reactor was full of CO 2 to reach a pressure of 1 atm (80 mL in volume).The reaction temperature was maintained at 30 C.After illumination for 30 min, the produced gases were analyzed by an Agilent 7820A gas chromatograph (thermal conductivity detector; TD-01 packed column; oven temperature, 50 C; inlet temperature, 120 C; detector temperature, 200 C; Ar as the carrier gas). The QE for CO 2 reduction was measured by using monochromatic LED lamp with band pass filter of 450 nm.The irradiation area was 2 cm 2 .The light intensity was 11.5 mW cm -2 (ILT 950 spectroradiometer).The reaction contains Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (12 mg), catalysts (10 g), 1 mL TEOA and 5 mL solvent (3 mL acetonitrile and 2 mL H 2 O).The reactor was full of CO 2 to reach a pressure of 1 atm (80 mL in volume).The QE was calculated as AQY Ne/Np100 2 M NAhc/ SPt100 (M: the CO amount, NA: Avogadro constant, h: Planck constant, c: light speed, S: irradiation area, P: light intensity, t: reaction time, : the wavelength of light). DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Program (VASP) package.15 The projector-augmented wave method was used to create effective core potentials and plane waves for the core and valance electrons with a cutoff energy of 500 eV for the plane waves.16,17 The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchangecorrelation function was used.16 A vacuum layer of 15 A was added to avert the interaction between adjacent layers.A Monkhorst-Pack kpoint mesh of (3 31), an energy convergence of 5 10 -5 eV and a force convergence of 0.03 eV/A were employed for these calculations. Gibbs free energies for each gaseous and adsorbed species were calculated at 298.15 K, according to the expression: G E DFT E ZPE CpdT-TS (E DFT is the electronic energy calculated with VASP, E ZPE is the zero-point energy, CpdT is the enthalpic temperature correction, TS is the entropy contribution, C p dT is negligible and C p dT 0).The free energy changes (G) of each step can then be calculated via the difference of the free energies of products and reactants or simply with respect to the initial state of gaseous CO 2 and catalysts surface."}], "operation mode": []}}
