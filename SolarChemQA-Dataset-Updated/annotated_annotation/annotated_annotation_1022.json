90, 88.46.It was found that the experimental data is consistent with the simulated PXRD pattern using AA stacking mode (Rwp 4.30 and Rp 3.33), but not AB stacking (Rwp 42.9 and Rp 33.4).The strong and sharp peak at 2.65 is assigned to the diffraction of 110 plane, indicating a high crystalline of PD-COF-23 (Fig. 1a).The other diffraction peaks at 2.73, 5.30 and 7.98 correspond to 200, 220 and 330 planes, respectively.Similarly for PD-COF-23-Ni (Fig. 1b), the diffraction peaks at 2.64, 2.75, 5.28 and 7.92 are assigned to 110, 200, 220 and 330 planes, respectively.Both two as-prepared COFs showed high crystallinity from their PXRD patterns.S2).The three species of nitrogen in high resolution N 1s spectrum at 400.02 eV, 401 eV and 401.7 eV are ascribed to pyrrolic N, pyrrolic NH and imine CN in PD-COF-23, respectively (Figure S2b).In the N 1s spectrum of PD-COF-23-Ni (Figure S2c), the new peak at 401.9 eV is attributed to the N-Ni.Specifically, the banding energy of 856.7 eV and 874.7 eV are assigned to the Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 (Figure S2d) in PD-COF-23-Ni. 33,41 shown in Fig S3 (a-d), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were measured as 181 m 2 g -1 for PD-COF-23 and 196 m 2 g -1 for PD-COF-23-Ni, corresponding to two type of pore sizes at around 1.8 nm and from 4.1 nm to 4.2 nm, which arise from the channel of A-A stacking in the frameworks.The relatively lower BET surface areas indicate a low N 2 uptake for the two as-prepared COFs, which is attributed to the tight staking and side chains protruding into the pores.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals the high thermal stability of PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni with less than 5 weight loss in N 2 atmosphere up to 320 C and 380C, respectively (Figure S4).Obviously, the Ni(II) coordination in PD-COF-23-Ni effectively strengthens its skeleton with a higher thermal stability than PD-COF-23. 40,42 n addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that PD-COF-23 crystallizes in a block-like structure with sizes of 5-20 m (Fig. 2), while PD-COF-23-Ni exists as multilayer nanosheets.The self-assembly synthetic control, which was beneficial for increasing the layer planarity, rendered the frameworks at large domain size.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the two COFs were recorded with further magnification at nano-meter scale to explore the internal morphology of COFs (Figure S6).Due to the strong - stacking interactions between adjacent layers, the aggregated sheetlike structure with uniform porosity was observed for both COFs.Owing to the formation of overall conjugated frameworks by Schiff-base reaction, the absorption edge at around 743 and 727 nm in visible region were endowed for PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni respectively (Figure S7).Subsequently, their optical band gaps were determined by the Kubelka-Munk equation with values of 1.67 eV and 1.70 eV, respectively.Moreover, the photocurrent response of PD-COF-23-Ni was obviously higher than that of PD-COF-23, indicative of efficient photogenerated hole-electron pair separation and more available electrons on the surface of former (Fig. 3a). 43This result proves that PD-COF-23-Ni is a better photocatalyst than PD-COF-23. The visible light driven photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was investigated using PD-COF-23 or PD-COF-23-Ni as photocatalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as sacrificial electron donor.As shown in Fig. 3c, the photocatalytic CO evolution rate was 20.9 mol g -1 h -1 for PD-COF-23 and 40.0 mol g -1 h -1 for PD-COF-23-Ni in 25 h.The Ni (II) in PD-COF-23-Ni acts as catalytic center to fix the absorbed CO 2 molecules, leading to enhanced performance of CO 2 reduction.Cycle photocatalytic experiments for PD-COF-23-Ni was carried out using the catalyst recycled from the former reaction by centrifugation and drying process under vacuum.As shown in Fig. 3d, the photocatalytic CO evolution rate approached up to 38.8 mol g -1 h -1 in the second cycle and 35.3 mol g -1 h -1 in the third cycle within 3 hours.The result indicates a considerable stability of PD-COF-23-Ni under visible light irradiation.Moreover, the selectivity of CO 2 reduction into CO is as high as 99 with only trace amount of CH 4 detected for the systems of both COFs.In addition, no other by-products (H 2 , CH 3 OH, and HCOOH) were detected from the reactions.The control reaction was also carried out under only Ar atmosphere, and no CO was generated due to the absence of CO 2 .This means that CO generated in the photocatalytic systems comes from the CO 2 .At the same time, no CO evolution was detected when using water or trimethylamine as sacrificial electron donor.In addition, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for CO evolution was measured to be 0.036 for PD-COF-23 and 0.079 for PD-COF-23-Ni.It's known that the efficient charge separation and transfer play an important role in aqueous photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The conduction band (CB) edge of the photocatalysts should be more negative than the CO 2 reduction potential (CO/CO 2 , theoretically -0.53 V vs NHE, pH 7 and -4.37 eV vs Ev, vacuum level), and the valence band (VB) edge should be more positive than the redox potential of H 2 O (O 2 /H 2 O, theoretically 0.82 V vs NHE, pH 7 and -5.67 eV vs Ev).Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure S8) was used to determine the absolute positions of the conduction and valence Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to understand the photo-excitation process and catalytic reaction mechanisms.The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) mainly distributes along the electron donating TAPP fragment, while lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) locates on DPP segments.The sufficient electron density separation of HOMO and LUMO energy levels enable the electron transfer from TAPP to DPP fragments upon visible light irradiation (Fig. 4a).One possible reaction route was proposed for the photocatalytic reaction based on PD-COF-23-Ni.As shown in Fig. 4b, the TAPP-DPP repeating unit undergoes charge separation and electron transfer from TAPP to DPP, subsequently, CO 2 is then reduced into CO by the two electrons acuminated nearby DPP.Meanwhile, the TEOA regenerates TAPP-DPP.In another potential reaction route, the Ni(II)porphyrin unit acts as both an photosensitizer and a catalytic center. 44,45 ue to the insufficient conjugation between TAPP and DPP, the porphyrin fragments might work as an internal reductive quenching cycle, first absorb visible light to form the excited NiTAPP, then associate with TEOA to form MTAPP -, lastly, reduce CO 2 into CO at Ni(II) centers.In this case, TEOA plays an important role as the sacrificial electron donor to prevent the charge recombination on the porphyrin fragments and achieve a complete photocatalytic cycle.As a result, the Ni(II) incorporated PD-COF-23-Ni shows a higher activity than PD-COF-23 in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "PD-COF-23 and PDCOF-23-Ni", "source": "In summary, donor-acceptor 2D COFs of PD-COF-23 and PDCOF-23-Ni were successfully developed for visible light photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO with high selectivity.", "context": "In summary, donor-acceptor 2D COFs of PD-COF-23 and PDCOF-23-Ni were successfully developed for visible light photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO with high selectivity.Typically, PD-COF-23-Ni showed higher CO production efficiency of 40.0 mol g -1 h -1 than PD-COF-23 of 20.9 mol g -1 h -1 within an operation time of 25 h.Due to the donoracceptor structure configuration of the two COFs, the electron-hole pairs upon visible light irradiation were separated and transported from electron-donating TAPP or NiTAPP to electron deficient DPP for CO 2 reduction.On the other hand, NiTAPP can also reduce CO 2 reduction to CO at the Ni(II) centers through an internal reductive quenching cycle, in which NiTAPP acts as both photosensitizer and catalytic center.

The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for CO evolution was measured using monochromatic visible light (420 nm).And the AQE was calculated as follow equation:"}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "The visible light driven photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was investigated using PD-COF-23 or PD-COF-23-Ni as photocatalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as sacrificial electron donor.", "context": "Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) of the PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni were performed to determine the crystalline structure.The simulation of crystalline structure for PD-COF-23 were implemented using the software Materials Studio 7.0.Its unit cell parameters were calculated as a 47.31A, b 48.24A, c 3.73 A; 90, 88.46.It was found that the experimental data is consistent with the simulated PXRD pattern using AA stacking mode (Rwp 4.30 and Rp 3.33), but not AB stacking (Rwp 42.9 and Rp 33.4).The strong and sharp peak at 2.65 is assigned to the diffraction of 110 plane, indicating a high crystalline of PD-COF-23 (Fig. 1a).The other diffraction peaks at 2.73, 5.30 and 7.98 correspond to 200, 220 and 330 planes, respectively.Similarly for PD-COF-23-Ni (Fig. 1b), the diffraction peaks at 2.64, 2.75, 5.28 and 7.92 are assigned to 110, 200, 220 and 330 planes, respectively.Both two as-prepared COFs showed high crystallinity from their PXRD patterns.S2).The three species of nitrogen in high resolution N 1s spectrum at 400.02 eV, 401 eV and 401.7 eV are ascribed to pyrrolic N, pyrrolic NH and imine CN in PD-COF-23, respectively (Figure S2b).In the N 1s spectrum of PD-COF-23-Ni (Figure S2c), the new peak at 401.9 eV is attributed to the N-Ni.Specifically, the banding energy of 856.7 eV and 874.7 eV are assigned to the Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 (Figure S2d) in PD-COF-23-Ni. 33,41 shown in Fig S3 (a-d), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were measured as 181 m 2 g -1 for PD-COF-23 and 196 m 2 g -1 for PD-COF-23-Ni, corresponding to two type of pore sizes at around 1.8 nm and from 4.1 nm to 4.2 nm, which arise from the channel of A-A stacking in the frameworks.The relatively lower BET surface areas indicate a low N 2 uptake for the two as-prepared COFs, which is attributed to the tight staking and side chains protruding into the pores.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals the high thermal stability of PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni with less than 5 weight loss in N 2 atmosphere up to 320 C and 380C, respectively (Figure S4).Obviously, the Ni(II) coordination in PD-COF-23-Ni effectively strengthens its skeleton with a higher thermal stability than PD-COF-23. 40,42 n addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that PD-COF-23 crystallizes in a block-like structure with sizes of 5-20 m (Fig. 2), while PD-COF-23-Ni exists as multilayer nanosheets.The self-assembly synthetic control, which was beneficial for increasing the layer planarity, rendered the frameworks at large domain size.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the two COFs were recorded with further magnification at nano-meter scale to explore the internal morphology of COFs (Figure S6).Due to the strong - stacking interactions between adjacent layers, the aggregated sheetlike structure with uniform porosity was observed for both COFs.Owing to the formation of overall conjugated frameworks by Schiff-base reaction, the absorption edge at around 743 and 727 nm in visible region were endowed for PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni respectively (Figure S7).Subsequently, their optical band gaps were determined by the Kubelka-Munk equation with values of 1.67 eV and 1.70 eV, respectively.Moreover, the photocurrent response of PD-COF-23-Ni was obviously higher than that of PD-COF-23, indicative of efficient photogenerated hole-electron pair separation and more available electrons on the surface of former (Fig. 3a). 43This result proves that PD-COF-23-Ni is a better photocatalyst than PD-COF-23. The visible light driven photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was investigated using PD-COF-23 or PD-COF-23-Ni as photocatalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as sacrificial electron donor.As shown in Fig. 3c, the photocatalytic CO evolution rate was 20.9 mol g -1 h -1 for PD-COF-23 and 40.0 mol g -1 h -1 for PD-COF-23-Ni in 25 h.The Ni (II) in PD-COF-23-Ni acts as catalytic center to fix the absorbed CO 2 molecules, leading to enhanced performance of CO 2 reduction.Cycle photocatalytic experiments for PD-COF-23-Ni was carried out using the catalyst recycled from the former reaction by centrifugation and drying process under vacuum.As shown in Fig. 3d, the photocatalytic CO evolution rate approached up to 38.8 mol g -1 h -1 in the second cycle and 35.3 mol g -1 h -1 in the third cycle within 3 hours.The result indicates a considerable stability of PD-COF-23-Ni under visible light irradiation.Moreover, the selectivity of CO 2 reduction into CO is as high as 99 with only trace amount of CH 4 detected for the systems of both COFs.In addition, no other by-products (H 2 , CH 3 OH, and HCOOH) were detected from the reactions.The control reaction was also carried out under only Ar atmosphere, and no CO was generated due to the absence of CO 2 .This means that CO generated in the photocatalytic systems comes from the CO 2 .At the same time, no CO evolution was detected when using water or trimethylamine as sacrificial electron donor.In addition, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for CO evolution was measured to be 0.036 for PD-COF-23 and 0.079 for PD-COF-23-Ni.It's known that the efficient charge separation and transfer play an important role in aqueous photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The conduction band (CB) edge of the photocatalysts should be more negative than the CO 2 reduction potential (CO/CO 2 , theoretically -0.53 V vs NHE, pH 7 and -4.37 eV vs Ev, vacuum level), and the valence band (VB) edge should be more positive than the redox potential of H 2 O (O 2 /H 2 O, theoretically 0.82 V vs NHE, pH 7 and -5.67 eV vs Ev).Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure S8) was used to determine the absolute positions of the conduction and valence Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to understand the photo-excitation process and catalytic reaction mechanisms.The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) mainly distributes along the electron donating TAPP fragment, while lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) locates on DPP segments.The sufficient electron density separation of HOMO and LUMO energy levels enable the electron transfer from TAPP to DPP fragments upon visible light irradiation (Fig. 4a).One possible reaction route was proposed for the photocatalytic reaction based on PD-COF-23-Ni.As shown in Fig. 4b, the TAPP-DPP repeating unit undergoes charge separation and electron transfer from TAPP to DPP, subsequently, CO 2 is then reduced into CO by the two electrons acuminated nearby DPP.Meanwhile, the TEOA regenerates TAPP-DPP.In another potential reaction route, the Ni(II)porphyrin unit acts as both an photosensitizer and a catalytic center. 44,45 ue to the insufficient conjugation between TAPP and DPP, the porphyrin fragments might work as an internal reductive quenching cycle, first absorb visible light to form the excited NiTAPP, then associate with TEOA to form MTAPP -, lastly, reduce CO 2 into CO at Ni(II) centers.In this case, TEOA plays an important role as the sacrificial electron donor to prevent the charge recombination on the porphyrin fragments and achieve a complete photocatalytic cycle.As a result, the Ni(II) incorporated PD-COF-23-Ni shows a higher activity than PD-COF-23 in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction."}, {"llm generation": "visible light", "source": "In summary, donor-acceptor 2D COFs of PD-COF-23 and PDCOF-23-Ni were successfully developed for visible light photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO with high selectivity.", "context": "In summary, donor-acceptor 2D COFs of PD-COF-23 and PDCOF-23-Ni were successfully developed for visible light photocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO with high selectivity.Typically, PD-COF-23-Ni showed higher CO production efficiency of 40.0 mol g -1 h -1 than PD-COF-23 of 20.9 mol g -1 h -1 within an operation time of 25 h.Due to the donoracceptor structure configuration of the two COFs, the electron-hole pairs upon visible light irradiation were separated and transported from electron-donating TAPP or NiTAPP to electron deficient DPP for CO 2 reduction.On the other hand, NiTAPP can also reduce CO 2 reduction to CO at the Ni(II) centers through an internal reductive quenching cycle, in which NiTAPP acts as both photosensitizer and catalytic center.

The visible light driven photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was investigated using PD-COF-23 or PD-COF-23-Ni as photocatalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as sacrificial electron donor.As shown in Fig. 3c, the photocatalytic CO evolution rate was 20.9 mol g -1 h -1 for PD-COF-23 and 40.0 mol g -1 h -1 for PD-COF-23-Ni in 25 h.The Ni (II) in PD-COF-23-Ni acts as catalytic center to fix the absorbed CO 2 molecules, leading to enhanced performance of CO 2 reduction.Cycle photocatalytic experiments for PD-COF-23-Ni was carried out using the catalyst recycled from the former reaction by centrifugation and drying process under vacuum.As shown in Fig. 3d, the photocatalytic CO evolution rate approached up to 38.8 mol g -1 h -1 in the second cycle and 35.3 mol g -1 h -1 in the third cycle within 3 hours.The result indicates a considerable stability of PD-COF-23-Ni under visible light irradiation.Moreover, the selectivity of CO 2 reduction into CO is as high as 99 with only trace amount of CH 4 detected for the systems of both COFs.In addition, no other by-products (H 2 , CH 3 OH, and HCOOH) were detected from the reactions.The control reaction was also carried out under only Ar atmosphere, and no CO was generated due to the absence of CO 2 .This means that CO generated in the photocatalytic systems comes from the CO 2 .At the same time, no CO evolution was detected when using water or trimethylamine as sacrificial electron donor.In addition, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for CO evolution was measured to be 0.036 for PD-COF-23 and 0.079 for PD-COF-23-Ni.It's known that the efficient charge separation and transfer play an important role in aqueous photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.The conduction band (CB) edge of the photocatalysts should be more negative than the CO 2 reduction potential (CO/CO 2 , theoretically -0.53 V vs NHE, pH 7 and -4.37 eV vs Ev, vacuum level), and the valence band (VB) edge should be more positive than the redox potential of H 2 O (O 2 /H 2 O, theoretically 0.82 V vs NHE, pH 7 and -5.67 eV vs Ev).Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure S8) was used to determine the absolute positions of the conduction and valence Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to understand the photo-excitation process and catalytic reaction mechanisms.The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) mainly distributes along the electron donating TAPP fragment, while lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) locates on DPP segments.The sufficient electron density separation of HOMO and LUMO energy levels enable the electron transfer from TAPP to DPP fragments upon visible light irradiation (Fig. 4a).One possible reaction route was proposed for the photocatalytic reaction based on PD-COF-23-Ni.As shown in Fig. 4b, the TAPP-DPP repeating unit undergoes charge separation and electron transfer from TAPP to DPP, subsequently, CO 2 is then reduced into CO by the two electrons acuminated nearby DPP.Meanwhile, the TEOA regenerates TAPP-DPP.In another potential reaction route, the Ni(II)porphyrin unit acts as both an photosensitizer and a catalytic center. 44,45 ue to the insufficient conjugation between TAPP and DPP, the porphyrin fragments might work as an internal reductive quenching cycle, first absorb visible light to form the excited NiTAPP, then associate with TEOA to form MTAPP -, lastly, reduce CO 2 into CO at Ni(II) centers.In this case, TEOA plays an important role as the sacrificial electron donor to prevent the charge recombination on the porphyrin fragments and achieve a complete photocatalytic cycle.As a result, the Ni(II) incorporated PD-COF-23-Ni shows a higher activity than PD-COF-23 in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction."}], "reactor type": [{"llm generation": "Slurry", "source": "The ITO slide was dip-coated with 0.55 mL of slurry, which was obtained from the mixture of photocatalyst (1 mg), ethanol (0.5 mL) and Nafion solution (0.05 mL, 5 w/w in water and 1propanol) under sonication for 30 min.", "context": "In a pyrex tube, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPP) (6.7 mg, 0.01 mmol) and DPP-CHO (9.1 mg, 0.02 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of 3 mL of n-butanol and 1 mL of mesitylene.Then, 0.1 ml of aqueous acetic (6 M) was added.
