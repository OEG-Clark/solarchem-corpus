Diffuse reflectance spectra of the obtained materials have been measured, band gap energies were determined from Tauc plots 42: 3.47 eV (ZnS-A), 3.57 eV (RuZnS-A), 3.64 eV (ZnS-B), 3.65 eV (RuZnS-B).Modification of the materials with ruthenium does not influence the electronic band structure significantly.Differences in band gap energies between ZnS-A and ZnS-B can be explained by differences in particle sizes (vide infra), defects, impurities and disorders in crystal structures which may lead to the formation of additional states within the band gap 43. Analysis of the chemical composition of photocatalysts was carried out by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).XRD analysis, shown in Fig. 1, proves the zinc blende structure (sphalerite) of both ZnS-A and ZnS-B materials (JCPDS No. 05-0566) 44.Particle sizes calculated from XRD measurements (using the Scherrer's equation) are equal to 3.3 and 20.6 nm for ZnS-A and ZnS-B, respectively, as calculated basing on the most intense peak 2 28 .Dynamic light scattering measurements allow to classify ZnS-B as the material composed of bigger aggregates (ca.350 nm) when compared to particles of ZnS-A (ca.300 nm), in accordance with previously reported data 37.Ruthenium deposition results in bigger aggregates formation: 350 and 460 nm for RuZnS-A and RuZnS-B, respectively.Deposition of ruthenium particles increases the average size of nanoparticles by about 0.6 nm.Energy dispersive X-ray analysis confirmed the presence of ruthenium particles on ZnS surface based on 2.56 and 19.27 keV signals (data presented elsewhere 37). The specific surface areas of the synthesized photocatalysts are relatively high in the case of ZnS-A materials (105 and 78 m 2 g -1 for ZnS-A and RuZnS-A, respectively) and ca.twice lower for ZnS-B (56 and 55 m 2 g -1 for ZnS-B and RuZnS-B, respectively).The specific surface areas of ZnS samples loaded with ruthenium is reduced comparing with starting materials.This decrease can be attributed to a stronger aggregation of nanoparticles observed upon deposition of ruthenium (vide supra) and to blocking of some pores, particularly in the case of ZnS-A. The results of spectroelectrochemical measurements are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1.Changes of current and reflectance upon swept potential allow to determine potentials of conduction band edge and electronic states lying beneath 41.The potential at which electrons start to be trapped (E ON ) may be determined from R(E) plot.E ON describes the material ability to accept electrons into the conduction band.The potentials of conduction band edges vary for the studied materials between -2.3 and -2.6 V vs. SHE, reaching higher values in the case of samples decorated with ruthenium (E ON values in Table 1 and Fig. 2).ZnS-A materials offer slightly better reducing properties when compared to ZnS-B.Beside the main reduction potential all materials can accept electrons in intrabandgap electronic states, as depicted in Fig. 2. The intra-bandgap states are localized within a broad range of -1.0 to -2.4 V vs. SHE.The deeper electronic states are less influenced by the presence Electronic states values for the studied materials with respect to an SHE electrode. EON, V vs. SHE (0.1 V) Other electronic states, V vs. ZnS-A -2.6 -1.9; -1.0 RuZnS-A -2.5 -1.8; -1.0 ZnS-B -2.5 -2.4; -1.0 RuZnS-B -2.3 -1.6 of ruthenium than those localized closer to the conduction band (compare ZnS-A and RuZnS-A).Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the photocatalysts.The materials are composed of irregular aggregates (0.2-2.0 m) of smaller nanoparticles. The activity of materials has been tested in photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide.Irradiation of the suspensions of prepared materials saturated with carbon dioxide resulted in the reduction of CO 2 to formic acid, carbon monoxide and methane, as demonstrated by GC and 1 H NMR analyses.Fig. 4 summarizes the results obtained after 5 h of irradiation in the presence of neat ZnS-A and ZnS-B, as well as the materials modified with ruthenium, showing also the amounts of formed hydrogen.Formic acid (in liquid) and carbon monoxide (in gas phase) were the main products of CO 2 reduction in the case of both, modified and unmodified photocatalysts.Small quantities of methane have been also detected in the gas phase above the reaction mixture.Noteworthy, the selectivity of the formate production at ZnS-A is very high.Additionally, formation of acetone, as the product of electron donor (2-propanol) oxidation, and hydrogen, was observed.Neither oxalic acid nor oxalate has been found basing on 13 C NMR analyses.The reaction did not proceed in systems lacking any of the following components: the photocatalyst, light or carbon dioxide (instead of saturation with CO 2 , the mixture was saturated with argon).The lack of any reduction products in the case of the reference tests performed in the absence of carbon dioxide, but in the presence of all other components, including photocatalysts and isopropanol, points at CO 2 as the source of products.Therefore the possibility of isopropanol oxidation to C 1 compounds can be ruled out.The amount of produced hydrogen is low in comparison with other products for all tested materials.Moreover, materials modified with ruthenium showed even lower (or negligible) activity towards H 2 formation when compared to the neat photocatalysts.Commercially available titanium dioxide (P25, Evonik) shows a negligible activity under the same reaction conditions.The amounts of products were below the limit of quantification. The calculated apparent quantum yields of CO 2 conversion to formic acid at 375 nm in the presence of the most efficient photocatalyst (RuZnS-A) is equal to 0.50 (0.05).The apparent quantum yield is often used to characterize heterogeneous photosystems, where determination of the number of absorbed photons is difficult or impossible.Calculations of apparent quantum yields are based assuming absorption of all incident light 45.Since this assumption overestimates the number of absorbed photons, the real quantum yield is higher than the measured apparent quantum yield. Materials modified with ruthenium (RuZnS-A and RuZnS-B) appeared more efficient in the process of CO 2 reduction than neat materials (ZnS-A and ZnS-B) under identical reaction conditions.In their presence the higher production of both main products, carbon monoxide and formic acid, was observed.A positive influence of ruthenium modifier may originate from: (i) a catalytic effect (lowering the CO 2 activation energy); (ii) collection of electrons at Ru particles resulting in a better charge separation (increased lifetimes of photogenerated charges) and improved multielectron reduction process; (iii) a significantly better adsorption of CO 2 at the surface of modified materials, as confirmed experimentally elsewhere 37.Materials with deposited ruthenium appear also more selective towards formic acid formation.Production of HCOOH is particularly efficient within the first hour of irradiation (Fig. 5).This observation may be explained by poisoning of the catalyst, oxidation of ruthenium or detaching the ruthenium nanoparticles from the surface of ZnS.In the case of reaction at RuZnS-B (right graph in Fig. 5) the formation of carbon monoxide during the first hour of irradiation is higher than in the case of reaction photocatalyzed by neat The effect of various solvents on photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was tested using neat ZnS-B photocatalyst (Fig. 7).In water (high polarity solvent) only traces of CO were formed, while formic acid is the dominating product.In the case of chloroform (low polarity solvent) the overall efficiency of CO 2 reduction is much lower, however the CO formation yield is higher than in water.It is worth to emphasize that water reveals to be a better H-transfer agent than isopropanol (cf.Fig. 4) with a HCOOH yield some three-four times higher with the same photocatalyst.Such behavior is not usual. As recently proven by EPR spin-trapping experiments, CO 2 -is photogenerated in the presence of both ZnS and RuZnS materials 37.Differences in relative efficiencies of HCOO -and CO formation in various solvents can be explained by generation of CO 2 -and its successive reduction with the second electron.In low polarity solvents the formed carbon dioxide anion radical can be strongly adsorbed at the surface of photocatalyst due to a poor solvation 46.Upon double protonation and the second reduction step CO and H 2 O are formed.In polar solvents another mechanism prevails -CO 2 -is stabilized by solvent molecules which, upon protonation and further reduction-protonation, is transformed to formic acid (Fig. 8).Interestingly, both reduction processes are formally \"2e - 2H \" transfer to CO 2 , however, the polarity of the reaction medium drives the reaction towards one of the reactions."}], "light source": [{"llm generation": "Monochromatic (375 nm)", "source": "The calculated apparent quantum yields of CO 2 conversion to formic acid at 375 nm in the presence of the most efficient photocatalyst (RuZnS-A) is equal to 0.50 (0.05).", "context": "ZnS-A and ZnS-B were synthesized according to literature recipes starting from zinc sulfate and sodium sulfide (ZnS-A) or freshly prepared zinc hydroxide and thiourea (ZnS-B) by a hydrothermal route.Metallic ruthenium nanoparticles were deposited at both materials through the impregnation of ZnS powders with ruthenium(III) chloride, followed by its reduction with NaBH 4 .Since no ruthenium could be detected in the solution after the catalyst centrifugation, almost quantitative deposition of ruthenium at zinc sulfide samples was assumed.Therefore the resulting materials contained 1 (wt.) of ruthenium.

UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of photocatalysts were recorded using UV-3600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) equipped with an integrating sphere.Powder samples were ground with BaSO 4 (1:50 wt.ratio).Barium sulfate was used as a reference.Prepared materials were analyzed on the X-ray powder diffractometer (MiniFlex 600, Rigaku) operated at 40 kV voltage.Energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) were recorded on EDX-720 (Shimadzu) spectrometer operated at 5 kV voltage.Scanning electron microscope (Vega 3 LM, Tescan), equipped with an LaB 6 cathode and EDS detector (10 mm 2 x-act SDD detector, Oxford Instruments), was operated at a voltage of 30 kV.

Analysis of the chemical composition of photocatalysts was carried out by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).XRD analysis, shown in Fig. 1, proves the zinc blende structure (sphalerite) of both ZnS-A and ZnS-B materials (JCPDS No. 05-0566) 44.Particle sizes calculated from XRD measurements (using the Scherrer's equation) are equal to 3.3 and 20.6 nm for ZnS-A and ZnS-B, respectively, as calculated basing on the most intense peak 2 28 .Dynamic light scattering measurements allow to classify ZnS-B as the material composed of bigger aggregates (ca.350 nm) when compared to particles of ZnS-A (ca.300 nm), in accordance with previously reported data 37.Ruthenium deposition results in bigger aggregates formation: 350 and 460 nm for RuZnS-A and RuZnS-B, respectively.Deposition of ruthenium particles increases the average size of nanoparticles by about 0.6 nm.Energy dispersive X-ray analysis confirmed the presence of ruthenium particles on ZnS surface based on 2.56 and 19.27 keV signals (data presented elsewhere 37). The specific surface areas of the synthesized photocatalysts are relatively high in the case of ZnS-A materials (105 and 78 m 2 g -1 for ZnS-A and RuZnS-A, respectively) and ca.twice lower for ZnS-B (56 and 55 m 2 g -1 for ZnS-B and RuZnS-B, respectively).The specific surface areas of ZnS samples loaded with ruthenium is reduced comparing with starting materials.This decrease can be attributed to a stronger aggregation of nanoparticles observed upon deposition of ruthenium (vide supra) and to blocking of some pores, particularly in the case of ZnS-A. The results of spectroelectrochemical measurements are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1.Changes of current and reflectance upon swept potential allow to determine potentials of conduction band edge and electronic states lying beneath 41.The potential at which electrons start to be trapped (E ON ) may be determined from R(E) plot.E ON describes the material ability to accept electrons into the conduction band.The potentials of conduction band edges vary for the studied materials between -2.3 and -2.6 V vs. SHE, reaching higher values in the case of samples decorated with ruthenium (E ON values in Table 1 and Fig. 2).ZnS-A materials offer slightly better reducing properties when compared to ZnS-B.Beside the main reduction potential all materials can accept electrons in intrabandgap electronic states, as depicted in Fig. 2. The intra-bandgap states are localized within a broad range of -1.0 to -2.4 V vs. SHE.The deeper electronic states are less influenced by the presence Electronic states values for the studied materials with respect to an SHE electrode. EON, V vs. SHE (0.1 V) Other electronic states, V vs. ZnS-A -2.6 -1.9; -1.0 RuZnS-A -2.5 -1.8; -1.0 ZnS-B -2.5 -2.4; -1.0 RuZnS-B -2.3 -1.6 of ruthenium than those localized closer to the conduction band (compare ZnS-A and RuZnS-A).Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the photocatalysts.The materials are composed of irregular aggregates (0.2-2.0 m) of smaller nanoparticles. The activity of materials has been tested in photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide.Irradiation of the suspensions of prepared materials saturated with carbon dioxide resulted in the reduction of CO 2 to formic acid, carbon monoxide and methane, as demonstrated by GC and 1 H NMR analyses.Fig. 4 summarizes the results obtained after 5 h of irradiation in the presence of neat ZnS-A and ZnS-B, as well as the materials modified with ruthenium, showing also the amounts of formed hydrogen.Formic acid (in liquid) and carbon monoxide (in gas phase) were the main products of CO 2 reduction in the case of both, modified and unmodified photocatalysts.Small quantities of methane have been also detected in the gas phase above the reaction mixture.Noteworthy, the selectivity of the formate production at ZnS-A is very high.Additionally, formation of acetone, as the product of electron donor (2-propanol) oxidation, and hydrogen, was observed.Neither oxalic acid nor oxalate has been found basing on 13 C NMR analyses.The reaction did not proceed in systems lacking any of the following components: the photocatalyst, light or carbon dioxide (instead of saturation with CO 2 , the mixture was saturated with argon).The lack of any reduction products in the case of the reference tests performed in the absence of carbon dioxide, but in the presence of all other components, including photocatalysts and isopropanol, points at CO 2 as the source of products.Therefore the possibility of isopropanol oxidation to C 1 compounds can be ruled out.The amount of produced hydrogen is low in comparison with other products for all tested materials.Moreover, materials modified with ruthenium showed even lower (or negligible) activity towards H 2 formation when compared to the neat photocatalysts.Commercially available titanium dioxide (P25, Evonik) shows a negligible activity under the same reaction conditions.The amounts of products were below the limit of quantification. The calculated apparent quantum yields of CO 2 conversion to formic acid at 375 nm in the presence of the most efficient photocatalyst (RuZnS-A) is equal to 0.50 (0.05).The apparent quantum yield is often used to characterize heterogeneous photosystems, where determination of the number of absorbed photons is difficult or impossible.Calculations of apparent quantum yields are based assuming absorption of all incident light 45.Since this assumption overestimates the number of absorbed photons, the real quantum yield is higher than the measured apparent quantum yield. Materials modified with ruthenium (RuZnS-A and RuZnS-B) appeared more efficient in the process of CO 2 reduction than neat materials (ZnS-A and ZnS-B) under identical reaction conditions.In their presence the higher production of both main products, carbon monoxide and formic acid, was observed.A positive influence of ruthenium modifier may originate from: (i) a catalytic effect (lowering the CO 2 activation energy); (ii) collection of electrons at Ru particles resulting in a better charge separation (increased lifetimes of photogenerated charges) and improved multielectron reduction process; (iii) a significantly better adsorption of CO 2 at the surface of modified materials, as confirmed experimentally elsewhere 37.Materials with deposited ruthenium appear also more selective towards formic acid formation.Production of HCOOH is particularly efficient within the first hour of irradiation (Fig. 5).This observation may be explained by poisoning of the catalyst, oxidation of ruthenium or detaching the ruthenium nanoparticles from the surface of ZnS.In the case of reaction at RuZnS-B (right graph in Fig. 5) the formation of carbon monoxide during the first hour of irradiation is higher than in the case of reaction photocatalyzed by neat The effect of various solvents on photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was tested using neat ZnS-B photocatalyst (Fig. 7).In water (high polarity solvent) only traces of CO were formed, while formic acid is the dominating product.In the case of chloroform (low polarity solvent) the overall efficiency of CO 2 reduction is much lower, however the CO formation yield is higher than in water.It is worth to emphasize that water reveals to be a better H-transfer agent than isopropanol (cf.Fig. 4) with a HCOOH yield some three-four times higher with the same photocatalyst.Such behavior is not usual. As recently proven by EPR spin-trapping experiments, CO 2 -is photogenerated in the presence of both ZnS and RuZnS materials 37.Differences in relative efficiencies of HCOO -and CO formation in various solvents can be explained by generation of CO 2 -and its successive reduction with the second electron.In low polarity solvents the formed carbon dioxide anion radical can be strongly adsorbed at the surface of photocatalyst due to a poor solvation 46.Upon double protonation and the second reduction step CO and H 2 O are formed.In polar solvents another mechanism prevails -CO 2 -is stabilized by solvent molecules which, upon protonation and further reduction-protonation, is transformed to formic acid (Fig. 8).Interestingly, both reduction processes are formally \"2e - 2H \" transfer to CO 2 , however, the polarity of the reaction medium drives the reaction towards one of the reactions."}], "operation mode": []}}
