the crystal structures of the samples.Fig. 2 shows that all the diffraction peak positions of pure SnNb2O6 point to monoclinic SnNb2O6 (JCPDS No. 23-0592).With an increase in the CdSe0.8S0.2-DETAcontent, the diffraction peak corresponding to 28.77 increased, and all the diffraction peaks of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and SnNb2O6 can be observed in the composite sample.These characteristic peaks can be seen in the composite sample, and the characteristic peak intensity of CdSe0.8S0.The morphology, structure, and composition of the samples were observed by using field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and EDS.Fig. 3 The surface elemental composition and chemical state of pure CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA,SnNb2O6, and 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 were studied by XPS.Fig. 4(a) shows the XPS spectra of the samples.The XPS survey spectrum of the 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6composite material confirms the presence of C, N, Cd, S, Se, Sn, Nb, and O.Among them, the C peak was detected in all samples.However, the C peaks of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 were significantly stronger than those of SnNb2O6.The C and N peaks of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 are due to the formation of ammonium molecules from DETA and their incorporation into CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA35.However, the C peak of SnNb2O6 may have been caused by impurities absorbed by the conductive adhesive during the test.Fig. 4(b) shows the XPS spectra of SnNb2O6 and 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6O 1s composites, and the binding energies correspond to 529.24 and 529.38 eV, respectively.The binding energies increased by 0.14 eV, and the electrons flowed out from SnNb2O6 63.Fig. 4(c) shows the XPS spectra of SnNb2O6 and the 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6Nb 3d composite material.The binding energies of Nb 3d5/2 are 206.11and 206.31 eV, respectively, and the binding energies of Nb 3d3/2 are 208.88 and 209.08 eV, respectively.By comparing the binding energy of Nb 3d in pure SnNb2O6 and 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6, it can be seen that the binding energy of Nb 3d in 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 is 0.3 eV higher than that in SnNb2O6.The energy difference between the two peaks of Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 is 2.77 eV, and Nb exists as Nb 5 64.Fig. 4(d) shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Sn 3d electrons.The peaks at 482.29 and 493.68 eV and at 485.47 and 493.87 eV are, respectively, assigned to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 of pure SnNb2O6 and 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6samples 65.A comparison of the binding energies of O 1s, Nb 3d, and Sn 3d in pure SnNb2O6 with those in 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 shows that the binding energies of O 1s, Nb 3d, and Sn 3d in 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6increased.The results indicate that the electron density around SnNb2O6 decreases and that the electrons flow to CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA.Fig. 4(e) shows that the Se 3d XPS spectrum of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA is divided into two peaks, at 53.00 and 53.82 eV, corresponding to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA.Se 3d in the composite material is also divided into two peaks, at 52.72 and 53.54 eV, corresponding to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, of 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6.A comparison of the binding energy of Se 3d in pure CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA with that in 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6shows that the binding energy of Se 3d in CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA is higher, which indicates that the binding energy of Se 3d in 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6decreased, the electron density around the composite increased, and electrons flowed into CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA.Fig. 4(f) shows that S 2p is divided into S 2p3/2 and S p1/2, whose peaks at 159.09 and 160.06 eV, respectively, correspond to S 2p3/2 and S p1/2 of pure CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA.The binding energy of S 2p in the composites also decreases 66.The spectra in Fig. 4(g) for Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 with a binding energy difference of 6.73 eV further prove that Cd exists as Cd 2 22. According to the above data, the electron density around SnNb2O6 decreased, while that around CdSe0.8S0.2-DETAincreased.This is caused by the migration of electrons between two different EF semiconductors, which is conducive to the formation of an internal electric field at the contact 17,67.These two materials form a stepped heterostructure, which is conducive to electron transfer.increase of visible-light utilization, more electron-hole pairs are generated, which is beneficial to photocatalytic activity.Fig. 5(b) shows the band gaps of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and SnNb2O6, which are 1.71 and 2.52 eV, respectively.The band gap of a semiconductor is calculated by using the following formula 35,62: (1) where h, Eg, n, A, and are the light energy, band-gap energy, different transition type of semiconductor, a constant value, and the absorption index, respectively.The n values of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and SnNb2O6 were 1 and 4, respectively.Fig. 5(c) clearly shows the valence band XPS spectrum.The valence band positions of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and SnNb2O6 are 0.46 and 1.40 eV, respectively 33,35,61.The conduction band was calculated by using the following formula: Therefore, the conduction band positions of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and SnNb2O6 are -1.25 and -1.12 eV, respectively. Fig. 6(a) shows the photocurrent response of 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 with a sharp jump under the condition of intermittent light at an interval of 50 s.Compared with the photocurrent of the pure sample (SnNb2O6 and CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA), that of the composite sample has been greatly enhanced.At the same time, the figure shows that the composited sample produces more active photogenerated electrons and participates in the reduction reaction to improve photocatalytic efficiency 65.Similarly, under the same illumination time, 30 of the composite still maintains a high photocurrent response.Tests have proved that 30 of the composite samples have very good photosensitivity.Fig. 6(b) clearly revealed the electrochemical impedance.The arc radius of 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 is smaller than that of the pure sample, which indicates that the interface resistance of the composite sample is lower than that of other samples, and the charge transfer speed is faster.It also means that 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 has a greater probability of separating electron-hole pairs. To verify the superiority of using the 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6nanocomposite, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction was tested under the same conditions.Fig. 7(a) shows the photocatalytic performances of the samples with different proportions.Among CdSexS1-x, CdSe0.8S0.2 exhibited the best performance.The photocatalytic performance was adjusted by changing the CdSe0.8S0.2-DETAcontent.With the increase in CdSe0.8S0.2-DETAcontent, the reduction rate of CO2 increased.Clearly, the reduction rate of the composite sample is higher than that of pure SnNb2O6, and CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and reached its highest value when CdSe0.8S0.2-DETAaccounted for 30.The CO production rate of 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6heterostructure was 17.31 molg -1 h -1 , which is a factor of 4.8 greater than that of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA(3.6 molg -1 h -1 ) and a factor of 2.8 greater than that of SnNb2O6 (6.2 molg -1 h -1 ).The above data demonstrate that the structure of the heterojunction improves photocatalytic performance.Because 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6constitutes a stepped heterostructure, the electrons and holes are separated in space.Electrons are concentrated in the conduction band of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA, and holes are concentrated in the valence band of SnNb2O6, which retains a high redox potential and strong visible-light absorption capacity.Therefore, the photocatalytic performance of the composite samples was improved.To determine the photocatalytic stability of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA,SnNb2O6, and 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6, the performance of the four cycles is plotted in Fig. 7(b).After each CO2 reduction reaction, the photocatalyst was collected, and the reaction mixture was added again.In these four cycles, the photocorrosion of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA was more severe, and the stability of SnNb2O6 was better, but its performance was poor.Moreover, 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6exhibited good stability and photocatalytic performance.Fig. 7(c) clearly shows the photocatalytic performance under different reaction conditions.The first is under normal reaction conditions, the second is with replacement of CO2 with N2, and no CO production is detected.This proves that CO was converted from CO2.Third, there is no 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6, and no CO production was detected, indicating that 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 is an active photocatalyst for the reaction 69.The fourth is that, under dark conditions, the generation of CO is also not detected, which indicates that a light source is needed to excite semiconductor materials.In Fig. 7(d Electrons absorb photon energy and transition from the valence band to the conduction band.Owing to the narrow band gap of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA, the generated photogenerated carriers recombine rapidly inside the semiconductor.Therefore, we propose a possible electron transfer scheme (S-scheme) 67.Fig. 8(b) shows the semiconductor material after contact.CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA was grown in situ on SnNb2O6, forming a heterojunction in close contact.Electrons will spontaneously transfer from CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA to SnNb2O6, and, through their interface, the Fermi levels of the two semiconductor materials will reach equilibrium 20,70.The conduction band of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETAlost electrons, causing the band edge to bend upward.The conduction band of SnNb2O6 bent downward owing to the accumulation of electrons.An internal electric field was generated at the interface 20,65.Owing to the internal electric field and Coulomb force, the holes in the valence band of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and the electrons in the conduction band of SnNb2O6 are easily recombined in the internal electric field 31.The electrons in the conduction band of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and the holes in the valence band of SnNb2O6 are separated in space 24. This separation suppresses the recombination of the photogenerated carriers inside the semiconductor.The semiconductor retains a high redox potential (through the conduction band of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and the valence band of SnNb2O6).These are conducive to the progress of photocatalytic reactions.As shown in Fig. 4, the binding energy of each element of the XPS changes.The binding energies of Cd, Se, and S decreased and the surrounding electron density increased, while the binding energies of Sn, Nb, and O increased, and the surrounding electron density decreased.It was also proved that the transfer path of electrons from SnNb2O6 to CdSe0.8S0.2-DETAfollows the path of the S-scheme heterojunction mechanism 24."}, {"llm generation": "1D/2D CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 composite", "source": "This is because the S-scheme heterojunction retains strong redox ability, inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs, and effectively separates and transfers electrons, thus enhancing the photocatalytic performance of 1D/2D CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6composites.", "context": "I n c o n c l u s i o n , a n S -s c h e m e 1 D / 2 D CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6composite was prepared by solvothermal in situ growth of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA on SnNb2O6 nanosheets.The changes in the XPS electron density and binding energy demonstrate that the electron transfer pathway in the 1D/2D CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6heterojunction occurs via the S-scheme.The experimental results show that the CO production rate of the 1D/2D CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6composite was factors of 4.8 and 2.8 higher than that of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and SnNb2O6, respectively.This is because the S-scheme heterojunction retains strong redox ability, inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs, and effectively separates and transfers electrons, thus enhancing the photocatalytic performance of 1D/2D CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6composites.In this study, a 1D/2D CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6S-scheme heterostructure was developed and a new way to structure CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA was explored.S-scheme heterostructure materials were used to enhance the conversion of sunlight.

samples.However, the C peaks of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 were significantly stronger than those of SnNb2O6.The C and N peaks of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 are due to the formation of ammonium molecules from DETA and their incorporation into CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA35.However, the C peak of SnNb2O6 may have been caused by impurities absorbed by the conductive adhesive during the test.Fig. 4(b) shows the XPS spectra of SnNb2O6 and 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6O 1s composites, and the binding energies correspond to 529.24 and 529.38 eV, respectively.The binding energies increased by 0.14 eV, and the electrons flowed out from SnNb2O6 63.Fig. 4(c) shows the XPS spectra of SnNb2O6 and the 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6Nb 3d composite material.The binding energies of Nb 3d5/2 are 206.11and 206.31 eV, respectively, and the binding energies of Nb 3d3/2 are 208.88 and 209.08 eV, respectively.By comparing the binding energy of Nb 3d in pure SnNb2O6 and 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6, it can be seen that the binding energy of Nb 3d in 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 is 0.3 eV higher than that in SnNb2O6.The energy difference between the two peaks of Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 is 2.77 eV, and Nb exists as Nb 5 64.Fig. 4(d) shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Sn 3d electrons.The peaks at 482.29 and 493.68 eV and at 485.47 and 493.87 eV are, respectively, assigned to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 of pure SnNb2O6 and 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6samples 65.A comparison of the binding energies of O 1s, Nb 3d, and Sn 3d in pure SnNb2O6 with those in 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 shows that the binding energies of O 1s, Nb 3d, and Sn 3d in 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6increased.The results indicate that the electron density around SnNb2O6 decreases and that the electrons flow to CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA.Fig. 4(e) shows that the Se 3d XPS spectrum of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA is divided into two peaks, at 53.00 and 53.82 eV, corresponding to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA.Se 3d in the composite material is also divided into two peaks, at 52.72 and 53.54 eV, corresponding to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, of 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6.A comparison of the binding energy of Se 3d in pure CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA with that in 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6shows that the binding energy of Se 3d in CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA is higher, which indicates that the binding energy of Se 3d in 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6decreased, the electron density around the composite increased, and electrons flowed into CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA.Fig. 4(f) shows that S 2p is divided into S 2p3/2 and S p1/2, whose peaks at 159.09 and 160.06 eV, respectively, correspond to S 2p3/2 and S p1/2 of pure CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA.The binding energy of S 2p in the composites also decreases 66.The spectra in Fig. 4(g) for Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 with a binding energy difference of 6.73 eV further prove that Cd exists as Cd 2 22. According to the above data, the electron density around SnNb2O6 decreased, while that around CdSe0.8S0.2-DETAincreased.This is caused by the migration of electrons between two different EF semiconductors, which is conducive to the formation of an internal electric field at the contact 17,67.These two materials form a stepped heterostructure, which is conducive to electron transfer.increase of visible-light utilization, more electron-hole pairs are generated, which is beneficial to photocatalytic activity.Fig. 5(b) shows the band gaps of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and SnNb2O6, which are 1.71 and 2.52 eV, respectively.The band gap of a semiconductor is calculated by using the following formula 35,62: (1) where h, Eg, n, A, and are the light energy, band-gap energy, different transition type of semiconductor, a constant value, and the absorption index, respectively.The n values of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and SnNb2O6 were 1 and 4, respectively.Fig. 5(c) clearly shows the valence band XPS spectrum.The valence band positions of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and SnNb2O6 are 0.46 and 1.40 eV, respectively 33,35,61.The conduction band was calculated by using the following formula: Therefore, the conduction band positions of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and SnNb2O6 are -1.25 and -1.12 eV, respectively. Fig. 6(a) shows the photocurrent response of 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 with a sharp jump under the condition of intermittent light at an interval of 50 s.Compared with the photocurrent of the pure sample (SnNb2O6 and CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA), that of the composite sample has been greatly enhanced.At the same time, the figure shows that the composited sample produces more active photogenerated electrons and participates in the reduction reaction to improve photocatalytic efficiency 65.Similarly, under the same illumination time, 30 of the composite still maintains a high photocurrent response.Tests have proved that 30 of the composite samples have very good photosensitivity.Fig. 6(b) clearly revealed the electrochemical impedance.The arc radius of 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 is smaller than that of the pure sample, which indicates that the interface resistance of the composite sample is lower than that of other samples, and the charge transfer speed is faster.It also means that 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 has a greater probability of separating electron-hole pairs. To verify the superiority of using the 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6nanocomposite, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction was tested under the same conditions.Fig. 7(a) shows the photocatalytic performances of the samples with different proportions.Among CdSexS1-x, CdSe0.8S0.2 exhibited the best performance.The photocatalytic performance was adjusted by changing the CdSe0.8S0.2-DETAcontent.With the increase in CdSe0.8S0.2-DETAcontent, the reduction rate of CO2 increased.Clearly, the reduction rate of the composite sample is higher than that of pure SnNb2O6, and CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and reached its highest value when CdSe0.8S0.2-DETAaccounted for 30.The CO production rate of 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6heterostructure was 17.31 molg -1 h -1 , which is a factor of 4.8 greater than that of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA(3.6 molg -1 h -1 ) and a factor of 2.8 greater than that of SnNb2O6 (6.2 molg -1 h -1 ).The above data demonstrate that the structure of the heterojunction improves photocatalytic performance.Because 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6constitutes a stepped heterostructure, the electrons and holes are separated in space.Electrons are concentrated in the conduction band of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA, and holes are concentrated in the valence band of SnNb2O6, which retains a high redox potential and strong visible-light absorption capacity.Therefore, the photocatalytic performance of the composite samples was improved.To determine the photocatalytic stability of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA,SnNb2O6, and 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6, the performance of the four cycles is plotted in Fig. 7(b).After each CO2 reduction reaction, the photocatalyst was collected, and the reaction mixture was added again.In these four cycles, the photocorrosion of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA was more severe, and the stability of SnNb2O6 was better, but its performance was poor.Moreover, 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6exhibited good stability and photocatalytic performance.Fig. 7(c) clearly shows the photocatalytic performance under different reaction conditions.The first is under normal reaction conditions, the second is with replacement of CO2 with N2, and no CO production is detected.This proves that CO was converted from CO2.Third, there is no 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6, and no CO production was detected, indicating that 30CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA/SnNb2O6 is an active photocatalyst for the reaction 69.The fourth is that, under dark conditions, the generation of CO is also not detected, which indicates that a light source is needed to excite semiconductor materials.In Fig. 7(d Electrons absorb photon energy and transition from the valence band to the conduction band.Owing to the narrow band gap of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA, the generated photogenerated carriers recombine rapidly inside the semiconductor.Therefore, we propose a possible electron transfer scheme (S-scheme) 67.Fig. 8(b) shows the semiconductor material after contact.CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA was grown in situ on SnNb2O6, forming a heterojunction in close contact.Electrons will spontaneously transfer from CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA to SnNb2O6, and, through their interface, the Fermi levels of the two semiconductor materials will reach equilibrium 20,70.The conduction band of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETAlost electrons, causing the band edge to bend upward.The conduction band of SnNb2O6 bent downward owing to the accumulation of electrons.An internal electric field was generated at the interface 20,65.Owing to the internal electric field and Coulomb force, the holes in the valence band of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and the electrons in the conduction band of SnNb2O6 are easily recombined in the internal electric field 31.The electrons in the conduction band of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and the holes in the valence band of SnNb2O6 are separated in space 24. This separation suppresses the recombination of the photogenerated carriers inside the semiconductor.The semiconductor retains a high redox potential (through the conduction band of CdSe0.8S0.2-DETA and the valence band of SnNb2O6).These are conducive to the progress of photocatalytic reactions.As shown in Fig. 4, the binding energy of each element of the XPS changes.The binding energies of Cd, Se, and S decreased and the surrounding electron density increased, while the binding energies of Sn, Nb, and O increased, and the surrounding electron density decreased.It was also proved that the transfer path of electrons from SnNb2O6 to CdSe0.8S0.2-DETAfollows the path of the S-scheme heterojunction mechanism 24."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "The sealed container was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp for 1 h, and 5 mL of gas was removed and injected into the injector for sampling and analyzed with a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014C).", "context": "Barium sulfate (BaSO4), sodium sulfate hydrate (Na2S9H2O), potassium hydroxide (KOH), niobium (V) oxide, hydrochloric acid (HCl), cadmium chloride (CdCl22.5H2O),DETA, sulfuric acid (95-98 H2SO4), sublimed sulfur, and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) were obtained from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Corp.
