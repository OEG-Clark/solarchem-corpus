R. China.All these reagents were of analytical pure grade and used without further purification. The g-C 3 N 4 was synthesized by a typical preparation process: a certain amount of urea was annealed at 520 C in an alumina crucible with a cover for 3 h with a ramp of 4 C/min.Then a light yellow product was obtained when the crucible was cooled to room temperature naturally. The Mg/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts were obtained as follows: 0.5 g g-C 3 N 4 and certain amounts (x wt) of Mg (NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O were dissolved in 60 ml ethanol and then sonicated for 2 h to achieve the bulk exfoliation the flaky g-C 3 N 4 .Then the mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 180 C for 12 h in an oven.The resulting samples were washed several times with deionized water and dried at 80 o C overnight, which were denoted as Mg/pCN-x, where x (x5, 10, 20, 30) represented the mass percentage of magnesium nitrate.And the pure g-C 3 N 4 (pCN) was obtained without Mg doping for comparison. To study the crystallographic phase of the as-prepared catalysts, X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were performed by a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer with CuK radiation.The measurement was performed at room temperature in the 2 range of 10-80 o .Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were measured by N 2 adsorption at 77 K on a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ-AG instrument.The pore size distribution was calculated by applying the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method on the desorption branch of isotherm curve. The morphologies of the prepared samples were examined by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Phillips XL-30 FEG/NEW) and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Phillips Model CM200).The optical absorption properties were investigated by Ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflection spectra recorded in the range of 250-800 nm on a spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-3600, Japan) using BaSO 4 as the reflectance standard material.Photoluminescence (PL) characteristics were analyzed with an excitation wave length of 325 nm at room temperature using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4600). CO 2 photocatalytic reduction was typically performed in a gas-closed circulation system by using a reactor (volume: 500 mL) purchased from Perfect Light Company (China, Beijing).The reactor was made of borosilicate glass with an optical quartz window at the top.A 300 W Xenon-arc lamp was used as the light source of the photocatalytic reaction.In a typical process, 50 mg photocatalyst was added into 100 mL deionized water and dispersed under adequate stirring.Prior to the illumination, the suspension was vacuum-treated and then filled with 100 kPa high purity CO 2 (99.999) by a mass flow controller, followed by purging for 30 min at the flow rate of 1mL/min to establish an adsorption/desorption equilibrium.After that, the experiment was started when the light was on.The temperature of the reactor was controlled at 25 C by cooling water circulation and the pressure was maintained at about 100 kPa.During the irradiation, 0.1 mL gas was sampled from the glass chamber at a given time intervals (1 h) for detecting CH 4 and CO or other carbon-based gases by gas chromatography (GC-2010 Plus, SHIMADZU, Japan)."}, {"llm generation": "Mg-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts", "source": "The XRD patterns of the synthesized Mg-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts with different magnesium doping content are shown in Fig. S1.", "context": "The XRD patterns of the synthesized Mg-doped g-C 3 N 4 catalysts with different magnesium doping content are shown in Fig. S1.In the case of pCN, two significant diffraction peaks at 27.5 o and 13.1 o can be found, which can be indexed as the (002) and (100) reflections, respectively, corresponding to the interlayer stacking of aromatic segments and in-plane structure packing motif of tri-s-triazine units 28.No diffraction peaks of Mg species could be detected, suggesting its good dispersion on catalyst surface.In addition, the crystallization degrees of the Mg/pCN catalysts are lower than that of pCN, indicating that the crystallization is alleviated during Mg doping process 29.Noticeably, the increase of magnesium content in the composites causes the reduction of the (100) diffraction peak intensity which reaches the weakest degree for the sample of Mg/pCN-20.The facts indicate that the in-plane crystalline size gets smaller and more structural defects appear after the doping of Mg.It is consistent with BET data in Table .1.and the observations from the SEM and TEM images in Fig. S2.However, when the Mg(NO 3 ) 2 doping amount reaches 30 wt, the peak intensity at 13.1 o increases instead of continuing to weaken, which may be originated from the aggregation of Mg species. In order to investigate the textural properties of these samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement was performed at 77 K.The properties for surface areas and pore size are summarized in Table1.The pore size obtained from the desorption branch using the BJH method indicates that all samples have a relatively narrow pore size distribution centered at about 3.8 nm.The BET surface area of pCN is only 47.1 m 2 /g , while the specific surface areas of the Mg/pCN composites slightly increase with Mg doping.The maximum value for the BET surface area is found to be 59.9 m 2 /g for Mg/pCN-20 catalyst, which is in accordance with the XRD analysis results.The increase of the specific surface area is probably due to the hindered crystal growth of graphitic carbon nitride by Mg doping, which may lead to the formation of surface defects and provide more active sites. The SEM and TEM images of pCN and Mg/pCN-20 samples are described in Fig. 1 depicts the absorbance spectra of pCN and Mg-doped pCN samples within the range 250-800 nm.All the samples show obvious absorption in visible light region (400-800 nm), with the absorption edge up to 466, 471, 478, 482, and 475 nm, respectively.It is apparent that the Mg-doped catalyst shows a light red-shifted absorption, which may be ascribed to the changed band structure after Mg deposition 30.The optical band gap ( ) of a semiconductor could be calculated based on the equation of h (h - ) /2 , where , h, A and E g are absorption coefficient, the photoenergy, a constant relative to the material, and the band gap energy, respectively.Moreover, n is depended on the type of the transition in a semiconductor ( n 1 for a direct transition and n 4 for an indirect transition).For the indirect optical transition of g-C 3 N 4 , n was equal to 4. Accordingly, the of Mg-doped pCN catalysts was determined from the plot of (h) 1/2 versus energy (h) (Fig. S3) and the band gaps of pCN and Mg/pCN-X (X 5, 10, 20, 30) are obtained (Table 1).It is clear that the band gaps of Mg-doped catalysts are narrowed, which is beneficial to the visible-light absorption. Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was carried out to analyze the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons and holes in the photocatalysts.As shown in Fig. 2, all samples exhibit a strong emission peak around the wavelength of 475 nm at ambient temperature, which is in line with UV-vis results.In comparison with pCN, the PL intensities of Mg-doped pCN samples decrease gradually.It might be caused by the heteroatom magnesium acting as the photogenerated electron target to reduce the recombination rate of photogenenrated electron-holes pairs 32.It can also be seen that Mg/pCN-20 shows the lowest recombination rate, agreeing well with its highest photocatalytic activity as described below. To evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the Mg-doped pCN catalysts with different Mg doping contents, their activities for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 were measured.Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the main products (CH 4 and CO) as a function of irradiation time for all catalysts.From the curves, it is clear that the yields of CH 4 and CO increase with the reaction time and Mg-doped pCN catalysts exhibit much higher photocatalytic activities than pCN catalyst.It should also be noted that photocatalytic performance is promoted with the increase of Mg doping contents and reaches the highest value on Mg/pCN-20 sample after 6h irradiation.The yields of CH 4 on Mg/pCN-20 is up to 17.09 mol/g-cat along with the corresponding CO yield of 4.13 mol/g-cat, which are about 1.96 and 2.8 times of the corresponding values on pCN catalyst, respectively. However, the decreased activity occurs with further increase of Mg doping content, which may be ascribed to the agglomeration of magnesium on the surface of pCN.The effect would block part of light absorption and decelerate the charge transfer, resulting in the decrease of CO 2 photocatalytic conversion efficiency. The as-prepared Mg/pCN photocatalysts exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 and CO under illumination.Based on the above characterization and analysis results, the enhanced photocatalytic performance was mainly attributed to the restrained recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.The possible reaction mechanism on the Mg/pCN catalysts is discussed as schematically presented in Fig. 4. Upon light irradiation, H 2 O molecules are oxidized by h to generate H and HO on the VB of Mg/pCN catalysts.Meanwhile, due to the fact that the Fermi level of magnesium is lower than that of pCN and the heteroatom magnesium may act as the photogenerated electron target 22, the electrons on the CB migrate to magnesium dispersed on the pCN surfaces and the CO 2 molecules are reduced to CO and CH 4 under the assistance of H .Obviously, this contributes to the separation of electron-hole pairs and results in photocatalytic activity improvement.In addition, there are also a variety of favorable properties contributing to the high photocatalytic performance of the Mg-modified catalysts, such as the uniform flaked structure along with relatively larger surface area, narrower band gap and better visible-light absorption than pCN."}, {"llm generation": "Mg-doped pCN catalysts", "source": "In summary, the Mg-doped pCN catalysts were synthesized via an in-situ hydrothermal deposition method.", "context": "In summary, the Mg-doped pCN catalysts were synthesized via an in-situ hydrothermal deposition method.

Upon light irradiation, H 2 O molecules are oxidized by h to generate H and HO on the VB of Mg/pCN catalysts.Meanwhile, due to the fact that the Fermi level of magnesium is lower than that of pCN and the heteroatom magnesium may act as the photogenerated electron target 22, the electrons on the CB migrate to magnesium dispersed on the pCN surfaces and the CO 2 molecules are reduced to CO and CH 4 under the assistance of H .Obviously, this contributes to the separation of electron-hole pairs and results in photocatalytic activity improvement.In addition, there are also a variety of favorable properties contributing to the high photocatalytic performance of the Mg-modified catalysts, such as the uniform flaked structure along with relatively larger surface area, narrower band gap and better visible-light absorption than pCN."}], "lamp": [{"llm generation": "Xenon", "source": "A 300 W Xenon-arc lamp was used as the light source of the photocatalytic reaction.", "context": "Urea (H 2 NCONH 3 ) and magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Corp, P.
