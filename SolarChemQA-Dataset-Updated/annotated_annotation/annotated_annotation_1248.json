accessories to test the adsorption state of the catalyst surface during the multitime reaction process. 2.6.Photoelectrochemical Characterization.The threeelectrode method was used to test the visible-light-driven photocurrent of NC-160 nanoparticles.Overall, a 0.5 M NaHCO 3 (Aladdin) aqueous solution was selected as an electrolyte and Pt and Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as a counter electrode and a reference electrode, respectively.Further, 7.5 mg of the NC-160 powder sample was dispersed in 0.5 mL of ethanol and 1 mL of terpineol, and then 0.5 mL of the abovementioned dispersion was spin-dropped on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (1 cm 1 cm).Visible light can be achieved using 420 nm and 780 nm cutoff filters.In the process of recording the photocurrent response, there

photocatalyst was characterized by XRD for a series of N-doped CoO.", "context": "As shown in Scheme 1, we chose a simple one-step solvothermal method to prepare N-doped CoO nanocrystals. Compared with the solid-phase synthesis route, solvothermal technology can synthesize nanoparticles with higher purity and more uniformity at a lower temperature. 28,29In this work, cobalt acetylacetonate Co(acac) 2 was used as a source of Co and O, a small amount of oleylamine was used as a surfactant and nitrogen source, and n-hexane was used as a solvent.By adjusting the temperature of the solvothermal method, Ndoped CoO nanoparticles with different crystallinities were prepared.The samples synthesized at 140, 160, and 180 C are denoted as NC-140, NC-160, and NC-180, respectively. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the surface morphology of the obtained sample.Figure 1a shows that the evaporation of n-hexane forms a composite of ultrathin nanowire bundles and nanosheets.It can be observed that the aggregation of nanowires forms a nanosheet structure.The large specific surface area of the two-dimensional material provides higher light utilization and more reaction sites for the photoreduction reaction.Atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure S1) proved that the thickness of the ultrathin nanosheet is 2.24 nm, which is close to the length of the oleylamine molecular chain (20.74 A).Therefore, it was confirmed that oleylamine was the template of the reaction.At the same time, the ultrathin structure with a thickness of only a few atoms provides a shorter path for the migration of photogenerated electrons. 30A transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to further analyze the overall structure of the sample.As shown in Figure 1b, the tip of the nanowire is tapered.In recent reports, a smaller radius of curvature of the tip greatly increases the charge density of the tip, thereby generating a stronger local electric field. 31The formation of a local electric field provides a directional path for the transfer of photogenerated charges.The possibility of carrier recombination is reduced, and the transmission rate of photogenerated electrons increases, thereby increasing the efficiency of the catalytic reaction as a whole. 32,33The high-resolution TEM image (Figure 1c) further reveals the lattice structure of the nanowires.Two different crystal lattices can be clearly observed, the 0.33 nm crystal lattice of the ( 220 The crystal structure of the photocatalyst was characterized by XRD for a series of N-doped CoO.As shown in Figure 2a, the results show that the diffraction peaks of CoO at 36.2, 42.1, and 61.2can be indexed to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the rock salt cubic phase CoO (space group Fm-3m).Compared with the standard card (PDF 97-024-5320), the positions of the diffraction peaks of N-doped CoO are slightly shifted to the low-angle direction.This is consistent with the increase in the lattice distance of the synthesized photocatalyst caused by the introduction of N. As the reaction temperature increases, the peak shape of the diffraction peak of N-doped CoO becomes sharper.This proves that the increase in the solvothermal temperature can increase the crystallinity of the sample.Through Raman spectroscopy, a series of CoO molecular vibration information was analyzed (Figure 2b).Due to the Oh symmetry of CoO (Fm-3m space group), obvious E g , T 2g , and A lg activity patterns can be observed in the Raman spectrum.In commercial CoO samples, the peaks of these three activity modes correspond to 474, 515, and 677 cm -1 , respectively. 34However, the vibration peak of the Ndoped CoO sample shifted slightly to the low-frequency region.This may be due to lattice distortion caused by Ndoping. 35It can be clearly observed that the NC-160 sample has the highest degree of red shift. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the surface element-binding state of the NC-160 photocatalyst (Figure 2c-f).Figure 2c shows the overall XPS spectra of the NC-160 photocatalyst.It can be clearly seen that the NC-160 sample contains Co, O, and N elements, which is consistent with the EDS results.The reason for the lower N peak intensity is that the N element is less doped.shows that the main peaks at 780.25 and 796.13 eV correspond to Co(II) 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 , respectively.The corresponding satellite peaks appear at 785.74 and 802.52 eV.The weaker peaks at 782.24 and 797.86 eV correspond to a small amount of Co-N bonds. 36,37Compared with the reported data of the CoO crystal, the positions of the two core peaks in the Co 2p region are slightly shifted to the direction of greater binding energy, which proves that N atoms have been successfully incorporated into the CoO lattice.Figure 2e shows the O 1s core energy spectrum of NC-160.The main peak at 530.74 eV corresponds to the O in the Co-O bond.The hump at 529.15 eV on the side is related to the CO bond, which may be caused by the adsorption of CO 2 in the air.The peak at 551.55 eV can be attributed to the -OH bond, which may be due to the adsorption of water in the air.The high-resolution N 1s spectrum further reveals the binding state of nitrogen in NC-160 (Figure 2f).N 1s is composed of two core peaks.The stronger peak at 399.52 eV corresponds to the N-Co-O bond, and the weaker peak at 397.88 eV corresponds to the N-Co bond.This is because the main form of N in the sample is by replacing the defective oxygen sites in the crystal lattice. 38.2.Electrochemical Performance.The main factors affecting the performance of the photocatalyst include: (i) the effective photon utilization rate of the photocatalyst, (ii) the separation of photogenerated charges, and (iii) the transfer of photogenerated electrons. 39The kinetic behavior of the photogenerated charge of the catalyst is mainly characterized by electrochemical tests.We have performed photoelectric tests and transient time spectroscopy tests on a series of Ndoped CoO photocatalysts and pure CoO materials.The effective utilization of photogenerated charge first stems from the high degree of separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.It can be seen from the photocurrent response analysis that the NC-160 sample shows the best charge separation performance (Figure 3a).This means that NC-160 has a higher photogenerated charge intensity under light excitation.The transient fluorescence spectrum test also confirms this point.It can be concluded from Figure 3d that the average fluorescence lifetime of NC-160 reaches 34.25 ns, which is much higher than other photocatalysts.The increase in the average fluorescence lifetime indicates the longer lifetime of the excited electrons.The transmission of photogenerated electrons is also a key indicator to evaluate the dynamic behavior of electric charges.The Nyquist diagram (Figure 3b) obtained by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement reveals the transfer ability of photogenerated charges on the catalyst surface.It is found that NC-160 exhibits a semicircle with the smallest radius of curvature.This phenomenon proves that NC-160 has the smallest mass transfer resistance and the strongest interface charge transfer ability.Through impedance simulation, the mass transfer resistance of the NC-160 material is 18.73 , which is less than the mass transfer resistance of other samples. The thermodynamic reduction ability of the photocatalyst is also an important evaluation factor for light conversion CO 2 RR.Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) of N-doped CoO and pure CoO showed almost the same maximum light absorption edge and similar band gap (Figure S2).The reduction of CO 2 to CO requires a reduction potential lower than -0.53 V vs NHE, which is similar to the reduction potential of H 2 produced by water splitting (-0.42 V vs NHE). 40In other words, the production of H 2 is the main side reaction. Based on the law of thermodynamic reaction 41 where E R is the overpotential for H 2 O splitting, E CB is the conduction potential of the photocatalyst, and E H/H2 is the reduction potential for splitting water into H 2 .CO 2 RR also conforms to this law.A series of photocatalysts were tested by linear voltammetry (LSV) to explore their ability to accept electrons (Figure 3c).The NC-160 photocatalyst shows the largest current density within the CO 2 conversion potential, indicating that photogenerated electrons may be used more for CO 2 RR in NC-160. The adsorption capacity of the (200) crystal plane and (220) crystal plane of CoO was explored through the partial wave charge density (Figure 4a).According to the theoretical calculation of the d-band center, the d-band center of the (220) crystal plane was 8.49 eV, and the d-band center of the (200) crystal plane was located at 10.16 eV.Therefore, it was judged that the (220) crystal plane has stronger adsorption capacity and was the active crystal plane of N-doped CoO.The N-doped CoO model was constructed by DFTU, and the charge density difference calculated based on the model is shown in Figure 4b.It could be seen that the charge redistribution occurred on the side of the N element, and N as an element for obtaining electrons made the electrons near Co more active.The calculation results theoretically confirmed that the N-doping strategy could effectively promote the electron accumulation of CoO and promote the construction of a catalyst with high reduction activity. 3.4.Performance of Photocatalytic Reduction of CO 2 .To verify the abovementioned analysis of a series of photocatalysts from reaction kinetics and reaction thermodynamics under visible light, a photoreduction test of CO 2 in air was done.The catalytic system reacts in a heterogeneous solution of acetonitrile (MeCN), water, and triethanolamine (TEOA).A small amount of photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (represented by Ru) was added as a cocatalyst.The high solubility of MeCN and TEOA to CO 2 ensures that the solvent absorbs a large number of reactants, thereby promoting photoreduction.Generally, TEOA and H 2 O reacts to form a large amount of HCO 3 -after absorbing pure CO 2 , and the phase separation of acetonitrile and water causes the solution to be divided into an acetonitrile layer and a water layer.However, this is not conducive to the adsorption and desorption of the catalysis process.In this work, we used fresh air at standard atmospheric pressure as the source of reactant CO 2 .A lower concentration of CO 2 reduces the occurrence of this phase separation phenomenon so as to make full use of the low concentration of CO 2 and accelerate the catalytic reaction.Under the irradiation of a xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter, as shown in Figures 5a,b and S3a-h, all CoO samples showed good H 2 , CH 4 , and ultrahigh CO conversion efficiency.Among them, the yield of the NC-160 sample photoreduced to CO in the air reached 2902.45 mol g -1 h -1 .After 2 h, the turnover frequency (TOF) of CO was as high as 307 h -1 , and the selectivity in the one-carbon product reached 97.60.Compared with unmodified pure CoO, the CO yield of NC-160 is about 11 times that of pure CoO, and the TOF and CO selectivity is also significantly improved.In addition, the CO output performance has a volcanic relationship with the synthesis temperature (Figure 5a), indicating that the photoreduction efficiency is closely related to the kinetic properties of the material.The rapid transmission of photons in the material and the low recombination rate jointly promote the rate of CO 2 photoreduction.Figure 5c shows a mass spectrum of the gas generated before and after the NC-160 photoreaction for 2 h.It can be clearly observed that the absolute intensity of CO 2 with m/z45 dropped by three-quarters after the reaction.This indicates that the reason the reaction reached close to equilibrium within 2 h was the large amount of CO 2 consumed in air.As shown in Figure 5d, to explore the catalytic cycle of the catalyst after the low-concentration CO 2 RR reaction, we performed two control experiments.The blue line simulates the catalytic reaction of flowing air.After NC-160 was irradiated for 2 h, we exhausted the gas from the system and introduced fresh air.It is found that the output performance of the catalytic system that readsorbs the reactants has almost no degradation.The black line describes that pure CO 2 gas is injected after NC-160 has reacted in air for 2 h, and it is found that both the catalytic rate and the CO yield have increased surprisingly.It could reach 4.45 mmol g -1 h -1 in the 3rd hour, which was 3 times the average speed in the first 2 h.This also corroborates the source of C in the photoreduced product.The abovementioned results all prove that NC-160 has a highefficiency photocatalytic performance in air and can almost completely convert CO 2 in air.Moreover, the catalytic system can be recycled at low concentrations. To further confirm the C source of the reaction, a CO 2 RR test was performed under pure argon conditions.Chromatography and gas mass spectrometer detection did not find any escape of gas and liquid products.This confirms that the carbon source of the C 1 product comes from the injected CO 2 .At the same time, the use of a 13 C isotope labeling method and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer fully confirmed that the carbon source in the process of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is entirely from the injected CO 2 .Through the 13 C isotope tracer detection of NC-160 reaction in air, the mass spectrometer showed that the products of 13 CO 2 (m/z 45) were mainly 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) and 13 CO (m/z 29) (Figure 5e).The rapid conversion of 13 CO 2 causes it to show a weaker intensity in the mass spectrum.This result is consistent with the conclusion drawn from the control experiment.In addition, to avoid the influence of thermal effects, CO 2 RR is carried out under connected condensed water.To explore whether there is a thermal effect, we shaded and heated the catalyst in the air system, and no evolution of the gas product was detected.The temperature of the solution when exposed to light for 2 h is about 30 C.An XRD (Figure S5) test was performed on NC-160 after illumination to verify the stability of the crystal structure of the NC-160 photocatalyst in the photocatalytic reaction.The results show that the N-doped CoO photocatalyst still has the original rock salt cubic structure.According to the abovementioned inspection, it can be determined that light is the energy source for the catalytic reaction, and the physical properties of the NC-160 photocatalyst remain unchanged during the reduction process. 3.5.Influence of O 2 in Catalytic Reactions.In addition, compared with the light conversion under the same concentration (0.03) of simulated air Ar/CO 2 , the yield of NC-160 photocatalytic CO 2 -CO in air is 17 times higher (Figures S3 andS4).By simulating an Ar/O 2 /CO 2 mixture of 21 O 2 and 0.03 CO 2 , we are surprised to find that the introduction of O 2 restores the reaction activity to the light conversion gain in the air state (Figure 6a).The reduced electrons are more diverted to form CO rather than H 2 (Figure 6b).This means that the addition of a small amount of O 2 in the low-concentration system can promote the occurrence of CO 2 RR through a certain mechanism.We will discuss this in the next section.In short, with the help of the alcohol amine and Ru, NC-160 achieved a high conversion rate of light CO 2 RR and system recyclability in real air.In the actual process of waste gas treatment, both the air and the waste gas from power plants contain low concentrations of O 2 .Therefore, by constructing a flow cell reactor, the system is expected to directly treat atmospheric waste gas, avoiding the high cost of pretreatment and separation. 9,42,43.6.Reaction Mechanism of CO 2 Photoreduction in Air.In the CO 2 RR process, the active intermediates of the combination and conversion of CO 2 and the catalyst system often determine the reaction path and product selectivity.The use of quasi-in situ drift spectra (Figure 7a,c-e) revealed a series of the CoO photocatalyst changes in the reaction intermediates of CO 2 RR in air. 4445546 The adsorption and activation of CO 2 molecules on the catalyst surface are important parts of the CO 2 RR process.Figure 7a shows two adsorption modes of CO 2 : carbon-coordinated monodentate carbonate m-CO 3 2-(1443 cm -1 ) and oxygen-coordinated b-CO 3 2-(1465 and 1069 cm -1 ).The absorption band at 1375 cm -1 comes from HCO 3-, which receives protons.Since CO 2 RR was performed in air, a weak CO 2 adsorption mode appeared within 1 min of the test.With the progress of the catalytic reaction, the intensity of m-CO 3 2-increased significantly, while b-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -showed a certain degree of decline.Under visible light, new absorption bands corresponding to CO 2 RR intermediates gradually appeared.For example, 1663 cm -1 can be matched with carboxylate COOH, and the tensile vibration peaks at 1150 and 1028 cm -1 can be assigned to the -CH 3 group of methoxy CH 3 O -.The strength of these two new bands increased significantly, proving the continued progress of the reaction.The absorption peak at 1180 cm -1 corresponds to the bridged methoxide species.The weakening of the peak here is due to the consumption of the hole sacrificial agent triethanolamine during the reaction.Compared with commercial CoO, the reaction intermediates of CO 2 RR are basically the same, and the slight shift of the individual absorption peaks may be due to the introduction of N, which causes the different vibrational frequencies of the molecules.In addition, it can be clearly observed that NC-160 reached the highest reaction rate in 10 min.At 60 min, the formation of the intermediate basically reached an equilibrium state.This proves that under the same test conditions, the reaction rate of NC-160 is far higher than that of other samples.This finding is also consistent with the catalytic test results (Figure 5a).The increasing absorption peak at 3308 cm -1 corresponds well to the surface -OH of the catalyst. Quasi-in situ Raman technology is used to detect the transformation process of intermediates derived in the CO 2 RR process to prove the authenticity of the quasi-in situ infrared test.The quasi-in situ Raman spectra of the NC-160 CO 2 RR reaction in the air are shown in Figure 7b.The corresponding peak positions of the corresponding intermediates were searched according to public knowledge. 4748849 The CO 2 in the air is partially absorbed by water, and the vibration peaks of the generated HCO 3 -and CO 3 2-are located at 1145 and 1496 cm -1 , respectively.It can be clearly seen that the peak signal becomes stronger, which means that the carbon dioxide in the air will not be consumed within 1 h (note: the test dosage of the quasi-in situ Raman catalyst is 1/40 times that of the quasiin situ infrared catalyst).The signal peaks at 303, 389, and 1837 cm -1 can be assigned to the CO ads , Co-C-O bonds, and surface vacancy-adsorbed CO.The increase in vibration is consistent with the conclusion that CO is the main reduction product in the experimental results, and it also confirms that the vacancy is the reaction site of NC-160.Three representative CO peaks showed significantly enhanced signals, indicating that NC-160 can maintain good CO 2 RR catalytic activity and an extremely high catalytic rate in air.The signal peaks at 989 and 1045 cm -1 are caused by the symmetrical and asymmetrical tensile vibrations of the COOH group and OC-O, respectively.At the same time, the increased signal peak at 718 cm -1 can be attributed to the surface hydroxyl -OH group, 47 which matches the peak at 3308 cm -1 in the quasi-in situ infrared measurement.TEOA is continuously reduced during the photoreduction process.Based on previous experience and the comparison under Ar/ CO 2 , we speculate that the enhanced -OH signal peak is caused by the reduction of trace O 2 in air. During the catalysis process, alcohol amine is continuously consumed as a sacrificial agent.Therefore, O 2 is likely to form an increasing number of surface -OH groups during the photoreduction process.HRTEM analysis was performed on the NC-160 catalyst after exposure to an oxygen-containing atmosphere (Figure 8a).The results show that the surface hydroxyl reduces the surface crystallinity of the catalyst.The electrochemical analysis shows (Figure 8b,c) that a small number of amorphous regions promotes the separation and transfer of charges and enhances the stability of low-valence defect metal oxides in the air.The linear voltammetry test proved that in an oxygen-containing atmosphere, the photogenerated -OH group changes the hydrogen evolution overpotential of the catalyst, making it more difficult for the hydrogen evolution reaction to occur.At the same time, more photogenerated electrons can be used to reduce CO 2 to CO. Based on the abovementioned analysis of quasi-in situ infrared spectroscopy and quasi-in situ Raman spectroscopy combined with previous investigations, 50 we proposed the possible evolution path of the NC-160 photocatalyst for CO 2 RR.The photoreduction pathway takes the carboxyl group and methanol as the characteristic reduction intermediate.The light-excited Ru dye undergoes a reduction quenching process, and the generated electrons undergo single-electron coupling and single-proton transfer on the surface of the catalyst with CO 2 in different adsorption states to form surface -COOH groups.Most of the COOH groups undergo oneelectron dehydration reduction to form CO. This is a ratedetermining step.The other part of COOH continues to be hydrogenated to form formic acid, which is then dehydrated to form formaldehyde.Formaldehyde continues to be hydrogenated and reduced to an important intermediate, methoxy CH 3 O, whose enhancement can be clearly observed in the quasi-in situ infrared results.Finally, methanol undergoes twoelectron reduction and dehydration to obtain methane.Compared with pure CoO, the adsorption strength of the Ndoped CoO sample at 1 min is basically the same, but the modified sample accelerates the rate of COOH generation.This is consistent with the results obtained from the electrochemical test above.The transmission rate of photogenerated electrons will be greatly improved due to the formation of a surface charge polarization of N-doped CoO.Therefore, it is easy for N-doped CoO to get more CO and CH 4 products. The following are possible reaction pathways from quasi-in situ tests for N-doped CoO during photocatalytic CO 2 RR 3.7.Possible Mechanism of Electron Transport in Solvent.The contact angle test proved that NC-160 has a smaller contact angle and better wettability to the MeCN/H 2 O system (Figure S6).Therefore, to further study the influencing factors of the CO 2 RR solvent system on the product performance, we conducted comparative experiments in solvent systems under different conditions (Figure 5f).The comparative experiments determined that NC-160 can detect the output of the product in the presence of water, catalyst, and TEOA.Also, O 2 will accelerate the reduction of CO 2 at low concentrations.First of all, this means that NC-160 is the active site of the reaction, and Ru only acts as a cocatalyst.Second, due to the strong adsorption capacity of acetonitrile for CO 2 , the utilization and conversion efficiency of CO 2 at low concentrations are improved.Finally, TEOA also plays an important role as a hole sacrificial agent in the reaction.According to previous reports, 10,51 we speculated about the formation of electrons in the entire catalytic system (Scheme 2).With the aid of the sacrificial agent and hydrogen ions, the Then, the water ionization produces hydrogen ions that combine with the CO 2 molecules adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst to cause a reduction reaction.Finally, the reduction product is released from the surface of the reactant."}, {"llm generation": "N-doped CoO photocatalyst", "source": "In summary, we synthesized an ultrathin two-dimensional structure of a N-doped CoO photocatalyst using a simple and effective anion doping strategy.", "context": "In summary, we synthesized an ultrathin two-dimensional structure of a N-doped CoO photocatalyst using a simple and effective anion doping strategy.Among them, the introduction of nitrogen shows excellent photogenerated charge separation and transfer capabilities.At the same time, the higher HER overpotential of NC-160 inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction, allowing more photogenerated electrons to be used to generate hydrocarbon products.With the help of an alcohol amine and Ru, NC-160 achieves ultrahigh conversion efficiency in air.After 2 h of light, our photocatalyst achieved a CO release rate of 2.902 mmol g -1 h -1 , and its TOF value reached 307.99 h -1 .A series of quasi-in situ experiments and DFT calculations show that N-doping can accelerate the photoreduction reaction.A small amount of O 2 in the air will be reduced by light to the form of surface -OH, which will change the crystallinity of the catalyst and accelerate the reduction of CO 2 in reaction kinetics.Our current work has opened up a new field for the practical application of photocatalysts so as to achieve high-efficiency light conversion in low-concentration CO 2 . s Supporting Information Figure 1.SEM (a), TEM (b), and HRTEM (c) images of NC-160.The insert in (c) is the electron diffraction of NC-160.HAADF-STEM (d) and EDX elemental mapping (e) of NC-160 full element image.The individual elemental mapping for Co, O, and N is shown from (e1) to (e3), respectively.

2 Reduction Experiment.Photocatalytic total CO 2 RR reductions were carried out in a gas-tight circulation system (Labsolar 6A, PerfectLight).Before the reaction, 20 mg of the photocatalyst sample was dispersed in a mixed solution of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O, 10 mL of deionized water, 10 mL of TEOA, and 40 mL of MECN.The concentration of Ru was 15.58 mmol/L.The solution was stirred for 0.5 h.Then, the air was fully absorbed or a mixture of Ar/CO 2 (0.03) was injected, and the suspension was irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300D) equipped with a 420 or 780 nm cutoff filter.During the irradiation, the reaction suspension was kept at 2 C by circulating cooling water.An on-line gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID) (GC 2014) was used to analyze the evolved gases such as CO and C 2 productions every hour, and Ar was used as the carrier gas.The photoluminescence (PL) images were analyzed on an RF-5301 PC.Regarding the quasi-FTIR test, this work uses Shimadzu's FTIR-8400 instrument, combined with PIKE's HATR multiple reflection accessories to test the adsorption state of the catalyst surface during the multitime reaction process. 2.6.Photoelectrochemical Characterization.The threeelectrode method was used to test the visible-light-driven photocurrent of NC-160 nanoparticles.Overall, a 0.5 M NaHCO 3 (Aladdin) aqueous solution was selected as an electrolyte and Pt and Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as a counter electrode and a reference electrode, respectively.Further, 7.5 mg of the NC-160 powder sample was dispersed in 0.5 mL of ethanol and 1 mL of terpineol, and then 0.5 mL of the abovementioned dispersion was spin-dropped on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (1 cm 1 cm).Visible light can be achieved using 420 nm and 780 nm cutoff filters.In the process of recording the photocurrent response, there was no bias potential, and the interval between on and off was 10 s.The LSV curve was determined at a scan rate of 10 mV s -1 .The EIS curve used the OCP as the starting voltage, the test frequency was 2 10 6 -1 10 -2 , and the amplitude was 0.02 V. 2.7.DFT Computational Details.DFT calculations were performed using the Material Studio code. 212222324 For the total energy calculations, the plane wave cutoff energy was 400 eV.Ion-electron interactions were represented by ultrasoft pseudopotentials within the framework of the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method. 25The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was adopted as the exchange-correlation functional. 26The Brillouin zone integration was approximated by a sum over specially selected k-points using the 3 3 1 MonkhorstPack method. 27The geometries were optimized until the energy was converged to 1 10 -5 eV/atom and the forces to 0.02 eV/A.To eliminate the interactions between slabs, the vacuum region was set to 15 A in the z-direction to separate the slabs.where y denotes yield."}, {"llm generation":

conversion efficiency.", "context": "As shown in Scheme 1, we chose a simple one-step solvothermal method to prepare N-doped CoO nanocrystals. Compared with the solid-phase synthesis route, solvothermal technology can synthesize nanoparticles with higher purity and more uniformity at a lower temperature. 28,29In this work, cobalt acetylacetonate Co(acac) 2 was used as a source of Co and O, a small amount of oleylamine was used as a surfactant and nitrogen source, and n-hexane was used as a solvent.By adjusting the temperature of the solvothermal method, Ndoped CoO nanoparticles with different crystallinities were prepared.The samples synthesized at 140, 160, and 180 C are denoted as NC-140, NC-160, and NC-180, respectively. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the surface morphology of the obtained sample.Figure 1a shows that the evaporation of n-hexane forms a composite of ultrathin nanowire bundles and nanosheets.It can be observed that the aggregation of nanowires forms a nanosheet structure.The large specific surface area of the two-dimensional material provides higher light utilization and more reaction sites for the photoreduction reaction.Atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure S1) proved that the thickness of the ultrathin nanosheet is 2.24 nm, which is close to the length of the oleylamine molecular chain (20.74 A).Therefore, it was confirmed that oleylamine was the template of the reaction.At the same time, the ultrathin structure with a thickness of only a few atoms provides a shorter path for the migration of photogenerated electrons. 30A transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to further analyze the overall structure of the sample.As shown in Figure 1b, the tip of the nanowire is tapered.In recent reports, a smaller radius of curvature of the tip greatly increases the charge density of the tip, thereby generating a stronger local electric field. 31The formation of a local electric field provides a directional path for the transfer of photogenerated charges.The possibility of carrier recombination is reduced, and the transmission rate of photogenerated electrons increases, thereby increasing the efficiency of the catalytic reaction as a whole. 32,33The high-resolution TEM image (Figure 1c) further reveals the lattice structure of the nanowires.Two different crystal lattices can be clearly observed, the 0.33 nm crystal lattice of the ( 220 The crystal structure of the photocatalyst was characterized by XRD for a series of N-doped CoO.As shown in Figure 2a, the results show that the diffraction peaks of CoO at 36.2, 42.1, and 61.2can be indexed to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the rock salt cubic phase CoO (space group Fm-3m).Compared with the standard card (PDF 97-024-5320), the positions of the diffraction peaks of N-doped CoO are slightly shifted to the low-angle direction.This is consistent with the increase in the lattice distance of the synthesized photocatalyst caused by the introduction of N. As the reaction temperature increases, the peak shape of the diffraction peak of N-doped CoO becomes sharper.This proves that the increase in the solvothermal temperature can increase the crystallinity of the sample.Through Raman spectroscopy, a series of CoO molecular vibration information was analyzed (Figure 2b).Due to the Oh symmetry of CoO (Fm-3m space group), obvious E g , T 2g , and A lg activity patterns can be observed in the Raman spectrum.In commercial CoO samples, the peaks of these three activity modes correspond to 474, 515, and 677 cm -1 , respectively. 34However, the vibration peak of the Ndoped CoO sample shifted slightly to the low-frequency region.This may be due to lattice distortion caused by Ndoping. 35It can be clearly observed that the NC-160 sample has the highest degree of red shift. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the surface element-binding state of the NC-160 photocatalyst (Figure 2c-f).Figure 2c shows the overall XPS spectra of the NC-160 photocatalyst.It can be clearly seen that the NC-160 sample contains Co, O, and N elements, which is consistent with the EDS results.The reason for the lower N peak intensity is that the N element is less doped.shows that the main peaks at 780.25 and 796.13 eV correspond to Co(II) 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 , respectively.The corresponding satellite peaks appear at 785.74 and 802.52 eV.The weaker peaks at 782.24 and 797.86 eV correspond to a small amount of Co-N bonds. 36,37Compared with the reported data of the CoO crystal, the positions of the two core peaks in the Co 2p region are slightly shifted to the direction of greater binding energy, which proves that N atoms have been successfully incorporated into the CoO lattice.Figure 2e shows the O 1s core energy spectrum of NC-160.The main peak at 530.74 eV corresponds to the O in the Co-O bond.The hump at 529.15 eV on the side is related to the CO bond, which may be caused by the adsorption of CO 2 in the air.The peak at 551.55 eV can be attributed to the -OH bond, which may be due to the adsorption of water in the air.The high-resolution N 1s spectrum further reveals the binding state of nitrogen in NC-160 (Figure 2f).N 1s is composed of two core peaks.The stronger peak at 399.52 eV corresponds to the N-Co-O bond, and the weaker peak at 397.88 eV corresponds to the N-Co bond.This is because the main form of N in the sample is by replacing the defective oxygen sites in the crystal lattice. 38.2.Electrochemical Performance.The main factors affecting the performance of the photocatalyst include: (i) the effective photon utilization rate of the photocatalyst, (ii) the separation of photogenerated charges, and (iii) the transfer of photogenerated electrons. 39The kinetic behavior of the photogenerated charge of the catalyst is mainly characterized by electrochemical tests.We have performed photoelectric tests and transient time spectroscopy tests on a series of Ndoped CoO photocatalysts and pure CoO materials.The effective utilization of photogenerated charge first stems from the high degree of separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.It can be seen from the photocurrent response analysis that the NC-160 sample shows the best charge separation performance (Figure 3a).This means that NC-160 has a higher photogenerated charge intensity under light excitation.The transient fluorescence spectrum test also confirms this point.It can be concluded from Figure 3d that the average fluorescence lifetime of NC-160 reaches 34.25 ns, which is much higher than other photocatalysts.The increase in the average fluorescence lifetime indicates the longer lifetime of the excited electrons.The transmission of photogenerated electrons is also a key indicator to evaluate the dynamic behavior of electric charges.The Nyquist diagram (Figure 3b) obtained by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement reveals the transfer ability of photogenerated charges on the catalyst surface.It is found that NC-160 exhibits a semicircle with the smallest radius of curvature.This phenomenon proves that NC-160 has the smallest mass transfer resistance and the strongest interface charge transfer ability.Through impedance simulation, the mass transfer resistance of the NC-160 material is 18.73 , which is less than the mass transfer resistance of other samples. The thermodynamic reduction ability of the photocatalyst is also an important evaluation factor for light conversion CO 2 RR.Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) of N-doped CoO and pure CoO showed almost the same maximum light absorption edge and similar band gap (Figure S2).The reduction of CO 2 to CO requires a reduction potential lower than -0.53 V vs NHE, which is similar to the reduction potential of H 2 produced by water splitting (-0.42 V vs NHE). 40In other words, the production of H 2 is the main side reaction. Based on the law of thermodynamic reaction 41 where E R is the overpotential for H 2 O splitting, E CB is the conduction potential of the photocatalyst, and E H/H2 is the reduction potential for splitting water into H 2 .CO 2 RR also conforms to this law.A series of photocatalysts were tested by linear voltammetry (LSV) to explore their ability to accept electrons (Figure 3c).The NC-160 photocatalyst shows the largest current density within the CO 2 conversion potential, indicating that photogenerated electrons may be used more for CO 2 RR in NC-160. The adsorption capacity of the (200) crystal plane and (220) crystal plane of CoO was explored through the partial wave charge density (Figure 4a).According to the theoretical calculation of the d-band center, the d-band center of the (220) crystal plane was 8.49 eV, and the d-band center of the (200) crystal plane was located at 10.16 eV.Therefore, it was judged that the (220) crystal plane has stronger adsorption capacity and was the active crystal plane of N-doped CoO.The N-doped CoO model was constructed by DFTU, and the charge density difference calculated based on the model is shown in Figure 4b.It could be seen that the charge redistribution occurred on the side of the N element, and N as an element for obtaining electrons made the electrons near Co more active.The calculation results theoretically confirmed that the N-doping strategy could effectively promote the electron accumulation of CoO and promote the construction of a catalyst with high reduction activity. 3.4.Performance of Photocatalytic Reduction of CO 2 .To verify the abovementioned analysis of a series of photocatalysts from reaction kinetics and reaction thermodynamics under visible light, a photoreduction test of CO 2 in air was done.The catalytic system reacts in a heterogeneous solution of acetonitrile (MeCN), water, and triethanolamine (TEOA).A small amount of photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (represented by Ru) was added as a cocatalyst.The high solubility of MeCN and TEOA to CO 2 ensures that the solvent absorbs a large number of reactants, thereby promoting photoreduction.Generally, TEOA and H 2 O reacts to form a large amount of HCO 3 -after absorbing pure CO 2 , and the phase separation of acetonitrile and water causes the solution to be divided into an acetonitrile layer and a water layer.However, this is not conducive to the adsorption and desorption of the catalysis process.In this work, we used fresh air at standard atmospheric pressure as the source of reactant CO 2 .A lower concentration of CO 2 reduces the occurrence of this phase separation phenomenon so as to make full use of the low concentration of CO 2 and accelerate the catalytic reaction.Under the irradiation of a xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter, as shown in Figures 5a,b and S3a-h, all CoO samples showed good H 2 , CH 4 , and ultrahigh CO conversion efficiency.Among them, the yield of the NC-160 sample photoreduced to CO in the air reached 2902.45 mol g -1 h -1 .After 2 h, the turnover frequency (TOF) of CO was as high as 307 h -1 , and the selectivity in the one-carbon product reached 97.60.Compared with unmodified pure CoO, the CO yield of NC-160 is about 11 times that of pure CoO, and the TOF and CO selectivity is also significantly improved.In addition, the CO output performance has a volcanic relationship with the synthesis temperature (Figure 5a), indicating that the photoreduction efficiency is closely related to the kinetic properties of the material.The rapid transmission of photons in the material and the low recombination rate jointly promote the rate of CO 2 photoreduction.Figure 5c shows a mass spectrum of the gas generated before and after the NC-160 photoreaction for 2 h.It can be clearly observed that the absolute intensity of CO 2 with m/z45 dropped by three-quarters after the reaction.This indicates that the reason the reaction reached close to equilibrium within 2 h was the large amount of CO 2 consumed in air.As shown in Figure 5d, to explore the catalytic cycle of the catalyst after the low-concentration CO 2 RR reaction, we performed two control experiments.The blue line simulates the catalytic reaction of flowing air.After NC-160 was irradiated for 2 h, we exhausted the gas from the system and introduced fresh air.It is found that the output performance of the catalytic system that readsorbs the reactants has almost no degradation.The black line describes that pure CO 2 gas is injected after NC-160 has reacted in air for 2 h, and it is found that both the catalytic rate and the CO yield have increased surprisingly.It could reach 4.45 mmol g -1 h -1 in the 3rd hour, which was 3 times the average speed in the first 2 h.This also corroborates the source of C in the photoreduced product.The abovementioned results all prove that NC-160 has a highefficiency photocatalytic performance in air and can almost completely convert CO 2 in air.Moreover, the catalytic system can be recycled at low concentrations. To further confirm the C source of the reaction, a CO 2 RR test was performed under pure argon conditions.Chromatography and gas mass spectrometer detection did not find any escape of gas and liquid products.This confirms that the carbon source of the C 1 product comes from the injected CO 2 .At the same time, the use of a 13 C isotope labeling method and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer fully confirmed that the carbon source in the process of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is entirely from the injected CO 2 .Through the 13 C isotope tracer detection of NC-160 reaction in air, the mass spectrometer showed that the products of 13 CO 2 (m/z 45) were mainly 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) and 13 CO (m/z 29) (Figure 5e).The rapid conversion of 13 CO 2 causes it to show a weaker intensity in the mass spectrum.This result is consistent with the conclusion drawn from the control experiment.In addition, to avoid the influence of thermal effects, CO 2 RR is carried out under connected condensed water.To explore whether there is a thermal effect, we shaded and heated the catalyst in the air system, and no evolution of the gas product was detected.The temperature of the solution when exposed to light for 2 h is about 30 C.An XRD (Figure S5) test was performed on NC-160 after illumination to verify the stability of the crystal structure of the NC-160 photocatalyst in the photocatalytic reaction.The results show that the N-doped CoO photocatalyst still has the original rock salt cubic structure.According to the abovementioned inspection, it can be determined that light is the energy source for the catalytic reaction, and the physical properties of the NC-160 photocatalyst remain unchanged during the reduction process. 3.5.Influence of O 2 in Catalytic Reactions.In addition, compared with the light conversion under the same concentration (0.03) of simulated air Ar/CO 2 , the yield of NC-160 photocatalytic CO 2 -CO in air is 17 times higher (Figures S3 andS4).By simulating an Ar/O 2 /CO 2 mixture of 21 O 2 and 0.03 CO 2 , we are surprised to find that the introduction of O 2 restores the reaction activity to the light conversion gain in the air state (Figure 6a).The reduced electrons are more diverted to form CO rather than H 2 (Figure 6b).This means that the addition of a small amount of O 2 in the low-concentration system can promote the occurrence of CO 2 RR through a certain mechanism.We will discuss this in the next section.In short, with the help of the alcohol amine and Ru, NC-160 achieved a high conversion rate of light CO 2 RR and system recyclability in real air.In the actual process of waste gas treatment, both the air and the waste gas from power plants contain low concentrations of O 2 .Therefore, by constructing a flow cell reactor, the system is expected to directly treat atmospheric waste gas, avoiding the high cost of pretreatment and separation. 9,42,43.6.Reaction Mechanism of CO 2 Photoreduction in Air.In the CO 2 RR process, the active intermediates of the combination and conversion of CO 2 and the catalyst system often determine the reaction path and product selectivity.The use of quasi-in situ drift spectra (Figure 7a,c-e) revealed a series of the CoO photocatalyst changes in the reaction intermediates of CO 2 RR in air. 4445546 The adsorption and activation of CO 2 molecules on the catalyst surface are important parts of the CO 2 RR process.Figure 7a shows two adsorption modes of CO 2 : carbon-coordinated monodentate carbonate m-CO 3 2-(1443 cm -1 ) and oxygen-coordinated b-CO 3 2-(1465 and 1069 cm -1 ).The absorption band at 1375 cm -1 comes from HCO 3-, which receives protons.Since CO 2 RR was performed in air, a weak CO 2 adsorption mode appeared within 1 min of the test.With the progress of the catalytic reaction, the intensity of m-CO 3 2-increased significantly, while b-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -showed a certain degree of decline.Under visible light, new absorption bands corresponding to CO 2 RR intermediates gradually appeared.For example, 1663 cm -1 can be matched with carboxylate COOH, and the tensile vibration peaks at 1150 and 1028 cm -1 can be assigned to the -CH 3 group of methoxy CH 3 O -.The strength of these two new bands increased significantly, proving the continued progress of the reaction.The absorption peak at 1180 cm -1 corresponds to the bridged methoxide species.The weakening of the peak here is due to the consumption of the hole sacrificial agent triethanolamine during the reaction.Compared with commercial CoO, the reaction intermediates of CO 2 RR are basically the same, and the slight shift of the individual absorption peaks may be due to the introduction of N, which causes the different vibrational frequencies of the molecules.In addition, it can be clearly observed that NC-160 reached the highest reaction rate in 10 min.At 60 min, the formation of the intermediate basically reached an equilibrium state.This proves that under the same test conditions, the reaction rate of NC-160 is far higher than that of other samples.This finding is also consistent with the catalytic test results (Figure 5a).The increasing absorption peak at 3308 cm -1 corresponds well to the surface -OH of the catalyst. Quasi-in situ Raman technology is used to detect the transformation process of intermediates derived in the CO 2 RR process to prove the authenticity of the quasi-in situ infrared test.The quasi-in situ Raman spectra of the NC-160 CO 2 RR reaction in the air are shown in Figure 7b.The corresponding peak positions of the corresponding intermediates were searched according to public knowledge. 4748849 The CO 2 in the air is partially absorbed by water, and the vibration peaks of the generated HCO 3 -and CO 3 2-are located at 1145 and 1496 cm -1 , respectively.It can be clearly seen that the peak signal becomes stronger, which means that the carbon dioxide in the air will not be consumed within 1 h (note: the test dosage of the quasi-in situ Raman catalyst is 1/40 times that of the quasiin situ infrared catalyst).The signal peaks at 303, 389, and 1837 cm -1 can be assigned to the CO ads , Co-C-O bonds, and surface vacancy-adsorbed CO.The increase in vibration is consistent with the conclusion that CO is the main reduction product in the experimental results, and it also confirms that the vacancy is the reaction site of NC-160.Three representative CO peaks showed significantly enhanced signals, indicating that NC-160 can maintain good CO 2 RR catalytic activity and an extremely high catalytic rate in air.The signal peaks at 989 and 1045 cm -1 are caused by the symmetrical and asymmetrical tensile vibrations of the COOH group and OC-O, respectively.At the same time, the increased signal peak at 718 cm -1 can be attributed to the surface hydroxyl -OH group, 47 which matches the peak at 3308 cm -1 in the quasi-in situ infrared measurement.TEOA is continuously reduced during the photoreduction process.Based on previous experience and the comparison under Ar/ CO 2 , we speculate that the enhanced -OH signal peak is caused by the reduction of trace O 2 in air. During the catalysis process, alcohol amine is continuously consumed as a sacrificial agent.Therefore, O 2 is likely to form an increasing number of surface -OH groups during the photoreduction process.HRTEM analysis was performed on the NC-160 catalyst after exposure to an oxygen-containing atmosphere (Figure 8a).The results show that the surface hydroxyl reduces the surface crystallinity of the catalyst.The electrochemical analysis shows (Figure 8b,c) that a small number of amorphous regions promotes the separation and transfer of charges and enhances the stability of low-valence defect metal oxides in the air.The linear voltammetry test proved that in an oxygen-containing atmosphere, the photogenerated -OH group changes the hydrogen evolution overpotential of the catalyst, making it more difficult for the hydrogen evolution reaction to occur.At the same time, more photogenerated electrons can be used to reduce CO 2 to CO. Based on the abovementioned analysis of quasi-in situ infrared spectroscopy and quasi-in situ Raman spectroscopy combined with previous investigations, 50 we proposed the possible evolution path of the NC-160 photocatalyst for CO 2 RR.The photoreduction pathway takes the carboxyl group and methanol as the characteristic reduction intermediate.The light-excited Ru dye undergoes a reduction quenching process, and the generated electrons undergo single-electron coupling and single-proton transfer on the surface of the catalyst with CO 2 in different adsorption states to form surface -COOH groups.Most of the COOH groups undergo oneelectron dehydration reduction to form CO. This is a ratedetermining step.The other part of COOH continues to be hydrogenated to form formic acid, which is then dehydrated to form formaldehyde.Formaldehyde continues to be hydrogenated and reduced to an important intermediate, methoxy CH 3 O, whose enhancement can be clearly observed in the quasi-in situ infrared results.Finally, methanol undergoes twoelectron reduction and dehydration to obtain methane.Compared with pure CoO, the adsorption strength of the Ndoped CoO sample at 1 min is basically the same, but the modified sample accelerates the rate of COOH generation.This is consistent with the results obtained from the electrochemical test above.The transmission rate of photogenerated electrons will be greatly improved due to the formation of a surface charge polarization of N-doped CoO.Therefore, it is easy for N-doped CoO to get more CO and CH 4 products. The following are possible reaction pathways from quasi-in situ tests for N-doped CoO during photocatalytic CO 2 RR 3.7.Possible Mechanism of Electron Transport in Solvent.The contact angle test proved that NC-160 has a smaller contact angle and better wettability to the MeCN/H 2 O system (Figure S6).Therefore, to further study the influencing factors of the CO 2 RR solvent system on the product performance, we conducted comparative experiments in solvent systems under different conditions (Figure 5f).The comparative experiments determined that NC-160 can detect the output of the product in the presence of water, catalyst, and TEOA.Also, O 2 will accelerate the reduction of CO 2 at low concentrations.First of all, this means that NC-160 is the active site of the reaction, and Ru only acts as a cocatalyst.Second, due to the strong adsorption capacity of acetonitrile for CO 2 , the utilization and conversion efficiency of CO 2 at low concentrations are improved.Finally, TEOA also plays an important role as a hole sacrificial agent in the reaction.According to previous reports, 10,51 we speculated about the formation of electrons in the entire catalytic system (Scheme 2).With the aid of the sacrificial agent and hydrogen ions, the Then, the water ionization produces hydrogen ions that combine with the CO 2 molecules adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst to cause a reduction reaction.Finally, the reduction product is released from the surface of the reactant."}], "reaction medium": [{"llm generation": "Liquid", "source": "The catalytic system reacts in a heterogeneous solution of acetonitrile (MeCN), water, and triethanolamine (TEOA).", "context": "As shown in Scheme 1, we chose a simple one-step solvothermal method to prepare N-doped CoO nanocrystals.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the surface element-binding state of the NC-160 photocatalyst (Figure 2c-f).Figure 2c shows the overall XPS spectra of the NC-160 photocatalyst.It can be clearly seen that the NC-160 sample contains Co, O, and N elements, which is consistent with the EDS results.The reason for the lower N peak intensity is that the N element is less doped.shows that the main peaks at 780.25 and 796.13 eV correspond to Co(II) 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 , respectively.The corresponding satellite peaks appear at 785.74 and 802.52 eV.The weaker peaks at 782.24 and 797.86 eV correspond to a small amount of Co-N bonds. 36,37Compared with the reported data of the CoO crystal, the positions of the two core peaks in the Co 2p region are slightly shifted to the direction of greater binding energy, which proves that N atoms have been successfully incorporated into the CoO lattice.Figure 2e shows the O 1s core energy spectrum of NC-160.The main peak at 530.74 eV corresponds to the O in the Co-O bond.The hump at 529.15 eV on the side is related to the CO bond, which may be caused by the adsorption of CO 2 in the air.The peak at 551.55 eV can be attributed to the -OH bond, which may be due to the adsorption of water in the air.The high-resolution N 1s spectrum further reveals the binding state of nitrogen in NC-160 (Figure 2f).N 1s is composed of two core peaks.The stronger peak at 399.52 eV corresponds to the N-Co-O bond, and the weaker peak at 397.88 eV corresponds to the N-Co bond.This is because the main form of N in the sample is by replacing the defective oxygen sites in the crystal lattice. 38.2.Electrochemical Performance.The main factors affecting the performance of the photocatalyst include: (i) the effective photon utilization rate of the photocatalyst, (ii) the separation of photogenerated charges, and (iii) the transfer of photogenerated electrons. 39The kinetic behavior of the photogenerated charge of the catalyst is mainly characterized by electrochemical tests.We have performed photoelectric tests and transient time spectroscopy tests on a series of Ndoped CoO photocatalysts and pure CoO materials.The effective utilization of photogenerated charge first stems from the high degree of separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.It can be seen from the photocurrent response analysis that the NC-160 sample shows the best charge separation performance (Figure 3a).This means that NC-160 has a higher photogenerated charge intensity under light excitation.The transient fluorescence spectrum test also confirms this point.It can be concluded from Figure 3d that the average fluorescence lifetime of NC-160 reaches 34.25 ns, which is much higher than other photocatalysts.The increase in the average fluorescence lifetime indicates the longer lifetime of the excited electrons.The transmission of photogenerated electrons is also a key indicator to evaluate the dynamic behavior of electric charges.The Nyquist diagram (Figure 3b) obtained by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement reveals the transfer ability of photogenerated charges on the catalyst surface.It is found that NC-160 exhibits a semicircle with the smallest radius of curvature.This phenomenon proves that NC-160 has the smallest mass transfer resistance and the strongest interface charge transfer ability.Through impedance simulation, the mass transfer resistance of the NC-160 material is 18.73 , which is less than the mass transfer resistance of other samples. The thermodynamic reduction ability of the photocatalyst is also an important evaluation factor for light conversion CO 2 RR.Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) of N-doped CoO and pure CoO showed almost the same maximum light absorption edge and similar band gap (Figure S2).The reduction of CO 2 to CO requires a reduction potential lower than -0.53 V vs NHE, which is similar to the reduction potential of H 2 produced by water splitting (-0.42 V vs NHE). 40In other words, the production of H 2 is the main side reaction. Based on the law of thermodynamic reaction 41 where E R is the overpotential for H 2 O splitting, E CB is the conduction potential of the photocatalyst, and E H/H2 is the reduction potential for splitting water into H 2 .CO 2 RR also conforms to this law.A series of photocatalysts were tested by linear voltammetry (LSV) to explore their ability to accept electrons (Figure 3c).The NC-160 photocatalyst shows the largest current density within the CO 2 conversion potential, indicating that photogenerated electrons may be used more for CO 2 RR in NC-160. The adsorption capacity of the (200) crystal plane and (220) crystal plane of CoO was explored through the partial wave charge density (Figure 4a).According to the theoretical calculation of the d-band center, the d-band center of the (220) crystal plane was 8.49 eV, and the d-band center of the (200) crystal plane was located at 10.16 eV.Therefore, it was judged that the (220) crystal plane has stronger adsorption capacity and was the active crystal plane of N-doped CoO.The N-doped CoO model was constructed by DFTU, and the charge density difference calculated based on the model is shown in Figure 4b.It could be seen that the charge redistribution occurred on the side of the N element, and N as an element for obtaining electrons made the electrons near Co more active.The calculation results theoretically confirmed that the N-doping strategy could effectively promote the electron accumulation of CoO and promote the construction of a catalyst with high reduction activity. 3.4.Performance of Photocatalytic Reduction of CO 2 .To verify the abovementioned analysis of a series of photocatalysts from reaction kinetics and reaction thermodynamics under visible light, a photoreduction test of CO 2 in air was done.The catalytic system reacts in a heterogeneous solution of acetonitrile (MeCN), water, and triethanolamine (TEOA).A small amount of photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O (represented by Ru) was added as a cocatalyst.The high solubility of MeCN and TEOA to CO 2 ensures that the solvent absorbs a large number of reactants, thereby promoting photoreduction.Generally, TEOA and H 2 O reacts to form a large amount of HCO 3 -after absorbing pure CO 2 , and the phase separation of acetonitrile and water causes the solution to be divided into an acetonitrile layer and a water layer.However, this is not conducive to the adsorption and desorption of the catalysis process.In this work, we used fresh air at standard atmospheric pressure as the source of reactant CO 2 .A lower concentration of CO 2 reduces the occurrence of this phase separation phenomenon so as to make full use of the low concentration of CO 2 and accelerate the catalytic reaction.Under the irradiation of a xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter, as shown in Figures 5a,b and S3a-h, all CoO samples showed good H 2 , CH 4 , and ultrahigh CO conversion efficiency.Among them, the yield of the NC-160 sample photoreduced to CO in the air reached 2902.45 mol g -1 h -1 .After 2 h, the turnover frequency (TOF) of CO was as high as 307 h -1 , and the selectivity in the one-carbon product reached 97.60.Compared with unmodified pure CoO, the CO yield of NC-160 is about 11 times that of pure CoO, and the TOF and CO selectivity is also significantly improved.In addition, the CO output performance has a volcanic relationship with the synthesis temperature (Figure 5a), indicating that the photoreduction efficiency is closely related to the kinetic properties of the material.The rapid transmission of photons in the material and the low recombination rate jointly promote the rate of CO 2 photoreduction.Figure 5c shows a mass spectrum of the gas generated before and after the NC-160 photoreaction for 2 h.It can be clearly observed that the absolute intensity of CO 2 with m/z45 dropped by three-quarters after the reaction.This indicates that the reason the reaction reached close to equilibrium within 2 h was the large amount of CO 2 consumed in air.As shown in Figure 5d, to explore the catalytic cycle of the catalyst after the low-concentration CO 2 RR reaction, we performed two control experiments.The blue line simulates the catalytic reaction of flowing air.After NC-160 was irradiated for 2 h, we exhausted the gas from the system and introduced fresh air.It is found that the output performance of the catalytic system that readsorbs the reactants has almost no degradation.The black line describes that pure CO 2 gas is injected after NC-160 has reacted in air for 2 h, and it is found that both the catalytic rate and the CO yield have increased surprisingly.It could reach 4.45 mmol g -1 h -1 in the 3rd hour, which was 3 times the average speed in the first 2 h.This also corroborates the source of C in the photoreduced product.The abovementioned results all prove that NC-160 has a highefficiency photocatalytic performance in air and can almost completely convert CO 2 in air.Moreover, the catalytic system can be recycled at low concentrations. To further confirm the C source of the reaction, a CO 2 RR test was performed under pure argon conditions.Chromatography and gas mass spectrometer detection did not find any escape of gas and liquid products.This confirms that the carbon source of the C 1 product comes from the injected CO 2 .At the same time, the use of a 13 C isotope labeling method and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer fully confirmed that the carbon source in the process of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is entirely from the injected CO 2 .Through the 13 C isotope tracer detection of NC-160 reaction in air, the mass spectrometer showed that the products of 13 CO 2 (m/z 45) were mainly 13 CH 4 (m/z 17) and 13 CO (m/z 29) (Figure 5e).The rapid conversion of 13 CO 2 causes it to show a weaker intensity in the mass spectrum.This result is consistent with the conclusion drawn from the control experiment.In addition, to avoid the influence of thermal effects, CO 2 RR is carried out under connected condensed water.To explore whether there is a thermal effect, we shaded and heated the catalyst in the air system, and no evolution of the gas product was detected.The temperature of the solution when exposed to light for 2 h is about 30 C.An XRD (Figure S5) test was performed on NC-160 after illumination to verify the stability of the crystal structure of the NC-160 photocatalyst in the photocatalytic reaction.The results show that the N-doped CoO photocatalyst still has the original rock salt cubic structure.According to the abovementioned inspection, it can be determined that light is the energy source for the catalytic reaction, and the physical properties of the NC-160 photocatalyst remain unchanged during the reduction process. 3.5.Influence of O 2 in Catalytic Reactions.In addition, compared with the light conversion under the same concentration (0.03) of simulated air Ar/CO 2 , the yield of NC-160 photocatalytic CO 2 -CO in air is 17 times higher (Figures S3 andS4).By simulating an Ar/O 2 /CO 2 mixture of 21 O 2 and 0.03 CO 2 , we are surprised to find that the introduction of O 2 restores the reaction activity to the light conversion gain in the air state (Figure 6a).The reduced electrons are more diverted to form CO rather than H 2 (Figure 6b).This means that the addition of a small amount of O 2 in the low-concentration system can promote the occurrence of CO 2 RR through a certain mechanism.We will discuss this in the next section.In short, with the help of the alcohol amine and Ru, NC-160 achieved a high conversion rate of light CO 2 RR and system recyclability in real air.In the actual process of waste gas treatment, both the air and the waste gas from power plants contain low concentrations of O 2 .Therefore, by constructing a flow cell reactor, the system is expected to directly treat atmospheric waste gas, avoiding the high cost of pretreatment and separation. 9,42,43.6.Reaction Mechanism of CO 2 Photoreduction in Air.In the CO 2 RR process, the active intermediates of the combination and conversion of CO 2 and the catalyst system often determine the reaction path and product selectivity.The use of quasi-in situ drift spectra (Figure 7a,c-e) revealed a series of the CoO photocatalyst changes in the reaction intermediates of CO 2 RR in air. 4445546 The adsorption and activation of CO 2 molecules on the catalyst surface are important parts of the CO 2 RR process.Figure 7a shows two adsorption modes of CO 2 : carbon-coordinated monodentate carbonate m-CO 3 2-(1443 cm -1 ) and oxygen-coordinated b-CO 3 2-(1465 and 1069 cm -1 ).The absorption band at 1375 cm -1 comes from HCO 3-, which receives protons.Since CO 2 RR was performed in air, a weak CO 2 adsorption mode appeared within 1 min of the test.With the progress of the catalytic reaction, the intensity of m-CO 3 2-increased significantly, while b-CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -showed a certain degree of decline.Under visible light, new absorption bands corresponding to CO 2 RR intermediates gradually appeared.For example, 1663 cm -1 can be matched with carboxylate COOH, and the tensile vibration peaks at 1150 and 1028 cm -1 can be assigned to the -CH 3 group of methoxy CH 3 O -.The strength of these two new bands increased significantly, proving the continued progress of the reaction.The absorption peak at 1180 cm -1 corresponds to the bridged methoxide species.The weakening of the peak here is due to the consumption of the hole sacrificial agent triethanolamine during the reaction.Compared with commercial CoO, the reaction intermediates of CO 2 RR are basically the same, and the slight shift of the individual absorption peaks may be due to the introduction of N, which causes the different vibrational frequencies of the molecules.In addition, it can be clearly observed that NC-160 reached the highest reaction rate in 10 min.At 60 min, the formation of the intermediate basically reached an equilibrium state.This proves that under the same test conditions, the reaction rate of NC-160 is far higher than that of other samples.This finding is also consistent with the catalytic test results (Figure 5a).The increasing absorption peak at 3308 cm -1 corresponds well to the surface -OH of the catalyst. Quasi-in situ Raman technology is used to detect the transformation process of intermediates derived in the CO 2 RR process to prove the authenticity of the quasi-in situ infrared test.The quasi-in situ Raman spectra of the NC-160 CO 2 RR reaction in the air are shown in Figure 7b.The corresponding peak positions of the corresponding intermediates were searched according to public knowledge. 4748849 The CO 2 in the air is partially absorbed by water, and the vibration peaks of the generated HCO 3 -and CO 3 2-are located at 1145 and 1496 cm -1 , respectively.It can be clearly seen that the peak signal becomes stronger, which means that the carbon dioxide in the air will not be consumed within 1 h (note: the test dosage of the quasi-in situ Raman catalyst is 1/40 times that of the quasiin situ infrared catalyst).The signal peaks at 303, 389, and 1837 cm -1 can be assigned to the CO ads , Co-C-O bonds, and surface vacancy-adsorbed CO.The increase in vibration is consistent with the conclusion that CO is the main reduction product in the experimental results, and it also confirms that the vacancy is the reaction site of NC-160.Three representative CO peaks showed significantly enhanced signals, indicating that NC-160 can maintain good CO 2 RR catalytic activity and an extremely high catalytic rate in air.The signal peaks at 989 and 1045 cm -1 are caused by the symmetrical and asymmetrical tensile vibrations of the COOH group and OC-O, respectively.At the same time, the increased signal peak at 718 cm -1 can be attributed to the surface hydroxyl -OH group, 47 which matches the peak at 3308 cm -1 in the quasi-in situ infrared measurement.TEOA is continuously reduced during the photoreduction process.Based on previous experience and the comparison under Ar/ CO 2 , we speculate that the enhanced -OH signal peak is caused by the reduction of trace O 2 in air. During the catalysis process, alcohol amine is continuously consumed as a sacrificial agent.Therefore, O 2 is likely to form an increasing number of surface -OH groups during the photoreduction process.HRTEM analysis was performed on the NC-160 catalyst after exposure to an oxygen-containing atmosphere (Figure 8a).The results show that the surface hydroxyl reduces the surface crystallinity of the catalyst.The electrochemical analysis shows (Figure 8b,c) that a small number of amorphous regions promotes the separation and transfer of charges and enhances the stability of low-valence defect metal oxides in the air.The linear voltammetry test proved that in an oxygen-containing atmosphere, the photogenerated -OH group changes the hydrogen evolution overpotential of the catalyst, making it more difficult for the hydrogen evolution reaction to occur.At the same time, more photogenerated electrons can be used to reduce CO 2 to CO. Based on the abovementioned analysis of quasi-in situ infrared spectroscopy and quasi-in situ Raman spectroscopy combined with previous investigations, 50 we proposed the possible evolution path of the NC-160 photocatalyst for CO 2 RR.The photoreduction pathway takes the carboxyl group and methanol as the characteristic reduction intermediate.The light-excited Ru dye undergoes a reduction quenching process, and the generated electrons undergo single-electron coupling and single-proton transfer on the surface of the catalyst with CO 2 in different adsorption states to form surface -COOH groups.Most of the COOH groups undergo oneelectron dehydration reduction to form CO. This is a ratedetermining step.The other part of COOH continues to be hydrogenated to form formic acid, which is then dehydrated to form formaldehyde.Formaldehyde continues to be hydrogenated and reduced to an important intermediate, methoxy CH 3 O, whose enhancement can be clearly observed in the quasi-in situ infrared results.Finally, methanol undergoes twoelectron reduction and dehydration to obtain methane.Compared with pure CoO, the adsorption strength of the Ndoped CoO sample at 1 min is basically the same, but the modified sample accelerates the rate of COOH generation.This is consistent with the results obtained from the electrochemical test above.The transmission rate of photogenerated electrons will be greatly improved due to the formation of a surface charge polarization of N-doped CoO.Therefore, it is easy for N-doped CoO to get more CO and CH 4 products. The following are possible reaction pathways from quasi-in situ tests for N-doped CoO during photocatalytic CO 2 RR 3.7.Possible Mechanism of Electron Transport in Solvent.The contact angle test proved that NC-160 has a smaller contact angle and better wettability to the MeCN/H 2 O system (Figure S6).Therefore, to further study the influencing factors of the CO 2 RR solvent system on the product performance, we conducted comparative experiments in solvent systems under different conditions (Figure 5f).The comparative experiments determined that NC-160 can detect the output of the product in the presence of water, catalyst, and TEOA.Also, O 2 will accelerate the reduction of CO 2 at low concentrations.First of all, this means that NC-160 is the active site of the reaction, and Ru only acts as a cocatalyst.Second, due to the strong adsorption capacity of acetonitrile for CO 2 , the utilization and conversion efficiency of CO 2 at low concentrations are improved.Finally, TEOA also plays an important role as a hole sacrificial agent in the reaction.According to previous reports, 10,51 we speculated about the formation of electrons in the entire catalytic system (Scheme 2).With the aid of the sacrificial agent and hydrogen ions, the Then, the water ionization produces hydrogen ions that combine with the CO 2 molecules adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst to cause a reduction reaction.Finally, the reduction product is released from the surface of the reactant."}], "reactor type": [], "operation mode": []}}
