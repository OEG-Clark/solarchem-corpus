    "content": "Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) has been widely investigated in photocatalysis due to its excellent semiconductor properties.Though various strategies have been used to optimize the catalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 , the influence of thickness itself on the photoelectric properties and CO 2 reduction activity of g-C 3 N 4 is still unclear.In this work, g-C 3 N 4 with various thickness were successfully prepared by high-temperature exfoliation, and applied for the photoreduction of CO 2 .It was found that the conduction band (CB) of g-C 3 N 4 samples shifted to negative position with decreasing thickness due to quantum confinement effect.Meanwhile, the more negative CB position endowed g-C 3 N 4 with higher reduction potential that favors the reduction of CO 2 .Moreover, the specific surface area remarkably increased with higher exfoliation degree accompanied by more exposed active sites.The thinner g-C 3 N 4 thickness also led to the exposure of ample edge amino groups that are beneficial for CO 2 adsorption.Furthermore, the high-temperature exfoliation were also benefit for optimizing the crystal structure of g-C 3 N 4 and reducing defect structures, which significantly inhibits the recombination of electronhole pairs and facilitates the migration of charge carriers.These merits of g-C 3 N 4 with high exfoliation degree synergistically catalyze the photoreduction of CO 2 with high efficiency."

    "content": "The g-C 3 N 4 samples with different thickness were prepared through high temperature calcination and thermal oxidative exfoliation two-step method (Scheme 1).Firstly, 3 g of melamine was placed in a porcelain boat which was then covered with silver paper and calcined in muffle at 550 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 C/min.The bulk g-C 3 N 4 was obtained as yellow solid (about 1.5 g) and named as CN-1.The block CN-1 was grounded into fine powder for further use.Subsequently, the powder CN-1 was placed in a semi-covered porcelain boat and calcined at 550 C for different time with a heating rate of 5 C/min.The samples calcined at 550 C for 4 h, 6 h, and 8 h were about 0.8 g, 0.5 g, and 0.3 g, and marked as CN-2, CN-3, and CN-4 respectively. The catalytic performance of the prepared catalysts were evaluated in a homemade quartz reactor with a volume of 200 mL.Typically, 0.02 g of catalyst was uniformly dispersed on the bottom of a quartz beaker which was placed in the quartz reactor containing 0.5 mL H 2 O. Subsequently, the reaction system was purged with CO 2 thoroughly to remove the air in the reactor.Then the reaction system was subjected to irradiation under simulated sunlight (Xenon lamp, 300 W) for 4 h.The reaction sample was collected every 1 h from the reaction system and analyzed by a chromatography (GC5890, Nanjing kejie instrument) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) detector and methanation instrument."

    "content": "The structure properties of the prepared g-C 3 N 4 with various thickness was characterized using a series of methods and displayed in Fig. 1.The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were used to analyze the crystal structure of the samples as shown in Fig. 1A.Clearly, all samples present two characteristic diffraction peaks at around 12.9 and 27.5 .These two peaks are respectively assigned to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) crystal face of g-C 3 N 4 , which are derived from the in-plane tri-s-triazine repetitive unit and the interlayer stacking of g-C 3 N 4 424344.The above results indicate that all the prepared samples reserve the main structure of g-C 3 N 4 .Interestingly, the diffraction peak intensity at 12.9 decreases with the declined sample thickness from CN-1 to CN-4, implying the disordered stacking state of tri-s-triazine unit in the samples with thinner structure 45,46.This result matches well with the structure of g-C 3 N 4 with few layers.Meanwhile, the peak shape of (0 0 2) crystal face gradually becomes narrow and sharp from CN-1 to CN-4, suggesting that the CN-4 presents more ordered crystal structure compared with CN-1.This phenomenon results from the high temperature oxidative exfoliation strategy of preparing catalysts, which is beneficial for optimizing the structure of g-C 3 N 4 .In addition, the (0 0 2) peak position varies with the samples thickness change.The diffraction peaks within 25-29 is magnified to further learn the law of change of g-C 3 N 4 with various thickness, as displayed in Fig. 1B.It is found that the (0 0 2) peak shows a redshift with decreased sample thickness from 27.5 of CN-1 to 27.8 of CN-3, while further reduced thickness has little influence on the diffraction angle.These results suggests that the interlayer space decreases with the reduction of sample thickness, in accordance with the previous report 37. The surface functional groups of the prepared catalysts were investigated using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra as shown in Fig. 1C.All the samples present a sharp peak at 810 cm -1 and two broad peaks at 1200-1700 and 3000-3600 cm -1 , which are attributed to the tri-s-triazine system 46, full condensed C -N( -C) -C (or bridging C -NH -C) units, and N -H (or O -H) stretching vibration, respectively.The results imply that the type of functional groups on the surface of CN-1 are almost unchanged after the high temperature exfoliation, indicating the stability of the catalysts.Meanwhile, the peak intensity at 810 cm -1 gradually increases with the degree of exfoliation from CN-1 to CN-4, suggesting better crystal structure with the decreasing g-C 3 N 4 thickness.The absorption bands within 3000-3600 cm -1 increase from CN-1 to CN-4, suggesting that more amino or hydroxyl groups are exposed with increasing exfoliation degree.Meanwhile, the peak located at 1204, which is attributed to C-N stretching vibration, also increases with higher exfoliation degree, implying that the increased absorption bands mainly derived from more exposed amino groups rather than hydroxyl groups.In addition, the stronger peak at cm -1 of CN-4 compared with that of CN-1 indicates the better CO adsorption ability of CN-4.This phenomenon is attributed to the ample amino groups of CN-4 which are beneficial for CO 2 adsorption. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm was performed to learn the specific surface area and pore volume of the prepared catalysts (Fig. 5D).Clearly, all samples display type IV isotherm 47, indicating the mesoporous structure of these catalysts.The textural parameters of the samples are presented in Table 1, the specific surface area enhances with increasing exfoliation degree of the catalysts from 12.49 m 2 g -1 of CN-1 to 81.64 m 2 g -1 of CN-4.Meanwhile, the pore volume change follows the Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of the synthesis procedure of g-C 3 N 4 with different thickness.same rule as that of specific surface area.The higher specific surface area enables more active sites expose to reactant and shortens the transport pathway of charge carriers from inside of a catalyst to the surface.Besides, the porous structure of CN-4 can offer ample channels for mass transfer.All the merits mentioned above are beneficial for the improvement of photocatalytic performance. The morphology of the samples were further investigated by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and shown in Fig. 2. Clearly, CN-1 presents block-like structure with a relative smooth surface, which is the typical structure of bulk g-C 3 N 4 .While CN-2 displays amorphous morphology with small block structure that is completely different from CN-1.This special morphology is originated from the high-temperature oxidative exfoliation and further condensation of g-C 3 N 4 , which may lead to better crystal structure as proved by XRD characterization.With the time extends of high-temperature treatment, the sample CN-3 is exfoliated into twist small sheet-like structure, as shown in Fig. 2C.In spite of this, the morphology of CN-3 is still a mixture of small sheet and block, which can be further optimized.The CN-4 presents a significantly improved, large sheet morphology with further prolonging treatment time.Interestingly, the small particles in CN-2 and CN-3 are almost disappeared in CN-4, instead the loosely stacked thin sheet dominates the morphology.From the above results we can conclude that the exfoliation and extension of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheet may go on simultaneously during the high-temperature treatment of the samples.The SEM results are in good agreement with the XRD and IR characterization.Atomic force microscope (AFM) was obtained to further investigate the impact of exfoliation conditions on the thickness of the carbon nitride samples.The bulk phase of both CN-1 and CN-2 are rather thick, which limits the measurement of their thickness.Thus the small particles at the edge of two samples were chose to study these two samples.It was found that CN-1 and CN-2 show blocky amorphous morphology, matching well with the SEM images (Figure S1).Interestingly, the thickness of the samples decreases with longer exfoliation time from about 93 nm of CN-1 to approximate 45 nm of CN-2.Moreover, the thickness of the samples declines with further prolonging exfoliation time, as indicated in Fig. 3.Both CN-3 and CN-4 display thin lamellar texture (Fig. 3A and3C).Meanwhile, the thickness of CN-3 and CN-4 are approximate 1.7 and 0.8 nm, respectively (Fig. 3B and3D).Thus, the thickness of CN sample decreases with increasing exfoliation degree.The AFM images are in good agreement with the SEM results. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was obtained to investigate the surface chemical state variation with the exfoliation of g-C 3 N 4 and presented in Fig. 4. All the samples present three peaks of O, N, and C at around 532.6, 398.1, and 287.3 eV, suggesting that no extra element is introduced during the exfoliation process of g-C 3 N 4 .High resolution N 1 s spectra of the catalysts were obtained to learn the chemical state of N element (Fig. 4B).The deconvolution of all samples display four peaks located at 398.7, 400.1, 401.g-C 3 N 4 during the exfoliation process.Similarly, the C 1 s and O1s binding energy of CN-2, CN-3, and CN-4 also remain the same as that of CN-1 (Figure S2 andS3), implying that the exfoliation of g-C 3 N 4 has little influence on the chemical state of the elements in the samples.That is no new functional groups are generated in the treated samples, matching well with the FT-IR results.Thus, the catalytic activity variation of the prepared samples all derives from the thickness and crystal structure changes due to the high-temperature exfoliation.The XPS characterization excludes the extra elements and functional groups impact on the catalytic performance of the prepared samples. A series of methods were taken to study the influence of thickness on its light absorption and utilization efficiency decreases. The photocurrent density and charge carriers transport ability of the samples were evaluated using transient photocurrent and impedance and summarized in Fig. 6.Clearly, the photocurrent gradually increases from CN-1 to CN-4 (Fig. 6A), and the current intensity of CN-4 (Acm -2 ) is about 15 times higher than that of CN-1 (0.4 Acm -2 ).According to previous reports, the intensity of the photocurrent depends on the photoinduced charge carrier separation rate between electrode and semiconductor materials, and the interface recombination rate of photoexcited electron-hole 52,53.Thus the above results suggest that exfoliation of g-C 3 N 4 into thinner sheet-like morphology can remarkably facilitate the separation efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole pairs.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed to further learn the charge charrier transport ability and displayed in Fig. 6B.The inset in Fig. 6B is the equivalent electronic circuit used to fit the Nyquist plot in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and the corresponding fitting information is presented in Figure S4.The semicircle observed in all the samples is related to the electrochemical reaction impedance 54.It is found that the arc radius of the prepared samples gradually decreases from CN-1 to CN-4 with declining sample thickness, indicating that the charge carrier transfer efficiency is increased from CN-1 to CN-4.The above results suggests that thinner sheet-like structure favors the migration of charge carriers, matching well with the previous reports 36,55.According to XRD analysis, the sample with higher exfoliation degree presents better crystal structure and reduced the defect structure which can serve as the recombination center for electrons and holes.Thus, the excellent charge carrier migration behavior of thinner CN-4 can be attributed to the follow reasons: (1) the better crystal structure of CN-4 extends the -conjugated system which is beneficial for electron migration, and reduces the defect amount that serve as recombination center for electron-hole pairs; (2) the thinner structure shortens the migration pathway of electrons from bulk phase to surface and greatly declines the recombination of electrons and holes.The defect structure of these samples were investigated using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technology and displayed in Fig. 7.All the samples exhibit an EPR signal, indicating the existence of defect structure.Interestingly, the signal intensity decreases with enhancing exfoliation degree from CN-1 to CN-4.The EPR signal of CN-4 is almost disappeared, indicating the better crystal structure of CN-4.The EPR analysis suggests that high-temperature exfoliation can not only reduce the thickness of a catalyst, but also optimize the crystal structure of g-C 3 N 4 based catalyst and reduce the defect in g-C 3 N 4 .The EPR results are in good agreement with the XRD, transient photocurrent, and impedance conclusion.Meanwhile, the greatly reduced sample thickness significantly shortens the charge carrier migration pathway from inside to the surface of the catalyst, and remarkably lowers the recombination possibility of electrons and holes.The effective electronhole pairs separation, fast charge carrier migration speed and reduced transport pathway of CN-4 all favor the improvement of photocatalytic catalytic activity. In addition to the charge carrier separation and migration efficiency, the conduction band (CB) and valance band (VB) position, that is redox potential, also play a critical role in the photocatalytic reactions.XPS valence band spectra of the prepared samples were used to obtain their VB position as shown in Fig. 8.It is found that the VB position of CN-1, CN-2, CN-3, and CN-4 are 1.90, 1.95, 1.89, and 1.91 eV, respectively.According to the band gap calculated from Tauc plots, the bandgap are respectively 2.81, 2.97, 3.03, and 3.08 eV from CN-1 to CN-4.Thus the CB position from CN-1 to CN-4 are -0.91,-1.02, -1.14, -1.17, respectively.Besides, the Mott-Schottky plots of the samples were also investigated to further confirm their band structure (Figure S6).The flatband potential (FB) of the four samples from CN-1 to CN-4 are -1.01,-1.12, -1.24, -1.27 eV (vs.Ag/AgCl), which can be converted to -0.81, -0.92, -1.04, -1.07 V (vs.NHE) 56.It was reported that the CB of n-type semiconductors is usually 0.1 V beneath the FB potential 57,58.Thus the CB potential of the samples from CN-1 to CN-4 based on Mott-Schottky plots respectively are -0.91,-1.02, -1.14, and -1.17 V, mating well with the results obtained from XPS VB spectra.The bandgap structure and the reduction potential of some CO 2 derived products are summarized and displayed in Fig. 9.It is found that the CB potential shifts to negative position from CN-1 to CN-4 with increasing exfoliation degree, indicating the reduction ability gradually increases from CN-1 to CN-4.The increased reduction potential is attributed to the quantum confinement effect as mentioned above.Furthermore, the reduction potential of all the samples are more negative than the reduction potential of the CO 2 derived products listed in Fig. 9, and the oxidative potential of all the catalysts are more positive than the oxidative potential of H 2 O (0.82 V).Hence, all the samples are able to convert CO 2 to the product listed in Fig. 9 with H 2 O in the absence of any sacrificial agent.However, the bandgap width increases with decreasing thickness from CN-1 to CN-4, indicating the reduction of light response region of the samples with thinner structure, which is unfavorable for the photocatalytic reaction. Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is a complicated multistep reaction.The catalytic performance is correlated to a number of factors such as light response region, photoinduced electron-hole pair separation efficiency, charge carrier migration ability, redox ability of the CB and VB of a catalyst.The photocatalytic reduction performance of the catalysts prepared in this work was evaluated through solid-gas reaction system with water vapor as sacrificial agent in the absence of any solvent.To confirm the origin of C element in the product, the reduction reaction was performed in N 2 rather than CO 2 atmosphere with other reaction conditions unchanged (Fig. 10A).Clearly, no product was obtained in N 2 atmosphere, indicating that the C element derives from CO 2 rather than the decomposition of g-C 3 N 4 catalyst. It is found that the CO evolution rate increases with declined sample thickness from 11.01 molg -1 of CN-1 to 54.42 molg -1 of CN-4 in 4 h (Fig. 10A).This results suggests that though the light response region reduces, the photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 material with higher exfoliation degree remarkably enhances.The excellent catalytic activity of the samples with higher exfoliation degree may originate from the reasons below: (1) large specific surface area and more exposed catalytic active sites enhance the contact between reactant and reactive sites; As an important criteria to assess a catalyst, the catalytic durability of CN-4 was evaluated by four successive catalytic cycles.After each cycle, the reaction system was purged with CO 2 thoroughly and filled with CO 2 .Thereafter, the reaction system was performed under the same conditions as a typical photoreduction CO 2 reaction.The recycle experiment shows that after four successive reactions the CO evolution rate was almost the same as that of the fresh catalyst, indicating the excellent catalytic stability of CN-4. The possible reduction mechanism of CO 2 over bulk g-C 3 N 4 and exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 are illustrated in Fig. 11.Under light irradiation, bulk g-C 3 N 4 is excited to produce electrons and holes.Then the adsorbed CO molecules on the active sites are reduced to CO by the photo-induced electrons, and H 2 O molecules are oxidized by holes to give H and O 2 .However, the limited active sites, inefficient electron-hole separation efficiency, and low charge carriers transport speed constrain the catalytic performance of bulk g-C 3 N 4 .When it comes to exfoliated g-C 3 N nanosheet (CN-3, CN-4), extensive edge amino groups and active sites are exposed to adsorb and active CO 2 molecules due to the large specific surface area.Furthermore, the high-temperature exfoliation optimizes the crystal structure of g-C 3 N 4 , enhances the electron-hole pair separation efficiency and facilitates the charge carrier migration speed.Meanwhile, the nanosheet structure remarkably shortens the migration pathway of charge carriers from inside to the surface of g-C 3 N 4 , which also inhibits the recombination of electrons and holes.Finally, the more negative CB position of exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 nanosheet due to the quantum confinement effect greatly enhances their reduction ability towards CO 2 reduction.The above merits of exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 synergistically catalyze the photoreduction of CO 2 to its reduced derivatives with high efficiency."

    "content": "Nanostructure has significant influence on the catalytic performance of a catalyst.Though g-C 3 N 4 with various morphology has been successfully prepared and applied in the field of CO 2 photoreduction, the impact of thickness on the catalytic activity is still ambiguous.In this contribution, the relationship between the thickness of g-C 3 N 4 and its photoelectric properties was studied in detail.Characterization results showed that the light absorption region declines, while the reduction potential enhances with reduced g-C 3 N 4 thickness.Meanwhile, the specific surface area of g-C 3 N 4 increased gradually with the reduction of thickness, along with more exposed active sites and edge amino groups.In addition, the crystal and defect structures were greatly optimized during the high-temperature exfoliation process.In spite of the narrowed light absorption range, the reduced electron-hole pairs recombination rate, declined charge carrier migration resistance, shortened charge transport pathway remarkably enhanced the light utilization efficiency.The excellent utilization efficiency together with the ample active sites and intense CO 2 adsorption ability accelerate the photoreduction of CO 2 .This work reveals the influence of thickness on the physicochemical and photoelectric properties of g-C 3 N 4 , as well as their impact on the catalytic performance towards CO 2 reduction.We hope this work may serve as a reference for other researchers.
