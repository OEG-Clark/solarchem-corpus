    "content": "Photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2 as a reductant over gold (Au)-doped TiO2 nanocatalysts in a continuous monolith photoreactor has been investigated.The nanocatalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, N2 adsorption-desorption and UV-Visible spectroscopy.Crystalline nanoparticles of anatase phase TiO2 were obtained in the Au-doped TiO2 samples.CO was the major product over 0.5 wt. Au-doped TiO2 with the yield rate of 12,305 ppm g-catal.-1 h -1, 318 times higher than un-doped TiO2 catalyst.Significantly higher photoactivity of Au-doped TiO2 was obviously due to fast electron transfer with hindered recombination rates and larger illuminated surface area inside the monolith channels.The CO production rate was gradually reduced with increasing the space velocity.The stability of the reused catalysts for CO production sustained at cyclic runs.It is evident Au-doped TiO2 nanocatalyst supported over monolith channels is highly potential for continuous CO2 photoreduction to CO and hydrocarbons."

    "content": "The gold-doped TiO2 catalysts were synthesized using modified sol-gel method as reported previously (Tahir and Amin, 2015a).Typically, a mixture of 7 mL acetic acid and 10 mL isopropanol was added to a mixture of 10 mL titanium tetra isopropoxide in 30 mL isopropanol under vigorous stirring.The stirring was continued for 24 h until a clear sol was produced.Next, calculated amount of gold chloride (HAuCl2.3H2O), dissolved in isopropanol, was added to the titanium solution and stirred for the next 6h until clear and thick sol was obtained.The monoliths were dip-coated in the resulting Au/TiO2 sol for a few seconds and excess sol was blown off using compressed hot air.The Au/TiO2 monoliths and the remaining sol were dried at 80 C for 12 h and finally calcined at a rate of 5 C min -1 up to 500 C and held for 5 h. Similarly, TiO2 samples were prepared using the same procedure.Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on Bruker D8 advance diffractometer.Cu-K radiation was used, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with a scan range of 10-80 degree (2), a scan speed of 1.2 degree (2) per min and wavelength () of 1.54A o.The morphology of the nanocatalysts was estimated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) carried out with JEOL JSM6390 LV SEM instrument.N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms was performed at -196 o C using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 Surface Area and Porosity Analyser.Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra of the samples were determined using Agilent, Cary 100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrated sphere. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2 as a reducing agent was conducted in a cylindrical stainless steel reactor of continuous flow with a total volume of 150 cm 3 as depicted in Figure 1 (a).The chamber was equipped with a quartz window for passing light irradiations from the reflector lamp.The catalyst coated ceramic monoliths with channels per square inch (CPSI) 200 were inserted in the middle of the chamber.The light source used was a 200 W Hg lamp for UV irradiation source.The light intensity of 150 mW cm -2 was measured with an online optical process monitor ILT OPM-1D and a SED008/W sensor.All the experiments were carried out in a continuous mode using different flow rates at fixed CO2/H2 molar feed ratios of 1.0.The compressed CO2 and H2 flow rates were regulated by mass flow controllers (MFC).The products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890 N, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionized detector (FID)."

    "content": "The XRD spectra of TiO2 and Au-doped TiO2 samples are presented in Figure 1 (b).The XRD peaks of pure TiO2 and Au-doped TiO2 revealed a pure crystalline and anatase phase TiO2.The peaks pertaining to Au-doping into TiO2 were not detected.In the case of 0.3 wt. Au, the TiO2 crystallite size slightly decreased but has no significant effect in 0.5 Au-loaded TiO2 (Table 1).This revealed a value of around 171 nm was found for all the samples with no appropriate change with the introduction of gold.Similar observations are reported previously (Hidalgo et al., 2011).The SEM images of the nanoparticles catalyst and coated over the monolith channels are presented in Figure 2. The morphology of the catalyst coated monolith is shown in Figure 2 (a-b).It is obvious that the catalyst was entirely coated over the channel surface with no broken layer observed.The TiO2 nanoparticles are obvious in Figure 2 (c), identified as spherical and mesoporous TiO2 structure.Similarly, Au-doped TiO2 nanoparticles are shown in Figure 2 (d).Obviously, gold-doped TiO2 nanoparticles are uniform in size with higher mesoporosity.Figure 3 (a) exhibits the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of TiO2 and Au-doped TiO2 nanoparticles.All the isotherms have close resemblance with type IV curve with obvious hysteresis loops, thus conforming TiO2 and Au-doped TiO2 as mesoporous materials.The monolayer-multilayer adsorption on the internal surface is obvious in the initial part of the isotherms (at low P/Po).The capillary condensation could be seen in the upper part of isotherms at higher P/Po, where the steep increment in the adsorption volume is observed as the pores were saturated with the liquid.(Tahir and Amin, 2015a).The specific surface area, pore volume and pore sizes of all the samples are reported in Table 1.The BET surface area of TiO2 was 2 /g closer to BET surface area of Au-doped TiO2.Thus in the case of Au-doped-TiO2 samples, the increase in the surface area was not significant.It is evident that Au-doping in TiO2 samples could not alter the BET surface area, confirming no significant effect on TiO2 morphology.However, the larger BJH surface area of all the Au-doped TiO2 samples are attributed to the suppression of TiO2 crystal growth by Au-doping, thus enhancing mesoporosity.Similarly, BJH adsorption pore volume increased with Audoping.Thus, the increased in the BJH surface area and pore volume was obviously due to the controlled crystal growth in the Au-doped TiO2 samples.The optical properties of the pure TiO2 and Au-doped TiO2 were studied by measuring the absorbance spectra of wavelengths ranging from 200 to 800 nm as presented in Figure 3 (b).All the samples of Audoped TiO2 show higher absorbance intensities than un-doped TiO2.The presence of Au metal improves the absorbance spectra towards visible light due to their optical absorption spectrum ranging between 500 to 700 nm, associated with surface plasmon resonance absorption peak of Au-metal.These results confirmed that the Au-metal could enhance TiO2 photoactivity in the visible region due to plasmonic response.The band gap energies were determined using Tauc plot i.e. (ahv) 2 versus (hv) by extrapolating the linear region of the plot to the intercept of the photon energy axis.The obtained band energy values of TiO2 and Au-doped TiO2 catalysts are reported in Table 1.The band gap energy of pure TiO2 was 3.12eV, reduced to 3.03 and 2.93 eV for 0.3 and 0.5 wt. Au-doped TiO2 samples, respectively.This shows Au impurity level is beneficial for extending the absorption spectrum wavelength towards the visible region. Preliminary investigations of CO2 photo-reduction with H2 was performed in a continuous flow monolith photoreactor at 100 C and feed flow rate 20 mL/min.The carbon containing compounds was not detected in the cases of (a) catalyst coated monolith without reactants under UV-irradiation, (b) reactants with catalyst coated monoliths without UV-irradiation.This confirmed catalysts and monoliths did not degrade and any carbon containing compounds produced were derived from CO2 through photocatalysis.The effects of Au-loading into TiO2 for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2 to CO through RWGS reaction using different irradiation times at 100 C, CO2/H2 ratio 1.0 and flow rate 20 mL/min are presented in Figure 4 (a).At the start of the reaction, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction into CO was significantly higher in all Au-doped TiO2 catalysts.The maximum CO production was observed initially and then gradually reduced over the irradiation time.Using un-doped TiO2 poor photoactivity is registered attributed to higher electronhole pair's recombination rate over the TiO2 surface.By doping Au-metal into TiO2, there was a substantial increase in CO2 reduction to CO as the major reduction product.A 0.5 wt. Au-doped TiO2 catalyst was optimum, then the yield rates gradually decreased with higher Au-doping.The maximum production of CO over 0.5 wt. Au-doped TiO2 was 12,305 ppm g-catal. -1 h -1 , 318 times higher than un-doped TiO2 catalysts calculated based on 2h irradiation time.Significantly higher TiO2 photoactivity in the presence of Au-metal was obviously due to the plasmonic effects with hindered recombination of charges over the Audoped TiO2 surface and efficient light distribution inside monolith channels.Furthermore, in continuous monolith photoreactor, there were efficient adsorption-desorption processes, more production of electronhole (e-/h) pairs and their mobility over Au-doped TiO2 catalysts, resulting in much higher CO production.This development confirmed higher performance of monolith photoreactor in continuous flow over Audoped TiO2 catalysts.Among the hydrocarbons, CH4 was found to be the major product in continuous monolith photoreactor at different irradiation time (0-10 h) as presented in Figure 4 (b).Using lower Au-doped TiO2, higher CH4 yield rate was observed, and then gradually decreased at more Au-loading.Besides, initially, CH4 yield increased and then decreased at an elongated irradiation time until reaching to steady state.The decreased in CH4 production by the irradiation time was probably due to the following: Firstly, when the reaction start-up, there was higher photoactivity of catalysts, thus more production of electrons, resulting in higher CO2 photoreduction to CH4.At prolonged irradiation times, CH4 production decreased, possibly due to decrease in catalyst photoactivity.Secondly, at the start-up of reaction time, there was adsorbed CO2 and H2, which efficiently converted to CO and CH4 in the presence of higher mobility of electrons.However, at a prolonged reaction time, there was the efficient desorption of CO with the feed stream, resulting lower possibility of its conversion to CH4.Third possibility may be the photo-oxidation of CH4 with oxygen at a prolonged irradiation time in the presence of efficient monolithic catalysts, resulting in decreased of CH4 production.However, the further investigation is required to find out the actual possibly way in the reduction of CH4 production.The hydrocarbon products observed were C2H4,C2H6,C3H6 and C3H8.The production of higher hydrocarbons confirmed higher performance of Au-doped TiO2 monolithic catalysts compared to un-doped TiO2.The effects of space velocity on the performance of Au-doped TiO2 catalyst for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2 in a monolith photoreactor are presented in Figure 5 (a).The reactant feed rates were changed to vary the space velocity at fixed CO2/H2 molar ratio and keeping all other parameters constant. With the increase in space velocity, production of CO and hydrocarbons gradually decreased.It indicates, at the same reaction conditions, a lower space velocity results in higher CO2 photoreduction.This is because a lower space velocity gives the reactant gases longer residence time over the catalyst surface in a monolith photoreactor (Tahir et al., 2015).In order to examine the stability of the photocatalyst, experiments were repeated for certain times on the recycled catalyst coated monoliths.After each cycle, the monolith was removed from the reactor and placed in open air for 24 h before starting the next run.The stability test for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2 over Au-doped TiO2 catalyst is illustrated in Figure 5 (b).It is noticeable CO yield was higher in the first run; gradually decreased in the second photocatalytic cyclic run, but a slight decrease in CO yield was observed after third run.Therefore, the Audoped TiO2 catalyst partially lost its activity in cyclic runs for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2 to CO.In the case of hydrocarbons, in first cyclic run, catalyst exhibits much higher CH4 yield which gradually decreased in second and third cyclic runs.This was possibly catalyst lost partial photoactivity for CH4 productions as explained previously.Similarly, hydrocarbons production also decreases after every run, confirming no coke production over the catalyst surface.These results exhibited better initial activity of Audoped TiO2 for the production of CH4 and hydrocarbons.The colour of Au-doped catalyst during photocatalytic CO2 reduction remained un-changed during every cyclic run when catalyst coated monolith was exposed to open air.These results confirmed higher stability of Au-doped TiO2 catalyst, with supressed coke production."
