    "content": "The photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to valuable fuels is a promising strategy for the prevention of rising atmospheric levels of CO 2 and the depletion of fossil fuel reserves.However, most reported photocatalysts are only active in the ultraviolet region, which necessitates co-catalysts and sacrificial agents in the reaction systems, leading to an unsatisfied economy of the process in energy and atoms.In this research, a CuMo x W (1-x) O 4 solid solution was synthesized, characterized, and tested for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of amines.The results revealed that the yield of CH 3 OH from CO 2 was 1017.7 mol/g under 24 h visible light irradiation using CuW 0.7 Mo 0.3 O 4 (x 0.7) as the catalyst.This was associated with the maximum conversion (82.1) of benzylamine to N-benzylidene benzylamine with high selectivity (99).These results give new insight into the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 for valuable chemical products in an economic way."

A series of CuMo x W (1-x) O 4 solid solution photocatalysts was prepared by a typical hydrothermal synthesis method, in which X is defined as the molar ratio of Mo/(Mo W).Setting the preparation of CuMo 0.1 W 0.9 O 4 (X 0.1) as an example: 10 mmol Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O was dissolved in 250 mL distilled water as precursor solution A. Onethousandth of a mol of NaMoO 4 2H 2 O and 9.0 mmol NaWO 4 2H 2 O were dissolved in 250 mL distilled water as precursor solution B. Precursor solution A was added dropwise to precursor solution B under a strong stirring condition in 30 min, during which the mixtures turned blue-green and more suspended substance appeared.After the addition, the suspended substance (about 80 mL) was then transferred into a 100 mL autoclave and heated at 180 C for 24 h.After cooling to room temperature, the obtained product was then filtered and washed with distilled water and anhydrous alcohol several times and then dried in a vacuum at 80 C for 10 h.The other photocatalysts could be easily prepared in the same way by adjusting the molar ratio: Mo/(Mo W). Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in 40 mL anhydrous acetonitrile with 0.06 g corresponding to the photocatalyst and 1 mmol benzylamine (purified by distilled before using) in an 80 mL self-made quartz reactor at 0.5 MPa CO 2 partial pressure.Before the reaction, the reactor was evacuated with high-purity dry CO 2 gas and blown through several times to remove lesser quantities of oxygen, and then it was tightly closed.Before illumination, the reaction system was stirred under darkness to prompt CO 2 adsorption and desorption equilibrium after blowing CO 2 for 30 min.Then, a Xe lamp (300 W) with a 420 nm cut-off filter was turned on as the light source for the photocatalytic reactions.During the processes, the reaction temperature was maintained at room temperature with a circulating cool water bath.After the reactions were complete, the products were immediately analyzed by GC (Figure S1), 1 H NMR (Figure S2), and MS (Figure S3).Detailed calculations of methanol yield, conversion rate of benzylamine, and selectivity of N-benzylidenebenzylamine are shown in the Supporting Information."

UV-vis DRS spectra of the solid solutions were obtained, and the results are shown in Figure 4.The samples had a wide absorption with a wavelength range from 350 nm to 750 nm.A bathochromic shift absorption band (from 570 to 610 nm) was observed with increasing x values from 0 to 0.7.With a further increasing x value (from 0.8 to 1.0), a blue-shifted absorption band was observed from 620 nm to 580 nm.The different trends of the absorption bands can be verified via XRD spectra.When x 0.7, these samples were in the form of CuWO4 H2O, but, when x 0.7, they were in the form of Cu (MoO ) (OH) .Generally speaking, the absorption of the lower band is more easily disturbed by the introduction of Mo and W than the higher bands, which indicates that a charge transfer from to or contributes to the formation of the absorption band.This is consistent with a paper by Gaudon et al. 57,58. As is well known, photoluminescence (PL) emission can be used to discover carrier transfer and recombination efficiency because it is caused by the recombination of photogenic carriers.Lower PL emission intensity suggests a lower recombination rate and exhibits higher photocatalytic activity for a photocatalyst 59,60, as shown in Figure 5, as the value of x increases from 0 to 0.7, the fluorescence intensity of the samples gradually weaken.This is mainly because the Mo content is gradually increasing, which inhibits the recombination of photogenerated charges and carriers, thereby improving the photocatalytic activity.The fluorescence intensity of the samples was gradually strengthened with further increases in x value (from 0.8 to 1.0).It is obvious that the PL emission spectra of samples can be divided into two categories (Figure 5).One type of spectrum was obtained for x values in the range of 0.8 to 1.0, showing strong PL emission with emission intensity increasing with increasing x value.Another emission intensity, lower than the former, was found when the x values were between 0 to 0.7.All optical results revealed that the photocatalytic activity of CuMo0.7W0.3O4(x 0.7) is optimal for the system.

All optical results revealed that the photocatalytic activity of CuMo 0.7 W 0.3 O 4 (x 0.7) is optimal for the system. To investigate the performance of various photocatalysts prepared hydrothermally, the photocatalytic oxidation of amine to imine coupling with the reduction of CO2 to CH3OH was carried out under visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation and a 0.5 MPa CO2 pressure environment.The detailed results are shown in Table 2.These results prove that CH3OH was selectively obtained from CO2, and imine was produced from the oxidation of amine, which were further confirmed with GC, NMR, and MS analysis (Figures S1-S3).We found that benzylamine can be converted to N-benzylidene benzylamine with high selectivity (99) and CO2 can be converted to CH3OH with good productivity after 12 h irradiation with photocatalysts.Moreover, the results suggested that CuW0.7Mo0.3O4(x 0.7) was the optimum photocatalyst among the examined samples, which showed the highest conversion of benzylamine (57.2) and high selectivity towards Nbenzylidenebenzylamine (99) within 14 h irradiations (Table 2, entry 4), and received the highest productivity of CH3OH up to 671.8 mol/g.These results are almost consistent with optical observations.Therefore, the CuW0.7Mo0.3O4(x 0.7) was selected as the photocatalyst in the following experiments.In addition, the results of two blank reactions showed that the conversion of benzylamine was 7.1 and 91.3 in the absence of catalyst and in the presence of catalyst, respectively. To investigate the performance of various photocatalysts prepared hydrothermally, the photocatalytic oxidation of amine to imine coupling with the reduction of CO2 to CH3OH was carried out under visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation and a 0.5 MPa CO2 pressure environment.The detailed results are shown in Table 2.These results prove that CH3OH was selectively obtained from CO2, and imine was produced from the oxidation of amine, which were further confirmed with GC, NMR, and MS analysis (Figures S1-S3).We found that benzylamine can be converted to N-benzylidene benzylamine with high selectivity (99) and CO2 can be converted to CH3OH with good productivity after 12 h irradiation with photocatalysts.Moreover, the results suggested that CuW0.7Mo0.3O4(x 0.7) was the optimum photocatalyst among the examined samples, which showed the highest conversion of benzylamine (57.2) and high selectivity towards Nbenzylidenebenzylamine (99) within 14 h irradiations (Table 2, entry 4), and received the highest productivity of CH3OH up to 671.8 mol/g.These results are almost consistent with optical observations.Therefore, the CuW0.7Mo0.3O4(x 0.7) was selected as the photocatalyst in the following experiments.In addition, the results of two blank reactions showed that the conversion of benzylamine was 7.1 and 91.3 in the absence of catalyst and in the presence of catalyst, respectively.

visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation and a 0.5 MPa CO 2 pressure environment.The detailed results are shown in Table 2.These results prove that CH 3 OH was selectively obtained from CO 2 , and imine was produced from the oxidation of amine, which were further confirmed with GC, NMR, and MS analysis (Figures S1-S3).We found that benzylamine can be converted to N-benzylidene benzylamine with high selectivity (99) and CO 2 can be converted to CH 3 OH with good productivity after 12 h irradiation with photocatalysts.Moreover, the results suggested that CuW 0.7 Mo 0.3 O 4 (x 0.7) was the optimum photocatalyst among the examined samples, which showed the highest conversion of benzylamine (57.2) and high selectivity towards N-benzylidenebenzylamine (99) within 14 h irradiations (Table 2, entry 4), and received the highest productivity of CH 3 OH up to 671.8 mol/g.These results are almost consistent with optical observations.Therefore, the CuW 0.7 Mo 0.3 O 4 (x 0.7) was selected as the photocatalyst in the following experiments.In addition, the results of two blank reactions showed that the conversion of benzylamine was 7.1 and 91.3 in the absence of catalyst and in the presence of catalyst, respectively.The time plot for the oxidation of benzylamine to the corresponding imine under 0.5 MPa of CO 2 on CuW 0.7 Mo 0.3 O 4 (x 0.7) is shown in Figure 6a,b.With prolonged irradiation time, the conversion of benzylamine was significantly enhanced, accompanied by an increased yield in CH 3 OH.As shown, the yield of CH 3 OH increased slightly within 10 h, and then obviously increased as time continued.With visible irradiation for 24 h, 82.1 of benzylamine was converted and 99 of them were selectively transformed to the corresponding imine, and the CO 2 was converted to CH 3 OH with high productivity up to 1017.7 mol/g, suggesting a satisfactory photocatalytic efficiency and selectivity under visible light conditions.The time plot for the oxidation of benzylamine to the corresponding imine under 0.5 MPa of CO2 on CuW0.7Mo0.3O4(x 0.7) is shown in Figure 6a,b.With prolonged irradiation time, the conversion of benzylamine was significantly enhanced, accompanied by an increased yield in CH3OH.As shown, the yield of CH3OH increased slightly within 10 h, and then obviously increased as time continued.With visible irradiation for 24 h, 82.1 of benzylamine was converted and 99 of them were selectively transformed to the corresponding imine, and the CO2 was converted to CH3OH with high productivity up to 1017.7 mol/g, suggesting a satisfactory photocatalytic efficiency and selectivity under visible light conditions.Motivated by preceding results, the substrate scope of the oxidation of other amines to corresponding imines coupling with the reduction of CO2 to CH3OH with photocatalytic CuW0.7Mo0.3O4(x 0.7) was also carried out.Detailed results, shown in Table 3, show that the oxidative coupling reactions of the amine derivatives to their corresponding imines coupling with the formation of CH3OH from CO2 could proceed well under the same conditions.However, different substrates can present great differences in the conversion of amines and the yield of CH3OH.Methyl-substituted benzylamines at the o-, m-, and p-positions of the benzene ring (Table 3, entries 2-4) can also be converted, but there are slight differences in the conversion process, and it can been seen from the Table 3 that their conversion rates differ vary greatly, which might to be relative to the effect of the steric hindrance.It can be ascribed to the electronic effects associated with electron withdrawing substituents (entry 5-6) and electron donating substituents (entry 4,7) on the benzene ring have an obvious effect on the conversion rate of amines, as well as the yield of formation of CH3OH.Two halo-substituted benzylamines could be oxidized to corresponding imines with a conversion of 30 and yield of 221.4 mol/g of CH3OH.Moreover, heterocyclic amines were also transformed into the corresponding imines (entries 9-10).However, when aliphatic amines were selected as the substrates (Table 3, entry 11,12), no imines were obtained.Motivated by preceding results, the substrate scope of the oxidation of other amines to corresponding imines coupling with the reduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH with photocatalytic CuW 0.7 Mo 0.3 O 4 (x 0.7) was also carried out.Detailed results, shown in Table 3, show that the oxidative coupling reactions of the amine derivatives to their corresponding imines coupling with the formation of CH 3 OH from CO 2 could proceed well under the same conditions.However, different substrates can present great differences in the conversion of amines and the yield of CH 3 OH.Methyl-substituted benzylamines at the o-, m-, and ppositions of the benzene ring (Table 3, entries 2-4) can also be converted, but there are slight differences in the conversion process, and it can been seen from the Table 3 that their conversion rates differ vary greatly, which might to be relative to the effect of the steric hindrance.It can be ascribed to the electronic effects associated with electron

To measure the reusability of the photocatalyst, the CuW 0.7 Mo 0.3 O 4 (x 0.7) was selected and re-used with the same reaction conditions three times.Before the proceeding reaction, the used photocatalysts were purified by thorough washing with CH 3 CN.Figure 7 illustrates cycling runs of CuW 0.7 Mo 0.3 O 4 (x 0.7) in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 coupling with amine selective oxidation to imine under visible light irradiation.It is clear that the high photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared sample minimally decreased after three recycles, indicating good photocatalytic stability of the photocatalyst under visible light irradiation.The decrease in photocatalytic efficiency was mainly due to the loss of crystal water in the photocatalyst after use.with electron

conversion rates differ vary greatly, which might to be relative to the effect of the steric hindrance.It can be ascribed to the electronic effects associated with electron withdrawing substituents (entry 5-6) and electron donating substituents (entry 4,7) on the benzene ring have an obvious effect on the conversion rate of amines, as well as the yield of formation of CH3OH.Two halo-substituted

    "content": "In summary, a series of CuW x Mo (1-x) O 4 solid solutions were prepared and applied to the reduction of CO 2 into CH 3 OH coupling with the conversion of aromatic amine into its corresponding imine.The results revealed that the yield of CH 3 OH from CO 2 was 1017.7 mol/g under 24 h visible light irradiations using an optimized photocatalyst, CuW 0.7 Mo 0.3 O 4 (x 0.7).The catalyst chosen was associated with the maximum conversion (82.1) of benzylamine to N-benzylidene benzylamine with high selectivity (99).Further experiments revealed that CuW 0.7 Mo 0.3 O 4 (x 0.7) exhibited good substrate suitability, photocatalytic activity, and photocatalytic stability.All results should be helpful for the design and application of economical photocatalysts for the reduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH under visible light. 4 H 2 O 54,55 (JCPDS no.: 33-0503).For x 0.8, several sharp diffraction peaks appeared and intensified, indicating that these photocatalysts are in a good crystalline state.2 values of 20.4,21.4,24.9, 25.3, 25.4, and 25.9 correspond to the Cu 3 (MoO 4 ) 2 (OH) 2 of the (021) (101), (121), ( Figure 1.XRD patterns of nanoparticles prepared by hydrothermal method at 180 C.
