    "content": "The development of a facile strategy to construct stable hierarchal porous heterogeneous photocatalysts remains a great challenge for efficient CO 2 reduction.Additionally, hole-trapping sacrificial agents (e.g., triethanolamine, triethylamine, and methanol) are mostly necessary, which produce useless chemicals, and thus cause costs/environmental concerns.Therefore, utilizing oxidation ability of holes to develop an alternative photooxidation reaction to produce value-added chemicals, especially coupled with CO 2 photoreduction, is highly desirable.Here, an in situ partial phosphating method of In 2 O 3 is reported for synthesizing InP-In 2 O 3 p-n junction.A highly selective photooxidation of tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) into value-added dihydroisoquinoline (DHIQ) is to replace the hole driven oxidation of typical sacrificial agents.Meanwhile, the photoelectrons of InP-In 2 O 3 p-n junction can induce the efficient photoreduction of CO 2 to CO with high selectivity and stability.The evolution rates of DHIQ and CO are 2 and 3.8 times higher than those of the corresponding In 2 O 3 n-type precursor, respectively.In situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron spin resonance are utilized to confirm that the direct Z-scheme mechanism of InP-In 2 O 3 p-n junction accelerate the efficient separation of photocarriers."

    "content": "Indium chloride (InCl 3 ), L-cysteine, triethylenetetramine (TETA) were purchased from Aladdin Ltd. (China).Sodium hypophosphite, anhydrous magnesium sulfate and triethanolamine (TEOA) were purchased from JK Chemical Ltd.(China).Tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives was purchased from Bide Pharmatech Ltd. (China).The carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) gas was bought from Air Liquide (Tianjin) Co., Ltd.(China).Deionized water (DIW) was used in all the experimental processes.All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. InS-TETA inorganic-organic hybrids were synthesized according to our previously work 44.In a typical procedure, tartaric acid (2 mmol), InCl 3 (1 mmol) and L-cysteine (6 mmol) were added into a mixture solvent of DIW and TETA with a total volume of 18 mL (V DIW /V TETA 2:1) in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave.After stirring to form a homogeneous solution, the autoclave was sealed and treated at 160 C for 24 h.Then, it was cooled down naturally to room temperature.The white precipitate was washed by DIW and absolute ethanol, respectively, and dried in a vacuum oven to produce InS-TETA. A 10 mg as-prepared InS-TETA was put into a solvent of 12 mL DIW in a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave under stirring to form a homogeneous solution.The autoclave was sealed and kept at 180 C for 10 h.The yellow precipitate was washed by DIW and absolute ethanol, respectively, and dried in a vacuum oven to produce hierarchical porous In 2 S 3 microsphere. A 50 mg as-prepared hierarchical porous In 2 S 3 microsphere was put into a tube furnace.Then, the sample was heated to 500 C with a rate of 1 C/min, and kept at 500 C for 3 h under flowing air atmosphere.Finally, it was cooled down naturally to room temperature to produce hierarchical porous In 2 O 3 microsphere. InP-In 2 O 3 was synthesized by gas-solid reaction using sodium hypophosphite as phosphorus source 45.First, 10 mg as-prepared In 2 O 3 and 5 mg NaH 2 PO 2 H 2 O were put in two separate quartz boats with NaH 2 PO 2 H 2 O at the upstream side for the furnace.Subsequently, the samples were heated to 300 C for 1, 2 and 3 h, respectively (see details in Table S1 and Figure S6, Supporting Information online) in a closed Ar atmosphere at a rate of 2 C/min (take the 2 h sample as example of InP-In 2 O 3 mentioned in the text).After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was washed with DIW and absolute ethanol several times, respectively, and finally dried in a vacuum oven overnight. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Bruker D8 Focus Diffraction System (Germany) using a Cu K source (0.154178nm) and the in-situ and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a photoelectron spectrometer using Al K radiation as the excitation source (PHI 5000 VersaProbe) with or without illumination.All the peaks were calibrated with C 1s spectrum at binding energy of 284.8 eV.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) analysis were taken with a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (Japan) equipped with the Thermo Scientific energy-dispersion X-ray fluorescence analyser (USA).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution TEM (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscope EDS (STEM-EDS) element mapping images were obtained with Tecnai G2 F20 system equipped with EDAX.UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorbance spectrum was tested on Shimadzu UV3600 (Japan).The gas chromatographmass spectrometer (GC-MS) was carried out with TRACE DSQ.The liquid phase product was measured on Aglient 7890A (USA) with thermal conductivity (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID).Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on Varian Mercury Plus 400 instruments (USA) at 400 MHz ( 1 H NMR) and 100 MHz ( 13 C NMR).Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm) down field from internal tetramethysilane.Multiplicity was indicated as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), mm (multiplet), dd (doublet of doublet), br (broad).Coupling constants were reported in Hz.The injection temperature was set at 280 C.Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at 1.5 mL/min.The gas phase product was measured on Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus (Japan) with barrier discharge ionization detector (BID).The electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis was obtained with Bruker A300 and 300 W Xe lamp (Germany) with the light intensity of 500 mW/cm 2 in the wavelength region of 320-780 nm. The CO 2 photocatalytic reduction is performed in a nonproton environment using Sneaker bottle, which could avoid the competition hydrogen evolution reaction and improve the energy conversion efficiency for CO 2 reduction.In a typical procedure of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, 25 mg photocatalyst was well-dispersed in CO 2 purged mixture solution of 25 mL acetonitrile and 0.02 mmol THIQ.300 W Xe lamp with the light intensity of 500 mW/cm 2 in the wavelength region of 320-780 nm was used as the light source.To eliminate the thermal effect, condensate water (25 C) was introduced to cooling down the system.The generated CO was characterized and quantified by GC-2010 Plus with BID using the following equation.The measurement of the THIQ conversion was discussed later.The evolution rate of CO were calculated using the equation of where C is the concentration of CO in standard gas, t is the illumination time, m is the mass of used catalyst, and V is the volume of used Sneaker bottle."

    "content": "Nanosheet-based porous hierarchical In 2 O 3 spheres were synthesized by air oxidation of the corresponding In 2 S 3 precursors 45.Then, the partial phosphating process was carried out by gas-solid reaction using sodium hypophosphite as the phosphorus source (see the details in the Supporting Information online).The SEM images (Figures S1-S3 The PRC was performed under the illumination of 300 W Xe lamp (see Supporting Information online for details).As shown in Figure 3(a), the photogenerated electrons and holes from exited InP-In 2 O 3 are used to reduce CO 2 and oxidize THIQ, respectively.During the irradiation, the evolving amount of CO, and the conversion of THIQ and its oxidative product were monitored by gas chromatography.For comparison, the performance of In 2 O 3 was also evaluated (see details in Table S1 and Figure S9(a-c)).As displayed in Figure 3(b), 0.02 mmol THIQ can be alomost completely converted after 10 h illumination over InP-In 2 O 3 , superior to that of pure In 2 O 3 .The oxidation product of THIQ is DHIQ, which is determined by NMR spectrum and GC spectrometry and the selectivity of DHIQ is up to 97 (Figures S11 andS12).Meanwhile, the amount of CO over In 2 O 3 and InP-In 2 O 3 shows nearly linear growth to 178 and 663 mol/g, respectively (Figure 3(c)).In addition, the ratio of reduction product/oxidation product is 0.93, which is slightly deviated from 1 due to the deviation of manual injection.Besides, no obvious CO can be detected without THIQ (Figure 3(f)), illustrating the boosted CO 2 -to-CO conversion reaction in the presence of THIQ.Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity of InP-In 2 O 3 is retained after five runs (Figure 3(d)), suggesting a good stability of the as-pyepared catalyst (Figures S14 andS15).The rates of CO production and conversion of THIQ are kept at about 62 mol/(g h) and 92, respectively, suggesting the robust durability of InP-In 2 O 3 .To verify the carbon source of CO formation, 13 CO 2 isotope experiment was carried out.The results of mass spectrometry show that 13 CO (m/z29) is detected once CO 2 is replaced by 13 CO 2 , indicating the carbon atom of evolved CO originates from CO 2 feedstock (Figure 3(e)).In addition, when using Ar as the reaction gas, CO cannot be detected, further confirming that CO product stems from PRC. To investigate the substrate tolerance, 6-Br-and 6,7-dimethoxy-THIQ were selected as the representative electro- withdrawing and -donating groups, respectively.Impressively, THIQ with electro-withdrawing or -donating groups can either be facilely oxidized and show an extremely acceptable conversion and high selectivity, simultaneously.And the CO yield can reach 170 mol/(g h) for 6,7-dimethoxy-THIQ, suggesting the evolution rate of CO 2 -to-CO can be accelerated by suitable THIQ derivatives (Figure 3 (f)). A series of characterizations were adopted to elucidate the enhanced PRC performance of InP-In 2 O 3 in the presence of THIQ.First, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra (Figure S13 much stronger than the signal of InP and In 2 O 3 , which indicated that the Z-scheme system exists much higher separate and tranfer efficiency.Therefore, the fabrication of a Zscheme system in InP-In 2 O 3 p-n junction, rather than type-II heterojunction, is a rational reason for boosting the CO 2 -to-CO reaction by coupling with THIQ oxidation.Based on above results, a plausible photocatalytic mechanism for coupling the CO 2 -to-CO reaction with the THIQ photooxidation over InP-In 2 O 3 is proposed in Scheme 1.The transfer of charge carriers in Z-scheme InP-In 2 O 3 is shown in Figure 1, which is endowed the prolonged lifetime of photogenerated carriers to boost surface chemical reaction.For details, the photogenerated holes from In 2 O 3 oxidize the THIQ to the associated cation radical A, which is subsequently deprotonated to form intermediate B (a radical anion).After taking off another proton and releasing one electron, the target product (DHIQ) is acquired.As reported in previous work 35, the released protons can be reduced by the electron from InP to generate H 2 .However, only little amount of H 2 was detected in our system.It is well known that a single electron transfer process is undergone to form surface adsorbed CO 2 -in the first step of CO 2 reduction reaction 16, which will abide further reaction with electrons and protons 31.According to the aforementioned information and our experimental results, we make a reasonable inference that the released protons from THIQ and photogenerated electrons will attack the CO 2 -to form CO and H 2 O.The Z-scheme system fabricated by InP-In 2 O 3 and the presence of THIQ are responsible for boosting CO 2 -to-CO conversion reaction, and simultaneously yielding valueadded DHIQ with high selectivity."

    "title": "Conclusions",
    "content": "In summary, a facile in situ partial phosphating method has been developed to synthesize InP-In 2 O 3 p-n junction for photocatalytic conversion CO 2 to CO with 92 selectivity.The CO evolution rate can be boosted after integrating with the dehydrogenation of THIQ derivatives.Such photooxidation reaction of THIQ can lead to the highly selective formation of DHIQ.After decorated with electron-donating groups, the evolution rates of both CO and dehydrogenation product can be increased, and reach to 170 and 200 mol/(g h) for CO and the dehydrogenation product of 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-THIQ, respectively.Such excellent performances are attributed to the efficient separation/ transfer caused by the Z-scheme mechanism of nanosheetbased InP-In 2 O 3 p-n junction.Our work may not only provide new opportunities for both CO 2 conversion and DHIQ derivatives with excellent selectivity and high economic value, but also open up a promising method of THIQ derivatives to replace oxygen evolution reaction or sacificant agents during CO 2 conversion reaction. Figure 1 Schematic diagram illustrating the synthesis and energy band diagram of of InP-In 2 O 3 p-n junction nanosheet-based porous microspheres (color online). ) show the successful preparation of nanosheet-based porous hierarchical In 2 O 3 spheres.After phosphating, the hierarchical porous morphology of In 2 O 3 can be maintained (Figure 2(a)).The TEM image (Figure 2(b)) indicates the nanosheet-based morphology of as-prepared materials.In the HRTEM image (Figure 2(c)), the fringe spacing of 0.42 nm matches well with the (211) lattice plane of In 2 O 3, and some amorphous parts can be clearly seen (the red circle in Figure 2(c)).The amorphous region may be caused by phosphatization.After crystallization at elevated temperature in Ar atmosphere, all the fringe spacings can be attributed to the mixture of In 2 O 3 and InP (Figure 2(d)), revealing the heterogeneous components of In 2 O 3 and InP rather than Pdoping structure.Such hybrid InP-In 2 O 3 structure is confirmed later by its Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism.Although the exact reason for the formation of heterogeneous materials is still unclear, the InP-In 2 O 3 hybrids may be associated with the InP-In 2 O 3 interface energy and the elastic repulsion between neighboring In 2 O 3 , as discussed in the initial randomly distributed Ag 2 S small islands on CdS during the partial cation exchange reaction of CdS nanorods with Ag cations 46.The high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) image and the associated STEM-EDS element mapping images (Figure 2(e)) suggest the existence of phosphorus element in the samples.All the XRD peaks are found to originate from cubic In 2 O 3 (JCPDS NO.06-0416) (Figure 2(f)).After crystallization, some weak peaks indexed to cubic InP (JCPDS NO.32-0452) can be seen (Figure S4), confirming the compositions of InP and In 2 O 3 in the samples.XPS is introduced to verify the element valence state of asconverted samples (Figure 2(g) and Figure S5).For InP-In 2 O 3 , the peak located at 129.5 eV can be ascribed to P 3-.The slightly shift toward higher binding energy of InP-In 2 O 3 than InP, which was caused by the surrounding O atoms with stronger electronegativity 47, and the weak peak intensity compared with the pure InP indicated the partial phosphating of the initial In 2 O 3 .All the aforementioned results demonstrate the successful preparation of InP-In 2 O 3 .
