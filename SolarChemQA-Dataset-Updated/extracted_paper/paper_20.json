    "content": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 by water was performed in the presence of a Ag/TiO 2 catalyst under illumination by lamps with different wavelengths (254, 365, and 400 nm).The yields of the main products (methane and methanol) were higher with the 254 nm lamp than with the 365 lamp while no products were observed with the 400 nm lamp.This was because the electron-hole generation rate increased with increasing energy of irradiation (decreasing wavelength) and there were higher densities of electron states at higher energies in TiO 2 .The increased efficiency of electron-hole generation with a shorter wavelength irradiation increased the efficiency of the catalyst.The energy of the electrons excited by visible light (400 nm) was too low for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction."

    "content": "Pure TiO 2 and silver-enriched TiO 2 powders were prepared by the sol-gel process in a reverse micellar environment.Pure TiO 2 was synthesized by the addition of titanium (IV) isopropoxide (Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 , Aldrich, 99.999) into an inverse micellar solution made of cyclohexane (Aldrich, 99.9, HPLC grade), non-ionic surfactant Triton X-114 (C 27 H 48 O 7.5 , Aldrich), and distilled water.The molar ratio of cyclohexane:Triton X-114:water:Ti(OC 3 H 7 ) 4 was kept at 11:1:1:1 (volume ratio TX-114:cyclohexane 0.49).The beaker with the solution made of the appropriate amount of cyclohexane, Triton X-114, and water was stirred vigorously for 15 min for homogenization and formation of inverse micelles.After the addition of all the isopropoxide, the sol was stirred for another 10 min.The sol was left in a bowl exposed to air for 24 h.The rigid gel obtained was calcined at 400 C for 4 h in an air flow in a muffle furnace.Ag-enriched TiO 2 was similarly prepared, but with using a AgNO 3 (Aldrich, 99.9999) solution of suitable concentration (1.85 mol/L) instead of distilled water 34. The crystalline phase of the sample was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD).The specific surface area of catalyst was evaluated by the multipoint BET method from N 2 physical adsorption isotherms.A UV-Vis spectrophotometer was used to record the diffuse reflectance spectra of the sample. The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in a batch stirred annular reactor with suspended catalyst powder illuminated separately by 8 W Hg lamps of 254 and 365 nm and a 8 W Hg lamp filled with argon (400 nm) (Fig. 1).A liquid phase of 0.2 mol/L NaOH and catalyst loading of 1 g/L was used.GC/FID/TCD was used for the analysis of gas and liquid reaction products.The details of the preparation and characterization of the Ag/TiO 2 catalyst, and descriptions of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment and analytical methods have been previously described 34,35."

    "content": "The textural properties and absorption edge of the prepared pure TiO 2 and Ag-doped titania samples are given in Table 1, together with the actual Ag content.The samples had a relatively high surface area, and the positive effect of silver was evident.XRD analysis confirmed the presence of the anatase structure while Ag was not detected, which indicated that Ag was present as metallic clusters inside the TiO 2 powder.The UV-Vis spectra of the catalysts showed an absorption shift to the visible region for the Ag-TiO 2 catalysts 34. The effect of irradiation time on the formation of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction products was investigated with various wavelengths of radiation for periods of 0-24 h.Two main products were obtained, which were methane in the gas phase and methanol in the liquid phase.Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected.Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane, and ethylene could also be formed 14 but they were not detected.Methane and methanol produced versus irradiation time with wavelengths of 254, 365, and 400 nm for the Ag/TiO 2 catalyst are shown in Fig. 2 and3. A substantial increase of methane yield was observed after 8 h of irradiation with the 254 nm lamp on the Ag/TiO 2 catalyst (Fig. 2).The methane yield over the pure TiO 2 catalyst with the 254 nm lamp was markedly less than over Ag/TiO 2 . The yields of methane were significantly lower with the 365 nm lamp than with the 254 nm lamp and the values obtained were almost the same for the two catalysts. The yields of methanol with the 400 nm lamp were one order of magnitude lower than the yields of methane over the Ag/TiO 2 catalyst (Fig. 3).Data at 5 h were measured but these were below the limit of detection (12 g/L or 0.38 mol/g).The yields of methanol for the shorter radiation wavelength were higher and comparable with the yield of methane.Therefore CH 3 OH yields for the 400 nm lamp for both methane and methanol were not measured. Pure TiO 2 has a relative large energy band gap and can only be excited by high energy UV irradiation with a short wavelength (UVA).Efforts have been made to extend the light absorption range of TiO 2 from UV to visible light by adding noble metals.In this work the material used (Ag/TiO 2 ) has an absorption edge of 2.74 eV, so this catalyst was expected to be active with irradiation of a longer wavelength Vis or at least UVC.Unfortunately, electrons excited by visible light do not have sufficient energy for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 since the Ag energy levels were probably under the TiO 2 conduction band edge.The increased activity of TiO 2 with incorporated Ag 34 was probably not caused by a decreased absorption edge, but the more probable reason was a decreased carrier recombination rate due to the spatial separation of electrons and holes in the surrounding Ag clusters.The Ag content of 5.2 comprised silver atoms that were not randomly located in the TiO 2 crystal, but that probably formed metallic clusters inside the TiO 2 powder 34.These metal clusters would cause a decrease in the electron-hole recombination rate 3637383940.The Fermi level of TiO 2 is higher than that of silver metal 41. Some works have shown that the composite of two kinds of semiconductors or two phases of the same semiconductor was beneficial in reducing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, and thus enhanced photocatalytic activity.The interface between the two phases probably act to rapidly separate the photogenerated electrons and holes due to the difference in the energy levels of their conduction bands and valence bands 424344. The electron-hole generation rate increased considerably with increasing energy of irradiation (i.e.decreasing wavelength) due to the higher densities of electron states at higher energies in TiO 2 45,46.The increased efficiency of electron-hole generation increased the efficiency of the catalyst when a shorter wavelength irradiation was used.Our results are in agreement with other works on CO 2 photocatalytic reduction on TiO 2 catalyst initiated by UV sources with different wavelengths 32,33."

    "content": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of Ag/TiO 2 and TiO 2 catalysts under separate illumination by lamps of 254, 365, and 400 nm wavelength was studied.The radiation with the shorter wavelength of 254 nm was significantly more effective for CO 2 photoreduction than the 365 nm radiation, which was expected to be better from the Ag/TiO 2 band gap (2.74 eV).The increased efficiency of electron-hole generation with the shorter wavelength of irradiation increased the efficiency of the catalyst.The radiation with the wavelength of 400 nm was not effective at all, probably because the energy of electrons excited by visible light (400 nm) was too low for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.
