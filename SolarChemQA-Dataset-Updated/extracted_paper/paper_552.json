    "content": "Electron-hole pair separation efficiency and adsorption performance of photocatalysts to CO 2 are the two key factors affecting the performance of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with H 2 O. Distinct from conventional promoter addition, this study proposed a novel approach to address these two issues by tuning the own surface features of semiconductor photocatalyst.Three ZnO samples with different morphologies, surface area, and defect content were fabricated by varying preparation methods, characterized by XRD, TEM, and room-temperature PL spectra, and tested in photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.The results show that the as-prepared porous ZnO nanosheets exhibit a much higher activity for photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O when compared to ZnO nanoparticles and nanorods attributed to the existence of more defect sites, that is, zinc and oxygen vacancies.These defects would lower the combination rate of electronhole pair as well as promote the formation of basic zinc carbonate by Lewis acid-base interaction, which is the active intermediate species for photoreduction of CO 2 .ZnO nanoparticles and ZnO nanorods with few defects show weak adsorption for CO 2 leading to the inferior photocatalytic activities.This work provides new insight on the CO 2 activation under light irradiation."

    "content": "Preparation of ZnO with Different Morphologies.All of the chemical reagents were of analysis grade and used without further purification.ZnO particles were prepared by directly calcining Zn(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O at 500 C for 4 h.The obtained sample is marked as ZnO-NP.ZnO nanorods were synthesized via a solvothermal route by adjusting the pH of ZnCl 2 aqueous solution.For a typical preparation, a certain amount of ZnCl 2 was dissolved in deionized water to form a 0.1 mol L -1 solution.The pH of solution was adjusted to 6.5 by dropping a 1 mol L -1 NaOH into this solution.After being stirred for 1 h, the solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave.Subsequently, the autoclave was kept at 150 C for 16 h and then cooled to room temperature.The white precipitate was collected after centrifugal separation, washed with deionized water and ethanol three times, respectively, and dried at 80 C overnight.Finally, the sample was ground and calcined at 500 C for 2 h, which was designed as ZnO-NR.ZnO nanosheets were fabricated by annealing ZnS(en) 0.5 (en ethylenediamine) complex precursor.ZnS(en) 0.5 composites were synthesized via a solvothermal route according to the literature. 27In a typical procedure, a certain amount of Zn(CH 3 OO) 2 and thiourea was dissolved in 75 mL of ethylenediamine under constant stirring.Subsequently, the solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel.The autoclave then was kept at 200 C for 12 h.As the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the white precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with ethanol and deionized water alternately, and dried in a vacuum at 60 C overnight.ZnO nanosheets were prepared by annealing the as-synthesized ZnS(en) 0.5 composites at 700 C for 1 h in air.This ZnO sample is labeled as ZnO-NS. Characterization.The phase composition of the as-prepared products was determined by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD), which was recorded on a D/MAX-2500 automatic powder diffract meter equipped with the graphite monochromatized Cu K radiation flux ( 0.15418 nm) at a scanning rate of 0.2s -1 in the 2 range of 20-80.N 2 adsorption-desorption measurements were carried out at 77 K using Quantachrome Autosorb.The samples were degassed under vacuum at 473 K for 6 h before measurements were made.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation was used to calculate the specific surface area.The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method was used to determine the pore-size distribution.The morphologies of samples were characterized by a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM, 5 kV).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and higher-magnification transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were obtained with JEOL-2100F system (200 kV).Specimens for TEM and HRTEM measurements were prepared via drop-casting a droplet of ethanol suspension onto a copper grid, coated with a thin layer of amorphous carbon film, and dried in air.Ultraviolet and visible diffusive reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were taken on a UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 750), the scanned range being 250-600 nm against barium sulfate standard.The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded with Thermo Nicolet Nexus using the KBr disk method.In situ IR spectra for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O were also taken with the same spectrophotometer.First, the sample was annealed in an IR cell at 473 K in Ar for 2 h, and then CO 2 and H 2 O vapor were introduced into the cell.In situ IR spectra were recorded at different adsorption times.TPD of the coadsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O over ZnO-NS sample was performed to confirm the formation of the basic zinc carbonate and the stability of photocatalyst.In this experiment, 100 mg of catalyst was loaded in a quartz reactor, and the two ends were stuffed with asbestos fiber.Before the adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O, the catalyst was treated by heating to 648 K in N 2 for 2 h, and then the temperature of the reactor was cooled to 473 K.After that the feed stream was switched to a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor with a molar ratio of 5:1 at the flow rate of 30 mL/min for 30 min.After being cooled to room temperature, the reactor was heated to 673 K with a rate of 5 K/min in a N 2 flow of 30 mL/min.The desorbed gases were analyzed by an infrared gas analyzer.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were tested through using a Fluorolog 3 photoluminescence spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Japan).The spectra were obtained in the range of 350-750 nm using a 325 nm laser excitation.Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in an electrochemistry workstation (CHI 660, CH Instrument, Austin, TX) with a three-electrode system using a three-compartment glass cell.The working electrode was obtained by dropcasting a drop of as-prepared product on glassy carbon electrode.A platinum wire ring and a saturated calomel electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.The experiments were operated at room temperature with Na 2 SO 4 solution (0.1 mol L -1 ) as electrolyte. Photocatalytic Activity Test.CO 2 photoreduction experiments were conducted under irradiation of high-pressure mercury lamp (125 W) in a stainless steel tank reactor equipped with a top quartz glass (100 mm in diameter) and a heating platform.The temperature of platform was monitored by a thermocouple.In a typical experiment, 0.05 g of photocatalyst was loaded, and the temperature was maintained at 150-250 C.Prior to the irradiation, the reactor was flushed with CO 2 at the rate of 30 mL/min for 2 h to remove the air in the reactor.The valves of gas inlet and outlet then were closed, and 0.5 mL of deionized water was injected into reactor.After 4 h of irradiation, the products of the reaction were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph using a thermal conductivity detector (Agilent 4890, nitrogen as a carrier gas)."

    "content": "Morphologies and Structures of ZnO Semiconductors.Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of three ZnO samples prepared with different methods.It can be seen clearly that all patterns exhibit almost the same diffraction lines, which can be ascribed to wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS36-1451).This indicates that the difference of preparation methods did not alter the crystal structure of ZnO.The diffraction peaks of ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR samples are distinctly stronger and sharper when compared to those of ZnO-NS, revealing that ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR have much larger particle size and higher crystallinity than ZnO-NS.In addition, the ZnO-NS sample displays relatively higher diffraction intensity of (002) plane, while the other two samples possess stronger peaks of (100) and ( 101) plane.This result shows that the preferred orientation of ZnO-NS was along the c-axis. 28he morphologies of the obtained ZnO samples were investigated by SEM and TEM, as shown in Figure 2. ZnO-NP exhibits polyhedral structure and rod-like shape formed by the accumulation of polyhedral ZnO particles, and the particle sizes are in the range of 200-900 nm (Figure 2a andb).For the ZnO-NR sample, the hexagonal prisms were observed, which have an average diameter of ca.50-60 nm and length of 300-400 nm.ZnO fabricated by annealing ZnS(en) 0.5 are porous planar nanosheets with a size of 800 1000 nm 2 and a thickness of 80-100 nm, which were formed by the accumulating of small particles as presented in Figure 2g andh.Numerous pores with different size distribution are found all through each nanosheet with an ultrahigh density, which would obviously increase the surface area of ZnO nanosheets. As seen in the HRTEM images (Figure 2c, f, and i), welldefined crystal structures are revealed for three ZnO samples.The interplanar spacing of 0.28 nm for ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR consistent with the d-spacing of (100) plane of wurtzite structure ZnO was detected, 29 whereas the interplanar spacing of 0.26 nm for ZnO-NS was detected, which is related to the dspacing of (002) lattice planes of the wurtzite ZnO, suggesting that the nanosheets grow along the c-axis, the 0001 direction. 28These results are in agreement with the XRD patterns. The specific surface area and porosity of ZnO samples were examined by N 2 adsorption/desorption analysis.As depicted in Figure 3A, N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the ZnO-NS sample show typical irreversible type-IV curves, 30 with a distinct condensation step and a hysteresis loop, revealing the characteristics of mesoporous materials.Furthermore, the pore-size distribution curves of ZnO-NS exhibited mesoporous peaks with the range of 5-30 nm (Figure 3B).However, much smaller hysteresis loops in N 2 sorption/desorption isotherms and weak peaks in pore size distribution curves were observed for either ZnO-NP or ZnO-NR samples, which confirmed that ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR samples contain less pores.The BET specific surface areas, average diameters, and pore volumes of three ZnO samples were listed in Table S1.BET surface areas of ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR samples are 1.3 and 12.1 m 2 /g, respectively, which are much lower than that of ZnO-NS (82.1 m 2 /g).Pore volumes and average pore sizes for ZnO-NP, ZnO-NR, and ZnO-NS samples were 0.0087, 0.0093, and 0.52 cm 3 /g and 4.7, 4.0, and 17.3 nm, respectively, further proving that the ZnO-NS sample possesses more pore structure.The large surface area of ZnO-NS could be attributed to the porous structure of nanosheet, which may originate from the decomposition of ethylenediamine in the precursor. Optical and Electronic Properties of ZnO Semiconductors.The UV-vis absorption spectra of the asprepared ZnO samples are shown in Figure 4A.The strong characteristic absorption below 400 nm from all samples indicated the existence of crystalline ZnO, which is consistent with the above XRD results.When compared to ZnO-NP, ZnO-NS and ZnO-NR displayed a stronger absorption in the UV range, which might be due to specific crystallinity of these two samples.More importantly, ZnO-NS showed much more obvious absorption in the visible region ( 500-700 nm) than ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR (inset of Figure 4A), indicating that the ZnO-NS sample has more surface defects than ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR. 31In this work, ZnS(en) 0.5 was used as the precursor for ZnO-NS synthesis via thermal treatment in air where the substitution of S atoms by O atoms would result in the distortion of the crystal lattice in consideration of the smaller radius of O atoms than S atoms. 27Consequently, considerable tensile stress was formed and further would be released through the cracking of the crystal lattice leading to the formation of defect sites. For their direct band gap feature, the band gaps of ZnO samples were calculated according to the following formula: 32 where is the linear absorption, A is a constant, h is the photon energy, and E g is the direct band gap.Extrapolating the linear section of the (h)-(h/A) 2 to (h/A) 2 0, the intercept value is E g .The obtained plots were presented in Figure 4B, and the estimated E g values of ZnO were listed in Table S1.The E g values increase in the order of ZnO-NP, ZnO-NR, and ZnO-NS, which can be related to the particle size of ZnO samples as revealed by XRD, SEM, and TEM results in Figures 1 and2. The room-temperature PL spectrum was used to investigate the state of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the defects in the photocatalyst, as shown in Figure 4C.The PL spectra of ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR exhibited a broad UV emission band with a peak around 402 nm, which is considered as near band edge emission due to recombination of free excitons. 33It is notable that ZnO-NS showed two emission bands, a relative low UV emission band with a peak around 390 nm and a much stronger defect emission band with a peak around 508 nm.The UV emission band showed a blue shift of 12 nm when compared to that of ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR.The blue shift of UV emission band can be explained by the larger band gap of ZnO-NS.The defect emission was far stronger than UV emission, indicating that ZnO-NS contains a large number of surface defects.This broad visible emission from 425 to 650 nm can be attributed to the transition from native point defects in ZnO nanosheets, such as oxygen vacancy V O , zinc vacancy V Zn , interstitial zinc Zn i , and interstitial oxygen O i, as discussed earlier. 3334435 However, blue light emission around 460 nm from Zn i centers and red-orange emission around 657 nm from the intrinsic defects of O i are observed at very low scale in roomtemperature PL measurements.Therefore, the origin of this broad visible emission may be due to contributions from V Zn and V O . 36Furthermore, the morphology and structure of ZnO have a significant influence on the intensity of fluorescence emission. 37Among these three ZnO, ZnO-NS possesses the smallest emission band, implying the lowest combination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes. To provide additional evidence for the above suggested observation, the transient photocurrent responses of ZnO series were recorded for several on-off cycles under Xe lamp as shown in Figure 4D.ZnO-NR and ZnO-NS samples exhibit much higher photocurrents as compared to ZnO-NP.This enhancement could be attributed to the improved photo absorption in the range of UV light, large surface area, and low recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers. Photocatalytic Activity.The photocatalytic activities of three ZnO catalysts were evaluated by the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor at 200 C under UV light irradiation.In the control experiments, without irradiation or photocatalysts, no product was detected, indicating that the CO 2 reduction requires the coexistence of photocatalyst and light irradiation.Besides, only H 2 was detected when the high-purity N 2 replaced CO 2 in the reaction system, suggesting that the formed carboncontaining products originated from CO 2 but not contamination. In addition to oxygen, H 2 , CO, and CH 4 were found to be the major CO 2 reduction products, in accord with previous papers. 38,39Except for a trace amount of C 2 H 6 , other products such as CH 3 OH, CH 2 O, and HCOOH were not detected during the reaction. Figure 5 shows the evolution of the main products (H 2 , CO, and CH 4 ) of CO 2 reduction with H 2 O over ZnO photocatalysts prepared with different methods under UV light irradiation.After 4 h of irradiation, the ZnO-NP sample presents a relatively higher H 2 production rate of 84.30 mol/g cat /h, but those of CO and CH 4 are pretty low (8.68 and 0.32 mol/g cat / h).The H 2 production rate of ZnO-NR is slightly lower than that of ZnO-NP, which is about 66.80 mol/g cat /h, whereas its production rates of CO (57.96 mol/g cat /h) and CH 4 (0.52 mol/g cat /h) are obviously higher than those of ZnO-NP.As compared to the other two samples, ZnO-NS exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity, and H 2 , CO, and CH 4 production rates of 112.69 mol/g cat /h, 406.77 mol/g cat /h, and 20.16 mol/g cat /h are achieved.The accumulated yield of 4 h for H 2 , CO, and CH 4 over ZnO-NS reached 450.7, 1627.08, and 80.6 mol/g cat , respectively.The effects of reaction temperature on photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over ZnO-NS photocatalyst were also investigated, and the production rates of the main products at 150, 200, and 250 C are shown in Figure S2.It can be seen clearly that the increase of temperature significantly improves the rates of main products evolution.Reaction temperature was raised from 150 to 200 C, and the production rates of all main products were almost doubled.Further increase in reaction temperature to 250 C could increase the photocatalytic activity by 50.This obvious improvement may be due to the effect of temperature on \"dark\" reaction steps, such as the adsorption-desorption equilibrium of reactants and products, diffusion of adsorbed species, and other thermal catalytic reaction steps occurring on the semiconductor surface. Table 1 presents the distributions of main products and total CO 2 conversion rates for all ZnO samples at 200 C. Obviously, ZnO-NP shows a relative high evolution rate for H 2 , but those for CO and CH 4 are very low (the (COCH 4 )/ H 2 molar ratio 0.11), revealing that the photocatalytic water splitting to H 2 preferentially occurs over the ZnO-NP sample rather than photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .For ZnO-NR nanorod, the formation rate of H 2 is close to that of CO and CH 4 , suggesting it had comparable activity for water splitting and CO 2 reduction.The ZnO-NS sample exhibited a far higher production rate for CO and CH 4 than H 2 , on which the molar ratio of (COCH 4 )/H 2 of 3.80 was achieved.This result indicates that the ZnO-NS sample is a more efficient photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction.Moreover, it can be observed that H 2 O conversion over ZnO-NS is around twice those on ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR, while the CO 2 conversion on ZnO-NS is about 50 and 7 times those over ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR, respectively, suggesting that the promoting effects of ZnO-NS for H 2 O and CO 2 conversion rates are completely different.Although high surface area, good photoabsorption, and low recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of ZnO-NS can improve the photocatalytic activity, these variables are not major factors for remarkably changing product distribution and resulting in different promotion effects for H 2 O and CO 2 conversion because they should promote both the water splitting and the CO 2 reduction rates equally (or at least in similar order of magnitudes), which is not true in the above reaction test.Integrating the above discussion, it is reasonable to make the hypothesis that different active sites for CO 2 chemisorption leading to new chemisorbed state of CO 2 exist in ZnO-NS, which leads to a completely different product distribution and promotion effect on reactants' conversion as compared to ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR. To clarify the assumption that the new chemisorbed state of CO 2 formed on ZnO-NS, several techniques were adopted.XRD patterns of fresh, exposed to air for 72 h, and spent ZnO-NS sample are shown in Figure 6A.As compared to fresh ZnO-NS, sample placed in air for 3 days and those spent for 4 and 16 h exhibit new diffraction peaks in addition to those belonging to the wurtzite ZnO, which can be ascribed to the Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 phase (JCPDS no.72-1100).This result indicates that ZnO-NS would react with CO 2 and H 2 O to form basic zinc carbonate due to the reaction: Further evidence for the formation of Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 over ZnO-NS sample was obtained by FT-IR of three ZnO samples exposed to air for 72 h, as shown in Figure 6B.For the FT-IR spectrum of ZnO-NS, the absorption band at 3420 cm -1 related to hydroxyl groups was detected, while 1525, 1388, 1047, 837, and 713 cm -1 corresponding to the vibration of CO 3 2-were observed, which were consistent with those of Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 reported in previous papers. 40These absorption bands reveal the formation of Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 over ZnO-NS sample, which further confirmed the XRD results.However, ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR only displayed very weak absorption bands at 3420, 1525, and 1388 cm -1 , while other peaks due to Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 were not detected, which suggests that the amount of basic zinc carbonate is in a very low level over ZnO-NR and ZnO-NP samples.Furthermore, the peak centered at 1626 cm -1 , which was contributed from bidentate bicarbonate (b-HCO 3 -), the common adsorbed intermediate due to CO 2 adsorption on semiconductor, 18 was observed on ZnO-NR and ZnO-NP with weak signals, while it is not obvious over ZnO-NS.However, it is worth noting that the peak of 1525 cm -1 in ZnO-NS is very broad, which may cover other weak signals such as bidentate bicarbonate.In addition, in situ FT-IR spectra for the coadsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O at different adsorption times under reaction conditions were also taken, as shown in Figure 8B.It could be seen clearly that the strong bands ascribed to Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 were detected in 20 min, and the intensity of these bands increased gradually with the increase of adsorption time.This result further indicated that Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 was able to form under the reaction conditions in a short time.Figure 6C shows the TG analytic result of ZnO-NS exposed to air for 72 h at a heating rate of 10 C min -1 .There is an obvious weight loss from 225 to 275 C, resulting from the decomposition of Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 . 41The weight loss in this stage is about 20.5, indicating that close to 62 of ZnO was converted to Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 according to the reaction equation, which confirmed that Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 can be formed in a large number over ZnO-NS sample. The difference between the intermediates formed on the three ZnO catalysts can be attributed to different surface defect conditions.As revealed by UV/vis spectra and PL spectra, the ZnO-NS sample possesses more defect sites (i.e., V O and V Zn ) when compared to ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR, which can On the basis of the above analysis, we could conclude that the formation of novel intermediates basic zinc carbonate might be responsible for the enhancement of photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O over ZnO-NS sample.However, before accepting this assumption, it should be considered whether the adsorbed Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 can be converted to CO and CH 4 under light irradiation.Therefore, two experiments were performed.One is photocatalytic reaction using ZnO-NS with the formation of Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 as photocatalyst, in which feed gases were changed to high-purity N 2 and H 2 O.After light irradiation for 4 h at 200 C, CO, CH 4 , CO 2 , along with H 2 were detected, showing that Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 can be converted to CO, CH 4 , and CO 2 .To rule out the possibility that the obtained products were converted from the adsorbed gas phase CO 2 on catalyst surface, in situ light irradiation-mass spectrograph (MS) experiment was employed using Ar as carrier gas.Prior to the light irradiation, 50 mg of ZnO-NS with the formation of Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 was loaded into a reactor, and treated at an Ar flow of 50 mL/min at 170 C for 2 h to remove CO 2 and H 2 O absorbed on the surface.After the UV light was turned on, the formed products were brought into the mass spectrograph by Ar carrier gas.The obtained MS spectra were shown in Figure 7A.It can be seen that obvious CO, CH 4 , and CO 2 signals were detected, and the CO signal was significantly stronger than CH 4 , which agreed with photocatalytic reaction results, further proving that Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 is a reactive intermediate for photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.Moreover, it is notable that no H 2 product was observed, which was due to the fact that oxygen vacancies are electron acceptors, and OH absorbed on oxygen vacancies cannot be reduced to H 2 . On the basis of the above discussion, the band gap structure and possible mechanism for the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O over ZnO-NS were proposed as illustrated in Figure 7B.The zinc vacancy V Zn served as electron donors under light irradiation to chemisorb CO 2 and form CO 3 2-by Lewis acidbase interactions, while the H 2 O would dissociatively adsorb on oxygen vacancy V O to form OH. Accordingly, the novel strongly adsorbed intermediate basic zinc carbonate was produced, which facilitated the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 .However, the normal ZnO conductor band possesses weak adsorption for CO 2 , leading to an inferior efficiency for photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O, which is the case on ZnO-NR and ZnO-NP.The other active sites for H 2 O adsorption over the three catalysts are on the conductor band of ZnO (zinc ion) due to the acidic-basic interaction, which is responsible for the H 2 production.This explains why ZnO-NP and ZnO-NR samples exhibit fairly high H 2 production rates while holding low CO production rates. We also did the stability test over the ZnO-NS catalyst for four cycles (16 h), and the results are shown in Figure 8A.It is clear that the ZnO-NS catalyst remained stable for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O after running four cycles under experimental condition.The production rate of CO, H 2 , and CH 4 was observed to be 88, 100, and 90, respectively, of that from fresh sample.The high stability may be attributed to the good recoverability of active species (i.e., defect sites, V O and V Zn ).To clarify this assumption, TPD over the sample with different number of cycles by coadsorption for H 2 O and CO 2 was conducted, and the results were exhibited in Figure 8C.Obviously, as compared to the fresh ZnO-NS, catalysts with different numbers of cycles displayed similar results.The highly symmetrical peak at around 270 C can be ascribed to the decomposition of basic zinc carbonate, which is consistent with the results of TG-DTG (Figure 6C).Especially, as compared to the peak from the first run, the two peaks of the next two cycles exhibit almost the same areas, revealing that the defect sites (leading to the formation of basic zinc carbonate) were completely recovered after the decomposition of basic zinc carbonate.The TEM image of the spent catalyst used for 16 h was illustrated in Figure 8D.The spent ZnO-NS remained in the same nanosheet structure as the fresh one, further explaining the high stability of this photocatalyst.These results confirm that ZnO-NS is highly efficient and stable for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under the irradiation of UV lamp."

    "content": "This work demonstrates a novel strategy to promote CO 2 photoreduction performance.Three ZnO samples were fabricated by varying preparation methods.The morphologies, surface area, photoluminescence properties, and photocatalytic activities of those three ZnO samples were investigated.The results show that the as-prepared porous ZnO nanosheets with the existence of more defect sites that is, zinc and oxygen vacancies, exhibit a much higher activity for photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O when compared to ZnO nanoparticles and nanorods.The production rate for H 2 , CO, and CH 4 can reach 112.69, 406.77, and 20.16 mol/g cat /h at reaction temperature of 200 C over ZnO nanosheets.Basic zinc carbonate strongly adsorbed on the ZnO nanosheets surface is believed to be the active intermediate species, which were formed due to Lewis acid-base interactions and finally facilitated the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 .On the contrary, due to the lack of defect sites, ZnO nanoparticles and ZnO nanorods showed weak adsorption for CO 2 while holding a high combination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes, leading to inferior photocatalytic activities.This work provides new insight on the CO 2 activation under light irradiation.
