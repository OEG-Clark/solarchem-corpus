    "content": "Two dierent Ti-containing porous silica thin lms having a hexagonal and cubic pore structure were synthesized and used as photocatalysts for the reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O at 323 K. UV irradiation of the Ti-containing porous silica thin lms in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O led to the formation of CH 4 and CH 3 OH with a high quantum yield of 0.28.These porous silica thin lm photocatalysts having a hexagonal pore structure exhibited higher reactivity than the Ti-MCM-41 powder photocatalysts with the same pore structure."

    "content": "Ti-containing porous silica thin lms were synthesized by a solvent evaporation method, as has been reported in a previous work 16.A typical synthetic procedure for the self-standing lms is as follows: tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMOS) (TMOS : VTMOS 7 : 1), TPOT (tetraisopropylorthotitanate), C 18 TAC (octadecyltrimethylammonium chloride), and methanol (TMOS VTMOS) :TPOT :C 18 TAC : methanol 1 :1/50 (or 1/25) :1/8 :1/25 were mixed by magnetic stirring and the mixture was allowed to react under acidic conditions (by the addition of HCl) for 10 min at room temperature.In order to hydrolyze the alkoxides, deionized water was added to the mixture.When the water/Si ratio was 1/3 and 4/3, Ti-PS(x) (x SiaTi ratio) and Ti-PS(c) were synthesized, respectively.The resulting solution was then deposited on poly(ethylene) lm and dried in air at 333 K for 24 h to remove the solvent and to complete condensation of the alkoxides.The dried lms could then be peeled o from the substrate and exible self-standing transparent lms were obtained. Prior to photoreactions and spectroscopic measurements, the catalysts (50 mg) were heated in O 2 at 723 K for 8 h and then evacuated at 475 K for 2 h.UV irradiation of the catalysts in the presence of CO 2 (36 \"mol) and gaseous H 2 O (180 \"mol) was carried out using a high-pressure Hg lamp (Toshiba SHL 100 W, !b 250 nm) for 6 h at 323 K.The reaction products collected in the gas phase were analyzed by gas chromatography.The number of incident photons to the cell was determined by means of a potassium ferrioxalate actinometer.The dierence between the number of photons passing through the Ti-containing porous silica thin lms and the corresponding number with the pure silica thin lms gives the number of photons absorbed by the Tioxide catalysts.Thus, the quantum yield for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to produce CH 4 and CH 3 OH was determined.The amounts of the surface OH groups were estimated from the amounts of the eliminated OH groups as H 2 O during the evacuation of the catalyst in the temperature ranges from 573 to 1073 K, by monitoring the decrease in the surface OH groups with the IR peak at around 3740 cm y1 .The Ti content in the synthesized thin lms was conrmed to be much closer to the Ti content in the original starting precursor gel by atomic absorption analysis.The BET surface areas of these Ti-containing porous silica thin lms were 900 m 2 g y1 ."

    "content": "Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of Ti-containing porous silica thin lm.As shown in gure 1(a) and 1(b), the XRD patterns of Ti-PS(25) and Ti-PS(50) indicate two diraction peaks assigned to (100) and (200) re ections of hexagonal symmetry.When compared with that of powdered samples, no (110) re ection could be observed on the lms.This is attributed to the fact that the channel axis is oriented parallel to the lm plane 17.The XRD pattern of Ti-PS(c) shows three diraction peaks assigned to (200), ( 210) and (211) of cubic symmetry.These structures were also conrmed by TEM images. Figure 2 shows the UVvis absorption spectra of Ti-containing porous silica thin lms.Ti-PS(50) and Ti-PS(c) both exhibit an absorption band in the wavelength region of 200270 nm, attributed to the LMCT (ligand-to-metal charge transfer) band of the highly dispersed tetrahedrally coordinated titanium oxide 18.The Ti-PS(25) shows an absorption band in the wavelength region of 250340 nm as well as the LMCT band, indicating the presence of two kinds of titanium oxide species, i.e. tetrahedrally coordinated titanium oxide species and aggregated octahedrally coordinated titanium oxide species. UV irradiation of the Ti-containing porous silica thin lm photocatalysts in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O led to the formation of CH 4 and CH 3 OH as the main products.As shown in gure 3, the yields of these photoformed products increase linearly against the UV irradiation time, while these reaction products were not detected under dark conditions nor with UV irradiation of mesoporous silica thin lms without titanium oxides.These results clearly indicate that both the presence of titanium oxide included within the mesoporous silica framework as well as UV irradiation are indispensable for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to take place on the catalysts.Figure 4 shows the product distribution in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O on Ti-containing porous silica thin lm catalysts.Ti-PS(25) having an aggregated titanium oxide species mainly leads to the evolution of CH 4 .These results are similar to those for the widely used TiO 2 (P-25) catalysts.Ti-PS(c) shows higher selectivity for the formation of CH 3 OH, though the photocatalytic reactivity was lower than that of the Ti-PS(50) catalyst.Among these Ti-containing porous silica thin lms, Ti-PS(50) shows the highest apparent photocatalytic reactivity per gram of Ti.Moreover, Ti-PS(50) exhibits two times higher reactivity as compared with powdered Ti-MCM-41 having a hexagonal pore structure, and the photocatalytic reactivity is highest among all of the catalysts which were investigated.It was found that the catalyst ground to powdered form, Ti-PS(50) H , maintains higher reactivity as compared with Ti-MCM-41.In powdered form, it can be expected that the eect of the scattering of light on the particle surface would be large and eective light absorption could, therefore, not be realized to measure.Therefore, it is of great benet to use transparent Ti-PS(50) thin lm photocatalyst to measure the exact quantum yield of the photocatalytic reaction using chemical actinometers.The quantum yield of Ti-PS(50) for the formation of CH 4 and CH 3 OH from CO 2 and H 2 O was determined to be 0.28.In contrast to the value obtained with the titanium oxides anchored on transparent porous silica glass (PVG), Ti/PVG, (quantum yield was 0.02), the quantum yield obtained with transparent Ti-PS(50) thin lm photocatalyst has been improved remarkably.Such improvement in the reactivity is attributed to larger surface area and higher transparency of Ti-containing porous silica thin lms as compared with that of Ti/ PVG.These results clearly suggest that the photocatalytic reactivity of transparent Ti-PS(50) thin lms is quite high and has enough reactivity for the utilization of these thin lms for the real photocatalytic systems. Figure 5 shows the relationship between the selectivity for the formation of CH 3 OH and the amounts of the surface OH groups.As shown in gure 5, Ti-containing porous silica thin lms having small amounts of surface OH groups exhibit the highest selectivity for the formation of CH 3 OH.In general, large amounts of H 2 O molecules can absorb on the surface of the catalysts having high concentrations of surface OH groups due to the hydrogen interaction between the H 2 O molecules and silanols.It is thus considered that the relative concentration of the H 2 O molecules surrounding the tetrahedrally coordinated titanium oxide species in uences the selectivity in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O.In a previous study, in the case of high values for the H 2 O/CO 2 ratio, the selectivity for the formation of CH 4 becomes higher.Therefore, in the case of high concentrations of surface OH groups, the formation of CH 4 occurred mainly due to the high concentration of H 2 O molecules surrounding the tetrahedrally coordinated titanium oxide species.In the case of low concentrations of surface OH groups, the selectivity for the formation of CH 3 OH may be higher because the reaction for the formation of CH 4 was prevented."
