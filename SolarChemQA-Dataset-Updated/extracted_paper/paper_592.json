    "content": "CuFe 2 O 4 is synthesized by co-precipitation.Stochiometric amounts of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 , 5H 2 O and Fe(NO 3 ) 2 , 5H 2 O, both of purity greater than 99, are dissolved in water and the solution is denitrified at 600 C.Then, the powder is homogenized in an agate mortar and heated in a muffle furnace at 800 C with intermediate regrinding.Sn (Merck, purity 99.9) is chemically polished in HCl (0.5 N) and thoroughly washed with water.Then, it was dissolved in HNO 3 (6 N) to give a white suspension which is evaporated and heated at 500 C. The optical gap is determined from the diffuse reflectance spectrum using a double-beam spectrophotometer (Specord 200 Plus). The point of zero charge (pzc) is determined from the equilibrium pH of an aqueous solution containing an excess of powder.The photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization is carried out in a standard cell using platinum foil (2 cm 2 ) as emergency electrode.The potential of the working electrode is controlled by a PGZ301 potentiostat (Radiometer analytical) and reported against a saturated calomel electrode (SCE).The capacitance measurement is performed at a frequency 10 kHz. The Co 2 stock solution (1000 mg L -1 ) is prepared by dissolving the accurate quantity of CoSO tion is filtered and the supernatant is analyzed for the residual Co 2 concentration using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 1800).Co 2 gives with SCN -a blue complex which absorbs at 619 nm ( 1770 cm -1 mol -1 L). Hydrogen evolution method is used to confirm the cobalt deposition.Owing to its redox potential (-0.50 V SC E ), the cobalt deposited by photocatalysis is re-dissolved in acidic solution (HCl 2 N) and titrated.The detailed setup for the hydrogen production is given elsewhere 13."

    "content": "The co-precipitation is useful in the preparation of homogeneous oxides powder 14.The X-ray diffraction of CuFe 2 O 4 (Fig. 1) reveals single phase in agreement with the JCPDS card N 01-072-1174; all peaks are indexed in the cubic system (S G: I4 1 /am) and the lattice parameters: a 0.58109 and c 0.87004 nm are in perfect agreement with the literature 15.The crystallite size (58 14 nm), evaluated from the Williamson-Hall plot, indicates nano crystallites.Assuming spherical and non-porous crystallites, the specific surface area (S 6 exp D )averages 19 m 2 g -1 . exp is the experimental density.The knowledge of the optical gap (E g ) is crucial for the solar photocatalysis; it is determined from the plot (h) 2 as function of the incident photon (h) (Fig. 2) according to Tauc formula: where is the absorption coefficient, the variation of (h) 2 with the photon energy (h) gives a direct gap at 1.65 eV.FeCu, FeO 4 is an inverse spinel, with d-d transition due to high spin Fe 3 splitting in either tetrahedral site (e 2 g t 3 2g ) or octahedral site (t 3 2g e 2 g ).The position of the electronic bands is of high importance for the photodeposition of metals.In this respect, the flat band potential E fb (-0.21 V) is provided from the intercept of the linear part of (h) 2 to potential-axis (C -2 0) of the Mott-Schottky plot (Fig. 3): N A is the holes concentration, and the other symbols have their usual significations.The negative slope indicates p-type behavior for CuFe 2 O 4 as generally observed for spinels 16. The potential of the conduction band (1.63 V E fb -E g E a )foot0 , is cathodic enough to reduce Co 2 ( -0.58 V for 50 mg L -1 ) to elemental state.However, the charge transfer in heterogeneous system occurs between levels of similar The overall reaction is kinetically governed by the electron flow within the conduction band of CuFe 2 O 4 because of the small diffusion length of the minority carriers.Therefore, the electrons with a low mobility (10 -6 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) 18 are rate determining and nanocrystallites are desirable in such a case; their size must be comparable with the diffusion length. The water contamination by toxic metals is a serious threat for the aquatic environment 19 and is currently recognized as a worldwide problem.The photocatalysis is an attractive alternative to remediate, at least partially, to the aquatic pollution.The reduction of Co 2 is non-spontaneous, and the sunlight is used for the electro-deposition.Moreover, the free potential of p-CuFe 2 O 4 (-0.56V) is more cathodic than the flat band potential E fb (-0.21 V) and there is no need to apply a further bias for the Co 2 reduction. The influence of the percentage of CuFe 2 O 4 in the hetero-system CuFe 2 O 4 /SnO 2 on the Co 2 reduction was investigated, and a maximum reduction is found for a ratio (50/50) (Fig. 4).At low CuFe 2 O 4 percentages, the number of photons is greater than that of the photocatalytic sites and the activity increases with increasing the mass of CuFe till the optimal value.For higher doses, the performance decreases because the catalyst works as optical filter and attenuates the photons flux; the shadowing effect and light scattering also account for the regression of the photoactivity.The potential of oxygen evolution is 1 V at pH 6 and usually varies by -0.06 V pH -1 while that of couple Co 2 /Co(1.6V SCE ) is pH independent.So, there is no limit above which Co 2 is oxidized and the specie is stable in water whatever the pH.However, the pH is a crucial factor which strongly affects the adsorption through protonation or deprotonation and competition of protons with Co 2 and (b) speciation of the metal.The mechanistic aspect involved at the solid/solution interface for the Co 2 adsorption onto the hetero-system is deduced from the pH study, and the results are closely related to pzc.The Co 2 adsorption on SnO 2 is pH dependent and is pronounced above pzc (5.30)where SnO 2 surface is negatively charged (pH pH pzc ).Hence, the dark adsorption favors the Co 2 reduction under natural conditions (pH 6) and is the first step in the photocatalytic process.Thus, the effect is investigated in the pH range (2-7), keeping the Co 2 concentration constant at 50 mg L -1 .A sharp increase up to 62 in the photoreduction occurs when the pH increases from 2 to 5.5 (Fig. 5), after which a drastic decrease is observed.Beyond pH 8, Co(OH) 2 precipitates because of its low solubility product (K s 2 10 -16 ).In acidic medium, some groups on the catalyst surface are protonated due to the predominance of H ions, leading to a positive surface charge and compete with the Co 2 adsorption.Hence, Co 2 does not adsorb on the surface and the photocatalytic process is inhibited because of the electrostatic repulsion.On the contrary, as the pH increases, more negatively charged surface becomes available due to deprotonization, thus making easy the approach of Co 2 to the binding sites.Hence, the further experiments studies are car- The industrial effluents can reach concentrations as high as 50 mg L -1 , and the effect of the initial concentration of Co 2 (C o ) is studied on five solutions ranging from 0 to 125 mg L -1 (Fig. 6).As expected, the photoreduction of Co 2 decreases with increasing C o , due to the limited number of active sites on the catalyst surface on which the adsorption occurs.Indeed, the photons flux is constant and in this way the number of photoelectrons; so raising the concentration C o should decelerate the reduction because the remaining sites become difficult to reach due the inside porosity of the catalyst and the repulsive forces between the Co 2 ions and the catalyst bulk. The color of the solution weakens progressively over illumination time and turns to white, an evidence of Co 2 reduction.To confirm the cobalt reduction, the powder was soaked in HCl (0.2 N) overnight, cobalt was re-dissolved and titrated.Measuring the volume of liberated hydrogen is equivalent to the quantity of Co 2 .It is worth noting that the concentration of cobalt is, within the experimental errors, very close to that determined during the photodeposition.The Co 2 reduction follows a zero-order kinetic with a rate constant of 0.19 mol (mg catalyst) -1 mn -1 under artificial light (Fig. 7). Over illumination time, the catalyst surface becomes heterogeneous and contains Co-clusters with a high affinity for the water reduction into hydrogen.Accordingly, the H 2evolution takes place competitively with the Co 2 reduction and therefore seems to be the main reason in the regression of the cobalt deposition (Fig. 8).Indeed, the in situ incorporation of ultrafine cobalt particles over SnO 2 is a surface modification with an intimate contact Co/SnO 2 .More inter-"

    "content": "The photoelectrochemical Co 2 reduction is reported for the first time on the hetero-system CuFe 2 O 4 /SnO 2 .The choice of the spinel CuFe 2 O 4 as sensitiser is motivated by its environmental friendly characteristic, chemical stability and optical gap which permits the exploitation of a large part of the solar spectrum.The photodeposition rate increases with increasing the spinel dose and peaks at 50, while the optimal pH is close to that of the natural medium.SnO 2 is a wide band-gap semiconductor which permits the electrons transfer to Co 2 ions.The kinetic of Co 2 reduction obeys to a zero-order kinetic.Over time, SnO 2 is surface modified by co-electro-deposition, resulting in heterogeneous surface with favorable catalytic sites for H 2 evolution.It results in the deposition of ultrafine co-crystallites where the hydrogen evolution occurs with low activation energy.

The activation energy (E a 0.2 eV) is determined from the conductivity measurements. The authors would like to thank Dr M. Fedailaine for his technical assistance and Pr F. Kaouah for her helpful discussions."
