    "content": "In this work, W 18 O 49 /g-C 3 N 4 hybrids were obtained via a simple hydrothermal method.Photocatalytic properties of W 18 O 49 /g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts were reflected by reducing CO 2 .The optimal photocatalytic performance was achieved by altering the mass fraction of W 18 O 49 in the composite. 3.1.Characterization of W 18 O 49 /g-C 3 N 4 Heterojunction.The morphology of pure W 18 O 49 was observed with SEM and TEM images.It is clear from Figure 1a,b that bare W 18 O 49 possesses the morphology of urchin spheres with a diameter of about 1 m.As illustrated in Figure 1c, many nanowire thorns are anchored on the surface of the W 18 O 49 sphere and the diameter of these nanowires is approximately 12 nm.The TEM images of pure g-C 3 N 4 are displayed in Figure S1a,b.The morphology of as-synthesized WOCN-20 wt photocatalyst was studied by TEM and are exhibited in Figure 1d,e.It is obvious that g-C 3 N 4 reveals the layered structure and urchinlike W 18 O 49 (black portion) is fixed on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 , implying that the morphology of W 18 O 49 is unchanged in the binary composite.In the HRTEM image (Figure 1f), the lattice fringe of W 18 O 49 is detected, which is 0.379 nm, corresponding to the (010) crystal plane of monoclinic W 18 O 49 . 41The material in the red region in Figure 1f is amorphous g-C 3 N 4 . 37These results indicate the tight contact that formed between W 18 O 49 and g-C 3 N 4 , which can facilitate the drift and separation of light-induced e --h pairs, thus boosting the photocatalytic behavior. XRD characterization was applied to detect the phases and crystal structures of bare W 18 O 49 , g-C 3 N 4 , and W 18 O 49 /g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts.As illustrated in Figure 2a, two distinct peaks at 13.1 and 27.5can be attributed to the (100) and (002) crystal planes of g-C 3 N 4 .For pure W 18 O 49 , 23.0 and 47.2diffraction peaks are observed, which could be attributed to the (100) and eV belong to W 6 ; the other two peaks correspond to W 5 , suggesting the existence of a great deal of oxygen vacancies in W 18 O 49 .Moreover, ESR was also applied to verify the presence of oxygen vacancies in the WOCN-20 wt composite (Figure S2).The characteristic ESR signal at g 2.001 was observed for this sample, implying the existence of oxygen vacancies in WOCN-20 wt nanowires.The O 1s XPS spectrum is exhibited in Figure 2d; the peaks at 530.7 and 531.8 eV can be interpreted as O-W and OW, respectively. 35,43As for the N 1s XPS spectrum of g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 2e), three peaks are derived from sp 2 -bonded nitrogen (CNC, 399.0 eV), tertiary nitrogen (N-(C) 3 , 399.7 eV), and amino groups (C-N-H, 401.2 eV), respectively.The C 1s peaks appearing at 284.9, 285.9, and 288.4 eV are originated from NCN, C-N-C coordination, and sp 2 C-C of graphitic carbon (Figure 2f). 37,38It is worth noting that, compared with W 18 O 49 and g-C 3 N 4 , the W 4f and O 1s peaks of WOCN-20 wt move toward the direction of lower binding energy, whereas the binding energies of N 1s and C 1s slightly increase.This phenomenon illustrates that electrons can be transferred from g-C 3 N 4 to W 18 O 49 . The N 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms and pore size distributions were performed to identify the specific surface areas of g-C 3 N 4 , W 18 O 49 , and W 18 O 49 /g-C 3 N 4 .Both monomers and composites reveal type IV isotherms with a hysteresis loop in Figure 3, which can be ascribed to the mesoporous structures of the as-prepared samples. 37,41 According to Table 1, bare g-C 3 N 4 has a BET specific surface area (S BET ) of only 56.37 m 2 /g, whereas the optimal binary composite WOCN-20 wt possesses a S BET of 90.34 m 2 /g.The increase of S BET after the combination of W 18 O 49 and g-C 3 N 4 indicates that the composite catalyst can supply abundant sites for the reaction of CO 2 reduction. There is no doubt that the optical absorption behavior of these prepared photocatalysts has a huge impact on the photocatalytic properties.The absorbance spectra are demonstrated in Figure 4a.Apparently, all the as-prepared samples exhibit outstanding light capture performance in the ultraviolet region, and the optical capturing edge of g-C 3 N 4 is about 461 nm.As for W 18 O 49 , it shows strong light absorption in the whole region of 250-2500 nm, especially in the near-infrared region.The excellent optical absorption performance of W 18 O 49 can be attributed to the coherent oscillations of the surface free electrons caused by plentiful oxygen vacancies. 34,37Obviously, the introduction of W 18 O 49 monomer has a strong effect on the light absorption capacity of the composite photocatalysts in the near-infrared region.With the increase of W 18 O 49 content, the light absorption performances of W 18 O 49 /g-C 3 N 4 hybrids in the near-infrared region increase gradually.The formula h A(h -E g ) can be applied to determine the band gaps of g-C 3 N 4 and W 18 O 49 , where is the absorption coefficient, h indicates the photon energy, and A stands for a constant. 37,44,45herefore, according to the above formula, the band gaps of g-C 3 N 4 and W 18 O 49 are 2.69 and 2.85 eV, respectively (Figure 4b).The yields of CO and CH 4 were measured to estimate the photocatalytic performances of these prepared photocatalysts.As exhibited in Figure 5a, pure g-C 3 N 4 has a poor efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , 1.15 molh -1 g -1 for CO and 0.83 molh -1 g -1 for CH 4 , under full spectrum light irradiation.Rapid combination of photoexcited e --h pairs is the dominant reason for the unsatisfactory performance of g-C 3 N 4 .As for the W 18 O 49 urchin sphere, no CO or CH 4 is produced during the photocatalytic process because the conduction band potential (0.25 V) is not enough for CO 2 reduction.After the combination of g-C 3 N 4 and W 18 O 49 , the photocatalytic behavior is significantly improved.In the composite photocatalyst, WOCN-20 wt reveals the greatest photocatalytic behavior under the irradiation of full spectrum light (6.46 molh -1 g -1 for CO and 3.97 molh -1 g -1 for CH 4 ).The corresponding apparent quantum yield of WOCN-20 wt composite is 2.2 (420 nm).The CO and CH 4 generation rates of WOCN-20 wt are 5.62-and 4.78-fold higher than those of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.Moreover, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied to verify the origins of CO and CH 4 during the photocatalytic reduction process.In Figure S3, m/z 29 and m/z 17 are detected and correspond to 13 CO and 13 CH 4 respectively when 13 CO 2 is used as the feedstock.According to these results, the generated CO and CH 4 should derive from the photoreduction of CO 2 .When the mass fraction of W 18 O 49 reaches 25 and 30 wt , the photocatalytic efficiency of the binary composites begins to decrease.The deterioration of activity may be derived from the excessive covering of the W 18 O 49 urchin sphere on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 .Moreover, excessive W 18 O 49 can serve as a recombination center of charge carriers, leading to the reduction of activity.As shown in Figure 5b, the WOCN-20 wt composite also demonstrates good photocatalytic activities in the near-infrared region (800-2500 nm), which are 1.50 and 1.06 molh -1 g -1 for CO and CH 4 , respectively.The outstanding performance results from the introduction of W 18 O 49 with abundant oxygen vacancies.Furthermore, as can be seen from Figure 5c,d, with the increase of the reaction time, the CO evolution amount of W 18 O 49 /g-C 3 N 4 composite photocatalysts gradually increases whether under the irradiation of full spectrum light or nearinfrared light, suggesting that the as-prepared photocatalysts possess good stability.The multiple-cycle photocatalytic activity diagram of the WOCN-20 wt composite under full spectrum and near-infrared region (800-2500 nm) light irradiation is exhibited in Figure S4 without significant reduction, which further proves the stability and durability of these photocatalysts.Furthermore, after the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the XRD pattern of the used WOCN-20 wt photocatalyst is shown in Figure S5 and the structure of WOCN-20 wt does not change significantly compared with fresh WOCN-20 wt , which further confirms that WOCN-20 wt possesses strong stability.3.3.Photoelectrochemical Properties and Photocatalysis Mechanism.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra can be applied to measure the combination speeds of the photoexcited e --h pairs in the photocatalysts, which is helpful to explain the superior performance of binary composites.The intensity of PL emission spectra can reflect the recombination speed of carriers, and stronger PL intensity stands for faster charge carrier recombination. 46As revealed in Figure 6a, g-C 3 N 4 possesses the greatest peak intensity at about 450 nm, implying the fast recombination of charge carriers, which can be used to explain its poor photocatalytic performance.W 18 O 49 /g-C 3 N 4 photocatalytic systems display lower peak intensities, where the lowest peak value emerges for WOCN-20 wt .The results indicate that WOCN-20 wt has the lowest photoexcited e --h pair recombination rate, corresponding to its optimal photocatalytic behavior. Furthermore, transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were also implemented to study the transport performance of photoinduced photocurrent carriers, which was closely related to photocatalytic activity. 15As shown in Figure 6b, as-prepared monomer and binary composites exhibit smooth transient photocurrent curves in six on-off cycles.It is clear in Figure 6b that g-C 3 N 4 and W 18 O 49 , represented by the red and black lines respectively, display poor transient photocurrent densities.However, the phototransient currents of the binary composites are significantly enhanced, and the highest photocurrent intensity is found on the WOCN-20 wt sample, implying the excellent photoinduced charge carrier separation performance of this sample.It is important to note that the photocurrent intensity of WOCN-20 wt does not drop to zero immediately after the light source is switched off, but rather it decreases slowly.This phenomenon demonstrates that the WOCN-20 wt composite photocatalyst can well inhibit the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, showing an excellent charge separation efficiency.This is conducive to photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . The electron migration process of these photocatalysts was evaluated through means of EIS technology.It is obvious from the EIS Nyquist plot that the radius of WOCN-20 wt is much smaller than those of g-C 3 N 4 and W 18 O 49 (Figure 6c).The above result proves that WOCN-20 wt has a lower electron transfer resistance, which enhances the separation of current carriers and accelerates the photocatalytic reaction. Mott-Schottky (MS) plots can be employed to study the band positions of g-C 3 N 4 and W 18 O 49 , which is a crucial step for the subsequent analysis of the photocatalytic mechanism. 47,48In Figure 6d,e -, respectively, which can be easily perceived by an EPR instrument. 51,52Apparently, the W 18 O 49 urchin sphere and WOCN-20 wt show an obvious DMPO- OH signal with a peak intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1.However, pure g-C 3 N 4 does not exhibit the characteristic signal of DMPO- OH because the valence band potential is not suitable for the generation of the hydroxyl group (Figure 7a).The strong signal of DMPO- OH in the WOCN-20 wt composite implies that the photoexcited holes still remain in the valence band of W 18 O 49 and do not transfer to the valence band of g-C 3 N 4 .This phenomenon is not consistent with the traditional type II heterojunction charge transfer mode.Moreover, in Figure 7b g-C On the basis of the above analysis, a Z-scheme heterojunction can be employed to illustrate the boosted photocatalytic CO 2 reduction properties of the composite photocatalysts.The Fermi level of g-C 3 N 4 is higher than that of W 18 O 49 . 53In order to achieve Fermi level equilibrium after the combination of g-C 3 N 4 and W 18 O 49 , the electrons on g-C 3 N 4 will transfer to the surface of W 18 O 49 and form an internal electric field with the direction from g-C 3 N 4 to W 18 O 49 .At the same time, the transfer of charge will cause band bending (Figure 8).When stimulated by UV and visible light, the electrons of g-C 3 N 4 and W 18 O 49 jump from the VB to the CB respectively, leaving holes in the VB.Under the action of the internal electric field and Coulomb force, the photoinduced electrons on the CB of W 18 O 49 tend to combine with the holes on the VB of g-C 3 N 4 .Hence, the photogenerated electrons on the CB of g-C 3 N 4 with the ability of reducing CO 2 can avoid being recombined, thus realizing the efficient photocatalytic reaction.In the near-infrared region, localized electron hopping is a widely recognized photocatalytic mechanism.When exposed to near-infrared region light, the special W 5 in W 18 O 49 is oxidized into W 6 and releases one electron (labeled as an LSPR-excited \"hot electron\"). 54Such electrons are populated on the localized state and subsequently migrated to the conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 through the interface to react with CO 2 .This process can significantly reduce the charge carrier combination rate and achieve higher photocatalytic efficiency.The process of photoreduction of CO 2 can be described by the following formulas: 555657 (1) (2) (3) Figure 1.(a) SEM image of urchinlike W 18 O 49 .(b, c) TEM images of W 18 O 49 .(d, e) TEM images of WOCN-20 wt .(f) HRTEM image of WOCN-20 wt .

(020) crystal faces, respectively.The diffraction peaks of W 18 O 49 sample are indexed to the monoclinic phase of W 18 O 49 (JCPDS No. 36-101). 37,42The diffraction peaks of these five binary photocatalysts are composed of the characteristic peaks of W 18 O 49 and g-C 3 N 4 , implying the successful synthesis of the composites.Moreover, compared with pure W 18 O 49 , the peaks of W 18 O 49 in W 18 O 49 /g-C 3 N 4 composites have no obvious deviation, suggesting the monoclinic W 18 O 49 does not change after combined with g-C 3 N 4 .XPS was performed to further research the valence states of the elements in the as-prepared photocatalysts.In the full-scale XPS spectrum of WOCN-20 wt composite (Figure 2b), W, O, N, and C elements are observed, implying the successful combination of W 18 O 49 and g-C 3 N 4 .For the W 18 O 49 urchin ball, four peaks of W 4f are located mainly at 34.5, 35.6, 36.2, and 38.0 eV in Figure 2c.Two peaks locked at 37.92 and 35.81 Figure 3.
