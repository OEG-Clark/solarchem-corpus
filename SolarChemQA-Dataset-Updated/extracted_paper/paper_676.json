    "content": "All of the chemicals and solvents used in this work were analytical or chromatographic grade.Cd(NO3)24H2O was bought from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd.CS(NH2)2 was obtained from Jingke Fine Chemical Industry Research Institute of Tianjin.Ethylene glycol (EG) was purchased from Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd.Bi(NO3)35H2O was bought from Alfa Aesar.Triethanolamine (TEOA, 99.8, GC), acetonitrile (MeCN, 99.9, GC) and ethylenediamine ( 99) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology.Carbon dioxide gas (CO2, super grade purity 99.999) was bought from Beijing Beiwen Gases Company.5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was got from Dojindo Laboratories, Japan.The high-purity water was acquired from a Milli-Q Plus system (Millipore, France) with 18.2 Mcm resistivity. CdS nanorods were synthesized via solvothermal route using ethylenediamine as solvent and structuredirecting agent.In a typical process, 3 mmol Cd(NO3)24H2O and 9 mmol CS(NH2)2 were dissolved in 30 mL of the mixture of ethylenediamine and water (v:v 2:1) under constant stirring for 30 min.Then the obtained mixture was transferred into an autoclave and maintained at 180 oC for 12 h in a muffle furnace. The resultant yellow precipitate was separated by centrifugation after being cooled down to the room temperature, then washed with ethanol and high-purity water for several times, and finally dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 65 oC, which is denoted as CdS. The CdS/Bi2S3 heterostructures were synthesized via a simple ion-exchange reaction in EG solution. Briefly, 0.5 mmol as-synthesized CdS nanorods were dispersed in 20 mL of EG under ultrasonication for 15 min.Then 1.5 mmol Bi(NO3)3 in 20 mL of EG was added dropwise into the above mixture and was maintained at 75 oC with constant stirring for different times (0.5 h, 1 h and 2 h).The resultant products were collected by centrifugation, followed by being washed with high-purity water and absolute ethanol for several times.Finally, the obtained samples were dried in vacuum at 65 oC overnight.The samples are respectively denoted as CdS/Bi2S3-0.5hand CdS/Bi2S3-1h according to the reaction time; while the one after 2-h reaction is Bi2S3 since all the CdS was converted. FeTCPP was synthesized according to the protocol reported previously 34,35. The morphology, chemical composition and element mapping analysis were achieved by using Hitachi S4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Bruker D8 diffractmeter with Cu K radiation.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer.UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and UV-vis absorption spectra were collected on a Lambda 750 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, USA) using BaSO4 as background.The BET specific surface area and CO2 adsorption isotherms were obtained by a surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics, Tristar II 3020).Photoluminescence (PL) spectra excited at 350 nm were collected on FLS980 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.).Time-resolved PL spectra were recorded with 375 nm excitation.Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were obtained with a Bruker E500 spectrometer at room temperature.The Mott-Schottky and transient photocurrent response curves were performed in a three-electrode cell on CHI 660D electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua) with a frequency of 1 kHz.The as-prepared samples, Pt plate and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used respectively as the working, counter and reference electrodes.For convenience, the potential was converted to that vs NHE. CO2 photoreduction experiments were performed in a photoreaction system (Labsolar-IIIAG, Beijing Perfect Light Technology Co., Ltd.) saturated with 29 kPa CO2 at 15 C 34.Briefly, 1 mg of FeTCPP molecular catalyst and 50 mg of CdS/Bi2S3 powder were suspended in 100 mL solution of acetonitrile/water/TEOA (3:1:1, v:v:v) under constant stirring.The system was first vacuumed and then purged with Ar for at least 1 h to ensure the removal of residual air.Before illumination, the system was purged with high purity CO2 gas in the dark for at least 1.5 h.The reactor was illuminated by a 300 W Xe lamp (Microsolar 300, Beijing Perfect Light Technology Co., Ltd.) with a 420-nm cut-off filter and an IR cut-off filter.The intensity of resultant visible light was 260 mW cm -2 .The gas products were analyzed by using Agilent 7890A gas chromatography equipped with a hydrogen flame ionized detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).Four control experiments (i.e., without CO2 purging, without illumination, blank solvent without photocatalysts, and only FeTCPP catalyst) were carried out to ensure that CO2 is the only carbon source for any observed products."

    "content": "Crystal structure and composition of the as-prepared samples are investigated by XRD. Figure 1 shows XRD patterns of the CdS/Bi2S3 heterostructures, as well as pure CdS and Bi2S3 samples.The diffraction peaks of pure CdS are well ascribed to hexagonal Wurtzite phase CdS (JCPDS: 41-1049).After the ionexchange reaction with Bi 3 for 0.5 h, the peaks assigned to the orthorhombic Bi2S3 (JCPDS: 17-0320) can be observed.CdS provides S source and acts as the matrices crystal during the ion-exchange reaction, which dissolves gradually; while Bi 3 reacts with the already-existing S source and recrystallizes to form Bi2S3 on the CdS surface due to its extremely lower solubility (Ksp 1 10 -97 ) than CdS (Ksp 8 10 -27 ) 29,36.It is found that the intensity of diffraction peaks for Bi2S3 increases as the reaction time prolongs. When the reaction time is extended to 2 h, the peaks for CdS disappear and all the observed peaks are ascribed to the orthorhombic Bi2S3, implying that CdS has been completely transformed into Bi2S3. During the synthesis of CdS/Bi2S3 heterostructures, the EG was chosen as the solvent mainly because Bi(NO3)3 is easily hydrolyzed in aqueous solution, while it can be successfully dissolved in EG to form Bi 3 ions.In addition, EG can slow down the rate of ion-exchange reaction by virtue of the low polarity and large viscosity. Figure 2 shows FE-SEM images of the as-synthesized CdS, Bi2S3 and CdS/Bi2S3 samples.Pure CdS has the nanorod morphology (Figure 2a).After 0.5 h of ion-exchange reaction with Bi source, no obvious change in morphology can be observed (Figure 2b), although little Bi2S3 has been formed.If further increasing the ion-exchange reaction time to 1 h, CdS continues to transform into Bi2S3, and interestingly, the surface of nanorods becomes slightly smoother and more uniform than before (Figure 2c).Finally, pure Bi2S3 nanorods with uniform morphology are obtained (Figure 2d).Elemental composition of the obtained samples was checked from EDX analysis and listed in Table 1.The Cd and S atoms are detected in pure CdS, for which the atomic ratio is close to 1.The element Bi can be detected after the ionexchange reaction with Bi 3 for 0.5 h, for which the ratio of (SCd)/Bi is calculated to be around 1.5, indicating the formation of Bi2S3.The resultant molar ratio of Bi2S3/CdS is around 0.12 for CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h.The amount of Bi2S3 increases with prolonging the ion-exchange reaction time.The molar ratio of Bi2S3/CdS is around 1.55 for CdS/Bi2S3-1h, and pure Bi2S3 is obtained when the ion-exchange reaction time increases to 2 h.All these are in good agreement with the aforementioned XRD results. Figure 3 shows TEM images, SAED pattern, and line-scan composition profiles taken along the radial and axial directions of CdS and CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h,respectively.TEM image further verifies the nanorod morphology of CdS (Figure 3a).The SAED pattern (inset of Figure 3b) indicates the single-crystalline nature of CdS nanorods.The line-scan composition analysis taken along the radial (Figure 3c) and axial directions (Figure 3d) reveal that the nanorods are composed of Cd and S elements, which are distributed homogeneously.The nanorod morphology and single-crystalline nature are still well maintained after 0.5 h of ion-exchange reaction (Figures 3e and3f).Meanwhile, the Bi element can be detected from line-scan 3g and3h), although the content is still low.If further increasing the ionexchange reaction time, as shown in Figure S1 for CdS/Bi2S3-1h sample, the content of Cd decreases while Bi increases, suggesting that the transformation of CdS to Bi2S3.When the ion-exchange reaction time reaches 2 h, only Bi and S elements can be detected from the line-scan composition results (Figure S2), indicating the complete transformation of CdS to Bi2S3, which is well consistent with the above XRD and EDX analysis from SEM.In addition, the typical N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of CdS, Bi2S3 and CdS/Bi2S3 heterostructures are displayed in Figure S3.The corresponding BET specific surface area is determined to be 27.97,33.43, 25.08 and 26.84 m 2 /g for CdS, CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h,CdS/Bi2S3-1h and Bi2S3, respectively. The chemical composition of the as-synthesized samples were further analyzed by XPS.The survey spectra in Figure 4a clearly indicate that the obtained samples are composed of Cd, S, and/or Bi elements. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Bi4f (Figure 4b) shows two peaks at binding energy of 163.6 and 158.3 eV, corresponding to Bi4f5/2 and Bi4f7/2, respectively.The doublet peak separation between the Bi4f5/2 and Bi4f7/2 is 5.3 eV, indicating that the valence state of Bi is 3 28.The peaks at around 162.3 and 161.1 eV are ascribed to S2p1/2 and S2p3/2, respectively.The resultant splitting energy of 1.2 eV is the characteristic value of S 2- 29.As for the high resolution XPS spectra of Cd3d (Figure 4c), two peaks at about 411.5 and 404.8 eV can be assigned to Cd3d3/2 and Cd3d5/2, respectively.The splitting energy of 6.7 eV between Cd3d3/2 and Cd3d5/2 is a typical value for Cd 2 in sulfides 37.The shift of Cd3d to a higher binding energy for the Bi2S3/CdS heterostructures is due to the interaction between Bi2S3 and CdS. UV-visible absorption spectra show that CdS possesses an absorption edge around 530 nm and Bi2S3 exhibits strong absorption in the whole UV-vis region (Figure 5a).The two fluctuations at around 500 nm and 860 nm in Figure 5a To evaluate the band structure of the as-synthesized CdS and Bi2S3 samples, Mott-Schottky plots were measured to determine the Flat-band potential (EFB) using equation (1), where C is space charge capacitance, ND is donor density, and 0 are the respective dielectric constants of free space and film electrode, E is applied potential, EFB is flat-band potential, B is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and q is electronic charge 38. Figure S4 shows the Mott-Schottky plots of CdS and Bi2S3.Positive slope of the linear section in the Mott-Schottky plots indicates the n-type behavior of CdS and Bi2S3.The EFB value can be estimated from the interception at X axis by linear extrapolating the linear region (1/C 2 0), which is -1.52 and -0.42 V (vs SCE) for CdS and Bi2S3, equivalent to -1.28 and -0.18 V (vs NHE), respectively.It is known that the CB position (ECB) of n-type a semiconductor is 0.10.3eV higher than EFB, dependent on the electron effective mass and carrier concentration 39.Here, the voltage difference between ECB and EFB is set to be 0.2 eV, and thereby, the bottom of the ECB for CdS and Bi2S3 is -1.48 and -0.38 V (vs NHE), respectively.The reduction potential of FeTCPP is -1.02V (vs NHE), thus electron transfer from the CB of CdS to FeTCPP is thermodynamically feasible, while the electron transfer from the CB of Bi2S3 to FeTCPP is thermodynamically unfavorable 34.Combining with the Eg derived from the absorption spectra in Figure 5, in addition, the valence band value (EVB) is calculated to be 0.96 V and 1.14 V (vs NHE) for CdS and Bi2S3, respectively. A series of control experiments were first carried out, i.e., without CO2 purging, without illumination, blank solvent without the photocatalysts, and only FeTCPP molecular catalyst.No any products like CH4 or CO can be detected in these experiments, indicating that the observed products indeed come from the Figure 6 shows the CO2 photoreduction results using the as-prepared semiconductor as light harvesting unit and FeTCPP as the catalyst center under visible-light illumination.Here the amount of FeTCPP is used to calculate the product yield since it acts as the catalytic center.The CO yield is 0.94 mmol/g over the CdS/FeTCPP hybrid catalyst after 4-h visible-light illumination (i.e., 0.24 mmol/g/h) with trace amount of CH4 (0.030 mol); while the CO yield increases to 7.73 mmol/g over the CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h/FeTCPPhybrid catalyst after 4 h (i.e., 1.93 mmol/g/h) with trace amount of CH4 (0.040 mol).That is to say, the CO yield over CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h/FeTCPP is about 8.2 times of that over CdS/FeTCPP.In addition, CO2 photoreduction using pure CdS and CdS/Bi2S3-0.5hheterostructure as the photocatalyst has been also performed (Table S1).If these results are compared with those acquired over the systems combined with FeTCPP, although not reasonable since the active centers are different, the CO yield is much higher for the CdS/FeTCPP catalyst than the pure CdS, and the CH4 yield is slightly increased for the hybrid catalyst.The same trend is observed for CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h/FeTCPPand CdS/Bi2S3-0.5hcatalysts. Meanwhile, H2 evolution is also observed mainly due to the in-situ generation of protonated TEOA TEOA , i.e. (HOCH2CH2)3NH ), which is an acid with pKA of about 7.8.This species is in favor of the formation of the porphyrin hydride, eventually leading to the evolution of H2 40.The H2 yield over the CdS/FeTCPP and CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h/FeTCPPafter 4-h visible-light illumination is 14.12 and 24.30 mmol/g (i.e., 3.53 and 6.08 mmol/g/h), respectively.The latter is about 1.7 times of the former.So CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h/FeTCPPexhibits much higher photoreduction activity than CdS/FeTCPP.However, it is noted that the CdS/Bi2S3-1h/FeTCPP catalyst shows much lower activity than CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h/FeTCPP,as only very little CO (0.10 mmol/g) and trace amount of CH4 (0.014 mol) are detected. No H2 or CO is detected over Bi2S3/FeTCPP hybrid catalyst, and only trace amount of CH4 (0.036 mol) is observed after 4-h visible-light illumination.This should be due to the low ECB (-0.38 V, vs NHE) of Bi2S3, which can not drive electron transfer from the CB of Bi2S3 to FeTCPP (-1.02 V, vs NHE). This may be further confirmed by the fact that Bi2S3 has very similar CH4 yield to Bi2S3/FeTCPP (Table S1).The photoreduction of CO2 over CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h/FeTCPPhybrid catalyst performed under illumination with 580 nm can further support this conclusion.In this condition, only trace amount of CH4 (0.016 mol) is obtained since Bi2S3 can be excited while CdS has no absorption (Figure 5a) and thus cannot be excited, indicating that the photoexcited electrons in Bi2S3 can transfer neither to the CB of CdS nor to FeTCPP because of its low ECB level (i.e., high electron affinity).The activity of CH4 production is not discussed since only trace amout of CH4 is observed upon CO2 photoreduction over different catalysts. Two major reasons may account for the enhanced performance of CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h/FeTCPPhybrid catalyst.One is that the amount of surface defects on CdS nanorods can be reduced via the ion-exchange reaction, which can be proved by the ESR characterization.As shown in Figure S5, the typical sulfur vacancy signal appears at g 2.003 41.CdS shows the highest ESR signal, followed by CdS/Bi2S3-0.In addition, CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h/FeTCPPhybrid catalyst exhibits good stability according to the linear increase of the CO and H2 yield over CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h/FeTCPPupon CO2 reduction under visible-light illumination for 9 h (Figure S6).Moreover, this is further confirmed by XRD results that the XRD patterns after CO2 photoreduction (Figure S7) are similar to those before the photoreduction (Figure 1). To investigate the charge transfer mechanism, ESR spectra of CdS, CdS/Bi2S3-0.5hand Bi2S3 were collected using DMPO as radical scavenger under visible-light illumination.DMPO can react with superoxide radical O2 -or carbon-centered radical -C to form DMPO-radical complex, giving rise to special ESR signals 424344.If without TEOA and FeTCPP, a strong characteristic peak of DMPO-O2 - with a standard intensity ratio of 1:1:1:1 can be observed for pure CdS (Figure 7a) 42.Since the redox potential of O2/O2 -is -0.33 V (vs NHE), it is very easy for CdS to trap molecular oxygen to generate O2 -under visible-light irradiation.However, the DMPO-O2 -signal can hardly be observed for Bi2S3, possibly because the ECB of Bi2S3 (-0.38 V vs NHE) is almost the same as the redox potential of O2/O2 - and/or the electron-hole recombination is very severe in Bi2S3.The intensity of the DMPO-O2 -signal decreases greatly for CdS/Bi2S3-0.5hheterostructure compared with that of CdS, while it is still slightly stronger than that of Bi2S3, indicating that most of the photogenerated electrons in CdS can transfer to Bi2S3 in CdS/Bi2S3-0.5hheterostructure since the ECB of Bi2S3 is much lower than that of CdS (-1.48V, vs NHE).This conclusion can also be confirmed from the results of transient photocurrent response curves (Figure S8), stead-state and time-resolved PL spectra (Figure S9 and Table S2). Interestingly, very different ESR results are obtained when measured in the presence of TEOA and FeTCPP under visible-light illumination ( 420 nm).A predominated signal with six peaks is observed for CdS (Figure 7b), which can be assigned to DMPO-carbon centered radical (DMPO-C) due to the oxidization of TEOA by the photogenerated holes in CdS 43,44.However, no any ESR signal can be observed if the experiment was performed under the illumination of CdS with 580 nm (Figure S10), indicating that the DMPO-C is formed from the oxidization of TEOA by the photogenerated holes in CdS.In addition to the DMPO-C signal, the DMPO-O2 -signal also appears for the CdS although it is very weak due to some reason not understood yet (Figure 7b).Considering the strong DMPO-O2 -signal for CdS in the case without the TEOA and FeTCPP (Figure 7a), we infer that most of the photogenerated electrons in CdS can efficiently transfer to FeTCPP molecular catalyst due to the more negative ECB of CdS and strong interaction between CdS and FeTCPP.The latter may be because of the carboxylic groups in the FeTCPP as they can coordinate with the Cd ions in CdS. For Bi2S3 in the presence of TEOA and FeTCPP, no DMPO-O2 -signal can be observed based on the same reason as discussed above.Furthermore, since the ECB of Bi2S3 (-0.38 V) is less negative than that of FeTCPP (-1.02 V) and thus the electrons cannot transfer to FeTCPP, only a relatively weak DMPO-C signal is observed for Bi2S3, which is originated from the oxidization of TEOA by the photogenerated holes in Bi2S3.The severe electron-hole recombination in Bi2S3 may explain the observed weak signal. For CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h in the presence of TEOA and FeTCPP, very interestingly, almost no ESR signal can be observed (Figure 7b), while a weak characteristic peak of DMPO-O2 -can be observed without the TEOA and FeTCPP as mentioned above (Figure 7a).Since the majority of electrons generated in the CB Therefore, if the CdS/Bi2S3 is not hybrided with FeTCPP, it is thermodynamically favorable for the photogenerated electrons to migrate from the CB of CdS to that of Bi2S3 in the CdS/Bi2S3 heterostructure; meanwhile the electrons can also transfer from the CB of Bi2S3 to the VB of CdS through the Z-scheme mode.However, when the CdS/Bi2S3 is hybrided with FeTCPP, the photogenerated electrons in CdS will efficiently transfer to the FeTCPP, followed by the CO2 reduction occuring over the FeTCPP molecular catalyst (Scheme 1).Accordingly, the electron transfer from CdS to Bi2S3 will be suppressed greatly upon intergration with FeTCPP.Therefore, the introduction of FeTCPP can change the transfer direction of electrons in CdS/Bi2S3-0.5hheterostructure.More important, the strong reducibility of electrons in the CB of CdS can thus be preserved due to the feasibility of Z-scheme mode in the hybride catalyst, which is in favor of the transfer to FeTCPP.Meanwhile, the separation and utilization of charge carriers will be considerably enhanced.In addition, as discussed above, the reduced sulfur vacancy in the heterostructure can further faciliate the separation of charge carriers.As a result, CO2 reduction can occur over the FeTCPP catalytic center much more efficiently, also because the TEOA acts as the sacrificial agent for hole scavenging."

    "content": "In conclusion, we have successfully fabricated CdS/Bi2S3/FeTCPP heterogeneous hybrid photocatalysts for highly efficient photoreduction of CO2 into CO and H2 under visible-light irradiation.Here the semiconductor acts as the light-harvesting antenna and FeTCPP molecular catalyst works as the catalytic center for CO2 reduction.The formation of CdS/Bi2S3 heterojunction can reduce the surface sulfur vacancy in CdS and thereby, increasing the charge separation and utilization.More important, the electron transfer direction can be changed once the CdS/Bi2S3 is integrated with the FeTCPP catalyst, as evidenced by the results of ESR and CO2 reduction.Accordingly, CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h/FeTCPPheterogeneous hybrid photocatalyst exhibits the highest activity for solar fuels production, with CO yield of 7.73 mmol/g and H2 yield of 24.30 mmol/g after 4 h under visible-light irradiation.This work may afford a better understanding of CO2 reduction over semiconductor heterostructure/molecular catalyst hybrid systems, and provide a feasible approach to fabricate highly efficient heterogeneous photocatalysts for solar fuel production. Figure 5b and Figure 5c.The Eg of CdS is calculated to be 2.44 eV, and Bi2S3 has a relatively narrow Eg CO2 photoreduction.For pure FeTCPP under visible-light irradiation, it is because of the lack of light absorber that there is no any reduction products observed. 5hand CdS/Bi2S3-1h, indicating that sulfur vacancy content gradually decreases after the formation of CdS/Bi2S3 heterojunction.The surface vacancy defects can act as the recombination centers of free electrons and holes.Thus, the decreased sulfur vacancy means that the separation and utilization of the charge carriers can be enhanced.Another possible reason is that the formation of CdS/Bi2S3 heterostructure can improve the charge separation efficiency too, as being discussed in the following section.As a result, CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h/FeTCPPhybrid photocatalyst shows high CO2 reduction activity due to the synergistic effect of the enhanced charge separation and utilization.For CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h heterostructure, just little Bi2S3 is formed on the CdS surface since the molar ratio of Bi2S3/CdS is only 0.12 for CdS/Bi2S3-0.5h,which means that most of the CdS can still directly hybrid with FeTCPP and the electrons in the CB of CdS can efficiently transfer to FeTCPP.However, most of the CdS is transformed into Bi2S3 if further increasing the ion-exchange reaction time (for instance, the molar ratio of Bi2S3/CdS is 1.55 for CdS/Bi2S3-1h), leaving CdS heavily coated with Bi2S3 layer.It is almost impossible for the electrons produced in such heavily-coated CdS transfer to FeTCPP molecular catalyst, resulting in greatly decreased photocatalytic activity of CdS/Bi2S3-1h/FeTCPP hybrid catalyst. CdS can transfer to the FeTCPP and the rest may transfer to the CB of Bi2S3 (Scheme 1), no DMPO-O2 -signal can be observed in the ESR spectrum when there are TEOA and FeTCPP in the system.However, it is complicated for the behavior of holes.Those generated in the VB of Bi2S3 can either transfer to the VB of CdS or recombine directly with the electrons; whereas for the holes in the VB of CdS, no matter they are originally arisen from CdS or Bi2S3, considerable amount of them can recombine with the electrons transferred from the CB of Bi2S3 (i.e., via Z-scheme mode, Scheme 1).Considering the DMPO-C signal is very weak for both CdS and Bi2S3 in the presence of TEOA and FeTCPP, as well as the intrinsic recombination of both CdS and Bi2S3, no DMPO-C signal can be detected either in the CdS/Bi2S3-0.5hwhen both TEOA and FeTCPP are present in the system.
