    "content": "At room temperature, 40 mL of anhydrous ethanol was mixed with 1 mL of deionized water.Then 1 ml of concentrated HCl (12 mol/L) was added to adjust the pH value.After mixing, 3 ml of PdCl 2 solution was added into the mixture.Under vigorous stirring, 12 ml of tetrabutyl titanate was added dropwise into the solution.The mixture was stirred continuously until the formation of TiO 2 gel.The resultant precipitate was dried at 100 C for 12 h after aging at room temperature for 24 h and calcined at 450 C for 2.5 h.A series of Pd modified TiO 2 catalysts with different concentrations of palladium was prepared by changing the concentration of PdCl 2 solution added in the mixture.The catalysts were designated as TiO 2 -Pd x, where \"x\" represented the nominal molar percentage content of Pd 2 ions in all metal ions (Pd and Ti) in TiO 2 .Pure TiO 2 , TiO 2 -Cu x and TiO 2 -Mn x samples were prepared with the same procedure, but by replacing the PdCl 2 solution with deionized water, CuCl 2 and MnCl 2 solution, respectively.Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/max 2500 X-ray diffraction spectrometer(Cu K, 1.54056A) in the range of 2080.The average crystal size was calculated based on Scherrer equation (D k/Bcos, parameter B is the peak half width).The BET surface areas of samples were determined by nitrogen absorption-desorption isotherm measurement at 77K (Micromeritics Automatic Surface Area Analyzer Gemini 2360, Shimadzu).Raman spectra were taken on a Renishaw in Via Raman microscope by using the 785 nm line of Renishaw HPNIR 785 semiconductor laser.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out with a VG-Scientific ESCA Lab 220i-XL spectrometer by using an unmonochromated Al K(1486.6eV)X-ray source.All of the XPS spectra were calibrated with respect to the binding energy of the adventitious C1s peak at 284.8 eV.Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) was taken on a scanning electron microscope (FEI Helios Nanolab 600i, USA).The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis were performed using a Philips Tecnai G2F20 instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV, for which the samples were prepared by applying a drop of ethanol suspension onto an amorphous carbon-coated copper grid and dried natural-ly.Diffuse reflectance UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrometer (U-4100, Hitachi).The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS920) using the 340 nm line of a Xe light as the excitation source.The time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra were measured on FL900 (Edinburgh, England) by using the light source of nf900.The experimental setup consists of a gas chromatograph (GC7890F, Shanghai Techcomp Instrument Co., Ltd.), a hydrogen generator (SPH-300A, Beijing BCHP Analytical Technology Institute), an automatic air source (SPB-3, Beijing BCHP Analytical Technology Institute) and a computer for data processing.All the measurements were carried out at room temperature (252) C unless stated otherwise. The photoreduction of CO 2 and H 2 O into CH 4 was carried out in a 225 mL cylindrical glass reactor with built-in light source of a 32 W Hg lamp.A stirred annular reactor (length 20 cm, width 4 cm) with a suspended catalyst was illuminated by a peak light wavelength at 253.7 nm situated in the center of the quartz tube.The whole reactor contains solution layer (125 ml) and gas layer (100 ml).First, 125 mg of catalysts was suspended in 125 mL of NaOH solutions (0.2 mol/L) in the reactor and the whole reactor was continuously inflated by CO 2 gas (99.999) at a flux of 0.3 L min -1 for at least 45 min, which was used to exclude the O 2 and other gas in the whole reactor.The pH value of the solution is evaluated to be at 6.5.Except for the NaOH solutions in the reactor, the 100 mL of gas layer filled with CO 2 is applied for quantitative test of the generated product CH 4 and CO.The cooling water in the outer layer of reactor was used to maintain the temperature balance of the whole reactor ((252) C).Every 2 h, 0.4 mL gas of gas layer was extracted to measure the produced amount of CH 4 and CO by a gas chromatograph (GC7890F, Shanghai Techcomp Instrument Co., Ltd.).The chemical reagents were all of analytical grade in the experiments and water was deionized water (18.2M cm). The calculation was carried out by a first-principle calculation software package CASTEP.Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) 1617 based density-functional theory (DFT) was used to calculate the electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) for TiO 2 , TiO 2 -Pd, TiO 2 -Cu and TiO 2 -Mn, respectively.An anatase TiO 2 model of 76 atoms with exposed (101) facet is created.The vacuum region has the same thickness as the TiO 2 slab.For TiO 2 -Pd, TiO 2 -Cu and TiO 2 -Mn, one metal ion is linked with two surface bridge O ions on the (101) facet.The pseudopotential used is Vanderbilt-type ultrasoft pseudopotential with 2s 2 2p 4 , 3s 2 3p 6 3d 2 4s 2 , 4d 10 , 3d 10 4s 1 and 3d 5 4s 2 as the valence-electron configurations for the oxygen, titanium, palladium, copper and manganese atoms, respectively.The plane wave energy cutoffs were taken to be 420 eV.In all the cases, geometry optimizations were The Journal of Physical Chemistry carried out first, and convergence was assumed when the forces on atoms were less than 50 meV/A.Compared with experimental results, theoretical calculation usually results in a underestimated band gap, caused by the shortcoming of the exchange-correction functional in describing the excited states 1819 .Pure TiO 2 , TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 samples are studied by the EDAX spectra, shown is Figure S1.For pure TiO 2 (Figure S1a), Ti, O and C are major elements.Compared with pure TiO 2 , the Pd, Cu and Mn elements are found for TiO 2 -Pd 1 (Figure S1b), TiO 2 -Cu 1 (Figure S1c) and TiO 2 -Mn 1 (Figure S1d), respectively.This result indicates that the introduced metal ions (Pd, Cu and Mn) really exist in TiO 2 photocatalyst.The N 2 adsorption isotherms of four samples are shown in Figure S16."

    "content": "To investigate the crystal structure of the metal ions (Pd, Cu and Mn) modified TiO 2 , Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of TiO 2 , TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 samples.TiO 2 modified with different amount of the metal ions (Pd, Cu and Mn) are also tested by XRD, shown in Figure S2-S4, respectively.It can be found that anatase is the major phase 20 .Except for anatase peaks, three weak peaks located at 27.5, 36.1 and 41.3 are found 21 , respectively.This result indicates that there are tiny amount of rutile existed in four samples.No other XRD peaks related to Pd, Cu and Mn (such as PdO, CuO and MnO) are detected in TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 samples, respectively.The lattice parameters, cell volumes and crystal size for all four samples are evaluated and summarized in Table 1.It is easily observed that after the introduction of metal ions (Pd, Cu and Mn) into TiO 2 system, the specific surface area (BET) increases and the crystallite sizes of the catalysts decrease.These results suggest the addition of Pd, Cu and Mn ions could inhibit titanium dioxide's grain growth. Compared with TiO 2 , the peak position remains almost unchanged (Inset of Figure 1).The lattice parameters and cell volume remain unchanged for TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 samples (Table 1), implying that no metal ions (Pd, Cu and Mn) are doped into the lattice of TiO 2 for TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 samples.According to the doping mechanism, it is hardly for the Pd, Cu or Mn ion to weave into the crystal cell of TiO 2 via interstitial mode, as the ionic radius of Pd 2 ion (86 pm) 22 , Cu 2 ion (72 pm) 23 and Mn 2 (80 pm) 24 are larger than Ti 4 ion (68 pm) 25 .Furthermore, if the introduced Pd, Cu or Mn ions replace lattice Ti 4 through substitutional mode, the lattice parameters and cell volume increase.As a result, the XRD peaks shift to lower diffraction angles for TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 samples.However, the shift of the peaks position can't be observed for TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 in Figure 1.Thus, the Pd, Cu and Mn ions in substitutional mode can be excluded.Therefore, the conjecture that the metal ions (Pd, Cu and Mn) might exist on the surface of TiO 2 as some kinds of species for TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 is very reasonable.It is observed from Figure 2 and S15 that TiO 2 consists of nanoparticles with an average diameter of 18 nm.After modification with Pd, Cu and Mn ions, the particles size of the nanoparticles decreased effectively, compared with pure TiO 2 .Moreover, the fringe spacing (d) corresponding to the (101) plane of anatase TiO 2 is 3.52 A for all samples, suggesting the Pd, Cu and Mn ions didn't enter into TiO 2 lattice in interstitial or substitutional mode.There is no other phase, such as PdO, CuO and MnOx observed in the TEM images.These TEM and HR-TEM images further demonstrate the introduced Pd, Cu and Mn ions exist on the surface of TiO 2 as some kind of surface species.Figure 3. Raman spectra of pure TiO 2 , TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 samples Raman spectra of pure TiO 2 , TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 samples are plotted in Figure 3, to further investigate the structure of the obtained samples.Raman spectra of TiO 2 modified with different amount of the metal ions (Pd, Cu and Mn) are shown in Figure S5-S7, respectively.The peaks at about 144 cm -1 (E g ), 194 cm -1 (E g ), 396 cm -1 (B 1g ), 516 cm -1 (A 1g and B 1g ) and 638 cm -1 (E g ) are found for TiO 2 , TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 samples, ascribed to typical anatase structure 26 .Compared with TiO 2 , no shift of Raman peaks is detected for TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1, implying that the metal ions are not weaved into TiO 2 lattice and might exist on the surface as some kinds of species.In addition, the new Raman peaks at about 302 cm -1 in TiO 2 -Pd 1 and 284 cm -1 in TiO 2 -Cu 1 are observed, ascribed to stretching modes of O-Pd and O-Cu bonds on surface, respectively 2728 .Another new Raman peak at about 364 cm -1 is observed for TiO 2 -Mn 1, ascribed to stretching modes of O-Mn bonds on surface 30 .The existing states of the metal ions (Me: Pd, Cu and Mn) would be further studied by XPS.The XPS spectra for TiO 2 -Pd x, TiO 2 -Cu x and TiO 2 -Mn x samples are plotted in Figure 4a, b andc, respectively.Figure 4a shows the Pd 3d XPS spectra of TiO 2 -Pd x sample.The doublet peaks at 336.7 eV and 342.1 eV are assigned to the Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 of O-Pd-O species on surface of TiO 2 (one Pd 2 ions linked with two unsaturated O 2-ions) 22 .In the Cu 2p XPS spectra of TiO 2 -Cu x (Figure 3b), there are double peaks observed at 952.8 eV and 933.0 eV, ascribed to the Cu 2p 1/2 and Cu 2p 3/2 of O-Cu-O species on surface of TiO 2 -Cu x, which was reported by our previous work 23 , since the peak position of Cu 2p 3/2 (933.0 eV) is between those of CuO (933.9 eV) 29 and Cu 2 O (931.7 eV) 30 .As shown in Figure 3c, Mn 2p (652.5 and 640.8eV) is ascribed to the Mn 2p 1/2 and Mn 2p 3/2 of O-Mn-O species on surface of TiO 2 -Mn x, respectively, because the valence state of Mn in this work is 2 and the binding energy of Mn 2p 3/2 is between that of Mn (638.9 eV) 31 and MnO (641.4 eV) 32 , implying the Mn ion for TiO 2 -Mn x linked with less O atoms than that for MnO.This results indicate that introduced metal ions are connected with two unsaturated oxygen ions on sur- The Journal of Physical Chemistry the CB is made up of Ti 3d orbitals and a small amount of O 2p.After the introduction of the metal ions into TiO 2 system, the VB top and CB bottom for TiO 2 -Pd, TiO 2 -Cu and TiO 2 -Mn almost remain unchanged compared with pure TiO 2 .However, for TiO 2 -Pd (Figure 5b) and TiO 2 -Cu (Figure 5c), the small hump occurs near to VB, due to the the mixed O 2p state with the Pd 4d or Cu 3d state, respectively.For TiO 2 -Mn (Figure 5d), a small peak forms close to the conduction of TiO 2 owing to the mixed O 2p state with the Mn 3d state. According to the discussion above, the introduction of metal ions (Pd, Cu and Mn) into TiO 2 system might enhance the visible response and inhibit the recombination of charge carriers, which would be in favor to improve the photocatalytic activity for photoreduction CO 2 into CH 4 .To prove the theoretical prediction, the corresponding characterizations are performed, as shown in the following sections.To explore the band structure of pure TiO 2 , TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 samples, XPS valence band (VB) spectra and diffuse reflectance UV-vis absorption spectra are shown in Figure 7.The XPS valence band spectra of TiO 2 , TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 are plotted in Figure 7a.The energy levels are in alignment with the work function of the XPS instrument (4.10 eV, Fermi level).The binding energies of the onset edge reveal the energy gap between the VB top and Fermi lev-el 36 .In Figure 6a, the onset edge of the VB for pure TiO 2 is 2.75 eV (2.35 eV, vs NHE).Meanwhile, it can be observed from Figure 6a that the onset edge of the valence band maximum for TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 is almost the same as that of pure TiO 2 , indicating the valence band position of TiO 2 is not changed by modified metal ions (Pd, Cu and Mn).Moreover, the hump about 2.25 eV (1.85 eV, vs NHE) for TiO 2 -Pd 1 and 1.75 eV (1.35 eV, vs NHE) for TiO 2 -Cu 1 are found, caused by the contribution of the Pd 3d states and Cu 3d states for O-Me-O species on surface of TiO 2 , respectively.So the energy levels of O-Pd-O and O-Cu-O species are at about 0.5 eV and 1 eV above the VB top of TiO 2 .In addition, the energy level of O-Mn-O for TiO 2 -Mn 1 is not observed, implies the energy levels related to O-Mn-O species are close to the CB of TiO 2 . In Figure 7b, the strong peak in UV light region is observed for all samples, because of the band-band transition.The band gap is estimated to be about 3.0 eV for pure TiO 2 , as the absorption onset edge is about 412.9 nm 21 .According to the onset edge of the valence band maximum (In Figure 7a,2.75eV (2.35 eV, vs NHE)), the CB bottom is -0.65 V (vs NHE) for pure TiO 2 .Moreover, the stronger peaks at around 496 nm for TiO 2 -Pd 1, at about 450 and 750 nm for TiO 2 -Cu 1 and at about 435 nm for TiO 2 -Mn 1 are observed, respectively.Moreover, with an increase of the modified metal ions (Pd, Cu and Mn), the absorption in visible region is further enhanced for TiO 2 -Pd x, TiO 2 -Cu x and TiO 2 -Mn x ( Figure S8), indicating that the visible-light absorption is really caused by the contribution of O-Me-O species (Me: Pd, Cu and Mn). According to the results of XPS valence band spectra and DFT calculation, a peak at around 496 nm for TiO 2 -Pd 1 is attributed to the electron transition from the surface energy level of O-Pd-O to the CB of TiO 2 .Two peaks about 450 and above 750 nm for TiO 2 -Cu 1 are attributed to the electron transition from the surface energy level of O-Cu-O to the CB of TiO 2 and from VB of TiO 2 to the surface energy level of O-Cu-O, respectively.So, energy levels of O-Pd-O and O-Cu-O species can be determined at 0.5 eV and 1.0 eV above VB of TiO 2 .For TiO 2 -Mn 1, the strong absorption around 435 nm can be ascribed to electron transition from VB to the surface energy level of O-Mn-O, which is determined at around 0.15 eV below the CB.Therefore, the schematic band structure of TiO 2 modified metal ions (Pd, Cu and Mn) photocatalysts are drawn and shown in Figure 10.The PL spectra is employed to investigate charge carriers' behavior of TiO 2 , TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 photocatalysts, shown in Figure 8.The peaks centered at about 467 and 528 nm are attributed to the transition from the oxygen vacancies with two trapped electrons and one trapped electron to the VB of TiO 2 , respectively 33-36 .The energy level of the oxygen vacancies is calculated to be about 0.34 and 0.65 eV below the CB of TiO 2 , respectively.The generated electrons in CB would migrate to the energy level of oxygen vacancies via a nonirradiative process, and further recombine with the holes in the VB, along with the fluorescence emission 37 .So, the decreased PL intensity suggests the efficient separation of photogenerated carriers.Shown in Figure 7, the photoluminescence intensity of TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 are weakened significantly compared with pure TiO 2 , indicating that the introduction of metal ions (Pd, Cu and Mn) could effectively separate of photogenerated charge carriers.Moreover, TiO 2 -Pd 1 sample shows the lowest fluorescence intensity in the four samples.The time-resolved PL decay curves of TiO 2 , TiO 2 -Mn 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Pd 1 are shown in Figure S9 and Table 2.The 1 and 2 value for TiO 2 , TiO 2 -Mn 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Pd 1 samples was counted through the double exponential decay fitting 37 .The PL decay curve derives from a nonradiative ( 1 ) process and a radiative ( 2 ) process 383940 .The fast decay ( 1 ) comes from the nonradiative relaxation process in connection with oxygen vacancies, and the slow decay process ( 2 ) is usually ascribed to the radiative process about the recombination of carriers 37 .It is shown that the 2 value for pure TiO 2 is 0.842 ns in Table 2.The PL lifetime of TiO 2 -Mn 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Pd 1 is effectively prolonged, compared with pure TiO 2 and the corresponding 2 values are 0.936, 0.993 and 1.146 ns, respectively, indicating that the photogenerated charge carriers is separated.Among these samples, the 2 value of TiO 2 -Pd 1 is longest, which is consistent with the result of PL spectra.These results further suggest that the modification with metal ions (Pd, Cu and Mn) can inhibit effectively the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.To evaluate the photocatalytic performance, the photoreduction of CO 2 and H 2 O into CH 4 under UV light irradiation is employed for all samples.CO is the intermediate product and CH 4 is the final product 49 .The photocatalytic results of pure TiO 2 , TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 are shown in Figure 9 and Table 3. Pure TiO 2 represents limited photocatalytic performance and about 1.52 mol of CH 4 is produced after irradiation for 12 hours.Compared with pure TiO 2 , the TiO 2 -Pd 1, TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 samples show an enhanced photocatalytic activity and 4.433, 2.916, 2.720 mol of CH 4 is produced, respectively.The specific photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 is 1.92 and 1.79 times higher than pure TiO 2 , respectively.For all samples, the TiO 2 -Pd 1 photocatalyst shows the better photocatalytic performance than any other samples, whose specific photocatalytic activity is 2.92 times higher than pure TiO 2 .In addition, the photocatalytic experiment of TiO Compared with TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 samples, the PL intensity for TiO 2 -Pd 1 is further quenched and the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons is prolonged, indicating the photogenerated charge carriers are separated more efficiently.More excited carriers participate in photoreduction reaction for TiO 2 -Pd 1 sample, leading to a much better photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 -Cu 1 and TiO 2 -Mn 1 samples.The large BET surface area for TiO 2 -Pd 1 also benefits for the photocatalytic reaction.Moreover, though the lifetime of photogenerated electrons for TiO 2 -Mn 1 is almost the same as that for TiO 2 -Cu 1, the PL intensity is further quenched and BET surface area is larger.That is reason why TiO 2 -Mn 1 exhibit better photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 -Cu 1."
