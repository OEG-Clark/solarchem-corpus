    "content": "Designation and optimization of facets of photocatalysts is an effective strategy to address the issue of facetdependent photocatalytic reactions.However, studies regarding the facet effect of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on the photocatalytic process are in infancy.In this study, NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) with different ratios of 001 and 111 facets was exactly controlled and synthesized, and it was found that the activity in photoreduction of CO 2 is enhanced with gradually increasing exposed proportion of 111 facets.The 111 facets exhibit photocatalytic activity with the maximal CO and CH 4 yields of 8.25 and 1.01 mol g -1 h -1 , which are 9 and 5 times higher than those of 001 facets, respectively.Also, the 111 facets give the highest quantum yields of 0.14 and 0.07 for CO and CH 4 production, respectively.Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectra reveal the importance of inhibiting the recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes for the sample with 111 facets.Besides, Ti III formed during the reaction process exhibits strong reducibility for CO 2 .Starting from NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti), the photocatalytic performance can be enhanced by regulating exposed 111 facets.This work not only provides a strategy for further enhancing photocatalytic performance by tuning the exposed active facets of MOFs, but also provides a deep understanding of the factors for improving the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ."

    "content": "In the synthetic system, we identified that the volume ratio of DMF and MeOH is powerful to adjust the ratio of 001 and 111 facets.These samples are denoted as NM 001 , NM A , NM B , NM C , and NM 111 , where NM represents NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti); 001 and 111 are the dominant facets; and A, B, and C are the mixed 001 and 111 facets with different ratios.Tuning the solvent ratio of DMF and MeOH and different titanium sources of titanium tetraisopropanolate (TPOT) or titanium butoxide (TBOT) with or without a modulator of AA can achieve transition of the morphology and facet for NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) (Figure 1a).For further observation of the evolution of the morphology and facet of all samples directly, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained.Clearly, these well-faceted NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) can be easily identified as 001 and 111 facets according to the SEM.The disk-shaped NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) exposes two 001 facets on the top and bottom (Figure 1c).Along with the variation of tuning factors (Table S1), the 001 facets are gradually diminished, and the 111 facets appeared and increased (Figure 1d-f).Until the last sample shown in Figure 1g, 001 facets disappeared, and the 111 facets were exposed completely.The results demonstrate the evolution of assynthesized NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) facets from 001 to 111.The average sizes of the samples are displayed in Figure 1h.The average percentages of exposed 001 and 111 facets were calculated from the corresponding facet area as illustrated in Scheme S1 (Table S3). 36owder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the assynthesized samples are shown in Figure 1b, which confirm that all the samples matched well with the calculated NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti). 37It is noteworthy that the relative intensity of (101) and ( 202) crystallographic planes at 6.7 and 13.5r educed and disappeared, respectively.Furthermore, compared with the calculated NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti), the relative intensity of (222) facet at 16.6increased gradually from NM 001 to NM 111 .The (hkl) denotes Miller indices of the facet, and hkl indicates a family index of the crystal facet. 38XRD peaks reflect the distribution of atom arrays in the facet of samples, and facet-dependent PXRD patterns indicate that the surfaces of NM 001 and NM 111 are dominated by 001 and 111 facets, respectively, as discussed previously. 28The facet-dependent PXRD patterns are consistent with the morphology and facet observed by SEM.The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra are shown in Figure S1 to further clarify the functional groups of NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti).Thermogravimetric analyses reveal that NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) with different exposed facets have similar thermal stability (Figure S2).These character-izations indicate that NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) with varied proportions of exposed 001 and 111 facets were successfully achieved. To investigate the optical properties of these samples, UVvis diffuse reflectance spectra were examined.The results indicate that all samples display light absorption from the UV to visible region (Figure 2a).The prepared samples mainly exhibit two absorption bands around 300 and 400 nm, corresponding to the absorption of Ti-O x clusters and ligandbased absorption within the framework of MOFs. 35,39The absorption wavelength shows red shift with increasing the ratios of 111 facets of the samples.The NM 111 displays the maximal red-shifted absorption wavelength, while NM 001 gives the narrowest absorption.Tauc plots were used to estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap, as depicted in Figure 2b.For semiconductor-like MOFs, the HOMO-LUMO gap is defined as the gap between the HOMO and the LUMO according to the molecular orbital model.To estimate the HOMO-LUMO gap edges of the catalysts, the Mott-Schottky plots were measured (Figures S3-S7).The flat band potentials were determined to be -0.63,-0.68, -0.72, -0.75, and -0.78 V versus NHE for NM 001 , NM A , NM B , NM C , and NM 111 , respectively.Thus, the calculated HOMO-LUMO gaps are 2.75 eV (NM 001 ), 2.69 eV (NM A ), 2.65 eV (NM B ), 2.66 eV (NM C ), and 2.61 eV (NM 111 ), as shown in Figure 2c.The catalyst with a lower HOMO-LUMO gap requires light with lower energy to inspire photogenerated electrons and holes.Accordingly, the exposure of 111 facets in NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) is favorable for possessing a better photoresponse under simulated sunlight irradiation and decreasing the energy of photoexcited electrons. According to the optical behavior of these samples, we explored their photocatalytic performance for CO 2 reduction and evaluated the correlation between photocatalytic activity and facets of the as-synthesized NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti).The photocatalytic CO 2 -to-CO and CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversions of the samples are depicted in Figure 3a.The CO and CH 4 characterized peaks are monitored by an FID detector (Figure S8).The NM 111 exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for generation of CO and CH 4 with product yields of 8.25 and 1.01 mol g -1 h -1 , which are 9 and 5 times higher than those of NM 001 , respectively.Also, NM 111 gives the highest quantum yields (QYs) of 0.14 and 0.07 for CO and CH 4 production (Table S4), which are comparable or higher than some reported photocatalysts (Tables S5 andS6).Interestingly, the trend of the product yields with respect to the facet surface area is consistent with the mass of catalysts (Figure 3a,b), and NM 111 shows the best performance (Figure 3b). 40,41Upon irradiation, the reduction reaction proceeded, in which TEOA acts as a proton and electron donor, providing 2e -and 8e -for reduction products of CO and CH 4 , respectively (Figure 3c).The degradation product of TEOA is determined as 2-(bis(2hydroxyethyl)amino)acetaldehyde (Figures S9 andS10).The 1 H NMR spectrum is used to prove that no liquid product was generated during the photocatalytic reaction (Figure S11).To verify that the detected CO and CH 4 are generated via the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, we performed comparison experiments.No C 1 products can be detected with absent CO 2 or photocatalyst.To further confirm the carbon source of the CO and CH 4 products, the 13 C-isotope trace experiment was employed using 13 CO 2 as the substrate.The products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).The signal peaks at m/z 29 ( 13 CO) and m/z 17 ( 13 CH 4 ) are observed (Figure 3f).The irradiation timedependence evolution of CO and CH 4 during 5 h is given in Figure 3d, and the intriguing phenomenon of the photochromic effect was observed in this photocatalytic system (inset in Figure 3d).The color changed from original bright yellow to green with constant irradiation and then turned to the yellow after the photocatalytic reaction.This process is attributed to the interconversion between Ti IV and Ti III valent states in the Ti-O x cluster with transition of the photogenerated electrons. 42Furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were measured to elucidate the existence of Ti III .As revealed in Figure 3e, no EPR signal was detected in the dark, while an obvious peak was observed with a g factor of 1.948 upon irradiation for 5 min. 43,44The results provide clues to further ensure the existence of Ti III , indicating the conversion of Ti IV to Ti III in the photoreduction system.It is noteworthy that NM 111 exhibits excellent stability after five cycles, and the photoreduction activity was maintained above 85 compared with the initial test (Figure S12).The PXRD pattern (Figure S13), FT-IR spectra (Figure S14), and SEM image (Figure S15) of NM 111 after five recycles confirm the structure stability under the photocatalytic reaction conditions. To further explore the facet effect on the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, N 2 adsorption isotherms were measured to obtain specific surface areas of the as-synthesized samples.As shown in Figure S16, all samples exhibit type I isotherms at 77 K with strong N 2 uptakes at a low relative pressure (P/P 0 0.001). 45,46NM 111 possesses the largest specific surface area (1312.2cm 3 g -1 ) among all the samples.The specific surface areas are found to increase with the increasing percentages of exposed 111 facets.Moreover, the adsorption abilities of these photocatalysts were investigated with catalytic substrate CO 2 , and CO 2 adsorption isotherms are obtained at 273 (Figure S17) and 298 K (Figure S18), showing the relatively large amounts CO 2 uptakes of NM 111 .The specific surface areas and the CO 2 uptakes are listed in Table S3.The high specific surface area and superior CO 2 uptake ability of NM 111 provide more active sites for enhanced photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity. 47he survey spectra of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are provided in Figure S19, and high-resolution XPS (HR-XPS) was employed to estimate the chemical state and coordination environment of NM 111 and NM 001 .As shown in Figure 4a, the Ti 2p displays two binding energy peaks at 458.9 and 464.6 eV, which is attributed to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 of Ti IV , respectively, indicating that titanium bonded to oxygen in the Ti-O x cluster remained in Ti IV . 48High-resolution O 1s presents distinction between NM 111 and NM 001 with three fitted peaks (Figure 4b).The first peak located at 531.9 eV is assigned to the oxygen in the carboxylate group in NH 2 -BDC, while the other two peaks at 530.7 and 530.2 eV are ascribed to oxygen in the Ti-O x cluster of NM 111 . 49The observed peak intensities are clearly higher than those of NM 001 , indicating that more Ti-O x clusters are exposed in the 111 facets in NM 111 .The atomic concentrations of NM 111 and NM 001 are listed in Table S2.NM 111 exhibits higher Ti atomic concentration than NM 001 , demonstrating more exposure of Ti-O x clusters on the surface of NM 111 .The structure of 001 and 111 facets in NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) revealed the distinct distribution of Ti-O x on different facets (Figures S20 andS21).As shown in Figure 4c, high-resolution N 1s presents two peaks corresponding to the -NH- and -NH 2 in amino groups of NM 111 and NM 001 , respectively. 50Obviously, the binding energy at 402.0 eV of NM 111 is stronger than that of NM 001 , implying the stronger electron transfer in NM 111 .The results demonstrate abundant Ti-O x clusters and the vigorous electron transfer on the surface of NM 111 , which further improve the photocatalytic activity. In addition to UV-vis spectra, steady photoluminescence (PL) spectral measurements were carried out to in-depth investigate photoinduced charge separation properties (Figure 5a).Under the excitation wavelength of 325 nm, NM 001 shows a high-intensity fluorescence at 485 nm due to the fast recombination of charge carriers, while PL intensity decreased significantly with the increase of the percentages of the 111 facets.Such appearance indicates the low recombination rate of photoinduced charge carriers and the effective separation of photogeneration electrons and holes in 111 facets.The timeresolved fluorescence decay spectra were performed to explore the photogeneration carrier dynamics of these as-synthesized photocatalysts (Figure 5b).The charge-separated lifetime increases in the order of NM 001 (0.17 ns) NM A (0.94 ns) NM B (1.19 ns) NM C (1.25 ns) NM 111 (1.63 ns), generally corresponding to a trend of prolonged lifetimes with the increase in the exposure of 111 facets.In the present case, the longer fluorescence lifetimes are attributed to the fast transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and inhibition of the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. 51The effective electronic interactions among these photocatalysts were investigated by the photocurrent transient response measurement (Figure 5c).All the catalysts exhibited a clear photocurrent response under on-off simulated sunlight irradiation.NM 001 shows lower photocurrent density due to the fast recombination of photogeneration charge carriers.The photocurrent signal increases with the increase of the ratio of exposed 111 facets, and NM 111 possesses the largest photocurrent response, revealing that the NM 111 has capability of interface charge transfer and separation.Besides, the results are also supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Figure 5d).The charge transfer resistance (R ct ) of NM 111 is much lower than that of NM 001 , NM A , NM B , and NM C , indicating the favorable electron transfer of NM 111 during the light irradiation. Based on the above results, we proposed a possible mechanism for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction of NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) with exposed varied ratios of 001 and 111 facets (Scheme 1).First, the high LUMO value of NM 111 reaches -0.78 V (vs NHE) with a strong ability to realize CO 2 -to-CO (-0.52 V) and CO 2 -to-CH 4 (-0.24V) conversions. 17,52Photogenerated electrons are excited from the HOMO under simulated light irradiation owing to the lower HOMO-LUMO gap and then migrate to LUMO to trigger the reduction reaction, while the photogenerated holes participate in the oxidation reaction.Second, TEOA as a sacrificial agent in this photocatalytic system will be oxidized, providing electrons to the photocatalytic system in the meantime.Third, high specific surface area and superior CO 2 uptake ability provide efficient active sites.Ti IV in the NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) captures the electron and converts to Ti III , and the Ti III sites possess strong reducibility to realize the conversion of CO 2 to the CO and CH 4 products.The NM 111 photocatalyst effectively suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.Thus, a lot of electrons and holes participate in the photocatalytic reaction and further promote the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction."

    "content": "In summary, we accurately designed and successfully synthesized a series of NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) with varied ratios of 111 facets by one-step solvothermal method, achieving the exact control of active exposed facets and comprehensively evaluating the ability of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction of the assynthesized photocatalysts.We also realized the optimization of CO 2 photoreduction activity with 100 exposure of 111 facets.The enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 activity was attributed to the exposure of 111 facets, which not only enlarge the specific surface area and CO 2 adsorption, prolong the PL lifetime, and increase the Ti atomic concentrations but also rapidly spatial separate and effectively suppress the recombination of electrons and holes.The transition between Ti IV and Ti III has been considered in the photoreaction, which facilitated the photoreduction process and enhanced photocatalytic activity.The NM 111 sample could be readily achieved by solvothermal reaction, and further efforts are needed to enhance the activity by incorporating composite species and/ or optimize the CO 2 reduction product such as CH 4 .This work demonstrates the intriguing investigation of the facet effect of NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti), which paves new ways for designing efficient MOF catalysts for photocatalytic performance by regulating the exposed active facets.The challenges in exploring the facet effect in MOFs still remain, and more efforts may be required in the future.
