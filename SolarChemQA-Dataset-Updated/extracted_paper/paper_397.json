    "content": "Using a high-purity gas phase photoreactor and highly sensitive trace gas analysis, new insights into the mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on TiO 2 P25 have been obtained.The reactor design and sample pretreatment excludes product formation from intermediates.Apart from CO 2 , the only other reactant offered to the catalyst is water.The main products found on this prominent photocatalyst are methane and carbon monoxide.To distinguish between the three possible mechanisms reported in previous studies, likely intermediates of the reaction were added to the TiO 2 photocatalyst and their reactivity was followed by gas chromatographic analysis.Based on the results, we can clearly rule out CO as intermediate of any photocatalytic reaction pathway on TiO 2 , because CO was not converted at all within a course of six hours.An improvement of carbonate formation on TiO 2 brought about by surface-doping with sodium decreased product yields, so carbonates are unlikely intermediates as well.Methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid were exclusively oxidized back to CO 2 .We thus support a mechanism running over C 2 -Intermediates, and we tested our hypothesis by reacting glyoxal, glyoxylic acid, acetic acid and acetaldehyde on TiO 2 .The reactions of acetaldehyde and acetic acid led to product distributions very similar to those obtained from CO 2 under the standard reaction conditions, strongly supporting the C 2 mechanism.This mechanism can also explain the small amounts of ethane usually found in the product mixture."

    "content": "For most of the measurements reported in this contribution, pure P25 TiO 2 (Evonik Industries) was used.The TiO 2 was recalcined at 400 C for 4 h for a first rough cleaning.To enhance carbonate formation, some P25 samples were doped on the surface with sodium using an impregnation procedure.A previous study on the influence of Na on the surface character of a metal oxide and the resulting activity in CO 2 reduction resulted in an optimum loading with of 3 Na atoms/nm 2 35 Expressed in terms of wt, that loading would be represented by 0.63 wt Na on a P25 support, taking into account the specific surface area of P25 of 55 m 2 /g.Two samples with this loading were prepared with two different Na precursors, one with NaOH (denoted as NaP25NaOH) and one with NaNO 3 (denoted as NaP25NaNO 3 ).One sample was prepared with NaOH as precursor, targeting a 50 times higher dilution of sodium on the surface, that is, with Na loading of 0.013 wt (denoted as NaP25NaOH50).The desired amount of the solid precursors was dissolved in a low volume of H 2 O (about 2 ml), ultra-sonicated for 10 min and then mixed with 500 mg of P25. Next, the H 2 O was removed in a rotary evaporator and the samples were calcined at 400 C for 3 h in flowing 20 O 2 in He. The photoreactor used for all experiments has been described previously by Mei et al. in Ref. 3 .In brief, the reactor is constructed entirely of parts suitable for high-vacuum systems and sealed only with grease-free sealing materials.All tube connections at the valves are connected with VCR connections, that is, with metal ring seals.The set-up further consists of a gas supply with mass flow controllers to insert CO 2 and Helium into the stainless steel reactor, a stainless-steel saturator for water enrichment of the gas-phase, pumps and a gas chromatograph (GC) for reaction products analysis.The sampling section of the GC is directly installed in the exhaust line.Irradiation is realized with the full UV and visible spectrum a 200 W Hg/Xe lamp.Only the IR part of the radiation is removed by passing it through a water-based filter.Using a photodiode, the irradiation intensity was determined to be approximately 200 mW cm -2 .The photocatalyst powder is spread as evenly as possible in a single layer into a small glass petri dish that sits on a metal mesh on the bottom of the reactor.The irradiated area, and the area of the petri dish, which are both about equal to the inner area of the round reactor, is roughly 20 cm 2 (5 cm diameter).Since the inner volume of the reactor is a little more than one centimeter in height the inner volume can be estimated as 25 cm 3 . In the work reported here, a new GC application was used.The new gas chromatograph For a typical CO 2 reduction experiment 50 mg of sample were introduced into the reactor. This sample was cleaned inside the same reactor before the measurement.In between the photocatalytic cleaning and the actual reaction, the sample was only exposed to inert purge gas (He, 99.9999). A cleaning procedure in the batch mode is identical to the reaction run, with the exception that no CO 2 is added to the gas phase. 3A more efficient cleaning procedure can be achieved by a cleaning in the flow mode.In this cleaning mode, water-enriched He flows through the reactor during the whole time of irradiation.During the cleaning in flow mode, it is not possible to conduct gas chromatographic analysis.To enable gas chromatographic analysis of the cleaning progress, it is required to perform a subsequent batch cleaning. Alternatively, to monitor the progress of the cleaning in flow mode the following procedure can be used: The reactor outlet is closed, and when the pressure inside the reactor reaches 1500 mbar the inlet is closed as well.Subsequently, all contaminants desorbing within 1 h are collected in the reactor volume to be sampled by the GC.When the chromatogram cannot detect any molecules apart from H 2 O, the cleaning is considered completed. The typical product distribution in four subsequent cleaning steps is displayed in Figure SI 1A-D for sample NaP25NaNO 3 as an example, to illustrate the quite significant amount of impurities liberated in this way.Those four batch cleaning steps were followed by a cleaning in flow mode to remove all residual hydrocarbons.The chromatogram detected after the cleaning in flow mode can be found in the supporting information (Fig. SI 1E). The reactor was flushed with the reactant gas mixture for 1 hour before closing the outlet to establish the desired pressure of 1500 mbar.The gas mixture used for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction (termed as \"standard conditions\") is composed of 1.5 CO 2 and 6000 ppm water in accordance with previous works. 3A 200 W Hg/Xe lamp was used for irradiation in all experiments.GC sampling was performed every 45 min.A potential reactivity of CO under the given conditions was checked by substituting the 1.5 CO 2 in the reaction mixture by 100 ppm CO.All other conditions were kept similar. For the reaction of other intermediates on TiO 2 , the samples were treated with dilute aqueous solutions of methanol, formaldehyde, formic acid, glyoxal, glyoxylic acid, acetaldehyde, or acetic acid, respectively.The solution of the species of interest was dropped onto the TiO 2 using a pipette.The sample was then dried in air until a liquid phase could not be distinguished anymore and subsequently introduced into the reactor.Water in the gas phase was not added in this case, however, due to the treatment in dilute aqueous solutions the presence of adsorbed multilayers of water on the photocatalyst is expected.Irradiation and sampling conditions were the same as in the CO 2 reduction experiments. In situ infrared spectroscopy was performed in a Harrick HVC-DRP-2 measurement cell with praying mantis mirror construction using a Nicolet Protege 460 spectrometer.In order to remove adsorbed contaminants such as H 2 O from the catalyst surface a heat treatment was performed, in which the sample was heated with a heating ramp of 10 C/min to 400 C in a mixture of 20 O 2 in He.The temperature of 400 C was kept for 30 min and a single spectrum with 500 scans was recorded.The sample was then cooled back to 35 C and again a single spectrum was recorded with 500 scans.This spectrum was later used for subtraction spectra, because it reflects the sample at its purest state in terms of potential contaminants.For the CO 2 adsorption measurement the measurement cell was purged with a mixture of 30 CO 2 in He with a total flow of 20 ml/min for 10 min at 35 C.After 10 min the CO 2 was purged out of the gas atmosphere by switching to pure He with a flow of 20 ml/min.Purging was performed for 20 min.Again, a single spectrum at the end of the CO 2 adsorption was recorded.A heating ramp with 5 C/min to 400 C was then applied to desorb the remaining adsorbates.After the temperature had been held for 30 min, a single spectrum was recorded.Finally the sample was cooled down and a last single spectrum was recorded. During all adsorption, purging, and heating procedures series of spectra consisting of one spectrum per minute were recorded with 100 scans. The standard conditions comprise 1.5 CO 2 and 6000 ppm water in the gas phase and an illumination with a 200 W Hg/Xe lamp.Under these conditions, the main carbon-containing products are methane and CO.At the same time, hydrogen is formed, which might be explained by the product distribution found in the decomposition of C 2 intermdiates (see below).The time course of product evolution as determined by gas chromatography is displayed in Figure 1A.The Na-modified samples were tested in their activity to produce CH 4 as well and revealed to be less active than pure P25 (see Figure 1B).In general, no clear trend was observed comparing the Na-loading or the used precursor.In contrast, the activity towards H 2 production was improved by Na-loading (see Figure SI2).It has to be noted that oxygen was not detected in significant amounts in any measurement. It is of course undoubted that the stoichiometry of the photocatalytic reaction going from CO We thus admit that we cannot close the catalytic cycle yet, but due to the highpurity conditions, we can provide solid evidence that the products must be formed from CO 2 . Figure 1 clearly shows CH 4 and CO as main carbon-containing products under standard conditions, but their relation to each other in the reaction network cannot be determined from this measurement.A formation and involvement of CO in the reaction network might occur on three possible ways: Firstly, CO could be formed from CO 2 and it could then be an intermediate on the way to methane.Secondly, CO could be formed from methane independently.In both cases, one way of CO formation might be a reaction of CO 2 with an oxygen vacancy, or alternatively a reaction with photocatalytically produced hydrogen by the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS, Equation 1).Thirdly, CO could be formed from methane, for example by means of photocatalytic steam reforming or dry reforming, according to Equation 2 or 3. Steam Reforming: Dry Reforming: The decomposition experiments that are presented in this study propose an independent way to form CO, as a product of the decomposition of potential intermediate molecules.CO then does not take part as a reactant in any further reaction.This will be shown below. In order to test whether CO will react under the given conditions, the 1.5 CO 2 in the reaction mixture were exchanged with 100 ppm CO, while keeping all other conditions similar.As can clearly be seen in Figure 2A, the concentration of CO remains unchanged over a time course of six hours.As displayed in Figure 2B, more hydrogen is formed in this reaction run, possibly indicating that hydrogen evolution and CO 2 reduction compete for the same active sites and/or that hydrogen formed from gas-phase photocatalytic H 2 O splitting is consumed for methane formation, as will be discussed in detail below.P25 was modified with Na with two different precursors, adjusting a loading of 0.63 wt and 0.013 wt.To characterize the adsorption modes the samples were exposed to a CO 2 /He-mixture during in situ DRIFTS measurements after a heat pretreatment of the sample in the measurement cell.During the first 10 min of the experiment the samples are in CO 2 atmosphere; after that the measurement cell is purged with pure He for 20 min.So, the spectra recorded at 5 min show the bands that are caused by an interaction of the sample with CO 2 while it is still in the gas phase.However, spectra recorded at minute 30 show bands resulting from the stable interaction with CO 2 in the absence of CO 2 in the gas phase. A full assignment of the bands and a Figure showing broad-range overview spectra of the adsorption for all four Na-containing samples can be found in the Supporting Information (Table SI 1 and Figure SI 3A).At 2353 cm -1 the characteristic band for the vibration of CO 2 that is linearly adsorbed to TiO 2 can be found. 29,38,39This band is overproportionally intense for NaP25NaOH50 (Figure SI 3A). Among the bands that are most drastically depleted for P25 (Figure 3A) after the purge out of CO 2 are the bands assignable to carboxylate species at 1235 and 1675 cm -1 . 4041243 Concluding from the close resemblance of the spectrum for P25 with the experimental and theoretical study by Mino et al. 39 on TiO 2 anatase (001) and (101) surface, these facets are likely involved in the adsorption processes giving rise to the spectra shown in Figure 3A.In general it can be said that the stability of carbonaceous species on Na-P25 samples is higher than that for pure P25.All samples predominantly allow for the adsorption of monodentate carbonates, reflected by the asymmetric stretching vibration at around 1585-1579 cm -1 . 39401 For the symmetric stretching vibration the additional band at 1434 cm -1 40 and 1377 cm -1 39404142 (Figure 3A) helps to characterize the adsorption as a monodentate carbonate.Pure P25, NaP25NaOH50, and NaP25NaNO 3 further show bands indicative of bicarbonates.The OH vibration can found around 1200-1225 cm -1 33,45,46 and the COO vibration around 1675 cm -1 40,42 .In the Na-modified P25 samples also new bands can be identified that were not seen in the pure P25 sample.The most curious feature is the intense peak at 1693-1695 cm -1 (see Figure 3C andD) These can be identified as carbonyl groups and are not part of the same species as the bands at 1647-1650 cm -1 and 1565-1562 cm -1 .When CO 2 is purged out of the gas phase the intensity of these bands (carbonyl and others) is changing, but not in a parallel way for all bands.The temperature programmed desorption experiment of the adsorbed species in the DRIFTS cell point out clearly that the band around 1565-1562 cm -1 is not part of the same feature as the other bands (see Figure SI 3B).In general, it can be stated that the spectra of CO 2 adsorption on two Na-modified samples synthesized with different precursors NaOH and NaNO 3 (Figure 3C andD) do not differ significantly. The potential participation of formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol in the mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction has been tested in this work.If these species are truly relevant for the product formation under the studied reaction conditions, it should be observed that significant quantities of CH 4 are formed during the irradiation with UV light in their presence. From SI 4A-C it can be seen, however, that under the applied conditions almost no CH 4 was formed from formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol.These molecules decompose in the presence of a photocatalyst and the irradiation of UV light to CO 2 , CO and H 2 .The ratios of the decomposition products are different depending on the decomposing molecule.It can be recognized that formaldehyde decomposition (Figure SI 4B) leads to much higher ratios in CO than the decomposition of formic acid (Figure SI 4A). C 2 intermediates are more easily reduced than C 1 intermediates, due to a lower reaction barrier for further reduction reaction of the former.It thus appears reasonable that the pathways of CO 2 reduction could involve C 2 intermediates, as assumed by the Zapol group. 47One of the properties that suggest glyoxal as a feasible intermediate is its significant gas-phase adiabatic electron affinity in comparison to formaldehyde and methanol. 47The potential participation of various C 2 intermediates in the product formation of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was thus tested in this work.For this purpose, oxalic acid, It can be seen that almost no CH 4 has been formed in the experiments with oxalic acid, glyoxylic acid and glyoxal (Figure SI4).These species decompose under the applied reaction Various types of carbonates have been detected on the P25 and Na-modified P25 samples upon exposure to CO 2 .Since spectra were recorded in diffuse reflectance, it is not possible to quantify the different species, but it becomes very clear that the nature of the adsorbed species differs with sodium doping and the amount of sodium present on the surface.The pure P25 sample formed carboxylates (see Figure 3A) in the presence of gas-phase CO 2 and after the purging mainly bidentate carbonate species were found.The ability to form carboxylates, which were found predominantly on P25 in this work, is often connected to the ability of the catalyst to perform the initial electron transfer to form CO 2 -.This is because carboxylates are structurally similar to CO 2 -. 36ncluding from the IR spectra the sample NaP25NaOH50 with the small Na loading of 0.013 wt showed the smallest affinity to create carbonates, but the highest to allow a linear adsorption of CO 2 (Figure 3B and Figure SI 3A).This could be connected to the fact that the Na species are probably more isolated and influence the surface of TiO 2 in a more punctual manner.The presence of Na on the surface of TiO 2 injects electron density into the oxide, since Na is highly Lewis basic.This causes the TiO 2 surface to be more nucleophilic and interact more strongly with CO 2 , especially with the positively charged C-atom in CO 2 .In a similar study with Al 2 O 3 the presence of Na was found to increase the nucleophilicity for Al-O-. 33e most striking difference in terms of forming certain kinds of adsorbed CO 2 is that P25 is the only sample able to form carboxylates.However, the carboxylates were not stable against the purging with inert gas (Figure 3A).After the purging mainly bidentate carbonate species were found.On the Na-modified samples with 0.63 wt Na (Figure 3C andD) bicarbonates were dominating the spectrum.The sample with the low Na-loading showed mono-, and bidentate carbonates (Figure 3B) which were fairly stable; at the same time that sample exhibited a high affinity to adsorb CO 2 in a linear fashion (Figure SI 3A). For the photocatalytic reduction of CO h HCO 3 - CO 3 - H 19 (4) This would lead to an accumulation of electrons in the catalyst bulk, which would ultimately hinder the electron flow to adsorbing molecules.Another possibility explaining the loss of activity through boosting the adsorption capacities towards CO 2 would be that carbonates are simply not participating in the formation of products and instead block active sites. The decomposition experiments showed that formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol decompose to CO 2 , CO and H 2 under the applied reaction conditions (Figure SI 4A-C).This observation reveals that these species preferably oxidize by hole-consuming reactions.The reason for this circumstance is most likely the lack of electron affinity. 9The ability of these molecules to consume electrons is rather low.Consequently, it appears implausible that formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol participate in the formation of CH 4 in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under the studied conditions. In the event that C 2 intermediates are participating in the photocatalytic CO Glyoxylic acid formation: Glyoxal formation: The decomposition experiments of oxalic acid, glyoxylic acid and glyoxal clearly show that CH 4 formation is a highly unlikely process in the photocatalytic reaction of these species under the applied conditions (Figure 4D-F).These molecules tend to be photocatalytically decomposed to CO 2 and CO in hole-consuming reactions (eq.8-10).Moreover, this observation points out that an electron-consuming reaction is rather unlikely, although these species should have electron affinity.A possible reason for this could be an insufficient reducing potential of the photoexcited electrons of TiO This decomposition of acetic acid has been reported to work reliably and was denoted as the new Kolbe reaction. 49.In summary, the product distribution obtained when adding acetic acid and acetaldehyde to the photocatalyst is very similar to that in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, strongly suggesting those species as potential intermediates. It still remains unanswered, though, how the process from CO 2 to acetic acid or acetaldehyde might take place, in particular with respect to the specific C 1 species or fragments on the surface that perform the C-C bond formation.The issue is further complicated considering that only C 2 -species at specific sites on the surface might be further reduced, while others simply decompose again.In principle, any CH x O y moiety formed from CO 2 might be involved in C-C coupling reactions.In this respect, it needs to be noted that in related studies of our group of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on isolated titanate species on silica, the presence of a \"carbon-pool\" on the surface of the photocatalyst after the reaction run was indicated, containing, for example, paraformaldehyde species 3 .Carbon accumulation might also take place on P25, and this issue is a focus of further studies. Yet, the results obtained so far already seem to imply that one additional mechanism might need to be considered and tested, in which the presence of small amounts of residual methyl radicals (or, in a more general sense: hydrocarbon radicals) on the sample is explicitly considered.Even with the best cleaning procedure, we will never be able to remove absolutely all of them.Those methyl radicals might then act in an autocatalytic manner: If a CH 3 radical attaches to any form of (adsorbed) CO 2 (radical) under the given reaction conditions, the unfavorable challenge of a reaction of the very stable CO 2 molecule might be circumvented.Instead, one would only face the challenge of a photocatalytic reduction of the resulting acetic acid, for example to acetaldehyde.The latter might then be reduced further to ethane, or two methyl radicals, or it might break apart to form methane, and either a formyl radical or CO.In this respect, it also needs to be noted that in our previous studies on titanate species on silica, the formation of larger amounts of methane in a second reaction run was reproducibly observed.In other words, when a certain carbon pool had already been established on the photocatalyst surface, yields of methane were considerably increased. Although we acknowledge that the working principle of both photocatalysts is certainly very different, since TiO 2 is a semiconductor and the titanate species is an isolated photoactive species, we consider this hypothesis a relevant guideline for our further research.In that sense, further studies are in progress aiming at unraveling a potential influence of adventitious hydrocarbon moieties in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. In summary, this study showed that C 1 molecules such as CO, formic acid, formaldehyde, and methanol presumably do not participate in the photocatalytic formation of CH 4 from CO 2 on TiO 2 .CO, in particular, did not react at all on the surface of TiO 2 .The improvement of carbonate formation on TiO 2 by the addition of sodium decreased the yields of methane in the photocatalytic process, which makes carbonates appear as unlikely intermediates, too.It is still possible that the product formation of CO 2 reduction includes C 1 intermediates, but those should be of a different chemical nature.Furthermore, oxalic acid, glyoxylic acid and glyoxal as previously proposed C 2 molecules also appear less relevant for the formation of TRACERA, Shimadzu) is equipped with a barrier discharge ionization detector (BID) that is in principle able to detect any gaseous component except for helium and neon.The column setup consists of a Poraplot Q and Molecular Sieve column in series.To allow a facile separation of the molecules whilst allowing the hydrocarbons to elute, a temperature program during the measurement is applied including a heating phase to 150 C and a subsequent cooling to room temperature.To load the sample loop a pressure balancing mechanism is used that prevents the opening of the set-up to ambient atmosphere at any time.For that the sample loop is evacuated constantly to 510 -2 mbar (except during loading of the sample loop), which lowers the risk of contamination even further.It is thus possible to detect H 2 O, CO 2 , CO, O 2 , N 2 , H 2 , and C 1 to C 5 hydrocarbons starting from concentrations of about 1 ppm.

Figure 4) were exposed to photocatalytic reaction conditions and the results are compared to the product distribution of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over TiO 2 (Figure 1A). photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. on 04 March 2016.Downloaded by Mahidol University on 10/03/2016 09:45:14.to only CO 2 , CO, and H 2 .The time profile of the decomposition of acetaldehyde and acetic acid, on the other hand, resembles the product profile of a CO 2 reduction experiment.The main products of the decomposition of acetic acid and acetaldehyde are CH 4 , CO 2 , CO and H 2 .It was also possible to detect C 2 H 6 as a product. conditions provides 8 electrons.It is still unclear what kind of reactive intermediates are formed during the formation of CH 4 from CO 2 .In the following we discuss the reactivity of suspected intermediate molecules under reaction conditions in a typical CO 2 reduction test experiment without the use of the reactant CO 2 , and with H 2 O only adsorbed on the Carbon monoxide clearly showed no reactivity at all on P25 under the investigated reaction conditions.Thus, under these conditions, it cannot be an intermediate of any photocatalytic reaction pathway.The formation of CO and CH 4 is thus either 1) unrelated to each other, 2)indirectly linked to each other by the decomposition of a particular intermediate, or 3) switched in their order, in the sense that CO is a consecutive product from methane, for example from photoreforming reactions.In any case, CO is clearly not an intermediate in a consecutive reaction to CH 4 .It was possible to increase the affinity towards carbonate formation on P25 by the addition of Na.However, none of the Na-modified samples was equally as good as or better than pure P25 in the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 .Various possible reasons might account for the lack of activity improvement in presence of carbonates.It was already suggested that carbonates, especially bicarbonates, can act as hole scavengers: 2it is required that the carbon atom loses the two C-O double bonds and that four C-H bonds are formed to become CH 4 .This process requires that the photocatalyst 2 reduction, it is required that a C-C coupling reaction of two reactive C 1 intermediates takes place.It is a matter of debate, if the C-C coupling step is one of the early steps or if it is one of the late steps in the product formation mechanism.The following Equations 5-7 propose different C 1 intermediates as potential candidates for a C-C coupling reaction leading to the formation of oxalic acid, glyoxylic acid and glyoxal.These reaction equations represent C-C coupling reaction in the early stage of the product formation, because the participating molecules are close to CO 2 and exhibit still C-O double bonds and less C-H bonds. 2. Summing up, it appears unrealistic that oxalic acid, glyoxylic acid and glyoxal are intermediates in the photocatalytic formation of CH 4 .However, glyoxal and glyoxylic acid could be an intermediate in the formation of CO, in case that these molecules are formed during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Furthermore, the results of the experiments yield further information about the decomposition mechanism of different functional groups of the investigated molecules.It was observed that carboxyl and aldehyde groups decompose predominantly to CO 2 and CO, respectively.In addition, the formation of CO seems to be coupled to the formation of H 2 .The molecular structure of acetic acid and acetaldehyde contains a methyl group.The methyl group is chemically close to CH 4 .Thus, acetic acid and acetaldehyde represent possible C 2 intermediates of the late product formation mechanism.The decomposition of acetic acid and acetaldehyde leads to the formation of CH 4 .The methyl group of these molecules participates in the formation of CH 4 according to eq. 11 and 12.For reaction 13, hydrogen radicals are required to form CH 4 from methyl radicals.Furthermore, the formation of ethane is possible via the recombination of two methyl radicals (eq.14).According to eq. 12 it is also possible to form CO from acetaldehyde.

It is of course undoubted that the stoichiometry of the photocatalytic reaction going from CO We thus admit that we cannot close the catalytic cycle yet, but due to the highpurity conditions, we can provide solid evidence that the products must be formed from CO 2 . Figure 1 clearly shows CH 4 and CO as main carbon-containing products under standard conditions, but their relation to each other in the reaction network cannot be determined from this measurement.A formation and involvement of CO in the reaction network might occur on three possible ways: Firstly, CO could be formed from CO 2 and it could then be an intermediate on the way to methane.Secondly, CO could be formed from methane independently.In both cases, one way of CO formation might be a reaction of CO 2 with an oxygen vacancy, or alternatively a reaction with photocatalytically produced hydrogen by the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS, Equation 1).Thirdly, CO could be formed from methane, for example by means of photocatalytic steam reforming or dry reforming, according to Equation 2 or 3. Steam Reforming: Dry Reforming: The decomposition experiments that are presented in this study propose an independent way to form CO, as a product of the decomposition of potential intermediate molecules.CO then does not take part as a reactant in any further reaction.This will be shown below. In order to test whether CO will react under the given conditions, the 1.5 CO 2 in the reaction mixture were exchanged with 100 ppm CO, while keeping all other conditions similar.As can clearly be seen in Figure 2A, the concentration of CO remains unchanged over a time course of six hours.As displayed in Figure 2B, more hydrogen is formed in this reaction run, possibly indicating that hydrogen evolution and CO 2 reduction compete for the same active sites and/or that hydrogen formed from gas-phase photocatalytic H 2 O splitting is consumed for methane formation, as will be discussed in detail below.P25 was modified with Na with two different precursors, adjusting a loading of 0.63 wt and 0.013 wt.To characterize the adsorption modes the samples were exposed to a CO 2 /He-mixture during in situ DRIFTS measurements after a heat pretreatment of the sample in the measurement cell.During the first 10 min of the experiment the samples are in CO 2 atmosphere; after that the measurement cell is purged with pure He for 20 min.So, the spectra recorded at 5 min show the bands that are caused by an interaction of the sample with CO 2 while it is still in the gas phase.However, spectra recorded at minute 30 show bands resulting from the stable interaction with CO 2 in the absence of CO 2 in the gas phase. A full assignment of the bands and a Figure showing broad-range overview spectra of the adsorption for all four Na-containing samples can be found in the Supporting Information (Table SI 1 and Figure SI 3A).At 2353 cm -1 the characteristic band for the vibration of CO 2 that is linearly adsorbed to TiO 2 can be found. 29,38,39This band is overproportionally intense for NaP25NaOH50 (Figure SI 3A). Among the bands that are most drastically depleted for P25 (Figure 3A) after the purge out of CO 2 are the bands assignable to carboxylate species at 1235 and 1675 cm -1 . 4041243 Concluding from the close resemblance of the spectrum for P25 with the experimental and theoretical study by Mino et al. 39 on TiO 2 anatase (001) and (101) surface, these facets are likely involved in the adsorption processes giving rise to the spectra shown in Figure 3A.In general it can be said that the stability of carbonaceous species on Na-P25 samples is higher than that for pure P25.All samples predominantly allow for the adsorption of monodentate carbonates, reflected by the asymmetric stretching vibration at around 1585-1579 cm -1 . 39401 For the symmetric stretching vibration the additional band at 1434 cm -1 40 and 1377 cm -1 39404142 (Figure 3A) helps to characterize the adsorption as a monodentate carbonate.Pure P25, NaP25NaOH50, and NaP25NaNO 3 further show bands indicative of bicarbonates.The OH vibration can found around 1200-1225 cm -1 33,45,46 and the COO vibration around 1675 cm -1 40,42 .In the Na-modified P25 samples also new bands can be identified that were not seen in the pure P25 sample.The most curious feature is the intense peak at 1693-1695 cm -1 (see Figure 3C andD) These can be identified as carbonyl groups and are not part of the same species as the bands at 1647-1650 cm -1 and 1565-1562 cm -1 .When CO 2 is purged out of the gas phase the intensity of these bands (carbonyl and others) is changing, but not in a parallel way for all bands.The temperature programmed desorption experiment of the adsorbed species in the DRIFTS cell point out clearly that the band around 1565-1562 cm -1 is not part of the same feature as the other bands (see Figure SI 3B).In general, it can be stated that the spectra of CO 2 adsorption on two Na-modified samples synthesized with different precursors NaOH and NaNO 3 (Figure 3C andD) do not differ significantly. The potential participation of formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol in the mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction has been tested in this work.If these species are truly relevant for the product formation under the studied reaction conditions, it should be observed that significant quantities of CH 4 are formed during the irradiation with UV light in their presence. From SI 4A-C it can be seen, however, that under the applied conditions almost no CH 4 was formed from formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol.These molecules decompose in the presence of a photocatalyst and the irradiation of UV light to CO 2 , CO and H 2 .The ratios of the decomposition products are different depending on the decomposing molecule.It can be recognized that formaldehyde decomposition (Figure SI 4B) leads to much higher ratios in CO than the decomposition of formic acid (Figure SI 4A). C 2 intermediates are more easily reduced than C 1 intermediates, due to a lower reaction barrier for further reduction reaction of the former.It thus appears reasonable that the pathways of CO 2 reduction could involve C 2 intermediates, as assumed by the Zapol group. 47One of the properties that suggest glyoxal as a feasible intermediate is its significant gas-phase adiabatic electron affinity in comparison to formaldehyde and methanol. 47The potential participation of various C 2 intermediates in the product formation of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was thus tested in this work.For this purpose, oxalic acid, It can be seen that almost no CH 4 has been formed in the experiments with oxalic acid, glyoxylic acid and glyoxal (Figure SI4).These species decompose under the applied reaction Various types of carbonates have been detected on the P25 and Na-modified P25 samples upon exposure to CO 2 .Since spectra were recorded in diffuse reflectance, it is not possible to quantify the different species, but it becomes very clear that the nature of the adsorbed species differs with sodium doping and the amount of sodium present on the surface.The pure P25 sample formed carboxylates (see Figure 3A) in the presence of gas-phase CO 2 and after the purging mainly bidentate carbonate species were found.The ability to form carboxylates, which were found predominantly on P25 in this work, is often connected to the ability of the catalyst to perform the initial electron transfer to form CO 2 -.This is because carboxylates are structurally similar to CO 2 -. 36ncluding from the IR spectra the sample NaP25NaOH50 with the small Na loading of 0.013 wt showed the smallest affinity to create carbonates, but the highest to allow a linear adsorption of CO 2 (Figure 3B and Figure SI 3A).This could be connected to the fact that the Na species are probably more isolated and influence the surface of TiO 2 in a more punctual manner.The presence of Na on the surface of TiO 2 injects electron density into the oxide, since Na is highly Lewis basic.This causes the TiO 2 surface to be more nucleophilic and interact more strongly with CO 2 , especially with the positively charged C-atom in CO 2 .In a similar study with Al 2 O 3 the presence of Na was found to increase the nucleophilicity for Al-O-. 33e most striking difference in terms of forming certain kinds of adsorbed CO 2 is that P25 is the only sample able to form carboxylates.However, the carboxylates were not stable against the purging with inert gas (Figure 3A).After the purging mainly bidentate carbonate species were found.On the Na-modified samples with 0.63 wt Na (Figure 3C andD) bicarbonates were dominating the spectrum.The sample with the low Na-loading showed mono-, and bidentate carbonates (Figure 3B) which were fairly stable; at the same time that sample exhibited a high affinity to adsorb CO 2 in a linear fashion (Figure SI 3A). For the photocatalytic reduction of CO h HCO 3 - CO 3 - H 19 (4) This would lead to an accumulation of electrons in the catalyst bulk, which would ultimately hinder the electron flow to adsorbing molecules.Another possibility explaining the loss of activity through boosting the adsorption capacities towards CO 2 would be that carbonates are simply not participating in the formation of products and instead block active sites. The decomposition experiments showed that formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol decompose to CO 2 , CO and H 2 under the applied reaction conditions (Figure SI 4A-C).This observation reveals that these species preferably oxidize by hole-consuming reactions.The reason for this circumstance is most likely the lack of electron affinity. 9The ability of these molecules to consume electrons is rather low.Consequently, it appears implausible that formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol participate in the formation of CH 4 in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under the studied conditions. In the event that C 2 intermediates are participating in the photocatalytic CO Glyoxylic acid formation: Glyoxal formation: The decomposition experiments of oxalic acid, glyoxylic acid and glyoxal clearly show that CH 4 formation is a highly unlikely process in the photocatalytic reaction of these species under the applied conditions (Figure 4D-F).These molecules tend to be photocatalytically decomposed to CO 2 and CO in hole-consuming reactions (eq.8-10).Moreover, this observation points out that an electron-consuming reaction is rather unlikely, although these species should have electron affinity.A possible reason for this could be an insufficient reducing potential of the photoexcited electrons of TiO This decomposition of acetic acid has been reported to work reliably and was denoted as the new Kolbe reaction. 49.In summary, the product distribution obtained when adding acetic acid and acetaldehyde to the photocatalyst is very similar to that in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, strongly suggesting those species as potential intermediates. It still remains unanswered, though, how the process from CO 2 to acetic acid or acetaldehyde might take place, in particular with respect to the specific C 1 species or fragments on the surface that perform the C-C bond formation.The issue is further complicated considering that only C 2 -species at specific sites on the surface might be further reduced, while others simply decompose again.In principle, any CH x O y moiety formed from CO 2 might be involved in C-C coupling reactions.In this respect, it needs to be noted that in related studies of our group of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on isolated titanate species on silica, the presence of a \"carbon-pool\" on the surface of the photocatalyst after the reaction run was indicated, containing, for example, paraformaldehyde species 3 .Carbon accumulation might also take place on P25, and this issue is a focus of further studies. Yet, the results obtained so far already seem to imply that one additional mechanism might need to be considered and tested, in which the presence of small amounts of residual methyl radicals (or, in a more general sense: hydrocarbon radicals) on the sample is explicitly considered.Even with the best cleaning procedure, we will never be able to remove absolutely all of them.Those methyl radicals might then act in an autocatalytic manner: If a CH 3 radical attaches to any form of (adsorbed) CO 2 (radical) under the given reaction conditions, the unfavorable challenge of a reaction of the very stable CO 2 molecule might be circumvented.Instead, one would only face the challenge of a photocatalytic reduction of the resulting acetic acid, for example to acetaldehyde.The latter might then be reduced further to ethane, or two methyl radicals, or it might break apart to form methane, and either a formyl radical or CO.In this respect, it also needs to be noted that in our previous studies on titanate species on silica, the formation of larger amounts of methane in a second reaction run was reproducibly observed.In other words, when a certain carbon pool had already been established on the photocatalyst surface, yields of methane were considerably increased. Although we acknowledge that the working principle of both photocatalysts is certainly very different, since TiO 2 is a semiconductor and the titanate species is an isolated photoactive species, we consider this hypothesis a relevant guideline for our further research.In that sense, further studies are in progress aiming at unraveling a potential influence of adventitious hydrocarbon moieties in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction."

    "content": "In summary, this study showed that C 1 molecules such as CO, formic acid, formaldehyde, and methanol presumably do not participate in the photocatalytic formation of CH 4 from CO 2 on TiO 2 .CO, in particular, did not react at all on the surface of TiO 2 .The improvement of carbonate formation on TiO 2 by the addition of sodium decreased the yields of methane in the photocatalytic process, which makes carbonates appear as unlikely intermediates, too.It is still possible that the product formation of CO 2 reduction includes C 1 intermediates, but those should be of a different chemical nature.Furthermore, oxalic acid, glyoxylic acid and glyoxal as previously proposed C 2 molecules also appear less relevant for the formation of TRACERA, Shimadzu) is equipped with a barrier discharge ionization detector (BID) that is in principle able to detect any gaseous component except for helium and neon.The column setup consists of a Poraplot Q and Molecular Sieve column in series.To allow a facile separation of the molecules whilst allowing the hydrocarbons to elute, a temperature program during the measurement is applied including a heating phase to 150 C and a subsequent cooling to room temperature.To load the sample loop a pressure balancing mechanism is used that prevents the opening of the set-up to ambient atmosphere at any time.For that the sample loop is evacuated constantly to 510 -2 mbar (except during loading of the sample loop), which lowers the risk of contamination even further.It is thus possible to detect H 2 O, CO 2 , CO, O 2 , N 2 , H 2 , and C 1 to C 5 hydrocarbons starting from concentrations of about 1 ppm.

Summing up, it appears unrealistic that oxalic acid, glyoxylic acid and glyoxal are intermediates in the photocatalytic formation of CH 4 .However, glyoxal and glyoxylic acid could be an intermediate in the formation of CO, in case that these molecules are formed during the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Furthermore, the results of the experiments yield further information about the decomposition mechanism of different functional groups of the investigated molecules.It was observed that carboxyl and aldehyde groups decompose predominantly to CO 2 and CO, respectively.In addition, the formation of CO seems to be coupled to the formation of H 2 .The molecular structure of acetic acid and acetaldehyde contains a methyl group.The methyl group is chemically close to CH 4 .Thus, acetic acid and acetaldehyde represent possible C 2 intermediates of the late product formation mechanism.The decomposition of acetic acid and acetaldehyde leads to the formation of CH 4 .The methyl group of these molecules participates in the formation of CH 4 according to eq. 11 and 12.For reaction 13, hydrogen radicals are required to form CH 4 from methyl radicals.Furthermore, the formation of ethane is possible via the recombination of two methyl radicals (eq.14).According to eq. 12 it is also possible to form CO from acetaldehyde.
