    "content": "MgO exhibits activity for the reduction of CO 2 to CO under photoirradiation in the presence of H 2 or CH 4 as a reductant, although MgO is an insulating material.The present study clarified the mechanism of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the presence of H 2 or CH 4 over MgO.The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra show that a CO 2 molecule adsorbed on MgO was activated to a CO 2 -radical under photoirradiation.In addition, it was confirmed by photoluminescence that new acceptor level built up between the valence band and the conduction band of MgO on CO 2 -adsorbed MgO.The CO 2 -radical was reduced to a surface bidentate formate or a surface bidentate acetate by H 2 or CH 4 in the dark, respectively.The surface bidentate formate anchors on MgO as a photoactive species and reduces CO 2 in the gas phase to CO since the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction proceeded over MgO absorbing HCHO or CH 3 CHO and only 12 CO was formed in the presence of 12 CO 2 over MgO modified by a 13 C-labeled formate under irradiation.The active species was generated from the side-on adsorption-type bidentate carbonate selectively, although the two types of bidentate carbonates were detected by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.On the other hand, the role of the surface bidentate acetate is under discussion.It is the first report that the substrate-modified insulating material exhibits activity in the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction."

    "content": "Materials.The magnesium oxide supplied from the Merck was hydrated in distilled water for 2 h at 353 K and filtered with a pump.After that, the sample was kept at 383 K for 24 h in an oven, followed by calcinations in air at 873 K for 3 h.The sample was ground to a powder under 100 mesh after calcination.The specific surface area is evaluated to be 110 m 2 g -1 by the BET method using N 2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K. Estimation of Amount of Chemisorbed CO 2 .Amount of chemisorbed CO 2 on MgO was determined by the adsorption equilibrium method as follows.MgO (0.3 g) was evacuated at 673 K as a beforehand treatment.CO 2 was introduced to MgO and an adsorption isotherm was measured at room temperature.Subsequently, CO 2 was evacuated through a N 2 liquid trap for 30 min at room temperature.After that, CO 2 was introduced to MgO and the adsorption isotherm was measured again.We subtracted the second adsorbed amount from the first one at the same equilibrium pressure to account for the physisorbed CO 2 .The value obtained by the subtraction represents the amount of chemisorbed CO 2 . Reactions.Reactants were purified prior to use for reactions in the following manner.Hydrogen was purified by passing it through a liquefied nitrogen trap.Carbon dioxide, methane, and acetaldehyde were purified by vacuum distillation at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. 13C-Labeled carbon dioxide and methane were commercially supplied from Icon and used without further purification.Formaldehyde was obtained by heating paraformaldehyde in a vacuum.Acetaldehyde was purified by vacuum distillation with a liquefied nitrogen trap. The reaction was carried out in a closed static system connected to a vacuum line.A 0.3 g amount of magnesium oxide was spread on the flat bottom of a quartz reactor (dead space 18.9 mL).Prior to photocatalytic reduction, the catalyst sample was heated at 673 K in air and evacuated for 30 min at the same temperature, followed by treatment with 8 kPa of O 2 for 90 min and evacuation for 30 min at 673 K.The mixture of substrate (CO 2 , 150 mol) and reductant (H 2 or CH 4 , 50 mol) was admitted into the reactor.The catalyst sample was irradiated from the flat bottom of the reactor through a reflection by a cold mirror with a 500 W ultra-high-pressure mercury lamp USH-500D supplied by Ushio Co.The area subjected to illumination was 12.6 cm 2 .After each reaction, the gaseous products were analyzed, and after 5 min of evacuation at room temperature the sample was heated at 673 K for 30 min and the desorbed gases were also analyzed.The analysis of the products was performed with an on-line TCD gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with a column packed with molecular sieve 5A and with Ar as a carrier gas.When formaldehyde or acetaldehyde was used as a reaction substrate, 5 mol of the substrate was introduced onto 0.3 g of MgO with 150 mol of CO 2 or 50 mol of H 2 or CH 4 in the reactor. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy.Infrared spectra of a sample and adsorbed species were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Specrum One Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in a transmission mode at room temperature.A magnesium oxide sample (ca.50 mg) was pressed into a wafer (diameter ) 10 mm) at a pressure of 2.0 MPa and introduced in a conventional in situ IR cell equipped with NaCl windows.The cell allowed us to perform heating, O 2 treatment, introduction of substrates, photoirradiation, and measurements of spectra in situ.Before a measurement, the sample was evacuated at 673 K for 30 min, followed by treatment with 8 kPa of O 2 for 90 min and evacuation for 30 min at 673 K.A 250 W ultra-highpressure mercury lamp USH-250D supplied by Ushio Co. was used as a light source for photoirradiation of the wafer.For each spectrum, the data from 10 scans were accumulated at a resolution of 4 cm -1 . Photoluminescence.Photoluminescence spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Hitachi F-3010 fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a phosphoresence unit, which enables us to record 1 ms delayed spectra, and an in situ cell.Before a measurement, the sample was pretreated under the same conditions as for FT-IR spectroscopy measurements.The effect of CO 2 adsorption on the photoluminescence was investigated by recording the spectra under the equilibrium adsorption of CO 2 at room temperature. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded with an in situ quartz cell on an X-band EPR spectrometer (JEOL JES-SRE2X) with 100 k Hz field modulation.Before a measurement, the sample was pretreated under the same condition as that of the IR spectra.The g values and the amount of radical species were determined by use of a Mn marker and TEMPOL (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl), respectively.The effect of CO 2 adsorption onto MgO on the EPR spectra was investigated by recording the spectra after the equilibrium adsorption of CO 2 at room temperature followed by evacuation.Some spectra were recorded under illumination from a 500 W ultra-high-pressure mercury lamp USH-500D supplied by Ushio Co. Particular attention was paid to the removal of oxygen contamination to prevent the interference of the superoxide anion with the spectra.Prior to introduction into the cell, methane was passed through a Pt catalyst bed maintained at 473 K and then through a liquid nitrogen trap.CO 2 was purified by a freeze-pump-thaw process with a liquid nitrogen trap for several cycles."

    "content": "Reactions.The products were CO and H 2 in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with CH 4 .CO (3.6 mol) and H 2 (0.05 mol) were formed over MgO in the presence of CO 2 and CH 4 under photoirradiation for 5 h at room temperature.In a previous study, we reported the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of H 2 as a reductant. 29In this case, the CO evolution exhibited 2.9 mol after 6 h of photoirradiation.It was found that CH 4 as well as H 2 operates as a reductant for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over MgO.In addition, we have investigated the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over ZrO 2 . 25,28he CO evolution over MgO was 5 times higher than that over ZrO 2 .When the reaction was carried out in the dark, without a catalyst or without a reactant (H 2 or CH 4 ), no CO or H 2 was detected in the gas phase.Figure 1 shows the time dependence of the amount of CO evolution and CH 4 consumption over MgO under photoirradiation.The rate of the CO evolution decreased gradually and was stopping after 30 h of photoirradiation.The evolution of CO and H 2 was 13.5 and 0.68 mol after 30 h, respectively.The conversion of CO 2 was 9.0.CH 4 was consumed exponentially until 12 h and the rate of the CH 4 consumption was constant after that.The amount of consumed CH 4 was considerably larger than that of evolved CO.The CH 4 consumption was not compatible with the CO evolution stoichiometrically.This suggests that intermediates anchor on the surface of MgO during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .We have confirmed that CO 2 was adsorbed on MgO readily.The origin of the carbon atom contained in the products and the surface species was determined by use of carbon isotopes ( 13 C-labeled CO 2 or CH 4 ).The carbon atom of either CO 2 or CH 4 was labeled by 13 C and the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with CH 4 was carried out over MgO. 13 CO or 12 CO was formed in the gas phase in the case of the 13 CO 2 12 CH 4 reaction or the 12 CO 2 13 CH 4 reaction, respectively.Therefore, all CO generated in the gas phase is derived from CO 2 , and CH 4 does not merely reduce CO 2 to two CO molecules on the basis of the formula (eq 2).In the present reaction, the role of CH 4 is the reduction of CO 2 adsorbed on MgO because only 20 mol of CH 4 was consumed.It is speculated that CO 2 species reduced by CH 4 anchors as an intermediate on MgO. CO and H 2 were detected in the gas phase by heating the catalyst sample at 673 K for 30 min after the reaction.It is expected that the intermediate consists of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen.It has been determined that formate is generated as an intermediate for the CO 2 H 2 photocatalytic reaction over MgO or ZrO 2 , and the amount of CO collected by heating the catalyst is equal to that of the formate formed on the surface. 24,26,27On the other hand, it was reported that acetate is generated expect the formate for the CO 2 CH 4 photocatalytic reaction over ZrO 2 . 28Figure 2 shows the time course of CO evolution by the photocatalytic reaction and by the heat treatment after irradiation.The CO amount after the catalyst was heated was constant against the irradiation time after 5 h, although the CO amount after irradiation increased gradually.The behavior of CO evolution upon heating of the catalyst sample is similar to that of CH 4 consumption.This also indicates that the amount of the intermediates which can be formed on MgO is limited.Figure 3 shows the dependence of the amount of CO evolved by the photocatalytic reaction and by the heat treatment after photocatalytic reaction on the initial amount of introduced CO 2 .There was no CO evolution by the photocatalytic reaction until the amount of introduced CO 2 reached 20 mol.The CO evolution increased gradually and was constant after CO 2 reached 40 mol.On the other hand, CO evolution by the heat treatment after photocatalytic reaction was maximal when the amount of introduced CO 2 was 20 mol.As mentioned previously, more than 20 mol of CH 4 was not also consumed although light irradiation was elongated.Therefore, it is inferred that one CO 2 molecule was reduced by one CH 4 molecule to the intermediate species.The introduction of more than 40 mol of CO 2 did not have a marked influence on the amount of either mode of CO evolution. Estimation of Amount of Chemisorbed CO 2 .In previous study, we have confirmed that about 40 mol of CO 2 is chemisorbed on 0.3 g of MgO 133 molg-MgO -1 . 29 The amount of chemisorbed CO 2 was determined as follows.CO 2 was trapped with a liquid N 2 after 150 mol of CO 2 was introduced to MgO.The amount of trapped CO 2 was subtracted from that of introduced CO 2 which left the amount of chemisorbed CO 2 .The amount of chemisorbed CO 2 133 mol g-MgO -1 was compatible with the minimum amount of introduced CO 2 in the maximum CO evolution by the photocatalytic reaction.In the present study, we obtained the adsorption isotherms of CO 2 on MgO as shown in Figure 4a.After that, CO 2 was adsorbed on MgO again as shown in Figure 4b.The subtraction between panels a and b was 130 mol g-MgO -1 .Thus, the amount of CO 2 chemisorbed on 0.3 g of MgO corresponds to 39 mol.This value was almost compatible with that in previous study as mentioned above.Introduction of 66 molg-MgO -1 of CO 2 caused the most CO evolution by the heat treatment.In addition, the CO evolution by the photocatalytic reaction could be detected in the gas phase after the amount of introduced CO 2 reached 66 molg-MgO -1 .On the other hand, both CO evolutions by the photocatalytic reaction and by the heat treatment were constant after the amount of introduced CO 2 reached 133 molg-MgO -1 .It is interesting that there are two different thresholds in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over MgO.These results suggest that the species produced before the introduced CO 2 reached 66 mol g-MgO -1 is different from that produced after more than 66 molg-MgO -1 of CO 2 was introduced. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy.Figure 5 represents the IR spectra of MgO after pretreatment.A peak assigned to an OH stretching vibration band (OH) of a surface hydroxyl group is observed at 3760 cm -1 .In addition, five bands appeared at 1507, 1422, 978, 862 (shoulder), and 844 cm -1 .Raman 30,31 described the 985 and 845 cm -1 bands as overtones of fundamental frequencies at 490 and 425 cm -1 , respectively.Hanna 32 and Evans and Ehateley 33 agreed with these identifications.Accordingly, the bands at 978, 862, and 844 cm -1 in the present study are derived from an overtone of a fundamental lattice vibration (Mg-O stretching).It is known that the bands at 1400-1500 cm -1 are a C-O stretching vibration band -(C-O) of carbonate ions. 33,34Davydov et al. 35 reported that the bands at 1415 and 845 cm -1 are assigned to an asymmetric C-O stretching vibration band as (C-O) and a deformation vibration band (CO 3 2-) of carbonate ion on MgO.The bands at 1507, 1422, and 844 cm -1 were assigned to carbonate ions.This carbonate ion would be derived from MgCO 3 . 33Considering this, the band at 844 cm -1 would be formed by overlapping the overtone of a fundamental lattice vibration and a deformation vibration of carbonate ion.Even evacuation at 673 K cannot remove MgCO 3 completely, since the decomposition temperature of MgCO 3 is higher than 673 K. CO 2 remaining as MgCO 3 after pretreatment is not involved in the reaction because CO was not generated under photoirradiation without the introduction of CO 2 . Figures 6 and7 illustrate the difference IR spectra of the adsorbed species on MgO (a) after introduction of 4.1 kPa of CO 2 and evacuation, (b) after introduction of 5.1 kPa of H 2 or 5.2 kPa of CH 4 and under photoirradiation for 18 h, and (c) after evacuation (H 2 and CH 4 were used as reductant in Figures 6 and7, respectively).The spectrum of pretreated MgO was used as a background of all difference IR spectra.When CO 2 was introduced to MgO, many bands appeared in the region of 1800-1250 cm -1 (Figures 6a and7a).Davydov et al. 35 determined that the unidentate carbonate bands at 1520, 1320, and 1020-960 cm -1 are an asymmetric OCO stretching 35 In our case, the unidentate carbonate and the surface bicarbonate appeared at 1526 and 1337 cm -1 and at 1685 and 1383 cm -1 , respectively.On the other hand, bands at 1661, 1631, 1346, and 1313 cm -1 (1666, 1631, 1340, and 1316 cm -1 in Figure 7) are assigned to surface bidentate carbonates. 33,3637738 Fukuda and Tanabe 36 reported that two type of bidentate carbonate are generated at room temperature.In addition, Tsuji et al. 37 and Yanagisawa et al. 38 confirmed that the bands at 1668, 1320, 1005, and 849 cm -1 (species A as shown in Chart 1a) increase in intensity at 373 K by FT-IR spectroscopy and temperatureprogrammed desorption (TPD) methods, although the bands at 1630, 1277, 955, and 833 cm -1 (species B as shown in Chart 1b) disappear.It was concluded that species A is adsorbed more strongly on MgO than species B. However, the assignment of these two bidentate carbonate is under discussion.In a previous study, we also monitored the behavior of the absorbance of two bidentate bands by FT-IR spectroscopy when introduced CO 2 was increased gradually.Both species were detected in introducing a small amount of CO 2 . 29The increase in the absorbance of the bidentate bands at 1660 and 1310 cm -1 (species A) stopped after introduction of CO 2 exceeded 66 molg -MgO -1 .On the other hand, the bidentate band at 1624 cm -1 (species B) increased in absorbance when more than 66 molg-MgO -1 of CO 2 was introduced.Therefore, in this study, it was also classified that the bands at 1661 and 1346 cm -1 are stronger than those at 1631 and 1313 cm -1 .As mentioned above, the maximum amount of the chemisorbed CO 2 was 130 mol g-MgO -1 .The most CO evolution by the heat treatment was achieved upon introducing 66 molg-MgO -1 of CO 2 .CO evolution by the photocatalytic reaction was confirmed in the gas phase when more than 66 molgMgO -1 of CO 2 was introduced to MgO.And CO evolution by both the photocatalytic reaction and the heat treatment became constant after the amount of the introduced CO 2 reached 133 molg-MgO -1 .The behavior obtained from the reaction is in agreement with that observed by IR spectra.In conclusion, the stronger bidentate carbonate (species A) is reduced to the mere intermediate, which is inactive for CO evolution.In introducing more than 66 molg-MgO -1 of CO 2 , the weaker bidentate carbonate (species B) is generated except species A. Species B is reduced to a surface-active intermediate that can produce CO in the gas phase from CO 2 by H 2 or CH 4 as a reductant because the amount of CH 4 consumption was compatible with that of species B evolution 66 molg-MgO -1 . Figures 6b and7b show the IR spectra of MgO irradiated for 15 h in the presence of H 2 or CH 4 as a reactant after evacuation of CO 2 .Increase or decrease in intensity and appearance of new bands were observed in the IR spectra in the region of 2900-2700 and 1800-1250 cm -1 .These spectra were not changed when MgO was left for 15 h in the presence of H 2 or CH 4 in the dark.The inset picture in Figure 6 shows the subtraction of the IR spectrum of adsorbed species on MgO in the presence of H 2 before photoirradiation (Figure 6a) from that after photoirradiation (Figure 6b).New bands at 2957, 2830, and 2730 cm -1 appeared in the region of 2900-2700 cm -1 under photoirradiation.These bands are assigned to a C-H stretching vibration band (CH). 394004142 Since surface carbonates have no C-H stretching vibration mode (CH), the appearance of these bands exhibits the formation of a surface species containing a C-H bond, which we expected to be a reaction intermediate. 29In the region of 1800-1250 cm -1 , new bands at 1599 as (OCO), 1448 (CH), and 1360 cm -1 s (OCO) appeared under photoirradiation, 414243 whereas the bands at 1668, 1634, and 1313 cm -1 assigned to a bidentate carbonate and the bands at 1686, 1459, and 1383 cm -1 assigned to a bicarbonate decreased in intensity.Accordingly, it is anticipated that the surface bidentate carbonate and the surface bicarbonate reacted with H 2 as a reductant under photoirradiation to the surface species containing a C-H bond.We have already confirmed that the new bands at 2957, 2830, 2730, 1599, and 1360 cm -1 were not formed in the dark or in the absence of H 2 . 29The new bands are derived from an intermediate species formed only in the presence of H 2 under photoirradiation because CO evolution by the heat treatment after the photoreaction is not observed without irradiation.In our previous papers, 26,27,29 we identified the intermediate for the CO 2 H 2 reaction over ZrO 2 and MgO as a surface formate species; in addition, we found that a similar spectrum to that of the surface species was obtained when formic acid or formaldehyde was adsorbed on the surface of ZrO 2 or MgO, respectively.The difference IR spectrum of MgO irradiated for 15 h in the presence of H 2 after evacuation of CO 2 (same as Figure 6b) is similar to that of formaldehyde species adsorbed on pretreated MgO as shown in Figure 8. Wang and Hattori 44 reported that the bands at 2840 (CH), 1604 as (OCO), and 1370 cm -1 s (OCO) are assigned to a surface bidentate formate when formaldehyde is adsorbed on pretreated MgO.We have already proposed the molecular structure of the adsorbed species followed by Peng and Barteau. 45Formaldehyde loses one hydrogen atom to connect with one lattice oxygen atom of MgO and forms a surface bidentate formate.Therefore, it was concluded that the surface species arising during the photoreaction between CO 2 and H 2 is a surface bidentate formate. On the other hand, the inset picture in Figure 7 shows the subtraction of the IR spectrum of adsorbed species on MgO in the presence of CH 4 before photoirradiation (Figure 7a) from that after photoirradiation (Figure 7b).In the case of using CH 4 as a reductant, new bands in the region of 2900-2700 and 1800-1250 cm -1 were observed in addition to the bands in the case of using H 2 as a reductant; the bands at 1666, 1631, and 1316 cm -1 were assigned to a bidentate carbonate and the bands at 1684, 1460, and 1382 cm -1 were assigned to a bicarbonate decreased in intensity.In the range of 2900-2700 cm -1 , seven bands at 2962, 2935, 2874, 2831, 2804, 2753, and 2733 cm -1 were observed and assigned to as (CH 3 ) (2962 cm -1 ), s (CH 3 ) (2935 cm -1 ), and (CH) (2874, 2831, 2804, 2753, and 2733 cm -1 ). 394004142 In the range of 1800-1250 cm -1 , new bands appeared at 1595 (s), 1579, 1447, 1436, 1395, 1384, 1356, and 1342 cm -1 .The bands at 1595, 1447, 1384, and 1356 cm -1 are assigned to as (OCO), (CH), (CH), and s (OCO), respectively, and derived from a formate because these bands were the same as that in the case of H 2 as a reductant. 4142243 In contrast, it was anticipated that the other bands were derived from an acetate.The band at 1579 cm -1 can be correlated to a C-O symmetric vibration mode. 46The bands at 1436, 1395, and 1342 cm -1 are assigned to a C-H deformation vibration mode: as (CH 3 ), (CH), and s (CH 3 ), respectively. 47,48As mentioned above, the spectrum of MgO irradiated in the presence of H 2 after evacuation of CO 2 was similar to that of pretreated MgO adsorbing formaldehyde (Figure 8).The surface species was a bidentate formate.Therefore, in the case of CH 4 as a reductant, it is expected that not only a bidentate formate but also a bidentate acetate are generated on MgO and the spectrum of MgO irradiated in the presence of CH 4 after CO 2 evacuation is similar to that of MgO adsorbing acetaldehyde.Khaleel et al. 49 reported that the adsorbed acetaldehyde interacts with lattice oxygen and transforms to a surface bidentate acetate when acetaldehyde is introduced to MgO. Figure 9 exhibits the difference IR spectra of acetaldehyde species adsorbed on pretreated MgO as compared with Figure 7b.The bands in the region of 3000-2700 cm and 1800-1250 cm -1 could be confirmed to be similar to those in Figure 7b.Consequently, the species adsorbed on MgO converts to the surface bidentate acetate as well as the surface bidentate formate as an intermediate in the presence of CH 4 under photoirradiation after CO 2 evacuation. We carried out the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction over MgO pretreated with HCHO or CH 3 CHO to investigate the role of the surface bidentate formate and the surface bidentate acetate as an intermediate.CO was not generated in the gas phase in the presence of only HCHO or CH 3 CHO as a substrate under photoirradiation.In addition, we have no CO over MgO pretreated with HCHO or CH 3 CHO in the presence of CH 4 as a reductant under photoirradiation.However, CO was detected in the gas phase when CO 2 was introduced to MgO in the presence of HCHO or CH 3 CHO under photoirradiation.This reaction did not proceed in the dark.The origin of the carbon atom contained in the products and the surface species was determined by use of carbon isotopes ( 13 C-labeled CO 2 ).The carbon atom of CO 2 was labeled by 13 C and the photoreaction between 13 CO 2 and H 12 CHO was carried out over MgO.Only 13 CO was formed in the gas phase.Therefore, CO generated in the gas phase is derived from CO 2 . These results are summarized as follows.Both the stronger bidentate carbonate (species A) and the weaker bidentate carbonate (species B) are generated when CO 2 is admitted to MgO.Species A increased by priority as compared with species B until the amount of introduced CO 2 reached 66 mol g-MgO -1 .In introducing more than 66 molg-MgO -1 of CO 2 , species B increased and CO was produced in the gas phase.The CO evolution by the photocatalytic reaction and the heat treatment became constant after more than 133 molg-MgO -1 of CO 2 is introduced to MgO.This value is compatible with the amount of CO 2 chemisorbed on MgO 130 molg-MgO -1 .Therefore, the same amount of species A and species B 66 molg-MgO -1 are formed on MgO.In conclusion, species A would be connected with only magnesium atom and remain on MgO as an inactive species because there are excessive base sites of MgO.On the other hand, species B, which was adsorbed by the side-on adsorption-type form, is reduced to a surface bidentate formate or a surface bidentate acetate by H 2 or CH 4 .These species are not intermediates but photoactive species on MgO because they are very stable and reduce CO 2 in the gas phase to CO. Photoluminescence.From the FT-IR spectroscopy, it was investigated that the photoactive species for the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction is produced from a side-on adsorption-type carbonate (species B) and reduces CO 2 to CO.The adsorption of CO 2 on MgO is related to the mechanism of formate and acetate formations.The CO 2 species adsorbed on MgO is reduced to a surface bidentate formate or acetate in the presence of H 2 or CH 4 under photoirradiation, respectively.And the formate and the acetate contribute to the evolution of CO under photoirradiation.Therefore, it is anticipated that CO 2 adsorbed on MgO are photoactivated under photoirradiation.We have already reported the study of CO 2 adsorbed on ZrO 2 by UVvis spectroscopy and photoluminescence. 26In the case of ZrO 2 , we have no spectral changes in the diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra; however, there were some peaks caused by the formation of new photoactive species in photoluminescence.In this study, we also carried out to identify a photoactive species in photoluminescence.Figure 10 shows phosphorescent excitation spectra of MgO (a) after pretreatment, (b) absorbing 33 molg-MgO -1 of CO 2 and (c) absorbing 66 molg-MgO -1 of CO 2 , and the inset is expanded at 280-380 nm.The emission light was monitored at 450 nm, because the maximum emission intensity was obtained at around that wavelength.The maximum excitation intensity, which was observed at 240 nm (5.2 eV), was assigned to excitation of bulk MgO.This result is reasonable as compared with the absorption band in the diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectrum, although Zecchina et al. 50described that the absorption bands of lowest energy in undamaged crystal of MgO are at 61500 cm -1 (7.68 eV).On the other hand, Tench and Pott 51 reported the excitation intensity at 240 nm on MgO, in addition, Coluccia et al. 525354 and Anpo et al. 55 investigated that the observed luminescence is derived from extrinsic lattice defects such as an F center, an electron trapped at surface anion vacancy.In introducing CO 2 to MgO, the excitation intensity at 250 nm was quenched gradually.Therefore, CO 2 interacts with the extrinsic lattice defects.On the other hand, it is found that an absorption of the excitation wavelength at 320 nm increased in intensity when CO 2 was adsorbed on MgO.We obtained the same conclusion as ZrO 2 .This shows that new bands build up between the valence band and conduction band of MgO.In addition, Figure 11 shows phosphorescent emission spectra excited at 320 nm of MgO (a) after CO 2 introduction and (b) after H 2 or CH 4 introduction to MgO-adsorbed CO 2 .The broad peak observed at 350-600 nm was quenched after introduction of H 2 or CH 4 .Thus, it is identified that the photoactive species derived from the adsorbed CO 2 interacts with H 2 or CH 4 as a reductant. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance.As mentioned above, we investigated whether the surface species derived from CO 2 adsorbed on MgO surface were photoactivated in a low energy.From many studies, the photoactivated CO 2 species on MgO was assigned to CO 2 -radical species. 38,5657758 Moreover, it was reported that CO 2 interacts with an F center of MgO.We also measured EPR spectra to clarify the photoactivated CO 2 species in the present reaction.Figure 12 shows the EPR spectra of MgO with adsorbed CO 2 species.A signal derived from Mn 2 as an impurity appeared as shown in Figure 12a.This signal did not change although CO 2 was introduced to MgO in the dark.However, sharp signals (g ) 1.998, 2.002 and g ) 2.007, 2.011, 2.022) of two radical species were observed under photoirradiation.Only one signal (g ) 2.001) was monitored when MgO was illuminated in the absence of CO 2 .This signal was assigned to color center of MgO. Figure 13 represents the EPR spectra of MgO with adsorbed 13 CO 2 species.Each signal was split into two when 13 CO 2 was adsorbed instead of 12 CO 2 .Therefore, the signals in Figure 12c were not derived from MgO but the CO 2 species adsorbed on MgO.It was reported that g ) 1.998, 2002 and g ) 2.007, 2.011, 2.022 are assigned to a CO 2 -radical and a CO 3 -radical, respectively. 5960061626364656667 Our results are also supported by this assignment.In our case, the signals of the CO 2 -radical and the CO 3 -radical remained after 1 h although the light illumination was stopped.This indicates that the photoactivated species on MgO is very stable in the dark after photoirradiation.On the other hand, the CO 2 -radical and CO 3 -radical, the photoactivated species on MgO, react with H 2 or CH 4 as a reductant readily.When H 2 or CH 4 was introduced to MgO in the dark, the signals derived from the CO 2 -radical and CO 3 -radical disappeared in short order.In addition, the CO 2 -radical species vanished more quickly than the CO 3 -radical species.It is concluded that the CO 2 -radical is reduced by H 2 or CH 4 to the formate or the acetate rather than the CO 3 -radical in the present reaction. Reaction Mechanism.From these results, we proposed the mechanism of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the presence of H 2 or CH 4 as a reductant as shown in Scheme 1.The two bidentate carbonate are generated on MgO in introducing CO 2 as shown in Chart 1. Species A is the stronger bidentate carbonate than species B. The bidentate carbonates are activated under photoirradiation and are converted to a CO 2 -radical or a CO 3 -radical.The CO 3 -radical derived from species A would be transformed to the bicarbonate, which is inactive for the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.On the other hand, the CO 2 -radical species derived from species B is reduced to a surface bidentate formate in the presence of H 2 or CH 4 .The surface bidentate formate is very stable on MgO and reduced CO 2 in the gas phase to CO under photoirradiation.In the case of using CH 4 as a reductant, a surface bidentate acetate as well as a surface bidentate formate is generated on MgO.We speculate about the role of the acetate on MgO and suggest the following two possibilities: (1) a surface bidentate acetate is also an active species for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction, and (2) an inactive acetate is transformed to an active formate.In the case of the CH 3 CHO CO 2 reaction, the activity was lower than that of the CO 2 CH 4 reaction.On the other hand, it was confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy that a surface formate was formed on MgO when acetaldehyde was introduced to MgO.We cannot assert whether the acetate species is active or not.In conclusion, we observed that the surface bidentate formate is a photoactive species for the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction and will discuss the role of the surface bidentate acetate in a future paper."

    "content": "In the present study, we uncovered the mechanism of the CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the presence of H 2 or CH 4 as a reductant.CO 2 adsorbed on MgO is activated to a CO 2 -radical under photoirradiation, and the CO 2 -radical was reduced to the surface bidentate formate in the presence of H 2 and CH 4 in the dark.It was identified that the photoactive species is the surface bidentate formate.This species, which was very stable on MgO, reduced CO 2 in the gas phase to CO under photoirradiation.In addition, it was clarified that the species was derived from the only side-on adsorption-type bidentate carbonate although the two bidentate carbonate were detected by FT-IR spectroscopy.It is isolated that the photocatalytic reaction proceeds over the stable species adsorbed on insulating materials such as MgO.This phenomenon is not explained by the conventional band theory, which is based on the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of semiconductor material.We proposed the new concept to the band theory for the photocatalytic reaction.
