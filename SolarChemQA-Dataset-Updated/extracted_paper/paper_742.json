    "content": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to syngas is an effective way for producing high value-added chemical feedstocks such as methanol and light olefins in industry.Nevertheless, the precise control of CO/H 2 ratio from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction still poses a great challenge for the further application.Herein, we prepared a series of highly efficient heterostructure based on highly dispersed palladium supported on ultrathin CoAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH).In conjunction with a Ru-complex sensitizer, the molar ratios of CO/H 2 can be tuned from 1:0.74 to 1:3 under visible-light irradiation ( 400 nm).More interestingly, the syngas can be obtained under light irradiation at 600 nm.Structure characterization and density functional theory calculations revealed that the remarkable catalytic activity can be due to the supported palladium, which improved the charge transfer efficiency.Meanwhile, more H atoms were used to generate H 2 on the supported palladium for further tunable CO/H 2 ratio.This work demonstrates a new strategy for harnessing abundant solar-energy to produce syngas from a CO 2 feedstock."

The CoAl-LDH nanosheets were synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method following the reference 28 with slight modifications.A 20.0 mL solution composed of 0.66 mmol Co(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O and 0.33 mmol Al(NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O was added dropwise to a solution of 20.0 mL H 2 O. Simultaneously, 0.25 M NaOH was added dropwise to maintain the mixture at a pH value of ca. 10 with magnetic stirring at 80 C.The precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with water.The prepared catalysts were denoted as CoAl-LDH."

    "content": "Herein, the CoAl-LDH was successfully prepared with typical (00 l ) peak as shown in From inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) measurements, the Pd loading of Pd/CoAl-x ( x 0.59, 2.89, 8.18 wt) can be determined to be 0.55, 2.46 and 7.57 wt, respectively.X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Pd/CoAl-0.55,Pd/CoAl-2.46and Pd/CoAl-7.57(Fig. S1) exhibited typical LDH structure.However, no diffraction peaks for Pd species can be found due to their small paricle size. The low-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the CoAl-LDH and Pd/CoAl-x samples exhibited similar hexagonal plate-like morphology with an average lateral size of 73 nm, and the Pd NPs were highly dispersed on the surface of LDH nanosheets ( Fig. 1 b-d).Remarkably, with the increase of Pd content from 0.55, 2.46 to 7.57, more Pd NPs can be observed.Furthermore, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of CoAl-LDH, Pd/CoAl-0.55,Pd/CoAl-2.46and Pd/CoAl-7.57were determined to be 27.20,38.91, 4 9.6 8 and 6 8.13 m 2 g -1 , respectively (Fig. S3). The Co K-edge X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS) measurements were carried out to elucidate the local structure and the mean oxidation state of the metals present in the above materials.X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) curves ( Fig. 2 similar even with increasing Pd content, indicating the presence of Pd NPs did not change the coordination environment of Co in the CoAl-LDH.However, these small changes in the surface oxidation states of Co can be further explored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. 2 c).The ratio of Co 3 /Co 2 slightly increased upon addition of Pd NPs.It was worth mentioning that the value of Pd 2 signal peak shifted to lower binding energy from 337.80 eV for Pd/CoAl-0.55 to 337.23 eV for Pd/CoAl-7.57,indicating a redox reaction of Co 2 with Pd 2 during the synthetic process ( Fig. 2 d) 29 .However, this shift value (ca.0.57 eV) was less obvious than the binding energy difference between Pd 0 and Pd 2 in PdCl 2 (ca.2.1 eV), implying the generation of electron deficient Pd species (Pd (2-n ) ) in Pd/CoAl-7.5730 . The photocatalytic CRR performance of Pd/CoAl-LDH materials was evaluated under visible-light irradiation ( 400 nm, 0.18 MPa CO 2 ) by using Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O as sensitizer with the assistance of TEOA 12 .The CO and H 2 were the only produces detected from the photocatalytic CRR by using CoAl-LDH and Pd/CoAl-7.57(Fig. S4), and no detectable liquid products were generated as shown by 1 H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S5).Fig. 3 (a andb) shows the evolution rates, ratios and selectivity of CO and H 2 for different catalysts.With the Pd content increasing from 0, 0.55, 5.46 to 7.57 in the Pd/CoAl-x , the evolution rates of CO decreased from 2.03, 1.68, 1.18 to 0.58 mmol g -1 h -1 , respectively.And more interestingly, the evolution rates of H 2 changed from 1.50, 1.78, 1.59 to 1.30 mmol g -1 h -1 , respectively.The CO/H 2 ratios of the above four catalysts were determined to be 1:0.74(1.35), 1:1.06 (0.94), 1:1.35 (0.75) and 1:2.23 (0.45), respectively.Furthermore, the effect of CO 2 pressure in the photocatalytic CRR was also investigated.The photocatalytic CRR was performed at various pressures of CO 2 (0.14, 0.18 and 0.22 MPa) while maintaining all the other conditions.As shown in Fig. S6, the CO/H 2 ratio was further adjusted to 1:3 at pressure of 1.4 MPa over Pd/CoAl-7.57.This wide range of syngas ratio (from 1:0.74 to 1:3) would be ideal for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction to synthesis high-value chemicals.In addition, CoAl-LDH and Pd/CoAl-7.57still had high evolution rates (69 and 4 mol g -1 h -1 CO, respectively) and appropriate syngas ratio (1:1) when the wavelength of light was above 600 nm as shown in Fig. 3 (e andf).This large range wavelength utilization was momentous for the further solar energy conversion.These synthesized CoAl-LDH and Pd/CoAl-x materials had a higher evolution rates of CO and H 2 with a tunable ratio than other catalysts reported in the previous literatures (Table S1), and this is the first report on the syngas evolution from CO 2 under light irradiation up to 600 nm.In order to trace the source of CO and H 2 , an isotopic experiment with 13 CO 2 and seven control experiments were carried out.The presence of m/z at 29 ( 13 CO) in the GC-MS spectra signifies that the CO was generated from CO 2 ( Fig. 3 c).In the control experiments (Fig. S7), the evolution rates of CO and H 2 were significantly lower than that under the normal reaction conditions.And no any products can be detected in the absence of photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 2 , further indicating that CoAl-LDH acts as cophotocatalyst for CO 2 reduction.The above results proved that CO and H 2 were evolved from the photocatalytic CRR with H 2 O using photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 2 and CoAl-LDH. The stabilities of CoAl-LDH and Pd/CoAl-7.57were investigated by four consecutive runs under visible-light irradiation, respectively ( Figs. 3 d,S8).The evolution rates and selectivities of CO and H 2 showed no significant changes from the 1st to the 4th run when CoAl-LDH was used as catalyst, indicating the stability and reusability of CoAl-LDH in the photocatalytic CRR.However, a change of the evolution rates of CO and H 2 can be observed from 1st to the 2nd run for Pd/CoAl-7.57.The stucture of Pd/CoAl-7.57after the first cycle was studied by using XRD, HRTEM and XPS, and there were no significant change of the layered structure of LDH as given in XRD patterns (Fig. S9a).However, the color of reaction liquid was changed from light brown to black and the 0.223 nm lattice spacing of the metallic Pd (111) crystal plane can be clearly detected (Fig. S9b,c).Furthermore, metallic Pd 0 species (340.35 and 335.12 eV) can be clearly observed from XPS spectra after the first recycle reaction (Fig. S9d) mainly due to the photocatalytic reduction of the Pd (2-n ) supported on LDH surface to metallic Pd 0 under visible light process.Hence, after the first cycle, the evolution rate of H 2 was improved and maintained the CO/H 2 ratio (1:2) during CO 2 reduction process.These catalytic test results further verify that the metallic Pd 0 supported on LDH surface acts as the main site during the CRR reaction. To further explore the key role of Pd NPs in the photocatalytic CRR, the charge transfer efficiency of photoinduced carriers was further traced by using electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), photocurrent response and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.As displayed in Fig. 4 (a), Pd/CoAl-7.57had a much smaller semicircle radius of Nyquist plots than CoAl-LDH, indicating the more efficient charge transfer on Pd/CoAl-7.57as mainly contributed by Pd NPs.Furthermore, Fig. 4 (b) compares the photocurrent response of CoAl-LDH and Pd/CoAl-7.57.Clearly, Pd/CoAl-7.57had an enhanced photocurrent intensity compared to CoAl-LDH when the light was on, further confirming the efficient charge transfer ability of Pd/CoAl-7.57.In addition, Pd/CoAl-7.57also produced a weaker emission peak around 630 nm, indicating a suppressed recombination of the electron-hole pairs ( Fig. 4 c).The above results proved the key role of Pd NPs in promoting the charge transfer and separation during the photocatalytic CRR. In addition, the band structure of CoAl-LDH was analyzed in order to study its photocatalytic mechanism.As shown in Fig. S10, the color of the catalyst turned darker with increasing Pd NPs, and the corresponding band gap ( E g ) of CoAl-LDH can be estimated to be 2.10 eV based on the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy ( Fig. 4 d).The above UV-Vis absorption of LDH and Pd/LDH-x well explained the CO 2 reduction activity under light irradiation above 600 nm.The energy gap from valance band maximum (VBM) to the Fermi level ( E f ) of CoAl-LDH was determined to be 0.45 eV (Fig. S11a).Moreover, the flat band potential was obtained from Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. S11b).Based on the above results, the relative band structure of CoAl-LDH can be achieved (Fig. S11c). To gain insights into the differences of CoAl-LDH and Pd/CoAl-LDH in the photocatalytic CRR, the electronic structure differences of CoAl-LDH and Pd/CoAl-LDH were studied via the periodic density functional theory (DFT).Based on the aforementioned experimental characterization results, the optimized models of As mentioned above, the CO 2 adsorption is a critical factor for the photocatalytic CRR.Therefore, the adsorption energies of reactant molecules on the surface of CoAl-LDH and Pd/CoAl-LDH were studied in more detail.As shown in Fig. S13, the two most stable adsorption configurations were established after optimizing initial structures.It is well known that Pd is the best catalyst for the H 2 evolution with lower overpotential 32 , 33 , explaining the improved H 2 evolution over Pd/CoAl-LDH during CO 2 reduction, in accordance with the decreased CO/H 2 ratio.The above DFT calculation results provided strong evidence to support the experimental results that the introduction of Pd NPs on the surface of CoAl-LDH enhanced the H 2 evolution for tunable CO/H 2 ratio.Based on the above observation and analyses, the possible mechanistic elucidation of the photocatalytic CRR on Pd/CoAl-LDH catalyst with Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 6H 2 O as photosensitizer was proposed in Fig. 5 (d).First of all, the photosensitizer Ru(bpy) 3 2 was excited under visible-light irradiation and oxidized to Ru(bpy) 3 3 .Simultaneously, a large amount of photoelectrons were generated (Table S2, eq1) 12 , 13 .In the beginning, a fraction of the photoelectrons were used to reduce Pd (2-n ) to Pd 0 (Table S2, eq2), while another fraction of the photoelectrons drived the reduction of H to generate H atoms (Table S2, eq3).Subsequently, the generated H atoms were transferred to the surface of LDH to reduce CO 2 into CO and inevitably combined directly to form H 2 (Table S2, eqs.4 and 5).In addition, some H atoms can also be combined directly to form H 2 on the surface of reduced metallic Pd 0 (Table S2, eq5).The oxidized Ru(bpy) 3 3 was reduced to Ru(bpy) 3 2 by the sacrifcial reductant TEOA (Table S2, eq6), providing the tunable CO/H 2 ratio during the CO 2 reduction process."

    "content": "To summarize, visible-light photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O to syngas by the heterostuctured Pd/CoAl-LDH and sensitizer (Ru complex) resulted in the formation of tunnable CO/H 2 ratio ranging from 1:0.74 to 1:3.More importatnly, the syngas can be obtained under light irradiation up to 600 nm.EIS, photocurrent response and steady-state PL spectroscopy fully suggested that the Pd NPs promoted the charge transfer and separation efficiency.DFT calculations also indicated that the presence of Pd NPs was beneficial to the adsorption of the reactant molecules H 2 O, which promoted the evolution of H 2 .This study provides a pathway to adjust the CO/H 2 ratio by photocatalytic CRR under visible-light irradiation, even extend to 600 nm. Scheme 1.The selectivity of CoAl-LDH and Pd/CoAl-x for CO 2 reduction under visible light irradiation in the presence of a Ru(bpy) 3 2 sensitizer and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor. Pd/CoAl-x ( x 0.55, 2.46 and 7.57 wt) The Pd/CoAl-x was synthesized via same synthetic method.A 20.0 mL solution composed of 0.66 mmol Co(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O and 0.33 mmol Al(NO 3 ) 3 9H 2 O and different amounts of PdCl 2 was added dropwise to a solution of 20.0 mL H 2 O. Simultaneously, 0.25 M NaOH was added dropwise to maintain the mixture at a pH value of ca. 10 with magnetic stirring at 80 C.The precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with water.The synthesized catalysts were denoted as Pd/CoAl-x ( x 0.55, 2.46, 7.57) corresponding to the PdCl 2 amount of 7.5 mol, 37.5 mol and 112.5 mol, respectively. Fig. S1.Structural characterization indicated that the CoAl-LDH showed a lateral size of 73.1 nm with an ultrathin thickness of 4 nm ( Fig 1 a and Fig S2).Previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of co-catalysts like Pd can improve the charge transfer efficiency of photoinduced carriers.As such, different amounts of Pd NPs were loaded onto ultrathin CoAl-LDH (denoted as Pd/CoAl-x, x represents the Pd mass percentage) by a simple co-precipitation method. a) showed that the Co K-edge of CoAl-LDH and Pd/CoAl-x samples were almost unchanged with increasing Pd content, implying that the presence of Pd had negligible influence on the oxidation states of Co in the synthesized Pd/CoAl-x catalysts.The Co extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) curves ( Fig. 2 b) for the CoAl-LDH and Pd/CoAl-x samples possessed two main peaks below 4 A, which corresponded to the first Co-O shell and second Co-M (M Co/Al) shells, respectively.The intensities of two shells were Fig. 1.TEM images of (a) CoAl-LDH, (b) Pd/CoAl-0.55,(c) Pd/CoAl-2.46,(d) Pd/CoAl-7.57,(The inset images show the particle distribution of CoAl-LDH and the Pd NPs size of Pd/CoAl-7.57,respectively); (e, f) AFM image and corresponding height profiles of Pd/CoAl-7.57.
