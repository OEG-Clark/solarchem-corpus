    "content": "Novel composites comprising amorphous carbon and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) were fabricated via facial one-step thermal condensation of glucose and urea precursors.The as-prepared composites were systematically characterized.The photocatalytic activity towards H 2 production under visible light was examined.By fine-tuning the weight ratio of precursors, the composites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity.The photocatalytic H 2 evolution rate of optimal composite was 212.8 mmol h A1 g A1 , about 10-fold larger than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 .The intimate interface between the amorphous carbon and g-C 3 N 4 plays the key role for prolonging the charge carrier lifetime and accelerating the charge transfer kinetics, which benefit the photocatalytic performance.Besides, the enhanced photocatalytic performance is also attributed to the improved visible-light absorption and enlarged surface area.Apart from H 2 production, the high-performance geC 3 N 4 ebased photocatalysts are potentially applicable for CO 2 reduction, organic synthesis and environmental remediation."

    "content": "All reagents used in the synthetic processes were used as purchased without further purification treatment.Pure g-C 3 N 4 was synthesized by heating 10.0 g urea in a covered crucible at 500 C for 2 h with a temperature raise rate of 5 C/min.Upon cooling down, light yellow powders were obtained and then grounded into fine powders.Herein, a crucible covered with a lid was employed to drive the intermediates generated in the pyrolysis process to polymerize into g-C 3 N 4 .Amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites were prepared via the one-step thermal co-condensation approach.Typically, 10 g urea was mixed with different amounts of glucose.Subsequently, the homogenous mixture of urea and glucose was put into a crucible with a cover and annealed at 500 C for 2 h at ramp rate of 5 C/min.By this approach, the bulk condensation of urea and glucose occurs in a muffle furnace.Then, the as-obtained products were grounded into fine powders.The mass ratio of glucose to urea was changed from 0.05 to 0.5, and the obtained photocatalysts were denoted as CNCx.x represents the weight ratio in preparation, which are CNC0.05,CNC0.1, CNC0.25 and CNC0.5.Amorphous carbon was prepared by heating glucose under identical conditions as those of amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposites. The structures of the as-prepared photocatalysts were recorded on a D/MAX-RB X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Ka radiation source at room temperature.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was characterized by JSM-7500F (JEOL, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by JEM-2100F electron microscopy (JEOL, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.The specific surface area data were collected by nitrogen adsorption isotherms using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus.All samples were conducted at A196 C after degassing at 150 C for 4 h.Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were conducted using KBr pellets with IRAffinity-1 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan).To estimate the chemical composition and valence states of as-prepared samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were adopted by using ESCALab 250 Xi electron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Corporation, USA) with Al Ka radiation as the source.The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were employed to investigate the optical properties of the synthesized samples by using UVevisible spectrometer (UV 2550, Shimadzu, Japan).The reagent of BaSO 4 was used as the reference.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan) with the excitation wavelength of 365 nm.The time-resolved fluorescence measurements were recorded on an Edinburgh FLS920 at an excitation wavelength of 345 nm.The obtained curves were fitted by using the following equation: The average emission lifetime was calculated via the following equation: The photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples was evaluated by the water splitting reaction under visible light irradiation.The photocatalytic H 2 evolution reactions were performed using a side-irradiated gas-closed system.In each experiment, 50 mg of photocatalysts was dispersed into 80 mL of aqueous solution, which comprised of 15 vol triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent.Before the light irradiation, the sealed reaction system was purged with high-purity N 2 gas for 0.5 h to remove the dissolved air in the aqueous solution.1.0 wt Pt was loaded onto the as-prepared photocatalysts as a co-catalyst from H 2 PtCl 6 aqueous solution via in situ photodeposition.To ensure the uniform irradiation of the suspension, the suspension was agitated during the photocatalytic process.A 350 W xenon arc lamp was used as the light source with a cutoff filter (l !420 nm).The evolved H 2 was measured by gas chromatograph.Typically, 0.4 mL of gas was collected from the top space of the sealed reactor by syringe and analyzed by gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was detected using four 3 W LEDs at centered wavelength of 420 nm and calculated based on the following equation: where N H2 is the number of generated H 2 molecules and Np is the number of emitted photons. Photoelectrochemical properties of the samples were performed in a conventional three electrode system.The electrodes were fabricated as following.30 mg of photocatalysts was added into 5 mL of anhydrous ethanol and then grounded to form homogeneous slurry.Subsequently, a doctor blading technique was employed to ensure the same thickness for each photoelectrode.The slurry was coated onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate.After drying in the air, the electrochemical properties of the photocatalyst deposited on the FTO substrate were measured in the three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI-660C, Shanghai Chenhua, China).The FTO substrate with photocatalyst film, Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were used as the working, counter and reference electrode, respectively.All of the electrodes were dipped into the 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution during the whole measurement process.The active area of the present working electrodes is ca.0.5 cm 2 .EIS Nyquist plots were obtained with amplitude of 5 mV over the frequency range from 10 5 to 1 Hz at a bias voltage of 0.34 V."

    "content": "The overall synthetic process of the amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts is illustrated in Fig. 1a.The amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites were obtained by one-step thermal condensation of urea and glucose with various mass ratios at 500 C. In order to enable the intermediates generated in the pyrolysis process to polymerize into g-C 3 N 4 52, covering the crucible with a lid is a prerequisite for preparing g-C 3 N 4 .Assuming that the precursors have the identical products yield in the mixture and individual condition, the weight percentage of amorphous carbon in composites were calculated based on the precursors yield, which are 0.3 wt, 0.5 wt, 1.3 wt and 2.5 wt for the synthesized CNC0.05,CNC0.1, CNC0.25 and CNC0.5 samples, respectively.Thermogravimetry (TG) detection was also employed to investigate the real amorphous carbon content.However, there was a large amount of gas generated during the detection program as well as the residual amount of the amorphous carbon in composites which leads to the big deviation on the TG results.The SEM and TEM were employed to investigate morphology and microstructure of the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 and CNC0.1.As shown in Fig. 1b, the bulk g-C 3 N 4 exhibits the aggregated morphologies consisting of irregular block-based flakes and particles, which is the typical structure characteristic of g-C 3 N 4 synthesized by thermal polymerization 49,52.Notably, CNCx presents smaller particles and thinner sheets relative to bulk g-C 3 N 4 .Typical TEM image of g-C 3 N 4 shows 2D nanosheet-like morphology with porous structure (Fig. 1g), which is ascribed to ammonia-based gas bubbling in the urea pyrolysis process 53.However, compared with the big smooth 2D layer sheets of g-C 3 N 4 , CNC0.1 exhibits the overlapping layers, as shown in Fig. 1h.The g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets with pores was partially covered by the amorphous carbon without pores, suggesting that the amorphous carbon grown on the g-C 3 N 4 to form the amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites with intimate interface by the thermal treatment.It is generally accepted that 2D-2D heterostructures are beneficial for improving photocatalysis efficiency by providing abundant surface active sites and short diffusion length for reducing the recombination probability and thus enhancing the separation of photoexcited charge carriers 20,51. The XRD pattern is used to examine the phase structure of the pure g-C 3 N 4 , amorphous carbon and amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites, as shown in Fig. 2. The pure amorphous carbon displays a broad diffraction peak centered at 21.5 , which is typical for amorphous carbon assembled by randomly oriented aromatic carbon sheets 54.The XRD pattern of pure g-C 3 N 4 shows two peaks at 13.4 and 27.4 , which can be indexed as the respective (100) and (002) plane.The peak at 13.4 that originates from the inplane repeating tri-s-trizaine ring structure refers to a distance of 0.661 nm.The peak at 27.4 is stemmed from inter-layer periodic stacking of conjugated aromatic systems along the c-axis, which exhibits the typical graphitic layer structures.The inter-layer dspacing of the aromatic units is calculated to be 0.326 nm by the Bragg's law.There exists a little change over in-plane repeating motif distance in comparison with the previous results 15, which is rationalized as the different raw materials and experimental conditions between current study and previous work.Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the intensity of (100) and (002) diffraction peaks for the amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites becomes less pronounced.In addition, the (002) peak of the amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites displays a small shift, i.e., from 27.4 of pure g-C 3 N 4 to 27.0 of CNC0.5.Besides, all composites, especially for CNC0.25 and CNC0.5 samples, exhibit a weak and broad diffraction peak at 21.5 that is attributed to the existence of amorphous carbon.Our results indicate that the stacking distance of the aromatic units was increased.It is reasonable to hypothesize that the g-C 3 N 4 can serve as the template for forming amorphous carbon due to its unique layered structure, and thus the carbonization and condensation process of glucose can be confined in the interlayer of g-C 3 N 4 during the thermal treatment 55. FT-IR measurement was used to further study the structure of the synthesized photocatalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. 3.For pure g-C 3 N 4 , the intense band at 809.6 cm A1 represents the typical characteristic breathing mode of the tri-s-triazine structure 50,56.The bands at 1635.1, 1570.8 and 1418.3 are assigned to the skeletal vibrations of aromatic CeN.The bands at 1324.6 and 1254.9 cm A1 assign to stretching vibration of connected units of full condensed N-(C) 3 and partial condensed CeNeH, respectively 50,57.Absorbance in the range of 3200e3400 cm A1 is associated with the residual NeH groups and the OeH band 58.It is found that there are no obvious changes between the pure g-C 3 N 4 and CNC0.1, indicating that the introduction of amorphous carbon does not alter the skeleton structure of g-C 3 N 4 . The chemical compositions and bonding characteristics of the g-C 3 N 4 and CNC0.1 were investigated by XPS.As shown in Fig. 4a, it is observed that the pure g-C 3 N 4 and CNC0.1 contain only C, N and O elements without any other impurities from the XPS survey spectra.O elements are often detected when urea was used as the precursor for preparing g-C 3 N 4 59.Fig. 4b displays C1s spectra with three distinct peaks at 287.8, 286.2 and 284.8 eV, which corresponds to sp 2 -hybridized carbon in the aromatic structure (NeCN), residual CeO and graphitic CeC, respectively.As shown in Fig. 4c, the high resolution N 1s spectra of g-C 3 N 4 and CNC0.1 exhibit several N species at 398.2, 399.8, 400.9 and 404.2 eV, which are attributed to sp 2 -hybridized aromatic N (CNeC), tertiary N bonded to carbon atoms (N-(C) 3 ), amino functions (CeNeH), and p excitations, respectively 51.The sp 2 -hybridized aromatic N and tertiary N as well as the sp 2 -hybridized carbon (NeCN) result in the tri-striazine ring structure.In addition, the relative intensities of the C and N with different chemical states were calculated from the deconvolution curves, as shown in Table 1.Compared with g-C 3 N 4 , the relative intensities of the CeC and CeO components of CNC0.1 increased and the NeCN component decreased, confirming the successful incorporation of amorphous carbon into g-C 3 N 4 .The relative intensities of N with different chemical states have no pronounced changes, indicating that the skeleton structure of g-C 3 N 4 was retained after modification by amorphous carbon.The XPS results are in agreement with the forth mentioned FT-IR results. The specific surface areas and pore structures play a significant role in the photocatalytic reaction and investigated through nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements.As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of pure g-C 3 N 4 and amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites are type IV with H 3 hysteresis loops.Moreover, the adsorption branch of nitrogen isotherms shows a sharp increase at high relative pressures, suggesting the existence of large-sized mesopores and small macropores 60, in agreement with the above SEM and TEM results that both pure g-C 3 N 4 and amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites present porous structure and slit-like pores.Notably, the specific surface area of amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposites is greater than that of the pure g-C 3 N 4 .The combination of amorphous carbon and carbon nitride through p-p interaction probably prevent carbon nitride from restacking to achieve a high specific surface area 40, which is beneficial to photocatalysis by providing more active sites.The specific surface area is increased with increasing amorphous carbon content and then decreased with further increasing amorphous carbon amount since excessive amorphous carbon can cause aggregation and thus decrease the specific surface area. To identify the photoelectric property of pure g-C 3 N 4 and amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites, UVevis diffuse reflectance spectra were performed.As shown in Fig. 6a, the absorption edge of pure g-C 3 N 4 is 440 nm, indicating the band gap of 2.8 eV.After incorporation of amorphous carbon, the composites show more intensive absorption over the whole range of wavelengths investigated.The absorption edge of the composites still keeps unchanged, indicating the unchanged bandgap of the composites.The above results prove that adding amorphous carbon significantly enhances the optical absorption of amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites.Compared with pure g-C 3 N 4 , the composites can harvest more visible light and thus are expected to show better photocatalytic performance. The PL spectra were adopted to investigate the charge carrier separation and recombination behavior.As shown in Fig. 6b, the amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites show fluorescence emission characteristics similar to those of g-C 3 N 4 .It can be observed that the PL signal of the amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites was remarkably suppressed relative to g-C 3 N 4 .This phenomenon is attributed to the highly efficient electron transfer from g-C 3 N 4 to the amorphous carbon under visible light irradiation, leading to the spatial separation of the photoexcited charge carriers.The lifetimes of the charge carriers were detected by time-resolved fluorescence.Fig. 6c summarizes the lifetimes, the corresponding percentage as well as the weighted mean lifetime.In detail, the short lifetime of charge carriers in g-C 3 N 4 is 1.93 ns with the percentage of 36.24 and CNC0.1 is 1.56 ns with the percentage of 32.53.While, the long lifetime of charge carriers changes from 7.6 ns with the percentage of 63.76 in g-C 3 N 4 to the 8.0 ns and 67.47 in CNC0.1.And the weighted mean lifetime of 7.45 ns for CNC0.1 is larger than the 6.88 ns for pure g-C 3 N 4 .Thus, the extended lifetime of photo-generated charge carriers over CNC0.1 sample further demonstrates that the introduction of amorphous carbon can efficiently retard the recombination of charge carriers and thus enhance photocatalytic activity.Overall, the existed intimate interface between amorphous carbon and g-C 3 N 4 is beneficial for the separation of charge carriers because the p-conjugative amorphous carbon has high electron storage ability and is believed to be an effective electron acceptor.As a result, the spatial overlap between photo-generated charge carriers is decreased 40.Thus, it can lead to the reduced of PL intensity and prolonged lifetimes of the charge carriers.To further confirm the effect of amorphous carbon on the generating and transporting photo-generated charge carriers, photocurrent measurements were carried out.Fig. 6d illustrates the maximum photocurrent density of CNC0.1 is almost 6 times higher than that of pure g-C 3 N 4 .The increase in photocurrent means a lower recombination and a more efficient separation of photo-generated charge carriers for the composites at the interface.Notably, the photocurrent of the CNC0.1 sample gradually decreases after turning off the light, suggesting the amorphous carbon acted as the electron acceptor to retain the electrons transferred from stimulated g-C 3 N 4 .Similar phenomenon was also reported in our previous work 61. The photocatalytic H 2 evolution over various samples was investigated under visible light irradiation using TEOA as a scavenger to consume photoinduced holes.1.0 wt Pt was loaded as a cocatalyst onto the samples by in-situ photoreduction.As shown in Fig. 7a, all of the amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites exhibit higher H 2 evolution activity than pure g-C 3 N 4 with H 2 evolution rate of 20.9 mmol h A1 g A1 .Especially, CNC0.1 has the maximum H 2 evolution rate of 212.8 mmol h A1 g A1 , exceeding 10 times of pure g-C 3 N 4 .The factors, including improved optical absorption, increased specific surface area and prolonged charge carrier lifetime, contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic activity.The apparent quantum yield of CNC0.1 was measured to be 0.9 at 420 nm.However, the H 2 evolution rate is decreased with further increasing amorphous carbon amount.Likewise, the PL intensity of the composites is decreased with the increasing amorphous carbon content.It is reasonable because the overloaded amorphous carbon with wide and strong optical absorption ability results in the decrease in the PL intensity.The above phenomena is probably associated with the increase in a large black opacity amorphous carbon and light scattering, and decreased light utilization of g-C 3 N 4 40.A physical mixture of amorphous carbon and g-C 3 N 4 was also examined, which exhibited much lower photocatalytic activity in comparison with CNC0.1.It indicates that intimate contact interface between amorphous carbon and g-C 3 N 4 plays an important role for the separation and transfer of photo-generated electron and hole pairs.Therefore, amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composite with optimized mass ratio is beneficial for photogenerated electron-hole pair separation and photocatalysis performance.Fig. 7b displays the recycle ability for CNC0.1.No significant deactivation is detected after 12 h run in photocatalytic H 2 evolution.The slight decrease of H 2 evolution is due to the consumption of sacrifice reagents during the running. To further investigate the electron separation and transfer procedure, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plot was performed.In EIS Nyquist plots, the semicircular radius is corresponded to the charge transfer process at the electrode and electrolyte interface, while the liner part is related to the charge diffusion limiting process 62.Fig. 8 shows that EIS semicircular was dramatically decreased after the introduction of amorphous carbon into g-C 3 N 4 , which proves the facilitated interfacial charge transfer. According the current results, a possible mechanism for photocatalytic H 2 evolution is proposed (Fig. 9).Under visible light illumination, g-C 3 N 4 can absorb the photons with enough energy to generate the electron-hole pairs.Then, the photo-generated electrons tend to transfer from the conduction band of g-C 3 N 4 to amorphous carbon surface and Pt particles to cause protons reduction reaction, whereas the holes remain in the valence band of g-C 3 N 4 and react with sacrifice regents.As a result, the photocatalytic activity is remarkably improved.A synergy among efficient charge separation, prolonged charge carriers lifetime, increased specific surface area and harvested visible light, endows the enhanced performance for the amorphous carbon/g-C 3 N 4 composites with intimate interface."
