    "content": "Ag or Pt-deposited TiO 2 nanocomposites were prepared by a simple method, in which oriented TiO 2 nanorods were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and a noble metal (Ag or Pt) was deposited on TiO 2 by photocatalytic reduction under UV irradiation.The oriented TiO 2 nanorods with Ag or Pt nanoparticles (20 nm) exhibited high CO 2 photoreduction efficiency, with CH 4 yield rates up to 16.0 ppm/g h and 10.8 ppm/g h, respectively, considerably higher than that of the pure TiO 2 nanorods (4.2 ppm/g h).The improvement in the CH 4 yield was attributed to the formation of a Schottky barrier and surface plasmon resonance."

    "content": "Fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates (F: SnO The nanostructures of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S4800) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco MultiMode) operating in the tapping mode with a scan frequency of 1 Hz.X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on an X'Pert PRO equipped with Cu K radiation ( 0.1541 nm, scanning rate of 2 /min from 2A 20 to 80 ) to determine the crystal structures of the prepared samples.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with a VG ESCALAB Mark II instrument using Mg-K (1253.6 eV) as the excitation source.The C 1s peak (at 284.6 eV) was employed as an internal reference for the absolute binding energies of the XPS peaks.To determine the light absorption ability, the absorption spectra of the photocatalysts were detected by UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-vis, TU-1901, Beijing, China).The photoluminescence (PL) spectra measurements were carried out at room temperature on a FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) using a 325 nm UV xenon lamp as the excitation source.The yields of the photocatalytic experiments were automatically analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC/FID, Thermo-Fisher, Trace GC). The oriented TiO 2 nanorods were prepared by the hydrothermal method on FTO substrates, which were ultrasonically washed with a mixed solution of deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol with volume ratios of 1:1:1 for 60 min, and then dried in ambient conditions before use.The deionized water and concentrated hydrochloric acid were mixed with a volume ratio of 1:1 for a total volume of 480 mL, and then stirred for 15 min before the addition of 8 mL of tetrabutyl titanate.The solution was then stirred for 15 min at ambient conditions.The FTO substrates were placed at an angle against the wall of the Teflon-liner with the conduction side facing down.The hydrothermal method was performed at 120 C for 24 h in an electric oven.After the synthesis was completed, the FTO substrates were removed from the oven, rinsed completely with deionized water and dried overnight in ambient conditions. The composite TiO 2 nanorod catalysts decorated with noble metals (Pt or Ag) were prepared by photocatalytic reduction 20.The deposition of Ag and Pt nanoparticles on TiO 2 was conducted under a UV irradiation system consisting of four 8 W UVA lamps with an average intensity of 3.25 mW cm -2 (measured by UVX radiometer, UVP) and located above the quartz container at a distance of 25 cm.Prior to photodeposition, the solution was aerated by a N 2 (Air Products, 99.999) flow for 30 min in the dark, followed by illumination under the UV lamps for 3 h using N 2 as shielding gas during the reaction.The oriented TiO 2 nanorods (1 1 cm 2 ) were immersed in a solution of 2 g/L H 14 Cl 6 O 6 Pt and methanol aqueous mixture (volume ratios of 1:1) to reach a total volume of 25 mL as precursor and hole sacrifice agent, respectively.The samples were soaked in deionized water for 30 min, followed by washing with deionized water 3 times and drying at 80 C in an electric oven.The deposition of Ag on TiO 2 nanorods (1 1 cm 2 ) was conducted according to the above described procedure but with only 10 mM AgNO 3 solution (25 mL) as the precursor, with the absence of a hole sacrifice agent attributable to its stronger sensitivity to light, reacted for 30 min to prepare the TiO 2 Ag composite catalysts. The photocatalytic reduction experiments were performed as described in our previous papers 13,21.Compressed CO 2 (Air Products, 99.999) was used as the carbon source.The system for CO 2 photoreduction was contained in a self-assembled reactor with two quartz windows on both sides.In order to exclude air from the container, N 2 gas was flowed to the reactor for 30 min.The CO 2 flow, controlled by mass flow meters at a speed of 100 mL/min, was passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor for 30 min in the dark.The CO 2 flow was then decreased and maintained at 50 mL/min and held for another 30 min before data collection in darkness.The irradiation system was located on opposite sides of the quartz windows in two units and the samples were placed in the middle of the reactor.The concentrations of methane gas were recorded automatically by gas chromatography during the 8 h total reaction time.The output of methane was within the detection limits of the gas chromatography system (200 ppb).Thus, we adopted the CH 4 production per hour as a direct measure of activity toward CO 2 photocatalytic reduction with UV light (3.25 mW cm -2 ) at room temperature and ambient pressure."

    "content": "The cross-sectional morphologies of the as-prepared TiO 2 nanorods before and after deposition with Ag or Pt nanoparticles observed by SEM and the three-dimensional AFM images were shown in Figure 1.It is evident that the entire surface of the FTO substrate is very uniformly covered with the TiO 2 nanorods, all of approximately the same height and a highly oriented 1D structure, in the form of tetragonal nanorods of average diameter of 0.13 m and height of approximately 1 m.Significantly, there are plenty of active sites provided for photocatalytic reactions, which increase the effective surface area compared to that of a planar film 19.From the EDS pattern shown in Figure 1b,c, Ag and Pt element are detected, indicating the existence of deposited Ag and Pt nanoparticles, respectively.The Ag and Pt nanoparticles were obviously smaller in size (20 nm in diameter) as compared to the size of the oriented TiO 2 nanorods and highly dispersed on the nanorods. The XRD peaks of the modified TiO 2 catalysts were essentially the same as those of the pure TiO 2 sample, which corresponded to the rutile phase with the growth axes in the (1 0 1) and (0 0 2) directions observed in Figure 2 13,22.The (1 0 1) rutile phase as the active reduction site was observed, which has been ascribed to surface electron traps.However, diffraction peaks characteristic of Ag and Pt were not identified, which may due to the Ag and Pt nanoparticles being well dispersed on TiO 2 nanorods with small sizes neither enter the TiO 2 lattice, which is consistent with the SEM results 23,24. In order to monitor the chemical and electronic structures of the Ag and Pt nanoparticles on the oriented TiO 2 nanorods, XPS analysis was employed and the resulting high-resolution XPS spectra of the samples are shown in Figure 3.The binding energy peaks at 530.1 and 458.2 eV can be attributed to the chemical binding of the O 1s and Ti 2p3/2 states respectively in the TiO 2 nanorods, confirming the main major components of the samples.As shown in Figure 3b, the binding peaks at 368.2 and 374.2 eV correspond to the Ag 3d5/2 and 3d 3/2 electronic states of metallic silver, respectively, with a gap splitting between the 3d sub-bands of 6 eV.Considering the difference between the binding energies of Ag 0 (368.2eV), Ag (367.7 eV) and Ag 2 (367.3 eV), there were no peaks for oxidized silver corresponding to Ag 2 O or AgO observed in the full XPS spectra 15.Due to the electrostatic interaction between Pt and TiO 2 , the binding energy peaks at 75.8 and 72.5 eV corresponding to the electronic states 4f5/2 and 7/2 respectively of the Pt nanoparticles were slightly higher than those of the free Pt nanoparticles (74.5 and 71.2 eV, respectively), from which it can be inferred that electrons transit from TiO 2 to Pt 19,20,25.Thus, the XPS patterns together with the SEM images suggest that the Ag and Pt nanoparticles were deposited on the oriented TiO 2 nanorods 26. The photoluminescence emission spectra of semiconductor materials are closely related to their microstructures, through parameters such as electronic state, defect state, and energy level structure, all of which are useful for explaining the efficiency of trapping, migrating, and transferring of electron-hole pairs in nanostructured semiconductors 7,272829.The photoluminescence spectra of pure TiO 2 , Ag, and Pt decorated TiO 2 nanorods are shown in Figure 4.The fluorescence peaks of Ag or Pt decorated TiO 2 nanorods are essentially the same as those of the pure TiO 2 nanorods but with different intensities in the range of 400-500 nm, demonstrating that the presence of Ag and Pt atoms did not result in any new photoluminescence events.The lower photoluminescence intensities of the TiO 2 nanorods decorated with noble metal particles can be attributed to the lower recombination rate of those electron-hole pairs in the process of the charge transfer from the excited state to the ground state under light irradiation 30. The key factor for a photoelectrochemical process is optical absorption, which is also as the first step for the reduction of CO 2 .The UV-vis absorption spectra in Figure 5, which were measured to express the optical absorption properties of the photocatalysts, show that the TiO 2 nanorods were influenced by the decorating Ag and Pt nanoparticles, with the decorated nanorods exhibiting higher absorbance intensities in the region of 300-700 nm compared to the pure TiO 2 and hence predicted to show improved photocatalytic activity, compared to the pure TiO 2 30.We peel the samples off from the FTO substrate.The absorption spectra were recorded with a UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with an integrating sphere attachment using BaSO 4 as the reference.We can get the absorbance of the sample by using the formula of Kubelka-Munk.The spectra for the metal-decorated samples exhibited a slight red-shift of the absorption edge and a slightly higher absorption intensity in the visible region compared to the pure TiO 2 .These observations may arise from the phenomenon known as a localized surface plasmon resonance effect, which induces an electric field in metal nanoparticles, resulting in the separation of those negative and positive charge plasmas attributable to reducing electron-hole pair recombination and boosting the excitation of electron-hole pairs in the modified photocatalysts, as well as amplifying the optical response of TiO 2 7,17. The photoreduction of CO 2 was investigated to test the activity of the catalysts in the presence of H 2 O under UV irradiation 13.Figure 6 shows the photocatalytic results in terms of the CH 4 production rate on the various TiO 2 catalysts versus reaction time.The CH 4 production rate increased with irradiation time and remained almost steady after 4 h.Both Ag and Pt-deposited TiO 2 exhibited much higher CH 4 production rates (16.0 ppm/g h and 10.8 ppm/g h, respectively) than that of the pure TiO 2 (4.2 ppm/g h), demonstrating that the decorated TiO 2 nanorods possess highly enhanced photocatalytic activity.Therefore, the observed enhancement of photoactivity is in very good agreement with the experimental results of the PL intensities in Figure 4. In order to deepen the understanding of the photocatalytic activity, it is important to identify the charge transfer process at the interface of mental and TiO 2 31,32.When modified TiO 2 was exposed to UV irradiation, on one hand, the electrons can transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band to the noble metal conduction band due to the lower E f of the metal nanoparticles.Together with the holes accumulated in the TiO 2 valence band, a Schottky barrier can form at the interface, which forces the photo-generated electrons to be far away.In theory, the Pt deposited on the TiO 2 surface produces a higher Schottky barrier than that with deposited Ag, due to its maximum work function among the metals, which facilitates electron capture.However, the photocatalytic activity results go against this theory.In this sense, Wang 19 observed that the size of Pt nanoparticles can affect its Fermi level.On the other hand, the excited electrons in the metal nanoparticles below the Fermi level (E f ) may jump the surface plasmon states and leave positive charges below the E f , inducing an electric field in the metal nanoparticles.The coupling of two phases allows the reduction of recombination rate of electron-hole pairs and prolongs the lifetime of the charge carriers 4,10,30. During the photocatalytic process, CO 2 adsorbed on the TiO 2 catalyst surface reacts with electrons to produce carbon dioxide radicals ( CO 2 -) as the first step, which then react with H to form surface CH 2 radicals that ultimately form CH 4 (Figure 7) 10.The electrons accumulated at the metal nanoparticles or the conduction band of TiO 2 transfer to the adsorbed O 2 on the surface to form oxygen radicals ( O 2 -) and followed by protonation and combining with trapped electrons finally result in an active species, namely OH radicals, which are responsible for the lower recombination probability in TiO 2. The highly oriented nanorod morphology and crystal structure of the films provide an increased diffusion length for photo-generated electron-hole pairs and surface electron traps, which improve photocatalytic activity 19.The longer lifetime of the electrons results in a greater possibility for the appearance of the active species.These active species are possibly responsible for the significant promotion of the photocatalytic reduction process.Thus, a substantial increase of CH 4 yield as the main product was observed with the presence of the Ag or Pt atoms during CO 2 conversion to CH 4 30."
