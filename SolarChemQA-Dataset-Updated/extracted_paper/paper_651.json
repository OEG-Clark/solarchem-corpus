    "content": "2.1 Preparation of the SiO2SiO2 4.35 mL aqueous ammonia (32wt ) were put into mixed solution of 74 mL ethanol and 10 mL ultrapure water.5.6 mL TEOS were added to the above mixed solution with magnetic stirring after stirring 30 min at normal atmospheric temperature.Then the mixture were stirred for 1 h to form opal solution.The mixture containing 6.2 mL of TEOS and 3 mL of C18TMOS was added dropwise to the above opal solution with vigorous stirring.After stirring for 3 h, the product was collected, washed, dried at 60 C, and calcined at 550 C for 6 h in air.The prepared SiO2SiO2 templates include dense nucleus and loose shell, and the thickness of this shell can be adjusted by changing the amounts of TEOS and C18TMOS.The SiO2SiO2 template were neutralized with hydrochloric acid. 2 g prepared templates were diffuse into 9 mL cyanamide then stirred for 3 hours.Subsequently, the solution was exposed to ultrasound wave about 30 min at 60 C, then heated to 550 C under the flowing N2 for 4 h with a ramp rate of 5 C min -1 .The obtained yellow samples were ground for 10 min, and then g-C3N4 was diffuse into the loose shell. 0.4 g of the above prepared sample, 0.15 g L-cysteine and 1 g PVP were diffuse into 80 mL ultrapure water after the application of ultrasound wave for 30 min, and the mixture was treated by oil bath at 95 C. 10 mL 1 mmol Ce(NO3)36H2O and 10 mL 1 mmol HMTA aqueous solution were added into the above solution under the reflux.After stirring for 2 h, the mixture was cooled down to room temperature, washed several times and dried at 60 C. The products were heated at 550 C for 2 h under the flowing N2 with a ramp rate of 5 C min -1 .The products were dispersed in 30 mL 4 M NH4HF2 for 0.5 h to remove the template. The products were centrifuged, washed several time and dried at 60 C.Finally, g-C3N4CeO2 hollow structures were obtained after the samples were heated at 500 C for 6 h under H2.The g-C3N4 and hollow CeO2 with rich oxygen vacancies are fabricated as references with the same methods above.

    "content": "The XRD patterns of the synthesized g-C3N4CeO2 with different CeO2 contents, pristine g-C3N4 and hollow CeO2 references are shown in Figure 2a.As it can be seen, all peaks of the aforementioned products are readily indexed in CeO2 (PDF: 43-0394) and g-C3N4, suggesting the successful fabrication of g-C3N4CeO2 composites and no side-products formed during the synthesis process.The CeO2 contents in the prepared g-C3N4CeO2 composites are determined by the thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), as shown in Figure 2b, which are 4.7, 23.6, 35.0, 49.7 and 65.2 (wt ), respectively.It is noteworthy that the angle corresponding to (200) crystal face of CeO2 showed a little shift to those of Ce2O3, implying the H2 reduction leaded to more oxygen vacancies for the samples.Investigation of broadening corresponding to (111) peak according to Scherrer equation, displayed existing of small particles with the average size ca.3.5 nm, implying the reduced hollow g-C3N4CeO2 particles contained nanocrystal subunits.The g-C3N4 exhibits two distinct peaks at 27.5 and 13.1, which are assigned to the (002) and (100) interlayered reference.For the hybrids of g-C3N4CeO2, the patterns show the combination of two sets of diffraction results containing CeO2 and g-C3N4.With the increase of CeO2 loading, the intensity of g-C3N4 peaks becomes weaken. SEM images of the dense SiO2 template and SiO2SiO2 (dense nucleus loose shell) are shown as in Figure 3a andb.The prepared template and SiO2SiO2/g-C3N4 are uniformly nanospheres with average sizes of 300 nm and 400 nm.The hybrid SiO2SiO2/g-C3N4 shows a rough surface, where the g-C3N4 coating layer shows a thickness of around 50 nm, according to the broken particle as inserted in the Figure 3c.The split in some nanospheres might be caused by rapid mass-transport across the shells.The unique hollow core-shell structure of final product g-C3N4CeO2 (CeO2 49.7 wt ) are also investigated by SEM and TEM (Figure 3d-e).The visible hollow interior frame can be observed distinctly and the thickness of the shell can be calculated about 70 nm, which is thicker than that of pristine g-C3N4 resulted from the coupled CeO2 layers.The g-C3N4 displays an amorphous nature as expected, which is uniformly attached with CeO2.HRTEM micrograph (Figure 3f) of the surface of the sample also shows the lattice spacing of 0.28 nm and 0.31 nm, corresponding to the (200) and ( 111) plane spacing of CeO2, which is in agreement with XRD results.The individually synthesized CeO2 presents a nanoparticle aggregation as shown in Figure S1, which is not as dispersive as the prepared g-C3N4CeO2 product.The main reason could be attributed to the amino groups of g-C3N4 anchored Ce precursors, and meanwhile the existing electrostatic attraction between the negative charge g-C3N4 and the Ce cations is also beneficial for stabilizing the Ce source.Therefore, nucleation centers of Ce are dispersive and CeO2 presents confined growth with g-C3N4.The elemental mapping images (Figure 3g) ascertain the coexistence of Ce, C, N and O in the prepared hollow g-C3N4CeO2 products. The FTIR spectra of the prepared g-C3N4CeO2 with different concentrations are shown in Figure 4.The peaks ranged of 1240-1600 cm -1 can be assigned to the characteristic vibration peaks of C-N heterocyclics in g-C3N4.While the peaks under 1000 cm -1 are assigned to metaloxygen bond 25,26 .These results are in consistent with XRD analysis and previous reports 25- 30 . To investigate the surface composition and chemical state of the g-C3N4CeO2 hollow photocatalysts, XPS analyses of the g-C3N4CeO2 (CeO2 49.7 wt ) are shown in Figure 5. The survey XPS spectra (Figure 5a) provide the C 1s sand N 1s peaks for g-C3N4, as well as Ce 3d peak for CeO2.As shown in Figure 5b, the C 1s peak at 284.78 eV, which is assigned to sp 2 C-C bonds of graphitic carbon 31 .The peaks at 286.24 eV and 288.82 eV are attributed to N-CN and -excitation, respectively.These peaks show a slight shift to the higher energy compared with pristine g-C3N4, which trend is as the same as other reported results 32,33 .The N 1s spectra (Figure 5c) are deconvolved into two peaks at about 399.16 eV and 401.26 eV, which are corresponding to the SP 2 -hybridized nitrogen in N-CN groups and the amino function groups 33 .To confirm the state of Ce, the comparison of the fitted-resolution spectra of hollow g-C3N4CeO2 before and after H2 reduction is shown in Figure 5d.Both samples show various profile natures, which resulted in the deconvolution of peaks into, respectively, five and four doublets of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 spin-orbit couples of Ce 3d.The peaks for the g-C3N4CeO2 before H2 reduction are fitted at about 880.58 (Ce1), 882.38 (Ce2), 884.18/885.99 (Ce3), 888.96 (Ce4), 898.30(Ce5), 900.96 (Ce6), 902.86 (Ce7), 907.08 (Ce8), 916.70 (Ce9) eV.The peak of Ce( 6) should be assigned to the impurity in CeO2, which is in agreement with other reports 34,3637 .The spin orbit doublets for g-C3N4CeO2 before H2 reduction show main peaks at binding energies of 898.3eV (Ce5) and 916.7 eV (Ce9) for Ce 4 3d5/2 and Ce 4 3d3/2, respectively.The peaks located at binding energies of 902.86 eV (Ce7) and 882.38 eV (Ce2) can be attributed to Ce 3 3d3/2 and Ce 3 3d5/2, respectively.Two additional peaks at 907.08 eV and 888.96 eV are indicative of orbital \"shake-up\" of Ce 3 3d3/2 and Ce 3 3d5/2, respectively 383940 .In case of g-C3N4CeO2 after H2 reduction, the addition of Ce2O3 has brought about slight changes in the binding energy.The characteristic peaks of Ce 3 are found at 882.67 eV and 904.28 eV, due to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 spin orbit states.While for Ce 4 , the signals are observed at 898.89 eV (3d5/2), 917.16eV (3d3/2) 404142 .The weak peaks of Ce (3) 884.18 and 885.99 eV should be assigned to the Ce 3 , merged together a strong peak after H2 reduction.The peak areas of Ce (3) distinctly enhance and the peak stations shift to a higher value after H2 reduction because the partial Ce 4 is reduced to Ce 3 .Therefore, the 3 improves and the decreased charges in valence band enhance the binding energy 343543 . The N adsorption/desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution of the obtained g-C3N4CeO2 (CeO2 49.7 wt ) product is shown in Figure 6.The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of pristine hollow g-C3N4 and CeO2 are shown in Figure S2 and S3 in Supporting Information.The isotherm is identified as type IV, which is the characteristic isotherm of mesoporous materials.The BET surface area of g-C3N4CeO2 (CeO2 49.7 wt ) product is 125.1 m 2 g -1 , which is larger than most of currently reported g-C3N4 and CeO2 based photocatalysts and is beneficial for CO2 adsorption.Therefore, this unique hollow structured heterojunction is expected to be favorable for enhanced reduction of CO2 in the process of photocatalytic reaction. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is well suited to examine the nature of the oxidation state (Ce 4 /Ce 3 ) of CeO2 nanostructures, which exhibits weak room temperature ferromagnetism.Therefore, we analyzed the EPR spectrum at room temperature with a 100 kHz modulation frequency as shown in Figure 7. EPR spectrum detected obvious signals for the oxygen vacancy of CeO2 after H2 reduction, whereas the CeO2 before H2 reduction exhibited the weak EPR signals.The previous reports prove that the EPR detection of Ce 3 ions in CeO2 relates mainly to the line with g 1.97 at room and up to very high temperatures 36 , which is not typical for rare-earth ions and rather close to the g value of cubic site position of Ce 3 in CeO2 particles.The trigonal site of the Ce 3 ion can be easy realized near an oxygen vacancy 3435363743 . The pepared hollow g-C3N4CeO2 hybrid structures showed the obvious single EPR signal, belonging to oxygen vacancies, while weak EPR signal appears in the case of CeO2 samples before H2 reduction.Therefore, EPR showed that the hollow g-C3N4CeO2 hybrid structures have characteristic oxygen vacancies, which could impart visible light-induced photocatalytic activity 3435363738 . We analyze the formation of g-C3N4CeO2 hollow structures, illustrated in Figure 1.Briefly, SiO2 (compact)SiO2 (loose) acted as template as shown Figure 2b.The silica is etched by NH4HF2 after the formation of SiO2g-C3N4CeO2.Subsequently, a high-temperature H2 reducing process was applied for fabricating the hollow g-C3N4CeO2 photocatalysts with rich oxygen vacancies.Our strategy provides a general designed route to fabricate hollow structured g-C3N4 based photocatalysts and this designed strategy can also be used to prepare other advanced yolk-shell materials, such as g-C3N4SnS (Figure S4) and g-C3N4TiO2 (Figure S5).All of them show excellent performance in the field of environmental catalysis and energy storage. UV-Vis absorption band edges of products of pristine g-C3N4, CeO2 and g-C3N4CeO2 coupled photocatalysts contained CeO2 concentration of 4.7, 23.6, 35.0, 49.7 and 65.2 (wt ) samples are shown in Figure 8. UV-Vis absorption band edges of the samples with CeO2 concentration of 41.2, 45.6 and 55.2 are listed in Figure S6 (Supporting Information).The visible photoabsorption intensity enhanced prominently with the increase of the content of CeO2.Particularly, the g-C3N4CeO2 (CeO2 49.7 wt ) presents the significant red shift.The band energy (Eg value) of hollow g-C3N4, and hollow CeO2 are 2.70 and 2.93 by Tauc relation, respectively.So, they can be promisingly acted as visible light photocatalysts.Narrowing in the band gap of the prepared CeO2 and g-C3N4 occurs because of the formation of hollow structure, which is supported by XPS studies and also in good conformity with other researches 24252627282930 .The band gap narrowing displays more efficient utilization of solar spectrum and consequently more photoinduced charge generation to exert superior photocatalytic performance. The maximum CO2 adsorption capabilities of the CeO2, g-C3N4 and g-C3N4CeO2 (CeO2 49.7 wt ) are 0.25, 0.16, and 0.31 mol g -1 as illustrated Table 1, revealing the g- C3N4CeO2 (Ce 49.7 wt ) exhibits the highest value in the three samples.The enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity plays an important role in the conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons 6,44 .The L-cysteine offered the amine groups and meanwhile anchored on the surface of g-C3N4 during the synthesis process, and thus contributes greatly to the enhanced CO2 adsorption performance.In fact, this pathway has been widely adopted to improve the CO2 adsorption capacity of materials because of their large content of alkalinity 45 .The photocatalytic CO2 reduction is conducted with a 420 nm cutoff filter as the visible light source.The results show that no hydrocarbons can be detected in the absence of photocatalysts or irradiation, indicating that effective photocatalysts and illumination are two essential factors for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.The photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4, CeO2, g-C3N4CeO2 for CO2 reduction under visible-light irradiation are shown in Figure 9a. The main photocatalytic products are important storable fuels of CO, CH3OH and CH4.The reduction products of CH3OH and CH4 involved more electrons transfer and relative energies according to Table S1.The evolution rate of the CO is significantly faster than that of other products, which is ascribed to a faster kinetics of their reduction reactions.Therefore, the relative reaction is more difficult to be occurred compared with CO. (seeing Suporting Information) The analysis of apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is shown in Supporting Information.The change of CH4 of 4 h photoreaction under different monochromatic light wavelengths at 525 nm were measured as reference, because the CH4 production is most difficult and its efficiency is the lowest in the reduction products.The energy flux (mW cm -2 ) of the Xe lamp was measured with a calibrated Si photodiode, and the photon flux absorbed by photocatalyst was obtained by dividing the energy flux by the energy of a photon with a wavelength of 525 nm.The apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE) was measured to be around It is noticed that the CH4 is not detected in the photocatalytic reduction products for individual hollow CeO2 with oxygen vacancies, and the yields of CO and CH3OH are 5.3 and 3 mol g -1 , respectively.Though the pristine hollow g-C3N4 exhibits lower BET surface areas, weaker CO2 adsorption capacity compared with CeO2, it shows better CO2 reduction effect with the yields of CH4 and CH3OH are 1.8 and 3.1 mol g -1 , implying the hollow g-C3N4 possesses intrinsic preeminent charge separation and transfer effect for the photoexcitation during the CO2 photocatalytic reduction.However, the relative high CB position and rapid electron-hole recombination of CeO2 alone should be responsible for its inferior reduction ability of CO2.Particularly, the hollow g-C3N4CeO2 hybrids exhibit obviously enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction.With the increase of CeO2 content, the reduction performance of CO2 remarkably increases and subsequently decreases.The g-C3N4CeO2 (Ce 49.7 wt ) delivered the highest yields of CH4 (3.5 mol g -1 ), CH3OH (5.2 mol g -1 ) and CO (16.8 mol g -1 ), which are higher than most of other latest reported g-C3N4 based photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction including coupled with semiconductors and noble metal cocatalysts 24252627282930 . To demonstrate the CH4 and CO are derived from CO2, three control experiments and an isotopic experiment with 13 CO2 were conducted: (1) experiment with g-C3N4CeO2, CO2 and water, but without light irradiation; (2) experiment with CO2, water and light irradiation, but without g-C3N4CeO2; and (3) experiment with g-C3N4CeO2, water, and light irradiation, but without CO2.No appreciable amounts of CO and CH4 are detected in all of the three control experiments, implying that CO and CH4 are generated by the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 on the g-C3N4CeO2.In the isotopic experiment using 13 CO2, the generated products are analysed as 13 CO and 13 CH4 by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Additionally, the Ar is employed to replace CO2 while keeping the other experimental conditions are the same as those for CO2 reduction, and no CO and CH4 are detected, which further demonstrates that CO and CH4 are derived from the photocatalytic CO2 reduction on g-C3N4CeO2. Because the photocatalytic reductions to generate CH4 and CH3OH are more difficult to be occurred compared with CO, we analysis the course of products of CH4 and CH3OH with different reaction time to investigate the photocatalytic mechanism under visible light as shown Figure 9b-d.For hollow g-C3N4, both CH3OH and CH4 generate initially under visible light irradiation.While for hollow CeO2, only CH3OH is detected from the initial time, however, the CH4 is not detected during the whole testing period.As for g-C3N4CeO2 (CeO2 49.7 wt ), both CH3OH and CH4 generate in the beginning.Particularly, the content of CH4 and CH3OH continuously increases obviously with the time prolongation and the yield even arrives at as high as 2.8 and 4.6 mol g -1 , respectively.These values are much higher than that of pristine hollow g-C3N4 and CeO2.With regard to the different results of the samples corresponding to different rations for CO2 reduction, many factors should be responsible for the photocatalytic activity.According to the analysis above, among these influencing factors, the size, morphology and specific surface area are almost the same. Additionally, the maximum CO2 adsorption capabilities of g-C3N4CeO2 is no higher than that of CeO2 significantly.Therefore, it can be assumed that the g-C3N4CeO2 heterojunctions and oxygen vacancies play the major roles in the photocatalytic reduce reaction.In fact, g-C3N4 exists the visible light response range and has higher photocatalytic activity compared with CeO2.However, the separation efficiency of photoinduced electronhole pairs of g-C3N4 is poor.CeO2 can more effectively inhibit the recombination of photoinduced charge carrier pairs compared with g-C3N4.The two semiconductors have suitable band potential and can form the hetero-junction structure to suppress the recombination of electron-hole pairs.More content of CeO2 implies more amounts of CeO2 existing g-C3N4CeO2 heterojunctions, which can well explain why the photocatalytic efficiency improved with increasing of CeO2 content.However, it doesn't mean that the higher CeO2 content loads, the better photocatalytic performance can be obtained.The high contents of CeO2 on the surface of g-C3N4CeO2 heterojunctions may hinder light irradiation A N U S C R I P T on g-C3N4 and limit the mutual contact between CO2 and g-C3N4.So further increasing the content of CeO2 leads to decreased photocatalytic efficiency.Meanwhile, more g-C3N4 in the g-C3N4CeO2 is also not beneficial for the photocatalytic performance.The main reason is that too low CeO2 in the heterojunctions may confine interfacial electron transfer from g-C3N4 to CeO2.So the reduction efficiency of CO2 decreases if the content of g-C3N4 is excessive loading according to Figure 9a.Therefore, an appropriate composition of g-C3N4CeO2 heterojunctions accomplishes the satisfied photocatalytic performance, and the g-C3N4CeO2 (CeO2 49.7 wt ) presents the best photocatalytic activity.Based on the results above, it is reasonable that the photoinduced electrons transfer to and accumulate on the CeO2 surface, resulting in the generation of CH4.The generation of CH4 needs much more electrons compared with the formation of CH3OH.As for g-C3N4CeO2 photocatalyst, the synergetic effect of mutual activations should be responsible for the effectively gathering of the photoinduced electrons, leading to generate CH4 much earlier and higher concentration than that of the pristine g-C3N4.Meanwhile, the rate of CH4 formation becomes fast with illumination time prolongation. The interactions between the g-C3N4 and CeO2 contribute greatly to the separation electronhole pairs and thus has significant effect on its photocatalytic activity.Therefore, Photoluminescence (PL) spectra is applied to prove the enhanced separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs as shown in Figure 10.The pristine hollow g-C3N4 shows a strong emission peak centered at about 460 nm, which is ascribed to the recombination of selftrapped excitons.The emission band becomes lower with the increasing content of CeO2.The enhanced separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs leads to the decrease of peak intensity. The g-C3N4CeO2 (CeO2 49.7 wt ) presents the best separation efficiency, which is coincided well with the photocatalytic performance.Surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS, Figure 11) is performed to further investigate the enhanced separation efficiency of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs.In principle, the strong SPS response is in line with the high separation efficiency of the photo-induced carriers on the basis of the SPS technology 46 . From Figure 11, all the samples exhibit relative obvious SPS signal in visible light region, and the g-C3N4CeO2 (CeO2 49.7 wt ) displays the most intensive SPS responses.These results imply that the heterostructure of g-C3N4CeO2 is beneficial to improve the separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers. Based on the above analysis and combined with the former calculated band energy (Eg value) of samples, the transfer pathway of photoinduced carriers is presented in Figure 12, which shows the schematic illustration of band structure diagram of g-C3N4CeO2.The Eg of g-C3N4 and CeO2 is 2.7 and 2.93 eV.The VB edges of CeO2 and g-C3N4 are calculated as 2.47 and 1.45 eV 29 .The valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were measured using PHI5000 Veras Probe instrument.The 2.40 eV and 1.52 eV are corresponding to the VB position of CeO2 and g-C3N4 as shown in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information, respectively, which is near the analysis above.So that, the CB potentials of CeO2 and g-C3N4 are calculated as -0.46 and -1.25 eV according to ECBEVB-Eg, which values are more negative than the reduction potentials of the formation of CH4, CH3OH and CO.However, the CH4 has not been detected in the products for the CeO2 alone even after 3 h, implying the accumulation and extraction of photoinduced electrons are not offered because of fast charge recombination.For the g-C3N4CeO2 composites, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 will migrate to that of the CeO2 while the holes generated in the CeO2 transfer to the VB of the g-C3N4.Such interfacial electron transfer consequently promotes the separation of electron-hole pairs leading to accumulation of electron-hole pairs with longer life-times over the g-C3N4CeO2.At the CB of CeO2, CO2 are reduced to CO, CH3-OH and CH4 by accumulated photoinduced electrons (e -).Meanwhile, the accumulated holes (h ) on the g-C3N4 will lead to partial oxidation of Ce 3 to Ce 4 (1.44 vs. NHE, at pH7), and the photogenerated h has an important role in prolonging the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers in g-C3N4CeO2 system via converting Ce 3 to Ce 4 26 .It can be noticed to generate CO2 -, which can be further reduced to CO and CH4 474849 .Therefore, g-C3N4 coupled with CeO2 with rich oxygen vacancies photocatalysts can preserve their strong reducibility and promote the photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation.In addition, the synthesized pristine g-C3N4 and CeO2 might also facilitate the photo electronhole recombination due to the narrow energy band gap, leading to the decreased quantum efficiency, and thus exhibits lower photocatalytic activity compared with g-C3N4CeO2. Moreover, the unique hollow structure can make multiple reflections of light in the cavity, and which enhanced the light utilization.The large BET surface areas are also beneficial for the enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.These results indicate that the present hollow g-C3N4CeO2 structures are promising as a broad visible light-harvesting photocatalyst."
