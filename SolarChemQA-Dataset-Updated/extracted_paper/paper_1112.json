    "content": "Z-scheme heterojunction can effectively separate photo-generated carriers and enhance photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction.In this work, we report indirect Z-scheme heterojunction of UiO-66-NH 2 /Cu 2 O/Cu, which achieves highly CO 2 photocatalytic conversion to CO.Among these, UiO-66-NH 2 /Cu 2 O/Cu-0.39(U/C/Cu-0.39)displays the best activity with a CO yield of 4.54 molg -1 h -1 , which is 37.8 times higher than that for UiO-66-NH 2 and 50.4 times higher than that for Cu 2 O. Cu not only acts as the electron conductor of the indirect Z-scheme heterojunction to promote the charge carrier transmission, but also acts as the active site of CO 2 reduction.The increase of active sites and the CO 2 adsorption capacity results in the superior photocatalytic performances."

    "content": "The crystal structures of the samples were analyzed with a BRUKER D8 ADVANCE X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) with the scan range of 5-80 and the scan speed of 5 /min (Cu K radiation).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the oxidation state of the photocatalyst by Thermo Fisher Scientific (Escalab 250Xi) equipped with a Mg K source (The binding energy of C1s was set at 284.8 eV as a reference).Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) were performed on FEI Quanta FEG 250.Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and mapping was also employed for elemental analysis and their distribution which was attached to the SEM.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were analyzed on JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at 200 kV.The amount of Cu and Zr were determined by an Agilent 720 inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-OES).The Cu 2 O were prepared according to a previously reported method 34.The preparation process of Cu 2 O were displayed in Scheme 1a.For the synthesis of Cu 2 O, 8 mL of CuSO 4 5H 2 O (0.68 M) and 7.2 g PVP was dissolved into 136 mL of deionized (DI) water.The mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 20 min, and then 8 mL of Na 3 C 6 H 5 O 7 2H 2 O (0.74 M) and 8 mL of Na 2 CO 3 (1.2M) was added in dropwise manner in sequence.After 10 min, 8 mL of C 6 H 12 O 6 (1.4 M) was slowly dropped into this solution.The solution was heated at 80 C for 2 h and then cooled to room temperature.The resulting reactant was aged for 7 days in air.The orange precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water and ethanol alternately several times.Finally, the product was vacuum dried at 60 C for 6 h. UiO-66-NH 2 were synthesized according to the literature with a little modification 35.0.0467 g ZrCl 4 and 0.0363 g ATA were added to 20.42 mL of DMA to obtain solution A. Then, 7.8 mL of acetic acid was Scheme 1.The preparation process of Cu 2 O and U/C/Cu.added to solution A and stirred for 1 h room temperature.Subsequently, the mixture was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 120 C for 12 h.The white product was obtained by centrifugation, washed with DMF and methanol and dried under vacuum at 80 C for h. The preparation process of U/C/Cu were displayed in Scheme 1b.0.2 g Cu 2 O and 0.0467 g ZrCl 4 were added to 20.42 mL of DMA and stirred for 30 min to obtain solution A. After that, 0.0363 g ATA was added to solution A, followed by an ultrasonic treatment for 10 min.Then, 7.8 mL of acetic acid was added to solution A. The mixture was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 120 C for h.Finally, the pink product, namely U/C/Cu-0.23,was obtained by centrifugation, washed with DMF and methanol and dried under vacuum at 80 C for 6 h.The addition amount of the composite photocatalyst raw material is shown in Table 1.In addition, we have prepared U/C-0.39, that was, no acetic acid was added during the synthesis process. Photocatalytic CO 2 reductions tests were carried out at 20 C in a gasclosed quartz reactor, containing 50.0 mg photocatalyst and 100 mL H 2 O as the proton source under UV-vis irradiation (300 W Xe lamp) for 4 h.The reaction system was stirred with a magnetic stirrer and bubbled with high-purity CO 2 (99.999) in the dark at least 20 min before light illumination.In the process of photocatalytic reaction, gas product of the CO 2 photo reduction was detected by gas chromatograph (GC5890, FID detector with reformer, Nanjing Kejie instrument) every hour.The temperatures for FID, an injection and oven temperature were 200, and 60 C, respectively, and retention time of CO is 1.2 min.The 13 isotopic labelling was confirmed using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Agilent, 7890B-5977B). The experimental details were described in supporting information file."

    "content": "As shown in Fig. S1a, wide-angle X-ray diffraction showed broad peaks at 29.6, 36.5, 42.4,61.5, 73.7 and 77.6 , which were characteristic of Cu 2 O (JCPDS:05-0667) 36.The XRD pattern of pure UiO-66-NH 2 was in good agreement with the simulated from the single crystal data (Fig. S1b).In addition, the XRD peaks of U/C/Cu-X (X 0.23, 0.39 and 0.55) could be well matched with Cu 2 O and UiO-66-NH 2 , indicating the successful synthesis of U/C/Cu-X composites (Fig. 1).With the increase of UiO-66-NH 2 content, the intensity of the UiO-66-NH 2 diffraction peak increases gradually between 5 and 10 in the complex.Beyond that, we found that the diffraction peaks in 43.2 and 50.4 could be well indexed to Cu (JCPDS:04-0836) 37.This was because acetic acid reduced part of Cu 2 O to Cu during the synthesis process.We found that in the XRD pattern of U/C-0.39,there were only the diffraction peaks of Cu 2 O and UiO-66-NH 2 , and there was no diffraction peak of Cu (43.2 and 50.4 ), indicating that acetic acid was the cause of the formation of Cu. The chemical states and element composition of Cu 2 O, UiO-66-NH 2 and U/C/Cu-0.39were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).Fig. 2a displayed the survey spectrum of Cu 2 O, UiO-66-NH 2 and U/C/Cu-0.39,which proved U/C/Cu-0.39was made up of C, N, O, Zr and Cu.And C, N, O, Zr and Cu had atomic percentages of 52.45, 5.84, 35.19, 4.64, and 1.88, respectively.The proportions of organic element in U/C/Cu-0.39were listed in Table S1.In Fig. 2b, the curves in the Zr 3d region of U/C/Cu-0.39could be fitted to two peaks for Zr 3d 3/2 and Zr 3d 5/2 located at 185.2 and 182.8 eV, respectively 38,39.Compared with UiO-66-NH 2 (185.3 and 183 eV), the Zr peaks of U/C/Cu-0.39shifted to lower binding energy.The N 1s pattern of UiO-66-NH 2 showed one peak at 399.9 eV, corresponding to amino group 39 (Fig. 2c).Besides, the peak of U/C/Cu-0.39located at 399.7 eV also revealed a slightly shift when compared with the peak of UiO-66- NH 2 .The XPS Cu 2p spectra of U/C/Cu-0.39showed two fitted peaks located at 932.9 and 952.8 eV, which were attributed to the Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 orbits, respectively 40 (Fig. 2d).Because XPS cannot distinguish the binding energy from Cu(0) and Cu(I) well, the existence of Cu(0) cannot be determined by XPS results.However, the coexistence of Cu(0) and Cu(I) was proved by Auger spectrum (inset in Fig. 2d).The peaks located at 568.48 and 570.18 eV were respectively ascribed to Cu (0) and Cu(I) 37,41, which further confirmed the coexistence of Cu and Cu 2 O in the heterojunction.Meantime, in order to determine the existence form of Cu in Cu 2 O, Auger spectrum of Cu 2 O was measured (Fig. S2).There was only a peak at 569.6 eV which was assigned to Cu(I).The above results indicated that Cu(0) appeared in the synthesis process and was not formed due to the reduction of Cu 2 O sample itself.Importantly, the peaks of U/C/Cu-0.39shifted to higher binding energy when compared with the two peaks of Cu 2 O located at 932 and 951.8 eV.The above results show that the electron cloud density of Zr and N increased while the electron cloud density of Cu decreased.Hence, there was strong electronic interaction between UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O, which can be attributed to Cu 2 O as the electron donor and Zr as the electron acceptor in U/C/Cu-0.39. The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared samples were characterized by SEM and TEM.The SEM image of Cu 2 O revealed a polyhedron structure with an average diameter of about 1.5 m (Fig. 3a).In Fig. 3b, UiO-66-NH 2 showed an octahedron morphology and the particle size of these octahedron were mainly distributed in the range of 0.7-0.9m.On account of the in-situ deposition of UiO-66-NH 2 on the Cu 2 O surface, more particles appeared on the surface of Cu 2 O (Fig. 3c).In addition, the Cu 2 O in the SEM images of U/C/Cu-0.39trend to be brighter, because Cu 2 O can scatter the incident electrons more effectively.In order to further confirm the existence of UiO-66-NH 2 , SEM-EDX analysis was carried out for U/C/Cu-0.39.EDX mapping images displayed that the elements of Cu, Zr, O, C and N are uniformly distributed in the whole U/C/Cu-0.39sample (Fig. S3).The TEM and HRTEM images of U/C/Cu-0.39were shown in Fig. 4. A layer of Cu was attached to the surface of the Cu 2 O (Fig. 4a).Further observations by HRTEM proved that the lattice fringes with d-spacing of 0.24 nm and 0.20 nm belonged to Cu 2 O and Cu, respectively 31 and UiO-66-NH 2 , Cu 2 O, and Cu were in close contact (Fig. 4b).The element mapping of U/ Visible absorption capacity of Cu 2 O, UiO-66-NH 2 and U/C-X (X 0.23, 0.39, 0.55) was measured by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS).As can be seen from Fig. 5a andb, the Cu 2 O exhibited a strong absorption edge at about 670 nm, and the band gap was calculated to be 1.87 eV via analyzing the relationship between (h) 2 and photon energy used as Tauc plots 42.UiO-66-NH 2 possessed an absorption edge of about 450 nm and the calculated band energy of UiO-66-NH 2 was 2.85 eV (Fig. 5c).Moreover, UiO-66-NH 2 displayed strong UV absorption because of transition of organic ligands 43.For U/C/Cu-X (X 0.23, 0.39 and 0.55), the absorption edges were occurred to redshifted than that of UiO-66-NH 2 and absorption intensity of visible light was significantly enhanced, which was mainly due to the effect of Cu 2 O.In addition, the band gap of U/C/Cu-0.23,U/C/Cu-0.39and U/C/ Cu-0.55 were 2.83, 2.79 and 2.71 eV, respectively (Fig. 5df).The valence band (VB) positions of UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O were further calculated using XPS wide spectra (Fig. S4).The VB positions were determined to be 3.12(vs.NHE) and 1.17 eV (vs.NHE) for UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O, respectively.Conduction band (CB) positions of UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O were calculated from the empirical formula (E CB E VB -E g ) 44, which the corresponding CB positions were 0.27 and -0.7 eV vs. NHE, respectively. The photocatalytic reaction was carried out over different photocatalysts in 100 mL of H 2 O without the addition of any sacrificial reagents.The CO evolution over the photocatalysts were expressed in Fig. 6.The pristine Cu 2 O and UiO-66-NH 2 displayed relative low CO production rate of 0.09 and 0.12 molh -1 g -1 , respectively.The yield of CO on U/C/Cu-X (X 0.23, 0.39 and 0.55) showed different degrees of improvement.U/C/Cu-0.39showed the highest photocatalytic activity among all photocatalysts (4.54 molh -1 g -1 ).Compared with UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O, the performance in CO production rate for U/C/Cu-0.39was increased by nearly 36.8-fold and 49.4-fold, respectively.Table S1 summarized the CO 2 conversion efficiency in the reported literatures related to UiO-66-NH 2 based photocatalysts or Cu 2 O photocatalysts 26,30,45,46.We found that coupling UiO-66-NH 2 with Cu 2 O/Cu could play a good role in photoreduction of CO 2 .The U/C-0.39 was also tested for photoreduction of CO 2 under the same condition.The productivity of CO of the U/C-0.39 was also higher than that of the UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O, while it was significantly lower than U/C/Cu-0.39.Hence, Cu as active site played a vital role in the process of photoreduction of CO 2 .At the same time, in order to explore the role of UiO-66-NH 2 , we prepared C/Cu without UiO-66-NH 2 under the same conditions (Table 1) and studied its photoreduction performance of CO 2 .The photocatalytic activity of C/Cu was higher than that of Cu 2 O, but it was much lower than U/C/Cu-X, indicating that UiO-66-NH 2 also played an irreplaceable role in the photocatalytic process.The amount of Cu and Zr at U/C/Cu-0.39 before and after the photocatalytic reaction was also measured by ICP technology, and it was found that the amount of Cu loss was negligible (Table S2).In addition, when the content of UiO-66-NH increased, it was conducive to the generation of CO, which may be because UiO-66-NH 2 enhanced the adsorption of CO 2 .However, when the content of UiO-66-NH 2 was too high, the production of CO would decrease, which may be caused by too much UiO-66-NH 2 covering the active site.The comparison experimental results were shown in Fig. S5.When the reaction was carried out under dark conditions, there were no products indicating that the conversion of CO 2 to CO was a light-induced process.When there was no photocatalyst in the reaction system, the photoreduction CO 2 reaction stopped completely, which indicated that the photocatalyst was indispensable.In addition, under the same experimental conditions, if N 2 was used instead of CO 2 , CO cannot be detected, indicating that the reaction produces CO from CO 2 .In order to verify the role of h in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , we also tested the oxygen yield on U/C/Cu-0.39 in the photocatalytic process.With the increase of the photocatalytic reaction time, the amount of O increased, indicating that the h did indeed react with H 2 O to produce O 2 (Fig. S6a).To further confirm the source of CO, the 13 C-labeled isotopic test was conducted.The result displayed CO 2 was the carbon source of CO (Fig. S6b). In addition, cyclic experiments were carried out to further discuss its stability (Fig. S7).After three cycles, the CO yield decreased from 4.54 to 2.97 molh -1 g -1 .In order to investigate the reasons for the performance degradation, the U/C/Cu-0.39before and after the reaction were characterized by SEM (Fig. S8).No significant changes were found in SEM before and after the reaction, so we studied the XRD patterns (Fig. 1).Firstly, the intensity of the characteristic peak belonging to UiO-66-NH 2 between 5 and 10 had dropped significantly.Secondly, the characteristic peaks belonging to Cu 2 O had the same trend as the characteristic peaks of UiO-66-NH 2 .In addition, we found that the intensity of the diffraction peaks at 43.2 and 50.4 increased after the reaction.Therefore, Cu 2 O would be gradually photo-corroded to produce Cu in the process of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .XPS was used to characterize the Cu valence of U/C/Cu-0.39before and after the reaction (Fig. S9).The peak of Cu 2P moved to the lower binding energy, illustrating that Cu 2 O in U/C/Cu-0.39would be reduced to Cu(0) 30.This corresponded to the XRD results. Larger specific surface area is conducive to the adsorption of more CO 2 molecules.The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms was applied to evaluate the surface area of Cu 2 O, UiO-66-NH 2 and U/C/Cu-0.39.And HK and BJH methods were applied to evaluate pore size distribution.As shown in Fig. S10a, there were mesopores in Cu 2 O.However, UiO-66-NH 2 had a typical microporous structure, revealing one major pore at 0.5 nm.And U/C/Cu-0.39inherited the microporous structure of UiO-66-NH 2 (Fig. S10c) 47.The specific BET surface area of UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O were 448.04 and 1.96 m 2 g -1 , respectively (Fig. 7a).U/C/Cu-0.39inherited the characteristics of UiO-66-NH 2 with a large specific surface area.Compared with Cu 2 O, the specific surface area of U/C/Cu-0.39had been greatly improved, reaching 68.62 m 2 g -1 .This indicates that UiO-66-NH 2 in U/C/Cu-0.39made a major contribution to the improvement of CO 2 adsorption.To further prove this point, we carried out physical adsorption of CO 2 on Cu 2 O and U/C/Cu-0.39at room temperature.As shown in Fig. 7b, the CO 2 adsorption performance of U/ C/Cu-0.39 was much higher than that of Cu 2 O, which may be because the amino group in UiO-66-NH 2 increases CO 2 absorption.Therefore, more CO 2 molecules reacted with the photogenerated electrons on the active site, thereby increasing the yield of CO. The photoluminescence and photochemical characteristics of the samples were further studied for revealing the charge separation ability.Fig. S11a showed the steady-state PL emission spectra of UiO-66-NH 2 , Cu 2 O and the U/C/Cu-0.39.It was observed that the UiO-66-NH 2 exhibited a strong emission at 453 nm, which demonstrated UiO-66-NH 2 had a high electron-hole pair recombination rate 48.Interestingly, compared with UiO-66-NH 2 , the Cu 2 O exhibited the lower PL intensity at 468 nm, indicating the efficient charge separation efficiency.Even though Cu 2 O had good charge separation efficiency, the photo-corrosive of Cu 2 O still prevented it from effectively reducing CO 2 49.Importantly, U/C/Cu-0.39showed the weakest emission peak, proved heterojunction suppressed photogenerated carrier recombination.Carrier lifetime plays an important role in photocatalytic reactions 50.Therefore, the time-resolved PL spectra of UiO-66-NH 2 , Cu 2 O and the U/ C/Cu-0.39 were recorded in Fig. S11b.The U/C/Cu-0.39 showed the longest lifetime (1.812 ns), while UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O showed shorter lifetimes (0.693 and 1.223 ns), respectively.Longer carrier life can imply better photocatalytic activity 51.Fig. 8a showed the photocurrent excitation pattern of UiO-66-NH 2 , Cu 2 O and the U/C/Cu-0.39under 300 W Xe lamp.U/C/Cu-0.39gave rise to higher transient photocurrent than pure UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O, indicating that U/C/Cu-0.39had better charge separation efficiency and showing better photocatalytic performance 52.In order to further confirm this inference, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of corresponding samples were also carried out (Fig. 8b).Clearly, U/C/Cu-0.39showed smallest semicircle in the Nyquist diagram, demonstrating charge transfer resistance at the contact interface between the U/C/Cu-0.39and the electrolyte solution was lowest 53.Hence, U/C/Cu-0.39possessed faster charge transfer, which was consistent with the results of PL and photocurrent, as well as the results of photocatalytic performance. In order to evaluate the mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , electron spin resonance (ESR) analyses were used to detect the generated radicals with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as spin-trapping agent 54,55.In the dark, DMPO/OH and DMPO/O 2 signals cannot be detected for U/C/Cu-0.39(Fig. 9).As shown in Fig. 9a, .This demonstrated that U/C/Cu-0.39had a better ability to generate superoxide radicals.The results were coincided with ESR analyses.Importantly, electronic mediator played an important role in indirect Z-scheme heterojunction.According to the literature, when the Fermi energy level of electronic mediator was between the Fermi energy level of two semiconductors, electrons would be transmitted through the Z-scheme mechanism 57.Therefore, the work function () of UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O were recorded by UPS (Fig. S13).The work function values of UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O can be calculated as 0.12 and -0.44 eV vs vacuum, respectively.And Fermi energy level (E f ) of UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O were -0.12 and 0.44 eV vs vacuum, respectively.In addition, the E f of Cu was 0.15 eV 57, which was between the E f of UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O.The above results declared that the band bending caused by the matching Fermi level structure facilitated the transmission of electrons through the Z-scheme mechanism. Taking into account the band position of individual components and ESR results, an indirect Z-scheme mechanism of charge migration was proposed and illustrated in Fig. 10.In the process of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , the generation of CO required two conditions, namely two electrons and a reduction potential of -0.52 eV.Therefore, when the catalyst had a suitable CB position and a suitable number of electrons, it would be beneficial to form CO. For U/C/Cu-0.39, the synergistic effect of Z-type heterojunction and Cu enhanced the conversion of CO 2 to CO.Under UV-vis light illumination, the photogenerated electrons from the CB of UiO-66-NH 2 were transferred to the interface of the composite material, while the presence of Cu could capture charge carriers and promote the accelerated electron transfer to VB of Cu 2 O, which greatly inhibited the recombination of charge carriers.The electrons accumulated at the CB of Cu 2 O were transferred to Cu used as an electron capture agent and active site, so the conversion of CO became easier and the yields were improved."

    "content": "In this report, UiO-66-NH 2 /Cu 2 O/Cu indirect Z-scheme heterojunction was prepared through the coupling UiO-66-NH 2 and Cu 2 O. Cu derived from Cu 2 O served as an electron mediator for the indirect Zscheme heterojunction.The UiO-66-NH 2 /Cu 2 O/Cu-0.39gave evidence of excellent photocatalytic activity for conversion of CO 2 to CO, in which the yield of CO reached 4.54 molg -1 h -1 .The key factors that led to the improved photocatalytic activity were the following: (1) Suitable band structures make it possible to construct Z-scheme heterojunction; (2) UiO-66-NH 2 slowed down the photo-corrosion rate of Cu 2 O and increased CO 2 adsorption capacity; (3) Cu accelerates the migration rate of charge carriers and provides active sites for CO 2 reduction. proportion of organic elements (C, H, N and O) were determined by the elemental Micro cube instrument and elemental EL III, respectively.The optical properties of the samples were characterized on UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450; Shimazu, Japan) in the range of 200-800 nm and BaSO 4 was used as a reference standard.Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved PL decay curves were measured by photoluminescence detector (Edinburgh instruments FLS980).Electron-spin-resonance (ESR) tests were carried out on Bruker A300-10/12 Electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer.Transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were conducted on Versa-STAT electrochemical workstation (Versa-STAT 3, Beijing, China).N 2 adsorption and CO 2 adsorption were measured on a TriStar II 3020 and ASAP 2460, respectively.Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to measure the work function () using He I emission (21.2 eV) as the source of ultra-violet light.The work function of the detector is 4.93 eV.The work function values of samples were obtained by formula (1): 21.2 -E -4.93 (E was energy distance from the upper onset to secondary onset).
