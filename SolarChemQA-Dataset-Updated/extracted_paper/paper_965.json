    "content": "The conversion of CO 2 into high value-added carbon-based compounds through photocatalytic reduction technology is considered as one of the more promising strategies to solve the greenhouse effect.And construction of heterojunction photocatalysts can promote the separation of photoelectron-hole pairs, so as to achieve higher activity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Hence, PtCeO 2 /3DCN heterojunction are prepared by calcination method and photoreduction technology.The photocatalytic results revealed that PtCeO 2 /3DCN show better photocatalytic activity for reducing CO 2 into CO and CH 4 , compared with 3DCN.Especially, Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN shows the maximum photocatalytic activity of 4.69 and 3.03 molh -1 g -1 for CO and CH 4 under UV light irradiation, respectively, and the reduction activity did not decrease significantly after five cycles.The enhanced photoreduction of CO 2 performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of the oxygen vacancies in CeO 2 for CO 2 activation and heterojunction for electron separation.Besides, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on CeO 2 /3DCN can further promote the transfer of electrons, resulting in higher photocatalytic activity."

    "content": "Urea (CO(NH 2 ) 2 ), dimethylcarbinol (C 3 H 8 O) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, (C 6 H 9 NO) n ) were all supplied by Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd.Natrium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ), cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O), ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) and chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O) were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.All chemicals are analytical grade and used without further purification. 13CO 2 (99) gas was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd. Crystal phase structures were conducted via a powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, D8ADV ANCE) over the 2 theta ranges of 10-80.The microstructure and morphology of all samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7800F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G 2 F30).The chemical states on the surface of photocatalysis were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI5300).The Raman spectra were performed over DXR Raman spectrometer.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded at room temperature using an A300 EPR spectrometer.Solid-state UV-vis diffuse absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu2450 spectrophotometer within a wavelength range of 300-600 nm using BaSO 4 as the reference.The photoluminescence (PL) spectra measurement was measured by QuantaMaster TM 40. In a representative method 41, the g-C 3 N 4 was synthesized by thermal decomposition of urea.Briefly, pure g-C 3 N 4 was synthesized by heating 5 g urea in a covered crucible at 550 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 Cmin -1 .After it, the resultant yellow product g-C 3 N 4 was collected and referred to as CN. The preparation procedure of three-dimensional porous carbon nitride was as follows: firstly, 0.5 g of CN and 4.0 g of NaHCO 3 were ground in an agate mortar.And then mixed powder after grinding were heated in a covered crucible at 350 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 Cmin -1 .Secondly, the sample after the reaction was subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 1 h by 500 mL deionized and then washed by centrifugation multiple times to remove Na and HCO 3 -from the sample.Finally, the sample was dried in an oven at 60 C for 24 h and the obtained sample grinded into powder was collected (3DCN). 0.5 g of 3DCN and 0.1892 g of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring for 24 h, respectively, and then was dried in an oven at 60 C for 24 h.The obtained powder was grinded in an agate mortar.The powder after grinding were heated in a covered crucible at 400 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 Cmin -1 .The resulting light-yellow powder was washed three times with deionized water and ethanol to remove impurities and dried under 60 C to obtain a 15 wt CeO 2 /3DCN (15CeO 2 /3DCN).The xCeO 2 /3DCN with different mass ratios were prepared by changing weight of CeO 2 (x 30 wt, 45 wt and 60 wt). Pt nano-particles (NPs) were loaded on the surface of CeO 2 /3DCN by photodeposition 42.0.5 g of 45CeO 2 /3DCN was added to 70 mL of isopropanol and 0.3 g of PVP was added into the above suspension.N 2 gas was bubbled into the suspension for 30 min after suspension was subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 1 h. 1 mL of H 2 PtCl 6 6H 2 O (10 mg/ mL, 43 wt) were added to the above slurry and the solution was irradiated to prepare 0.86 wt Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN under a 300 W UV lamp for 1 h.Then, the product was collected by filtration and washed for several times, and dried at 60 C in vacuum drying oven to obtain the Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN photocatalyst. Photocatalytic CO 2 reductions tests were performed in a closed photochemical reactor, involving 0.1 g photocatalyst, 100 mL of NaOH solution (0.1 M) and 1 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) under UV light or visible light for 10 h.The reaction system was stirred with a magnetic stirrer and bubbled with high-purity CO 2 (99.999) in the dark at least 30 min before light illumination.The system was maintained at 0.4 MPa.In the process of photocatalytic reaction, gas product of the CO 2 photo reduction was detected by gas chromatograph with FID detector every 2 h.The isotope-labeled experiments were performed using 13 CO 2 instead of 12 CO 2 , and the products were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Agilent, 7890B-5977B)."

    "content": "The crystal structures of as-prepared samples were researched by XRD 43,44.The XRD patterns of 3DCN, CeO 2 , 45CeO 2 /3DCN and Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN are shown in Fig. 1.The wide-angle X-ray diffraction showed broad peaks at 12.9and 27.4, which were characteristic of 3DCN (JCPDS:50-1250) 45.CeO 2 exhibited six peaks at 28.6, 33.1, 47.6, 56.4, 69.2and 76.7, corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2) and (4 0 0) diffraction faces (JCPDS: 34-0394) Fig. 1.The XRD patterns of 3DCN, CeO 2 , 45CeO 2 /3DCN and Pt45CeO 2 / 3DCN.46, respectively.Compared with CeO 2 , the peak of (1 1 1) diffraction face of CeO 2 in Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN and 45CeO 2 /3DCN became wider due to the existence of 3DCN.In addition, the characteristic peak of Pt was not observed in Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN, which may be on account of the small size of Pt nanoparticles. The composition and chemical status of Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN was studied in detail by XPS 32.The survey spectrum in Fig. 2a revealed the presence of C, N, O, Ce and Pt elements in Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN, in accord with the result of EDS and the atomic percentage of the elements was summarized in the Table S1.C 1s peak position located at 284.8, 286.5 and 288.3 eV belonged to the typical CeNH 2 , Ce(N) 3 and NeC N groups of 3DCN 47,48 (Fig. 2b).As shown in Fig. 2c, the highresolution spectrum of N 1s at 398.8 and 400.4 eV were stemmed from Ne(C) and CeNH 2 in 3DCN 49.The weak peak of N 1s at around 404.6 eV was attributed to -excitations.In addition, O 1s XPS peaks could be best fitted by the combination of two XPS peaks of 529.3 and 532.6 eV, which could be attributed to lattice oxygen or metal oxygen bonds in defective oxides (Fig. 2d) 505152.The double peaks at 72.8 and 76.1 eV were appointed to Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 , respectively, which belonged to metallic Pt and Pt 2 , and Pt deposited on the Pt45CeO 2 / 3DCN was metallic (Fig. 2e) 535455.The Ce 3d spectrum exhibited two contributions, 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 , located at 881.9, 885.2, 888.8, 898.0, 900.5, 903.7, 912.2 and 916.4 eV (Fig. 2f), which can correspond to CeO 2 55.The Ce 3 in Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN was evidenced on the main peak at 881.9, 885.2, 888.8 and 898.0 eV.In addition, the peaks at 900.5, 903.7, 912.2 and 916.4 eV were assigned to the Ce 4 , confirming the coexistence of Ce 3 and Ce 4 in CeO 2 56.The percentage of Ce 3 species was calculated to be 0.51 according to the area ratio of Ce 3 /(Ce 3 Ce 4 ), which indicated Ce 4 can effectively capture electrons to generate Ce 3 . SEM, TEM and HRTEM were used to study the micro-morphologies of the as-prepared samples 57,58.As shown in Figure S1a and S1b, 3DCN was formed by randomly stacked g-C 3 N 4 sheets and had obvious irregular channel structure.SEM image recorded the cube shape of the CeO 2 with a particle size of 20 nm (Figure S1c).The inset in Figure S1c corresponded to the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of CeO 2 and the pattern showed bright rings, which illustrated CeO 2 nanoparticles had a polycrystalline structure.TEM image of Pt nanoparticles are shown in Figure S1d and the size of Pt nanoparticles was about 5-6 nm.It could be seen from the SEM and TEM images of CeO 2 / 3DCN that CeO 2 nanoparticles were randomly distributed on the inner and outer surfaces of 3DCN, and the introduction of CeO 2 did not change the porous structure of 3DCN (Figure S1e andS1f).However, 60CeO 2 /3DCN have the stacking and agglomeration phenomenon (Fig. S2) which could be attributed to excessive CeO 2 .Fig. 3a showed TEM image of the Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN, in which CeO 2 and Pt were randomly distributed on the surface of 3DCN.Fig. 3b showed the HRTEM of Pt 45CeO 2 /3DCN, the lattice fringes displayed spacings of 0.19 and 0.20 nm, which match well respectively with those of the (2 2 0) planes of the CeO 2 and (2 0 0) planes of the Pt, respectively.The elemental mapping shown in Figure S3a-e proved that the elements C, N, Ce, O and Pt were distributed in the Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN.This result was corresponding to the EDS result analysis (Figure S3f), which both manifested Pt and CeO 2 nanoparticles successfully loaded on 3DCN surface.Moreover, the weight percent of C, N, O, Ce and Pt were 26.29, 42.81, 16.27, 12.35 and 0.9, respectively.The Na element was present on account of the synthesis procedure of 3DCN using the NaHCO 3 . The Raman spectra of the CeO 2 , 3DCN, CeO 2 /3DCN and Pt 45CeO 2 /3DCN are displayed in Figure S4.For CeO 2 , the peak at 460 cm -1 was attributed to vibration of Ce-O bond 59, while the peak at 594 cm -1 was assigned to the presence of oxygen vacancies in CeO 2 .There were five peaks (677 cm -1 , 734 cm -1 , 957 cm -1 , 1204 cm -1 and 1600 cm -1 ) observed in Figure S2, which were characteristic of vibration modes of the CN heterocycle, matching with the vibration mode of g-C 3 N 4 60.Furthermore, the vibration modes of the CN heterocycle in g-C 3 N 4 and the characteristic peaks of CeO 2 were observed in the Raman spectra of 45CeO 2 /3DCN and Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN, indicating that CeO 2 and 3DCN were successfully coupled. The optical properties of CeO 2 , 3DCN, xCeO 2 /3DCN and Pt 45CeO 2 /3DCN were analyzed by UV-vis DRS, and the corresponding diffuse reflectance spectra were converted from the Kubelka-Munk function.As can be seen from Fig. 4a, the absorption edges of 3DCN, CeO 2 , xCeO 2 /3DCN (X 15, 30, 45) were very similar, while the absorption edges of 60CeO 2 /3DCN and Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN are obviously red-shifted.For ternary Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN composite materials, compared with those binary composite materials, the visible light capture ability was significantly enhanced, which was beneficial to generate more photogenerated carriers in the photocatalytic system.The band gap of 3DCN, 45CeO 2 /3DCN and Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN were calculated to be about 2.61, 2.50 and 2.48 eV, respectively, via analyzing the relationship between (h) 1/2 and photon energy used as Tauc plots (Fig. 4b and Figure S5).In order to trace the valence band (VB) position of CeO 2 and 3DCN, it was calculated using XPS wide spectra (Figure S6).The VB positions of CeO 2 and 3DCN were determined to be 2.29 and 1.75 V (vs.NHE, pH 7), respectively.On the basis of the band gap energy and VB position, conduction band (CB) position of CeO 2 and 3DCN can be calculated from the empirical formula in Eq. ( 1) 61. CeO 2 and 3DCN had CB position of -0.52 and -0.86 V (vs.NHE, pH 7), respectively, which was very promising for photocatalysis to effectively reduce CO 2 to selective fuels. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of bulk g-C 3 N 4 (BCN), 3DCN, 45CeO 2 /3DCN and Pt45CeO 2 / 3DCN are shown in Fig. 5.All the isotherms were of the type-IV adsorption with a loop ring of type-H3, indicating the presence of irregular mesopores in the samples 62.Average pore diameter and specific surface area of synthetic samples are listed in Table 1.The S BET of 3DCN was greater than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 due to the porous structure of 3DCN.The 3DCN could provide more adsorption and active sites to improve photocatalytic activity.The S BET of 45CeO 2 /3DCN was about 1.21 and 1.95 times that of BCN and 3DCN, so it can absorb more CO 2 and effectively promote the subsequent reaction.When Pt nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of 45CeO 2 /3DCN, the specific surface area of Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN was less than that of 45CeO 2 /3DCN.However, Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN had better photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction than 45CeO 2 /3DCN, which manifested enhancement of photocatalytic activity was independent of surface area.And the BJH pore size distributions of BCN, 3DCN, 45CeO 2 /3DCN and Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN showed the mesopore distribution ranged from 11.48 nm to 20.41 nm. Photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction under UV light was conducted on all samples with TEOA as the sacrifice agent.Fig. 6a and 6b depicts the time-dependent CO and CH 4 yields.And the production rate for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over photocatalysts is displayed in Fig. 6c.Using 3DCN lower amount of CO and CH 4 were obtained because of faster charge carrier recombination.With the decoration with CeO 2 on the surface of 3DCN, the production rates of CO and CH 4 were changed.Compared with 3DCN, 45CeO 2 /3DCN showed better catalytic activities and the CO and CH 4 production rate by 45CeO 2 / 3DCN was both enhanced nearly by 4 times.Therefore, it could be speculated that the presence of CeO 2 provided more active sites for CO 2 reduction and inhibited recombination of electron-hole pairs.However, the photocatalytic activity of the composites decreased after the content of CeO 2 exceeds 45.This was mainly due to the agglomeration of CeO 2 nanoparticles on the surface of 3DCN, which led to the reduction of the active sites of the photocatalyst.Interestingly, when 45CeO 2 / Fig. 4. (a) The UV-vis diffused spectra of all samples; (b) the band gap spectra of 3DCN, 45CeO 2 /3DCN and Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN photocatalysts. 3DCN was decorated with Pt, CO production rates were improved and CH 4 production rates were considerably suppressed.This showed that Pt can not only reduced the over-potential required for the reaction and accelerated the photo-reduction reaction, but also had a selective synergistic effect on the photocatalytic system.In addition to this, the absence of O 2 on the surface of Pt greatly inhibited the reverse backward reaction of CO reoxidation to CO 2 .Therefore, the rate of CO formation and the selectivity of CO release were significantly improved 63.By comparing Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN with other similar photocatalysts, it can be seen that the photocatalyst prepared in this paper had good photocatalytic performance (Table 2) 6465666768. Besides, the stability test indicated that the Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN maintains photocatalytic activity after five cycles.And the structure of the Pt45CeO 2 / 3DCN had not noticeable change before and after the reaction (Figure S7).Control experiments with different reaction conditions were conducted (Figure S8).The CO 2 reduction reaction was carried out under dark conditions, no product was produced, indicating that the reaction is a light-induced reaction.Nitrogen was used instead of CO 2 , only a small amount of CO is produced which may be a carbon-containing product from the decomposition of carbon residues on the catalyst.In order to further trace the carbon source of carbon monoxide produced, the reaction with isotopic 13 CO 2 was also performed under identical conditions.And products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, Fig. S9).The main signals m/z 17 and m/ z 29 in GC-MS were assigned to 13 CH 4 and 13 CO, proving that the CH 4 and CO originated from CO 2 .When the original CN was used as a photocatalyst, the production of CO and CH 4 was extremely low, indicating that CN was not dominant in photoreduction of CO 2 .In addition, photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction under visible light was conducted over Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN.Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN with CO and CH 4 yield of 0.5 and 0.3 molg -1 h -1 displayed the lower catalytic activity (Fig. S8).This may be due to the fact that more photo-generated electrons can be excited under ultraviolet light to participate in the process of reducing CO 2 . In order to explore photocatalytic activity mechanism, PL tests, photocurrent responses and EIS experiments were carried out.EPR measurements of CeO 2 and Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN were carried out at 297 K.The signal peaks of CeO 2 and Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN appeared at the same position (Figure S10).It could be seen from the calculation that the position of the signal peak is about g e 2.001, corresponding to oxygen vacancies on the surface of CeO 2 and Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN 69. It is generally known that the lower PL intensity is, the lower recombination of photoinduced charge carriers are 70.The PL spectrum of 3DCN in Fig. 7 revealed a broad peak at around 439 nm.Compared with 3DCN, the PL intensity of xCeO 2 /3DCN (x 15, 30, 45 and 60) decreased significantly.This can be attributed to the heterostructure between CeO 2 and 3DCN effectively preventing the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs.In addition, after depositing Pt on the surface of 45CeO 2 /3DCN, the PL intensity was further reduced, indicating that Pt can promote the separation of charge carriers.Fig. 8a shows the periodic on/off photocurrent responses of 3DCN, 45CeO 2 /3DCN and Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN under intermittent visible light irradiation.Compared with 3DCN, the photocurrent density of 45CeO 2 / 3DCN had increased, manifesting the higher separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs for 45CeO 2 /3DCN.When Pt and CeO 2 were simultaneously deposited on the surface of 3DCN, the Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN displayed the highest photocurrent density, which indicated that the Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN composite could more effectively separate electron and hole pairs.EIS measurements were further conducted to investigate interfacial charge transfer resistance and separation efficiency (Fig. 8b).The large semicircle diameter of 3DCN was caused by its poor electronic conductivity.The effective charge transfer between CeO 2 and 3DCN effectively improved the electrical conductivity of 45CeO 2 /3DCN.The Nyquist diagram of Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN possessed the smallest semicircle, indicating that the Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN photocatalyst could quickly transfer photogenerated carriers and produce high photocatalytic activity.The above results collectively prove that the coexistence of Pt and CeO 2 on 3DCN can effectively promote the separation and transfer of charge carriers, thereby accelerating the rate of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction. The schematic mechanism for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on Pt 45CeO 2 /3DCN under UV-light irradiation for the production of CO and CH 4 had been presented in Fig. 9.The CB and VB of CeO 2 were -0.52 and 2.29 V (vs.NHE, pH 7), respectively.And the CB and VB of 3DCN were -0.86 and 1.75 V (vs.NHE, pH 7), respectively.Firstly, the 3DCN and CeO 2 would be excited to generate electron-hole pairs under the UV light.Based on the results of band structure analysis, the E CB potentials of 3DCN and CeO 2 enabled both of them to reduce CO 2 into CO and CH 4 (E CO2 / CO -0.53V vs NHE at pH 7 and E CO2 / CH4 -0.24V vs NHE at pH 7).On the one hand, the CB edge potential of 3DCN was more negative than that of CeO 2 , hence, a part of photo-generated electrons on the surface of 3DCN were easily transferred to CeO 2 via close contact of heterojunction.On the other hand, the other part of the electron is transferred to Pt for photoreduction of CO 2 .Moreover, part of the electrons in the conduction band of CeO 2 participated in the conversion of Ce 4 and Ce 3 , and part of them were also transferred to Pt to complete together the conversion of CO 2 to CO and CH 4 .At the meantime, Ce 4 in CeO 2 was reduced to Ce 3 by trapping electrons 64,71.Ce 3 and oxygen vacancies can activate CO 2 molecules to generate CO 2 .In the process of the mutual conversion of Ce 4 and Ce 3 , it not only improves the utilization of electrons, but also activates CO 2 molecules by utilizing oxygen vacancies, ultimately achieving the purpose of increasing the conversion rate.The holes created by the VB were consumed by TEOA, which was beneficial to inhibit the reorganization of electrons and holes.The dominating reaction steps for the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into CO and CH 4 were summarized as follows:"

    "content": "In a word, CeO 2 and Pt are supported on the surface of 3D porous g-C 3 N 4 by calcination method and photoreduction technology.The heterojunction formed at the interface of CeO 2 and 3D g-C 3 N 4 reduces the electron-hole recombination rate, and oxygen vacancy in CeO 2 can capture electrons and activate CO 2 molecules.The mutual conversion between Ce 3 and Ce 4 is also conducive to improving the utilization rate of electrons.Meantime, Pt cocatalyst can play the role of electron transfer mediator.Hence, under UV light Pt45CeO 2 /3DCN shows the yields of 4.69 and 3.03 molh -1 g -1 for CO and CH 4 , respectively, which are 3.9 times higher than that of 3DCN.
