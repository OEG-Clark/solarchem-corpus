    "content": "Iodine-doped titanium dioxide nanosheets with high exposed 001 facets (IFTO) were synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal treatment followed by calcination at 350 C. The photocatalyst samples were characterized by X-ray diffractometry, transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.The IFTO were more active than surfacefluorinated TiO 2 nanosheets or iodine-doped TiO 2 nanoparticles in the gaseous reduction of CO 2 with water vapor.The IFTO photocatalytic activity was repeatable over five successive cycles.Coexisting I-O-Ti and I-O-I structures in the IFTO TiO 2 lattice contributed to visible light absorption and a high percentage of exposed 001 facets that enhance H 2 O oxidation.Surface fluorination promoted the formation of unsaturated Ti atoms, which helped reduce CO 2 to CO 2 A and retard the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs."

    "content": "All chemicals were used without further purication.I-doped TiO 2 samples with 001 dominated facets were prepared via a two-step hydrothermal method followed by sintering.Firstly, TiO 2 samples with 001 exposed facets were prepared based on hydrothermal reaction between hydrouoric acid (HF, Analytical reagent, Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd.) and titanium tetrabutoxide (TBOT, 99 solution, Huadong Medicine Co., Ltd.).In a typical experiment, 6 mL HF and 50 mL TBOT (with molar ratios of F/Ti 14 1) were added into a 200 mL Teon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 180 C for 24 h.The solid products were collected by centrifugation and then washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water several times, followed by drying in a vacuum at 60 C for 10 h.The obtained samples were labeled FTO.Secondly, iodine ion was doped on the FTO samples by a simple hydrothermal procedure using iodic acid (HIO 3 , Analytical reagent, Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd.) as iodine source.FTO precursor (2 g) was dispersed in 160 mL deionized water consisting of 2.687 g HIO 3 (with molar ratios of I/Ti 14 1), transferred to a 200 mL Teon-lined stainlesssteel autoclave and heated at 150 C for 24 h.Aer cooling naturally, white precipitates were collected and washed several times with deionized water, and dried at 60 C. Finally, IFTO photocatalyst (with molar ratios of I : F : Ti 14 1 : 1 : 1) powders were obtained by calcining in air at 350 C for 2 h to obtain better crystallization and to remove impurities.A similar method was adopted to prepare I-doped TiO 2 (ITO) without adding HF in the rst step. XRD analysis of the synthesized photocatalysts was carried out on a Thermal ARL X-ray diffractometer (Thermo, France), using Cu Ka radiation (45 kV and 40 mA) over a 2q of 10-80 and at 2 min A1 .Sample crystallite sizes were calculated according to the Scherrer equation. 24XPS analyses were conducted on a PHI 5000C ESCA system (Perkin-Elmer, USA) equipped with a monochromated Mg Ka radiation source operated at 1253.6 eV.Sample size and morphology were observed at 10 kV by S-4800 FESEM (Hitachi, Japan) and Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin TEM (Philips-FEI, Netherlands) at 160 kV.All UV-vis diffuse reectance spectra experiments were carried out on a TU-1901 spectrophotometer (Pgeneral, China) using BaSO 4 as reference.BET specic surface areas (S BET ) were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K in an ASAP 2010 Analyzer (Micromeritics, USA). Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was performed in a home-made stainless steel reactor at room temperature under visible-light irradiation.The stainless steel reactor (80 mm inner diameter, 55 mm inner height, and 260 mL effective capacity) was equipped with an O-ring-sealed quartz window at the top through which irradiating light passed.A 500 W Xe arc lamp (Beijing Electric Light Sources Research Institute, China) with cut-off lter to remove radiation below 400 nm was used as the visible-light source, and was positioned 20 cm above the vessel.The luminous ux on the reactor, measured using a FZ-A visible-light radiometer (Beijing Normal University, China), was 2.551 A 10 A6 einstein min A1 cm A2 .For each run, 0.3 g sample was placed at a glass ber (4 cm A 4 cm) located in the bottom of the reactor.High-purity (99.995)CO 2 (Hangzhou Jingong Special Gas Co., Ltd., China) was passed through a water bubbler at 3.0 mL min A1 for 30 min to produce a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor (3.2 H 2 O, v/v).Aer the inlet and outlet reactor valves were closed, the Xe lamp was switched on.At given time intervals, 1 mL of gas was removed from the reactor for concentration analysis of various products using a gas chromatograph (GC). CH 4 and CO were detected by GC-2014 (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a ame ionization detector using nitrogen as carrier gas and by GC 7890B (Agilent, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using helium as carrier gas, respectively.O 2 was analyzed by a GC 7890A (Agilent) equipped with a TCD using argon as carrier gas. The quantum yield (QY, number of moles of electrons reacted/number of moles of incident protons) is calculated under the same photocatalytic reaction conditions.Eight and two electrons are required for the formation of one molecule of products from CO 2 and H 2 O for CH 4 and CO, respectively."

    "content": "XRD XRD patterns of the IFTO samples are presented in Fig. 1 to explain the crystal phase evolution.XRD patterns of FTO and ITO were also obtained as references.Diffraction peaks at 25.304 (101), 37.793 (004), 48.037 (200), 53.886 (105), 55.061 (211), and 62.685 (204) can be indexed to anatase phase TiO 2 (JCPDS card no.21-1272). 25The relative intensities of the ( 200) and (004) diffraction peaks represent the growth of the anatase TiO 2 crystal along the a and c axes, respectively. 22The intensity of the (200) diffraction peak of FTO and IFTO is more intense and sharper than that of the (004) peak and suggests preferential growth in the 100 direction.Growth along the c axis or 001 direction is greatly inhibited in the presence of F A because F A is adsorbed strongly on the 001 facets. 22The introduction of iodine does not appear to inuence the numbers or positions of the diffraction peaks, and no relative diffraction belonging to iodine-related species is observed.The thickness of the TiO 2 nanosheets in the 001 direction and the length in the 100 direction can be calculated from the full width at half-maximum of the (004) and ( 200) diffraction peaks, respectively, based on Scherrer's equation. 26As shown in Fig. 1 and listed in Table 1, the thickness and side length of the FTO are 8.57 nm and 29.43 nm, respectively.With HIO 3 addition, the peak intensities of (004) and (200) weakened and correspond to the slight broadening of FWHM, which indicates that the thickness and side length of the IFTO decreased.The IFTO thickness is 6.39 nm and its side length is 26.29 nm. As listed in Table 1, the percentage of exposed 001 FTO facets is 63.20 with 6 mL HF content.The 001 facets percentage increased slightly to 67.29 aer iodine doping.This occurs because the decrease in thickness is more obvious than the decrease in side length in the secondary hydrothermal process. The morphology and microstructure of the ITO (Fig. 2a), FTO (Fig. 2b), and IFTO (Fig. 2c) samples were investigated further by TEM and FESEM.Because of their high surface activities and because they were sufficiently attractive, the SEM images show that the ITO is composed of aggregated particles of 15 nm.The other two uorinated samples were uniform in size and appear sheet-shaped, with observed thicknesses and side lengths that agree with those calculated by XRD.For ITO, FTO, and IFTO, the thickness and side length ranged from 5 to 9 nm and from 10 to 30 nm, respectively.No obvious change in FTO morphology could be observed from SEM analysis with and without iodine modication.However, upon close observation of the TEM micrographs, it could be seen that the top and bottom surfaces changes from rectangular to ellipse-shaped during the secondary hydrothermal process.The typical HRTEM image of the IFTO shows clear fringes separated by 0.235 and 0.352 nm that matched well with the (001) and (101) lattice spacing of a tetragonal phase TiO 2 crystal. 27S Sample elemental compositions were determined by XPS.Fig. 3a shows the full spectra of ITO, FTO, and IFTO samples, and conrms the presence of F, I, Ti, O, and C. The carbon peak is attributed to residual carbon from oil pollution and adventitious hydrocarbon from the XPS instrument itself.28 The binding energy shis because relative surface charging was corrected using the C (1s) level at 284.6 eV as an internal standard.The high-resolution XPS spectra of the F 1s and I 3d core level region of all samples are shown in Fig. 3b andc.The F 1s XPS spectrum shows a single peak at 684.1 eV, which conrms the existence of typical surface Ti-F species, which is consistent with the reported results.29 Since no F 1s core electron peak at 688 eV existed in our experiment, it can be concluded that lattice F did not exist in FTO and IFTO.30 The 3d regions of I displayed two doublet peaks at 623.9 eV (I 3d 5/2 ) and 635.6 eV (I 3d 3/2 ) and at 620.1 (I 3d 5/2 ) and 631.6 (I 3d 3/2 ) eV. 13 Tojo et al. conrmed that binding energies of 623.9 eV should be ascribed to I 5 , whereas a further peak at 620.1 eV exists because of the I A species.13 The binding energy of I 3d 3/2 of the prepared samples is different from that of HIO 3 (622 eV), which implies the occurrence of energetically favorable substitution of Ti 4 by I 5 .This occurs because the ionic radius of I 5 (0.062 nm) is close to that of Ti 4 (0.064 nm).31 Lattice-substituted I 5 exist in the I-O-Ti bond in TiO 2 , whereas I A is derived from I 5 reduction by accepting electrons.32 It should be noted that the molar ratios of I/Ti for sample ITO are greater than those for IFTO, which demonstrates that surface uorine hinders iodine doping on TiO 2 . High-resolution XPS spectra of the Ti 2p of sample are presented in Fig. 3d.With respect to FTO, a higher oxidation state of titanium at 460.0 eV is clearly observed for ITO and IFTO, which should be assigned to the presence of Ti-O-I. 33,34herefore, the Ti 2p peak of ITO and IFTO was separated into six peaks.The peaks located at 464.23 (458.39)eV, 463.24 (457.68)eV, and 465.98 (460.0)eV correspond to the oxidation states of Ti 4 , Ti 3 , and Ti in Ti-O-I, respectively. 35Aer tting with Gaussian functions using XPS peak 41 computer soware, the molar ratios of trivalent titanium to the sum of trivalent, tetravalent titanium, and Ti-O-I, abbreviated here as Ti 3 /(Ti 3 Ti 4 Ti-O-I), are shown in Table 1.The values are 13.26, 10.59, and 17.89 for FTO, ITO, and IFTO, respectively, and increase as IFTO FTO ITO.Fluorine and iodine doping may enhance the generation of Ti 3 , which has been reported previously. 33,36Surface uorination of TiO 2 can introduce an electron into the 3d orbital of Ti 4 because of charge compensation effects, and leads to the conversion of Ti 4 sites to Ti 3 defects. The specic surface areas of samples were characterized based on the BET analysis, as presented in Table 1.The specic surface areas of FTO and ITO calculated using the BET method are 112 and 96 m 2 g A1 , respectively.The ITO has a relatively lower specic surface area compared with FTO, although its particle size is smaller.This should be induced by nanoparticle aggregation.With secondary hydrothermal treatment of FTO with HIO 3 aqueous solution, the BET surface area of the resulting IFTO decreased signicantly to 63 m 2 g A1 , possibly because of further TiO 2 nanosheet aggregation. The UV-vis diffuse reectance spectra were applied to investigate the optical response of samples to the solar spectrum and results are shown in Fig. 4. Band gaps estimated by the Kubelka-Munk method are 3.11, 2.39, and 2.98 eV for FTO, ITO, and IFTO samples, respectively. 39With respect to the FTO sample, no obvious red shi in absorption threshold compared with pure anatase TiO 2 (3.2 eV) could be found.Nonetheless, the band gap of ITO narrowed signicantly, which implies that bulk doping is overwhelming for iodine-doping catalyst. 34elative to FTO, the IFTO sample shows a similar band gap and an obvious absorption edge up to 700 nm.This is an obvious feature of surface-doped anatase TiO 2 in iodine doping.It can be concluded that the presence of uorine lead to surface doping instead of bulk doping of iodine.This is because the titanium-uorine single bond energy, 581 kJ mol A1 , is higher than that of the iodine-uorine single bond of 273 kJ mol A1 . 40 The photocatalytic property of the prepared samples was studied in a closed reactor in the presence of gaseous CO 2 and water vapor.CH 4 and CO were the main products in the gas phase when IFTO and ITO were irradiated with visible light (see Fig. 5).The type of products in CO 2 reduction is dependent on the redox potential. 41Since the conduction band (CB) potential of TiO 2 is (A0.56V) more negative than the reduction potential of CO 2 /CH 4 (A0.24V vs. NHE, pH 7.0) and CO 2 /CO (A0.53 V vs. NHE, pH 7.0), it is energetically favorable for electrons from the CB of TiO 2 to transfer to CO 2 to initiate CO 2 reduction with H 2 O and produce CH 4 and CO. 42 Except for CH 4 and CO, other products such as CH 3 OH, HCHO, HCOOH, and H 2 were not detected during the reaction.This result is consistent with other investigations. 43As a control, no detection of any product in the reaction system without irradiation or catalysts reveals that the CO 2 reduction should proceed photocatalytically.Besides, no reduction product was observed when high-purity N 2 gas instead of CO 2 was used as reactant, which proves that CH 4 and CO were generated from CO 2 as the only carbon source rather than from contamination produced during the preparation process. 44he performances of FTO in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction were tested to investigate the effect of iodine doping on photocatalysts.CH 4 and CO could not be detected above the detection limit during FTO sample irradiation with visible light.Instead, ITO and IFTO exhibited effective photocatalytic activity in CO 2 reduction.Fig. 5 compares photocatalytic CH 4 and CO yields of ITO and IFTO samples as a function of reaction time.Samples of IFTO have a higher photoactivity than ITO samples.CH 4 and CO yields with IFTO were 36.36 and 13.71 mmol g A1 , respectively, whereas CH 4 and CO yields with ITO were 31.79 and 5.37 mmol g A1 , respectively.Catalyst activity was evaluated by comparing the QYs of the photocatalytic process.The calculated QYs of the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 were 0.229 and 0.263 for the catalysts ITO and IFTO, respectively. Compared with FTO without any visible-light response, IFTO with coexisting I-O-I and I-O-Ti structures had lower energy photon excitation pathways from occupied states of the I-O-Ti structure just above the valence band (VB) to the unoccupied states of the I-O-I structure below the CB in the band gap. 45herefore, a wider range of visible light response existed for IFTO, although its intrinsic band gap is very close to FTO. Based on the physical-chemical characterization, the major differences between IFTO and ITO is their surface chemistry and morphology.The premise of CO 2 photoreduction is the formation of the key intermediate of surface-bound carboxylates (CO 2 A radical anion). 46As proved by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Ti 3 served as the only active sites for electron transfer to the adsorbed CO 2 . 47Moreover, the existence of Ti 3 can act in charge-carrier trapping, thereby suppressing e A -h recombination. 37Surface uorination is benecial to the formation of Ti 3 species as determined by XPS analysis, which is advantageous to CO 2 A formation and the prolongation of photogenerated carrier lifetime.The rate of a photocatalytic reaction rate usually depends on transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes.In this study, H 2 O should act as the hole scavenger. 48If H 2 O could not be oxidized at a rate equal to the CO 2 reduction rate, Ti 3 sites associated with oxygen vacancies would act as e A -h recombination centers.As reported, H 2 O prefers to dissociate on highenergy 001 oxidative facets of TiO 2 nanosheets rather than 101 facets, since it is exothermic on the (001) surface and endothermic on the (101) surface. 49Consequently, the IFTO exhibited higher photoactivity than ITO towards CO 2 reduction using H 2 O as an electron donor. As shown in Table 1, relative to ITO, the Ti 3 percentage for IFTO is 87.76, which is 1.1 times higher than that for ITO.The percentage of 001 facets is 1.6-fold greater than that observed on ITO.The reduction of CO 2 to CO 2 A by photogenerated electrons and the oxidation of H 2 O by photogenerated holes is promoted, which corroborates this result.The QY of IFTO was 1.1 times higher that of ITO.Besides photocatalytic activity, catalyst stability is an important property, which is related directly to practical catalyst application.A repeated experiment on photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor was designed to examine IFTO stability.As shown in Fig. 6, the IFTO photocatalyst maintains its photocatalytic activity for CO 2 reduction aer ve successive cycles with 35.56 mmol g A1 for CH 4 and 13.14 mmol g A1 for CO, which is almost unchanged compared with the rst cycle. In our case, water vapor was used as the electron donor during the photocatalytic process.Since a gastight syringe was used to sample gaseous samples in the reactor and was then injected manually into GC 7890A (Agilent), N 2 together with O 2 in the air cannot be removed completely, which would interfere with the quantitative analysis of O 2 produced from H 2 O oxidation.An alternative method is to use the O 2 /(O 2 N 2 ) volumetric ratio as an indicator.As depicted in Fig. 7, the volumetric ratio of O 2 /(O 2 N 2 ) was 21 at the beginning of the photoreaction, which is close to the value of the atmospheric O 2 /(O 2 N 2 ) ratio. The volumetric ratio of O 2 /(O 2 N 2 ) increased gradually with passing reaction time, and reached 32.7 at 240 min.The result provides strong evidence that O 2 is the oxidation product during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor."

    "content": "This study focused on the reduction of CO 2 in the gas phase with H 2 O through the photocatalytic process using FTO, ITO, and IFTO as catalysts.We have demonstrated that the reaction catalyzed by IFTO had a higher CO 2 -reducing capacity than the ITO and FTO-catalyzed photocatalysis.CH 4 (36.36 mmol g A1 ) and CO (13.71 mmol g A1 ) were produced simultaneously aer 240 min by visible-light irradiation of IFTO in the presence of CO 2 and water vapor, which corresponds to a QY of 0.263.The reusability experiment showed that IFTO is a long-living catalyst.The I-O-I and I-O-Ti structures on the IFTO were responsible for the visible light response.Moreover, it is proposed that the high percentage of Ti 3 because of surface uorination facilitates CO 2 A formation and extends the lifetime of photogenerated e A -h pairs, and the exposed 001 reactive facets with a high surface energy enable efficient dissolution of H 2 O.The results indicate that the photocatalytic method using IFTO as catalyst is a viable technique for CO 2 reduction and has the potential for storing sunlight energy as chemical fuels aer further in-depth investigations. Fig. 1 XRD patterns of IFTO, FTO, and ITO. 37 I doping may facilitate Ti 3 formation.During the secondary hydrothermal treatment of FTO with HIO 3 , the existence of I 5 may partly replace the Ti 4 in TiO 2 to form the I-O-Ti bond.Since a high reactivity and tendency of I 5 usually results in the formation of multivalences of iodine such as I 2 O 4 , I 4 O 9 , and I 2 O 5Ax , this process would create oxygen deciencies in TiO 2 .33Subsequently, corresponding excess electron density localized on the pair of Ti atoms adjacent to the vacancy produced two Ti 3 sites.38Zhou et al. deconvoluted the O 1s peak of iodine-doped TiO 2 (Fig. 3e) into four peaks of 529.51 eV, 530.27 eV, 531.80 eV, and 533.02 eV binding energies, that represent O 2A (TiO 2 ), O 2A (I 2 O 5 ), O (TiO 2Ax ), and O (I 2 O 5Ax ), respectively. 33Peak deconvolution revealed that the IFTO sample has the highest percentage of O (TiO 2Ax ) and the lowest percentage of O 2A (TiO 2 ) compared with ITO and FTO.The number of Ti 3 surface sites is believed to depend on the number of O (TiO 2Ax ).As a consequence, the percentage order of O (TiO 2Ax ) for three samples agrees with that of the order of the Ti 3 sites.
