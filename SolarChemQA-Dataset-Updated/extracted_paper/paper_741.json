    "content": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to hydrocarbon fuels is an ultimate and utmost strategy to resolve the everincreasing environmental problems and energy crisis.Our study aimed to develop a specific type of photocatalysts with increasing light utilization efficiency, reducing electron-hole recombination rate and enhancing photocatalytic activity by integrating unique donor-acceptor systems into the polymeric network of graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN).The results of the characterization showed that C and O are successfully integrated into the framework of g-CN.The O-containing and C-containing section of the as-prepared catalysts (OCCNx) play the role of donor and acceptor, respectively.The donor-acceptor systems of OCCN x offer an extra electron transfer transition mode, which dramatically extends the optical absorption range, and narrows down the bandgap of g-CN from 2.74 to 2.03 eV.Also, the donor-acceptor systems significantly improve the delocalized ability of the photoinduced charge carriers, which efficiently prolongs the lifetime of the charge carriers and reduces the electron-hole recombination rate, as all of these are all beneficial for boosting the photocatalytic activity of the catalysts.Experimental results show that OCCN 0.25 displays the best photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance with a CO production rate of 34.97 mol g -1 in 4 h, which is 4.3-fold higher than that obtained in the case of bulk g-CN.Moreover, the reaction is performed in water without any co-catalyst and sacrificial agent, which makes it a green and environmentally friendly reaction.Results obtained from DFT simulation agree well with the empirical results, and a possible reaction mechanism is suggested based on these calculations."

    "content": "Melamine (99 ), formaldehyde (37 aqueous solution) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.; Triethanolamine (99 ), ethanol (AR) were obtained from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd.; CO 2 ( 99.99 ), CO ( 99.99 ), and CH 4 ( 99.99 ) were purchased from Nanjing Special Gas Factory Co., Ltd. HMM was prepared according to literature 48.Typically, 19.5 g of 37 aqueous formaldehyde was placed in a 100 mL flask equipped with a reflux condenser.The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.5 with 10 aqueous NaOH.After adding 3.78 g of melamine, the mixture was maintained at 50 C under stirring until a clear solution resulted; heating was continued for another 10 min; then the mixture was cooled to room temperature.The resulting white solid was collected by filtration, washed with ethanol, and dried at 50 C.The final product was obtained as a white solid with a yield of 88 . In a typical procedure, a certain amount of HMM and 4 g of melamine were thoroughly mixed in a mortar.Then the resulting mixture was heated to 550 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 C min -1 .The resulting solid was ground into fine powder for further use.The obtained catalyst was denoted as OCCN x , where x represents the mass ratio of HMM to melamine.For instance, OCCN 0.25 means that the mass ratio of HMM to melamine is 1:4.The reaction procedure and possible structure of the catalyst are illustrated in Scheme 1. Bulk g-CN was prepared in the same way as HMM doped g-CN without adding HMM. X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization was performed on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (Japan) equipped with Cu Ka radiation (40 KV, 200 mA).The scanning ranges from 5to 60with a scanning rate of 10m in -1 .Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were acquired using a Nicolet Magna-IR 550 spectrometer with KBr as the reference sample in the wavelength range of 400-4000 cm -1 .Raman spectra were obtained on a DXR spectrometer using 532 nm laser, and the Scheme 1.The synthesis procedure and possible structure of OCCN x .measurements were performed in backscattering geometry.Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired using a Hitachi F4500 photoluminescence detector (Japan).Transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were obtained using a Zahner CHI 852C electrochemical workstation (Germany).UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) measurements were performed on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer with BaSO 4 as a reference.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was obtained using a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Mg K radiation (1253.6 eV) as the X-ray source.Elemental analysis (EA) was performed on a Thermo fisher Flash 2000 elemental analyzer.N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained on a BELSORP-minill Micro 2020 specific surface area and pore size analyzer. The calculation was based on the density functional theory (DFT).The geometry optimization of the catalyst fragments was performed on the Gaussian 09 program equipped with the B3LYP method and 6-311 G (d, p) basis set.The HOMO and LUMO of the catalyst fragments were calculated based on the optimized geometry. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was evaluated through the photoreduction of CO 2 .The reaction was performed in a homemade gas-closed quartz reactor with a volume of 300 mL under irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) lamp (254 nm, 40 W/cm 2 , 4 W).Briefly, 0.02 g of catalyst and 100 mL deionized water were placed in the reactor.Before irradiation, the reactor was thoroughly purged with CO 2 for 10 min to remove air.During the reaction process, the gas sample was taken from the reactor every 1 h.The gas samples were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC5890, Nanjing kejie instrument) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and methanation equipment."

    "content": "A series of characterization methods were used to verify the structural peculiarities of the obtained materials, concentrating more on the sample OCCN 0.25 .XRD was used to investigate the chemical structures of the OCCN x catalysts.As can be observed in Fig. 1a, both g-CN and OCCN x displayed two distinct characteristic peaks at around 13.0and 27.4, matching well with the diffraction pattern of carbon nitride reported previously 49.The peak at 13.0is attributed to the repeating unit of tri-s-triazine in-plane, and the peak at 27.4is recognized as the interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic system of g-CN 505152.In comparison with g-CN, both the (002) and (100) peak of OCCN x remained unchanged, implying that the main structures of g-CN have been well preserved.However, the intensity of both (100) and (002) peaks decreased with increasing the amount of HMM doping, indicating that the doping of HMM partially breaks the ordered structure of g-CN.Notably, the (100) peak of OCCN 0.5 is almost invisible, implying the rather unordered stacking of tri-s-triazine 21,53.These results demonstrate that the crystallinity of g-CN decreases with the increasing amount of HMM doping, which may lead to the appearance of vacancies.This partially disordered structure of carbon nitride could facilitate the charge separation of electrons and holes to some extent 54. The structures and functional groups of g-CN and OCCN x were also investigated by FT-IR (Fig. 1b).The characteristic peaks at around 810, 1200-1650, and 3000-3600 cm -1 are assigned to the breathing modes of tri-s-triazine heterocycles 41, stretching modes of CN heterocyclic units 55, and vibrating modes of edge eNH 2 or adsorbed eOH, respectively.The characteristic absorption bands of OCCN 0.25 are almost the same as that of observable case of g-CN, demonstrating that the surface functional groups of g-CN are almost unchanged after the doping with HMM.Interestingly, OCCN 0.25 exhibits two small peaks at 2975 and 1053 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the CeH vibration bands of the saturated carbon and CeO vibration bands, respectively 56, demonstrating that some new groups or structures are introduced into g-CN after the doping with HMM.In addition, the intense broad absorption bands of OCCN 0.25 within the range of 3000-3600 cm -1 in comparison to that of g-CN suggests that more adsorbed H 2 O or edge eNH 2 appears on the surface of g-CN after the doping with HMM.Moreover, the Raman spectra of OCCN 0.25 show two intense peaks at 1351 cm -1 (D band) and 1570 cm -1 (G band, Fig. 1c).The D band derives from the surface defects and the imperfections of the structure due to the introduction of C and O-based groups into the structure of g-CN 57.The G band derives from the first-order scattering of the E 2g mode 41.This result demonstrates the presence of surface defects on the OCCN 0.25 which may serve as active sites for the photoreduction of CO 2 , being also in accordance with the XRD results. The solid-state 13 C NMR spectra were taken under the loupe to further elucidate the structural peculiarities of the as-prepared catalysts (Fig. 1d).Both g-CN and OCCN 0.25 show two characteristic peaks at 156.5 and 164.8 ppm, which can be assigned to the carbon chemical shifts of C 3 N and C 2 N-NH x in the heptazine units, respectively 58,59.However, OCCN 0.25 exhibits weaker signal intensity at 156.5 ppm than that of g-CN, indicating that the amount of C 3 N in OCCN 0.25 decreases in comparison with that of g-CN.The results suggest that some of the heptazine units are damaged with the doping of HMM, which is accompanied by the presence of vacancies.Interestingly, several small new peaks are observed in the spectra of OCCN 0.25 , indicating the structural changes of the OCCN x .The peaks found at 213.9 and 221.6 ppm are attributed to the carbonyl carbon, which is derived from the partial oxidation of g-CN 54,60, while the two peaks at 99.4 and 107.8 ppm are assigned to the unsaturated carbon of alkene.Based on the information obtained from XRD, IR, Raman, and 13 C NMR investigations, we can conclude that during the doping procedure of g-CN using HMM, some chemical bonds of g-CN are broken and other/new chemical bonds are formed, accompanied by the introduction of hydroxyl, carbonyl, and alkene groups into the structure of g-CN. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were employed to investigate the physical and structural properties of the samples.All the catalysts present type IV isotherm with deep hysteresis loops within the range of P/P 0 0.4-1.0 (Fig. 2a), indicating the existence of the mesoporous structure of the catalysts.The bigger hysteresis loop of OCCN 0.25 compared with other catalysts suggests that OCCN 0.25 has more pores in its structure, while the pore size distribution indicates that the pore diameter of the samples concentrates within the range of 20-40 nm (Fig. 2b).On the other hand, the specific surface area of OCCN x increases with increasing the amount of doping agent and reaching its maximum of 18.26 m 2 g -1 at OCCN 0.25 (Table 1).Further increasing the amount of HMM leads to reducing specific surface area.This behavior can be explained with the polymerization process, as the small amount of HMM can serve as a pore-making agent to increase the porous structure of OCCN x .However, when a large amount of HMM was used, the incomplete decomposition of excess HMM may block the pores of the catalysts and lead to the reduction of specific surface area.The variation of the pore volume is matching well with that of the specific surface area.The high specific surface area of OCCN 0.25 can contribute to its excellent catalytic performance. The XPS survey spectra were carried out to investigate the surface elemental composition and chemical states of the various elements.Only C, N, and O three main elements are detected in both g-CN and OCCN 0.25 (Fig. 3a).C and O contents increase with the amount of doping agent, accompanied by the decrease of N content, followed by a C/N molar ratio rising from 0.73 of g-CN to 0.83 of OCCN 0.25 (Table 2).These results suggest that C and O are successfully introduced into the structure of OCCN 0.25 by the doping procedure.Moreover, the elemental analysis was performed to get the bulk elemental composition of the samples (Table 3).The bulk O content of g-CN decreases compared with the surface O content, while the O content of OCCN 0.25 varies oppositely, indicating that the introduced O mainly distributes inside of the sample OCCN 0.25 .However, the bulk C content of OCCN 0.25 decreases compared with that of g-CN despite the total C/N ratio increases.Considering the high content of C on the surface of OCCN 0.25 , we can get the conclusion that the introduced C is mainly dispersed on the surface of OCCN 0.25 . High-resolution C 1s, N1s and O 1s XPS spectra were obtained to investigate the existing state of the introduced elements further.The deconvolution of C 1s spectra of both samples show three peaks located at 284.6, 286.1 and 288.0 eV (Fig. 3b), corresponding to the sp 2 hybridized carbon atoms (CeC, CC) 61, the C-NH 2 species of g-CN and the sp 2 hybridized carbon atoms in heptazine (NeCN), respectively 62,63.In comparison with g-CN, the peak areas at 284.6 and 286.1 eV of OCCN 0.25 increases obviously, suggesting that the sp 2 hybridized carbon and amount of C-NH 2 species increase in OCCN 0.25 , in accordance with the IR results.Also, a new peak at 288.9 eV appears in the C 1s spectra of OCCN 0.25 , which can be attributed to the C bonded to the O atoms (CeO, CO) 21,54,56, matching well with the 13 C NMR analysis.Both samples display similar N 1s spectra with core levels at around 398.3, 399.5, 400.8 and 404.3 eV (Fig. 3c), which are assigned to sp 2 hybridized aromatic N (CNeC, N1), the tertiary N bonded to three carbons N-C 3 (N2), the amino groups -NH x (N3) and the -excitations, respectively 646566.It is also found that the peaks located at 399.5 eV of g-CN shifts to a slightly lower position of 399.3 eV for OCCN 0.25 , indicating the chemical environment changes in OCCN 0.25 (Table 4).In addition, the peak area of N1 decreases from 59.76 of g-CN to 52.35 of OCCN 0.25 , while the peak area of N3 grows from 7.81 of g-CN to 9.84 of OCCN 0.25 , implying the partial loss of tri-s-triazine in OCCN 0.25 after the doping procedure using HMM (Table 4), in accordance with C 1s spectra and IR analysis.On the other hand, the O 1s XPS spectra of OCCN 0.25 can be deconvoluted into three main peaks located at 530.7, 531.9 and 533.2 eV (Fig. 3d), corresponding to physically adsorbed oxygen 67, surface adsorbed H 2 O, and the introduced CO (and CeO) groups, respectively 59.The result indicates that O atoms are bonded to C atoms rather than N atoms in heptazine of g-CN.The O in g-CN is ascribed to the adsorbed water.Thus, the O 1s spectra also confirm the successful introduction of Ocontaining groups into the structure of OCCN 0.25 .These O-based functional groups are favorable for enhancing the hydrophilicity and thus, the catalytic activity of OCCN 0.25 68.It is worth to be mentioned that the results of XPS match well with the XRD, IR, and 13 C NMR analysis. According to all the results of the analysis mentioned above, possibly existing forms of introduced O and C atoms in the structure of OCCN x have been proposed, as displayed in Scheme 2. During the thermal condensation process of melamine with HMM, the hydroxymethyl groups of HMM decompose into hydroxyl and methylene active free radicals.The hydroxyl radicals bond to the C atoms to form the CeO bonds (hydroxyl and carbonyl), while the methylene active free radicals embed into the structure of OCCN x to form carbon ring and alkene.Depending on the amount of doping agent, the possible fragments containing C and O functional groups are abbreviated as F1, F2, and F3.The newly introduced O-containing groups in the framework of OCCN x could enhance the hydrophilicity and the amount of defects of the catalyst and serve as active sites to improve the photocatalytic performance 54.Meanwhile, carbonaceous components can modulate the electronic properties and the optical properties of the semiconductors in order to get better catalytic activities 20,56. The optical absorption properties of the catalysts were investigated using UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Fig. 4a).The intrinsic absorption edge of OCCN x displays increasing redshift with rising the amount of doping agent in comparison with the main catalyst.This behavior demonstrates that doping the g-CN with HMM could remarkably enlarge the electron's delocalization range in the OCCN x polymer network and stabilize the photoinduced electrons.Moreover, doping of g-CN with HMM widely extends the light absorption range to almost the whole visible light region, indicating that more light energy can be used/absorbed to induce the photocatalytic reaction.The bandgap of g-CN and OCCN x calculated from the classical Tauc approach show that the OCCN x with higher amount of doping agent displays the narrower bandgap value, ranging from 2.74 eV (g-CN) to 2.00 eV (OCCN 0.5 , Fig. 4b).Furthermore, it is found that the UV-vis absorption spectra of OCCN x exhibit more shoulder-and tail-like features with increasing the amount of HMM.Given the results above, we can suppose that an additional electron transition approach may exist in OCCN x except for the intrinsic electron transition in g-CN from the valance band (VB) to the conduction band (CB).Together with the previous reports and the structures of OCCN x , we can suppose that the intramolecular charge transfer transition (CTT) is the other charge transfer pathway in OCCN x 38. CTT is a kind of electron transition mode that can be found in many organic molecules, which needs the participation of both electron donor and electron acceptor.Under irradiation, the electrons of the donor are excited to the orbital of the acceptor tightly bonded to the donor 38.According to previous reports, atoms or groups with lone pair electrons often can play the role of electron donor, and aromatics act as electron acceptors 31,38.Therefore, in OCCN x the O-containing parts were thought to act as electron donor because of the lone pair electrons originated from oxygen atoms, while C-containing portions play the role of electron acceptor because of its strong ability of delocalization (due to the incorporation of ethylene groups).The donor-acceptor structures and charge carrier excitation/recombination process are illustrated in Fig. 5a.The electrons on the HOMO of the donor will be excited to the LUMO of the acceptor upon irradiation of light.The electron transition mode in g-CN and OCCN x is proposed in Fig. 5b.A similar electron transition process can be observed on the interface between semiconductor and dye, or two different semiconductors, which is referred to as interfacial CTT 69,70.The absorption edges of OCCN x being gradually red-shift with increasing HMM doping amount suggests that the bandgap between HOMO and LUMO is reduced with rising donor-acceptor content.However, the light absorption region of OCCN 0.5 is slightly decreased in comparison with that of OCCN 0.25 .This may result from that excess HMM doping amount introduces more defects in the structure of OCCN 0.5 which destroys the donor-acceptor configuration and the corresponding CTT. The PL spectra of g-CN exhibit a broad emission band at around 460 nm, corresponding to the intrinsic emission originating from VB to CB of g-CN (Fig. 6a).The PL spectra emission intensity of OCCN 0.25 is remarkably reduced in comparison with that of g-CN, indicating the substantially decreased rate of electron-hole recombination.The result means that the introduction of donor-acceptor arrangement can efficiently facilitate the separation of photoinduced charge carriers.The magnified PL spectra of OCCN 0.25 shows two distinct emission bands at 440 and 460 nm, being attributed to the intrinsic emission of g-CN, the charge transfer emission between donor and acceptor, respectively (Fig. 6a) 38.The typical dual-band optical absorption and PL spectra were also observed in other polymers with donor-acceptor structures 30,71,72.Thus, the PL spectra analysis can further confirm the existence of donor-acceptor assemblies in OCCN x .According to previous reports, the electrons and holes in intrinsic VB to CB transition of g-CN are in the same tri-s-triazine ring 49,73, which makes them easy to recombine with each other, leading to a reduced lifetime of the charge carriers.On the contrary, electrons and holes can be located at two separate regions (acceptor moiety and donor moiety, as shown in Fig. 5a) in the case of CTT, which significantly reduces the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes.Moreover, the delocalized aromatic structures of donor and acceptor can stabilize the photoinduced charge carriers, which further decreases the recombination rate, and prolonging their lifetime.EPR was performed to support further the conclusions enlisted above.The EPR results show that OCCN 0.25 displays an excellent electron delocalization property compared with g-CN (Fig. 6b), result in accordance with the results mentioned above 74.The large delocalized structure significantly inhibits the recombination of charge carriers.Furthermore, the intense EPR signal of OCCN 0.25 in comparison with that of g-CN suggests a high concentration of lone pair electrons, which is favorable for photocatalytic reaction. The desired photocatalytic performance of a catalyst depends not only on the optical absorption ability and electron-hole separation efficiency but also on the hydrophilicity and transferability of charge carriers 68,75.The EIS and transient photocurrent investigations are employed to understand the charge carrier transferability on g-CN and OCCN 0.25 .The transient photocurrent of OCCN 0.25 is 15.4 A cm -2 , which is about 4 times higher than that of g-CN under light illumination (Fig. 6c).The intensity of the photocurrent depends on the separation rate of photoexcited charge carriers to the electrode from semiconductor as well as the recombination rate of photoinduced electronhole at the interface 41,76.Therefore, the intensity of the photocurrent in the case of OCCN 0.25 in comparison with the g-CN demonstrates that doping of g-CN with HMM could effectively facilitate the electron-hole separation on the catalyst.EIS was performed to examine the photoinduced charge carrier transferability further, as it is presented in Fig. 6d.It can be observed that, OCCN 0.25 presents a much smaller arc radius in the EIS plot compared with that of g-CN, demonstrating that doping of HMM into the structure of g-CN could efficiently increase the rate of the charge transport.The high electronhole separation efficiency, reduced electron-hole recombination rate, and enhanced charge carrier migration ability are all supposed to facilitate the photocatalytic performance of OCCN 0.25 .Apart from the properties mentioned above, the bandgap structures also can play a critical role in the photoreduction of CO 2 .Mott-Schottky plots of g-CN and OCCN 0.25 were measured to calculate their orbital energy levels (Fig. 7a).The positive slope found in the case of these two catalysts indicates that both of them are n-type semiconductors.It can also be seen that the flat-band (FB) potential of g-CN and OCCN 0.25 are -1.22 and -1.02 eV (vs.Ag/AgCl), which are respectively converted to -1.02 and -0.82 V (vs.NHE) 20.According to previous reports, the CB of most n-type semiconductors is about 0.1 V below the FB potentials 77,78.Thus, the potential of CB of both materials is calculated, being -1.12 and -0.92 V (vs.NHE), respectively.According to the bandgap energy values of these two samples obtained from the Tauc plots (Fig. 3b), the VB potentials of g-CN and OCCN 0.25 are calculated to be 1.62 and 1.11 V (vs.NHE).The decreasing orbital energy levels of the doped material in comparison with that of g-CN indicates that doping with HMM can modulate the energy levels of g-CN.As shown in Fig. 7b, the CB potential of OCCN 0.25 (-0.92 V) is more negative than the reduction potentials of all the CO 2 products presented in the figure.Thus, OCCN 0.25 possesses an appropriate bandgap to reduce CO 2 to the desired hydrocarbon fuels such as CO and CH 4 .Considering the significantly enhanced optical and electronic properties of OCCN 0.25 compared with that of g-CN, it is expected to present remarkably improved catalytic activity toward photoreduction of CO 2 . The catalytic performance of the catalysts was evaluated by the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 .The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was carried out in an aqueous system in the absence of any solvent or sacrificial agent to meet the requirements of green chemistry.Irradiation with UV light was utilized to drive the reduction reaction of CO 2 .The catalytic activity of various samples is displayed in Fig. 8a, carbon monoxide (CO) was detected as the dominant product.Besides, negligible methane was also observed.Under UV light irradiation, g-CN gives a CO evolution rate of 8.11 mol g -1 in 4 h, increased by the amount of HMM doping, reaching the highest when the HMM/melamine mass ratio is 1/4 (OCCN 0.25 ), being with a 4.3-fold higher than that of g-CN.However, further increasing the amount of doping agents leads to reduced activity, as indicated by the CO evolution rate of OCCN 0.5 .This may result from the massive amounts of vacancies due to the excess amount of HMM, which acts as recombination centers for electron/hole pairs, and leads to the reduction of photocatalytic performance. The operational stability of OCCN 0.25 in the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was also investigated through four successive cycles.After each run, the reaction system was thoroughly purged with N 2 to eliminate the produced CO, and then, the reaction was performed in the same way as a typical catalytic reaction.As shown in Fig. 8b, after four successive cycles, the evolution rate of CO using OCCN 0.25 is almost the same as the fresh catalyst, indicating that the catalytic activity of the material is well retained.The results demonstrate that the prepared catalyst is highly durable in the reaction, which makes it a promising candidate for practical applicability. DFT was utilized to get insight into the mechanism of the intramolecular photo-induced electron transfer process.The calculation was based on three representative fragments (F1, F2, F3, Fig. 9a) due to the complex structure of the catalyst.The calculation of the theoretical energy levels was based on the structural model of the three fragments.According to the results of calculation, the O-containing fragments play the role of the electron donor, and the C-containing fragments act as the electron acceptor.Furthermore, the heterocycle with O atom in its cyclic structure presents a stronger electron donor nature than the heterocycle with O atom outside its cyclic structure.As presented in Fig. 9b, in the case of fragments F1 and F3, HOMO mainly localizes on the heterocycle unit with O atom in its structure, while LUMO mainly locates on heterocycle unit with ethylene group, suggesting the spatial separation of HOMO and LUMO.However, in the fragment of F2, HOMO localizes uniformly on the fragment, but the LUMO mostly localizes on heterocycle units with the ethylene group, implying the incomplete spatial separation of HOMO and LUMO.The spatial split of HOMO and LUMO may significantly facilitate the separation of the charge carriers via the HOMO-LUMO transition.F1 and F3 fragments can deliver excellent charge separation efficiency due to the spatial effects, being ideal for photocatalytic reactions.Thus, in g-CN with donor-acceptor approaches, the higher content of F1 and F3 fragments are beneficial for improved photocatalytic performance.However, with increasing the amount of HMM doping agent, the increasing number of F2 fragment can reduce the electron relay system.According to the experimental results and characterization, the optimized doping amount of HMM is 0.25, the resulting OCCN 0.25 presents the best charge carrier separation efficiency, and exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity. Taking into account the experimental data and DFT simulation results, a possible reaction mechanism is proposed and illustrated in Fig. 10.Under irradiation with UV light, the electrons on the VB of g-CN and HOMO of the donor are excited to the CB of g-CN and LUMO of the acceptor, respectively.Then the electrons on the CB of g-CN are"

    "content": "In summary, a series of g-CN based materials with donor-acceptor structures (OCCN x ) were prepared by incorporating C and O into the structure of the g-CN polymeric network.These photocatalysts were used to catalyze the photoreduction of CO 2 to hydrocarbon fuels in water in the absence of any co-catalyst and sacrificial agent.The best photocatalytic activity was observed applying OCCN 0.25 under irradiation of UV light with a CO production rate 4.3 times higher than that of bulk g-CN.The excellent photocatalytic activity of OCCN 0.25 was attributed to the incorporation of donor-acceptor configurations into the g-CN network, which substantially improved its light-harvesting ability, narrowed its bandgap, and improved its electron-hole separation efficiency.Also, hydroxyl and carbonyl groups resulting from the introduced O greatly enhanced the hydrophilicity of OCCN 0.25 , which is advantageous for the photoreduction of CO 2 .Moreover, the catalyst was highly stable during the reaction, and the catalytic performance was almost unchanged after four successive reactions.This work not only offers an efficient, green and environmentally friendly photocatalyst for reduction of CO 2 but also provides a new pathway for constructing donor-acceptor structures in g-CN, which may serve as a reference for other researchers.
