    "content": "The photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into energy-rich CH 4 solar fuel is an ideal strategy for future energy generation as it can resolve global warming and imminent energy crisis concurrently.However, the efficiency of this technology is unavoidably hampered by the ineffective generation and utilization of photoinduced charge carriers.In this contribution, we report a facile in situ topotactic transformation approach, where 001-faceted BiOBr nanosheets (BOB-NS) were employed as the starting material for the formation of single-crystalline ultrathin Bi 2 WO 6 nanosheets (BWO-NS).The as-obtained BWO-NS not only preserved the advantageous properties of 2D nanostructure and predominantly exposed 001 facets, but also possessed enlarged specific surface area as a result of sample thickness reduction.In opposed to the commonly observed bandgap broadening when the particle sizes decrease to ultrathin nanoscale owing to the quantum size effect, the developed BWO-NS exhibited a fascinating bandgap narrowing compared to pristine Bi 2 WO 6 nanoplates (BWO-P) synthesized from conventional one-step hydrothermal approach.Moreover, the electronic band positions of BWO-NS were modulated resulting from the ion exchange for reconstruction of energy bands, where BWO-NS demonstrated significant upshifting of CB and VB levels, which are beneficial for photocatalytic reduction applications.This propitious design of BWO-NS through integrating the merits of BOB-NS rendered BWO-NS to exhibit a substantial 2.6-fold and 9.3-fold enhancement of CH 4 production over BOB-NS and BWO-P, respectively."

    "content": "All chemicals used in the synthesis of photocatalysts were of analytical grade and used as received without any further purification.Bismuth (III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO 3 ) 3 The fabrication of BiOBr nanosheets (BOB-NS) has been reported in our previous work. 30In brief, 5 mmol of KBr was dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water and the stoichiometric amount of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O was added slowly into the solution.The pH of the solution was altered to 6 using 2.0 M NaOH.Subsequently, the mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 1 h, then transferred to a 125 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave.The autoclave was kept at 160 o C for 12 h.After completion of reaction, the resulting precipitate was collected and washed repeatedly with ethanol and deionized water.Lastly, the product was dried in an air oven at 60 o C for 12 h. The Bi 2 WO 6 nanosheets (BWO-NS) with single-crystallinity and dominantly exposed 001 facets were formed from a hydrothermal anion exchange treatment involving metathesis reaction. Prior to the hydrothermal process, 1.5 mmol of the as-developed BOB-NS was dispersed in 120 mL of aqueous solution containing 1 mmol of Na 2 WO 4 2H 2 O.The mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature.Subsequently, the mixture solution was transferred to a 200 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was maintained at 140 o C for 12 h under autogenous pressure.Upon completion of reaction, the autoclave was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature.Then, the precipitate was collected by filtration and washed repeatedly with ethanol and deionized water for several times.Finally, the obtained product was dried in an air oven at 60 o C for 12 h. For comparison, pristine Bi 2 WO 6 nanoplates (BWO-P) were prepared through one-step hydrothermal process without using BiOBr as starting material.Briefly, 1 mmol of Na 2 WO 4 2H 2 O was dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water and the solution was added dropwise into 70 mL of deionized water containing 2 mmol of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O.The mixture solution was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 1 h, then transferred to a 125 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave.The autoclave was maintained at 140 o C for 24 h under autogenous pressure.After completion of reaction, the autoclave was cooled naturally to room temperature and the resulting precipitate was filtered and washed repeatedly with ethanol and deionized water for several times. The final product was subjected to oven drying at 60 o C for 12 h. The crystallographic phase of the as-developed samples was acquired by a X-ray diffractometer equipped with a UV cut-off filter to simulate visible light ( 400 nm). The computations were performed using Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) within the ultrasoft pseudopotential approach. All the proposed geometrical structures were optimized by generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) of exchange-correlation functional.A kinetic energy cut-off of 400 eV and Monkhorst-Pack mesh of 331 were adopted for the geometry optimization and electronic property calculations.The convergence criteria were set as 210 -5 eV/atom for energy, 0.05 eV/A for maximum force, 0.001 GPa for maximum pressure and 0.002 A for maximum displacement. To evaluate the photoactivities of the as-developed photocatalysts, CO 2 photoreduction experiments were performed over all the samples in a continuous gas flow reactor, as delineated in Fig. S1.To mimic natural surroundings, the experiment conditions were maintained at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature.Prior to the experiments, photocatalysts were uniformly coated on glass rods, and the glass rods were loaded into quartz columns which positioned under light source.Subsequently, high purity CO 2 gas (99.999 ) was directed through H 2 O, and the humidified CO 2 gas was channeled to the quartz columns to allow intimate contact between the reactant gas and coated photocatalysts.The flowrate of gas was maintained at 50 mL/min for 30 min, in order to evacuate excess air from the reactor and also to ensure adsorptiondesorption equilibrium was achieved on the sample surface.Thereafter, the flowrate was reduced to 5 mL/min and kept constant for 8 h under visible light irradiation, which was supplied by a 300W Xenon arc lamp equipped with UV cut-off filter to provide 400 nm.To avoid light interference from the surroundings, the whole reactor setup was enclosed in a black box.The reaction products were collected at every 1 h interval and qualitatively analyzed by online gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7820A) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD).The total production yield of CH 4 from the photocatalytic reaction was quantified using Eq.1: (1) where and are the final and initial concentration of CH 4 , is the volumetric flowrate of product gas, and is the amount of photocatalysts used in the experiment."

    "content": "For the fabrication of single-crystalline Bi 2 WO 6 ultrathin nanosheets with predominantly exposed 001 facets, the ultrathin BiOBr nanosheets developed in our previous work 30 Since the solubility product constant (K sp ) of Bi 2 WO 6 is minuscule compared to BiOBr, the reaction of BiOBr with Na 2 WO 4 is thermodynamically favorable according to Le Chatelier's Principle.Besides, Eq. 2 also discloses that NaBr is a possible by-product from this chemical reaction.Fortunately, the non-polar NaBr is highly soluble in water, endowing it to be easily removed during the sample washing process, which will be further evidenced later.Interestingly, the as-obtained BWO-NS from the in situ topotactic transformation route was appeared to be thinner than BOB-NS.This could be attributed to the nanoscale Kirkendall effect resulted from the fast outward diffusion rate of Br -ions and slow inward diffusion rate of WO 4 2-ions.Since the employed starting material BOB-NS is of ultrathin 2D nanosheet structure, the mass transport discrepancy resulted in the intriguing decrease in the sample thickness, which is demonstrated for the very first time. Based on the FESEM image (Fig. 1A), BWO-NS was observed to be in 2D ultrathin nanostructure with lateral length ranges from 70 -500 nm and thickness of ca. 8 nm (Fig. 1A inset).In spite of the considerably difference in the atomic arrangements between tetragonal BiOBr and orthorhombic Bi 2 WO 6 , this in situ anion exchange process does not seem to compromise or degrade the 2D morphology of the samples as no pulverization could be observed.On the contrary, the BWO-NS appeared to be much thinner than the pristine Bi 2 WO 6 nanoplates (BWO-P) synthesized from conventional one-step hydrothermal process (thickness ranges from 36-83 nm, as shown in Fig. S3B).This renders BWO-NS to possess larger exposure of reactive facets and also reduce the transportation distance of the photogenerated charge carriers from the interior to the surface.From the TEM image in Fig. 2B, the nearly transparent appearance of BWO-NS further elucidates the ultrathin nature of the BWO-NS.The HRTEM image (Fig. 1C) of BWO-NS Of note, the predominantly exposed 001 facet is highly desirable as 001 facet is the most reactive facet of Bi 2 WO 6 for reduction-related reactions. 34,35Furthermore, the SAED pattern (Fig. 1D) over a large piece of the nanosheet displays a single set of well-defined electron diffraction spots, manifesting the single-crystalline nature of the BWO-NS.Moreover, this set of diffraction spots can be well-indexed to the diffraction pattern of 001 zone axis, suggesting that BWO-NS possesses predominantly exposed 001 facets, as illustrated in Fig. 1E.On the other hand, the EDX mapping and spectrum (Fig. 1F -1I and Fig. S4) revealed the homogenous distribution of Bi, W and O elements in BWO-NS, where no Br or Na element could be detected, which confirmed that our proposed in situ anion exchange process through metathesis route is a feasible and effective approach to transform BiOBr into Bi 2 WO 6 . To provide fingerprint evidence for the successful formation of orthorhombic Bi peaks were detected, it indicates that the as-developed BWO-NS is of single phase and without any secondary impurity formation.It is worth noting that BWO-NS possesses higher XRD intensity than the BOB-NS, suggesting that the in situ growth approach can greatly enhance the crystallinity of the sample.More importantly, the relative intensity ratio of (200)/(020) peak to (113) peak was measured to be ca.0.518, which is far higher than the standard ratio of 0.185.This implies that BWO-NS has preferred anisotropic growth along the (200)/(020) plane, 36,37 resulting in the formation of ultrathin sheet-like nanostructures with highly exposed 001 facets, which were in line with the observations from HRTEM and SAED. Further evidence of complete transformation of BiOBr into Bi 2 WO 6 was provided by XPS analysis.The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 2B) revealed the presence Bi, O and Br elements in the BOB-NS, which is in accordance with the elemental composition of BiOBr.After the in situ topotactic transformation, W element was clearly observed in the XPS survey spectrum of BWO-NS, where none of the peak attributed to Br and Na could be found.This further attested that BOB-NS served as a raw material for the formation of high-purity Bi 2 WO 6 , where the by-product NaBr was completely removed from the filtration process.From the high-resolution Bi 4f XPS spectra (Fig. 2C), two spin-orbit doublets represented by the levels of Bi The structural changes resulting from the topotactic transformation of BiOBr into Bi 2 WO 6 were reflected by Raman spectra in Fig. 2G.For BOB-NS sample, the intense peaks positioned at 59 and 115 cm -1 were attributed to the A 1g internal stretching mode of Bi-Br. 38The small peak located at 93 cm -1 was ascribable to the A 1g first-order vibration modes of Bi metal, whereas the peak at 162 cm -1 was resulted from the E 1g stretching mode of Bi-Br. 39Of note, all these peaks could be well-indexed to the Raman peaks of BiOBr.After the metathesis reaction of transforming BOB-NS into BWO-NS, significant changes in the exhibited peaks were observed, where all these peaks were changed to the characteristic peaks of Bi 2 WO 6 .As shown in Fig. 2G, the peak positioned at 714 cm -1 could be assigned to the antisymmetric bridging mode arisen from the tungstate chains, whereas the peaks at 791 and 822 cm -1 were interpreted as the antisymmetric and symmetric A g modes of terminal O-W-O modes, 40 respectively.In addition, the strong peak at 301 cm -1 was associated with the translational mode originated from the simultaneous motion of Bi 3 and WO 6 6-ions.For other peaks fall below 520 cm -1 , these peaks were ascribable to the bending and stretching vibrations of the BiO 6 polyhedron, WO 6 octahedron and Bi-O bonds. 41nce all the Raman peaks exhibited by the BWO-NS were in good agreement with the characteristic peaks of Bi 2 WO 6, this provides another undeniable evidence for the successful transformation of tetragonal BiOBr into orthorhombic Bi 2 WO 6 .Combining the observations from FESEM, HRTEM, SAED, XRD, XPS and Raman analyses, it is undeniable that single-crystalline 001-faceted Bi 2 WO 6 ultrathin nanosheets have been successfully formed, providing prerequisites for studying the importance of these propitious characteristics toward enhanced photocatalytic performance. The photoabsorption and electronic band structures of semiconductor photocatalysts play pivotal roles in deciding the photoactivities.In this regard, the optical properties of the samples were analyzed using UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.From Fig. 2H, the absorption edge of BOB-NS was measured to be ca.435 nm, corresponding to a bandgap energy of 2.85 eV (Fig. After in situ topotactic transformation, the bandgap of the as-developed BWO-NS was significantly reduced to 2.55 eV.For comparison, the bandgap of pristine BWO-P was estimated as 2.70 eV, which was tally with the bandgap energy of Bi 2 WO 6 reported in our previous works 41,42 and literature 43,44 .Therefore, it signifies that this current work demonstrates an elegant example for bandgap engineering of Bi 2 WO 6 without involving any surface defects or heteroatoms, where no midgap states or impurities states were formed and it allows direct band-to-band strong visible light absorption.More intriguingly, this observation of bandgap reduction opposed to the common phenomenon of bandgap broadening when the sample thickness decreases to ultrathin nanoscale ( 10 nm) as a result of the quantum size effect. 4546647 What causes this work to deviate from the firm belief of widely accepted facts?To unveil the reasons behind these, theoretical calculations and experimental analysis were carried out to divulge the electronic band structures of the samples. The total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) of BOB-NS and BWO-P were determined from first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and shown in Fig. and BWO-NS were estimated to be ca.1.06, 1.12 and 0.85 V, respectively.Incorporating the bandgap energies determined from Tauc plots, the CBM of BOB-NS, BWO-P and BWO-NS were found to position at -1.79, -1.58 and -1.70 V, respectively (Fig. 3D).Therefore, it signifies that this in situ transformation process has profound impacts on the electronic structures of the samples, in which a significant upshifting of CBM and VBM was observed for BWO-NS compared to the conventional BWO-P.This is highly favourable as the photoinduced electrons of BWO-NS were positioned at a more negative potential, rendering it to exhibit stronger reduction power in driving the reaction of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.Moreover, the replacement of Br 4s 4p orbitals with W 5d orbitals in the BWO-NS resulted in the bandgap narrowing, which could be attributed to the well-known mystical effects of ion exchange for reconstruction of energy bands. 48,49Indisputably, this revolution will contribute positively to the utilization of solar energy and reducibility of the photocatalyst, which will be corroborated by the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments. To study the effect of in situ topotactic transformation on the photoreduction performance, gas phase photocatalytic reduction of CO with UV cut-off filter was employed as the light source in order to avoid the formation of photoinduced oxygen vacancies on BOB-NS to ensure a fair comparison between the samples.BET analysis revealed that BWO-NS exhibited an enlarged specific surface area (14.10 m 2 /g) compared to pristine BWO-P (8.24 m 2 /g) and BOB-NS (12.47 m 2 /g) owing to the Kirkendall effect during the topotactic transformation.Thirdly, a noticeable bandgap narrowing along with the up-shifting of CB for BWO-NS endowed more electron-hole pairs to be generated upon light irradiation and the strong reduction power of BWO-NS was beneficial for the CO 2 conversion. Finally, this in situ growth process of BWO-NS resulted in a much enhanced crystallinity (as evidenced by XRD and XPS), which favours the separation and migration of photoinduced charge carriers.To confirm this, transient photocurrent responses and EIS Nyquist plots of the samples were examined to unravel the behaviours of charge carriers.As can be seen from Fig. S6A in the supporting information, the BWO-NS exhibited the highest photocurrent intensity, followed by BOB-NS and lastly, BWO-P.This observation is in good agreement with the results obtained from the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments, further affirming that this topotactic transformation played a pivotal role for enhancing the generation and separation of electron-hole pairs.Similar trend was also observed in the EIS Nyquist plots.Typically, a smaller arc radius indicates an accelerated interfacial charge transfer owing to the lower electron transfer resistance and better separation of photogenerated charge carriers. 5051152 As depicted in Fig. S6B, BWO-NS demonstrated smaller arc radii than BOB-NS and BWO-P under both dark and visible light illumination.These observations indicate that the surface-engineered BWO-NS with single-crystalline ultrathin nanosheets can effectively generate and direct the electron-hole pairs to the surface active sites, thereby the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers was thwarted.As widely accepted, the self-built internal electric field along the slabs of Bi 2 WO 6 favours the separation of electron-hole pairs to the opposite sides of the layered structures. 53,54Coincidentally, the reduction of BWO-NS to ultrathin thickness can greatly shorten the travel distance of charge carriers from the interior to the surface.As illustrated in Fig. 5, the ultrathin BWO-NS rendered ultrafast migration of photogenerated electrons to the most reactive 001 facets, where these spatially separated electrons were effectively consumed for photocatalytically converting CO 2 into CH 4 .This eminently highlights the importance of this in situ topotactic transformation process, where it enables the merits of BOB-NS to be preserved while engendering favourable changes in the structures, physiochemical and optical properties in BWO-NS.In addition, comparing the BWO-NS obtained from topotactic transformation with pristine BWO-P synthesized from conventional one-step hydrothermal process, the proposed topotactic transformation approach in this work demonstrates unusual photocatalytic enhancement without changing the chemical composition of the photocatalysts.This indicates the developed strategy could also be extended for the modifications of other metal oxides at atomic level."

    "content": "In summary, we have demonstrated a facile topotactic transformation approach for the synthesis of ultrathin BWO-NS from BOB-NS.Other than preserving the 2D nanostructure and dominantly exposed 001 facets, the BWO-NS exhibited enlarged specific surface area and improved crystallinity compared to the pristine BWO-P synthesized from one-step hydrothermal process. More importantly, a fascinating bandgap narrowing and upshifting of CB resulting from the mystical effects of ion exchange for reconstruction of energy bands were observed for BWO-NS. Integrating these propitious properties into a single-photocatalyst, BWO-NS exhibited a total CH 4 production yield of 8.02 mol/g after 8 h of reaction under visible light, manifesting a significant 2.6-fold and 9.3-fold improvement of CH 4 production over BOB-NS and BWO-P, respectively.This production yield is impressive for a standalone photocatalyst without involving any cocatalysts, dopants or artificial defects.As a whole, this work delivered an ingenious approach to boost the performance of a standalone photocatalyst through combining the virtues of both photocatalysts, and we believe that our work would bring a step closer towards the rational optimization of efficient photocatalyst design.

Fig.4A and 4Bshow the CH 4 production yield over the BWO-NS, BOB-NS and BWO-P after 8 h of reaction under visible light illumination.In comparison to BOB-NS and BWO-NS, the control sample BWO-P showed minimal CH 4 production, with a total yield of only 0.86 mol/g.This observation is in line with the theoretical expectation, in which pristine Bi 2 WO 6 with uncontrolled surface structures and exposed facets may render plenty bulk recombination centre as well as promoting the competition between reduction and oxidation reactions.On the contrary, BWO-NS exhibited a remarkable CH 4 yield of 8.02 mol/g after 8 h of reaction, which demonstrated a substantial 2.6-fold and 9.3-fold enhancement over BOB-NS and BWO-P, respectively.Moreover, the photostability tests over BWO-NS revealed a remarkable stability of 93.6 after 3 successive test cycles of CO 2 photoreduction under identical experimental conditions (Fig.S5A and S5B), which manifested the suitability of BWO-NS for repeated usage.This superior photocatalytic activity of BWO-NS was attributed to several synergistic factors.Firstly, the careful design of BWO-NS for ultrathin thickness with predominantly exposed 001 facets rendered a large exposure of the most reactive facets for photoreduction reactions.Secondly, Figure 5.
