    "content": "For the excellent optical property and unique electronic structure, halide perovskite has been employed as a photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction.However, the photocatalytic performance is relatively poor.Herein, we demonstrate a new strategy with Mn-doped CsPb(Br/Cl)3 mixed-halide perovskites as catalysts to enhance the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction.Via tuning the content of Mn, a serial of CsPb(Br/Cl)3:Mn perovskites are obtained and show high efficiency in CO2 conversion to CO and CH4.Especially, for the optimum catalyst of sample, the yields of CO and CH4 are up to 1917 mol/g and 82 mol/g which are 14.2 and 1.4 folds higher than the ones of CsPbBr3.This work provides new insights to improve the reactivity of perovskites in CO2 photoreduction."

    "content": "All chemicals were directly used without further purification.Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99, Aladdin), lead (II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.5, Aladdin), manganese (II) chloride (MnCl2, 99.5, Aladdin), oleylamine (OAm, technical grade 90, Aladdin), oleic acid (OA, technical grade 90, Aladdin), 1octadecene (ODE, technical grade 90, Aladdin), ethyl acetate (AR, Aladdin), hexanes (AR, Aladdin). Preparation of precursor Cs-oleate 1.First of all, Cs2CO3 (0.8140 g), OA (2.5 mL) and ODE (10 mL) were put into a 50-mL 2-neck round bottomed flask, and then the flask was excluded air for about 5 minutes at room temperature.Afterward the flask was full of nitrogen and was vacuumed at 120 C for 30 minutes, hereafter retaining 120 C until the solution becomes transparent.It should be noticed to heat the Cs-oleate completely before applying. Synthesis of Mn-doped CsPb(Br/Cl)3 mixed-halide perovskites and CsPbBr3 nanocrystals 1.Take CsPbBr3 nanocrystals as an example.PbBr2 (0.18 mmol), OAm (0.8 mL), OA (0.8 mL), and ODE (5 mL) were added to a 50-mL 2-neck round bottomed flask.After that, the system was evacuated and refilled with nitrogen for 30 minutes at 120 C.And then the solution was heated to185 C, OAm (0.8 mL) and OA (0.8 mL) were injected to the system.Subsequently the Cs-oleate (0.064 mL) was immediately injected into the reaction and the solution was cooled by an ice bath after 5 seconds.The CsPbBr3 was washed for three times with 3 mL hexane and 30 mL ethyl acetate.For Mn-doped CsPb(Br/Cl)3 mixed-halide perovskite, named as sample 1-4, is synthesized by adding different ratio of PbBr2/MnCl2 (4:1, 2:1, 2:3, 3:7) with total mole amount of 0.18mmol, OAm (0.8 mL), OA (0.8 mL), and ODE (5 mL) into a 50-mL 2neck round bottomed flask. The same amount of Mn-doped CsPb(Br/Cl)3 mixed-halide perovskite was evenly coated on the ITO substrate (with the size of 1 cm1 cm).And then the ITO substrate was dried at room temperature.Photocurrent test was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660e, CH Instruments, Inc., USA).The self-prepared photoelectrode, Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt-flake electrode individually as working, reference and counter electrode formed a three-electrode configuration.The testing conditions were carried out under the same light source and similar light intensity compared to the photocatalytic reduction. The photocatalytic reaction was accomplished in a 50 mL transparent quartz tube.0.5 mg Mn-doped CsPb(Br/Cl)3 mixed-halide perovskite and 6 mL ethyl acetate were added into the tube as the catalyst and solvent, respectively.The system was inflated CO2 for 20 minutes to remove the air and build a full of CO2 atmosphere.The temperature of this system was controlled at 20 C through a circulating cooling water.The reaction was irradiated by a 300 W xenon lamp with a 1.5 AM filter for 9 hours.After that, the gas product were gathered and analyzed by GC.The as-synthesized Mn-doped CsPb(Br/Cl)3 mixed-halide perovskites and CsPbBr3 were firstly prepared by the reported hot-injection method with minor modifications 1.According to the powder X-ray diffraction pattern (PXRD), all the samples appear diffraction peaks at the same position, which indicates the same construction of the perovskites with different amounts of manganese (Figure 1e). Figure 1(a-d) shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Mn-doped CsPb(Br/Cl)3 mixed-halide perovskites.All of them have a cubic shape and small size of around 10 nm, which provide a large specific surface area for photocatalysis.To investigate the effect of Mn-doped amounts on the absorbance of Mn-doped CsPb(Br/Cl)3 mixed-halide perovskites, the UV-vis absorption spectra are characterized.In Figure 2a, the absorbance of sample 1 and sample 2 are stronger than that of CsPbBr3 under the visible light range.As the doping content of Mn increases, the absorption intensity drops significantly for sample 3 and sample 4. The results show that the Mn element in perovskites could affect the absorption property.For emission spectra, the intensity decreases gradually with the increase of Mn 2 amount in Mndoped CsPb(Br/Cl)3 mixed-halide perovskites (Figure 2b), which illustrates the reduced combination of electrons and holes for the Mn-doped mixed-halide perovskites.The band gap of Mn-doped perovskites taking sample 2 as the example is calculated to be 2.30 eV by (hv) 2 versus hv curve in Figure 2c.To verify the photocatalytic performance of Mn-doped CsPb(Br/Cl)3 mixed-halide perovskites, the CO2 reduction was conducted under visible-light irradiation with ethyl acetate as the solvent, without photosensitizer.Figure 3a displays the amounts of CO and CH4 in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, which alters with the change of manganese content in perovskites.When using sample 1 as a catalyst, the yields of CO and CH4 equal to 767 mol/g and 108"

To illuminate the stability of Mn-doped perovskites, we examined the crystalline phase after photocatalysis.The PXRD patterns of these materials after catalysis were basically kept intact, but a few new peaks (CsPb2Br5) appeared (Figure 4).Interestingly, CsPbBr3 and sample l emerge more obviously impure peaks than the other three materials.These results demonstrate that Mn-doped mixedhalide strategy is beneficial for the stability of perovskites in some extent.Due to the importance of charge separation in the redox reaction, the transient photocurrent responses are carried out under Xe-300 lamp irradiation or in the dark to unveil the good performance of Mn-doped CsPb(Br/Cl)3 mixed-halide perovskites in CO2 reduction.In Figure 5, the photocurrent results display that the photocurrent intensity of sample 1 and 2 exceeding sample 3 and 4, is of 7.4 and 6.8 A cm -2 which is 40 higher than that of bare CsPbBr3 indicating more photogenerated electrons in sample 1 and sample 2. According to the above mentioned results of UV-visible absorption, sample 1 and 2 have better absorption performance than other samples.However, the emission spectrum shows that the recombination of electrons and holes for sample 2 is quite lower than the one of sample 1.These may lead to excellent photocatalytic performance of sample 2."
