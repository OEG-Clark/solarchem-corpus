    "content": "SrNb2O6 and Sr2Nb2O7 were prepared by a flux method.To fabricate SrNb2O6, 2 g of Nb2O5 powder (99.9,Wako) and 6 g of SrCl26H2O (99.9,Wako) were ground in an alumina mortar for 5 min.SrCl26H2O was used as the precursor and flux reagent.The mixture was calcined in air using an alumina crucible at 1173 K for 2 h.After calcination, the obtained powder was thoroughly washed three times with hot water (353 K) to remove the residual salt and dried at 353 K in an oven.The process of synthesizing Sr2Nb2O7 was almost the same as that of synthesizing SrNb2O6, except for the use of SrCO3 (99.9,Wako) as the precursor.Modification using a Ag cocatalyst was performed by chemical reduction (CR), impregnation (IMP), and photodeposition (PD) methods.For modification by CR method, the obtained SrNb2O6 or Sr2Nb2O7 (1.5 g) was suspended into a 50 mL aqueous solution of AgNO3 (0.1 M), followed by the dropwise addition of a NaPH2O2 (0.4 M) solution into the suspension.After stirring the mixture at 358 K for 1.5 h, it was filtered and dried at room temperature.For modification by IMP method, SrNb2O6 (1.5 g) was homogeneously dispersed in an aqueous AgNO3 solution, followed by evaporation at 358 K to remove water and calcination at 723 K for 2 h in air. Modification by PD method was carried out in situ during the photocatalytic conversion of CO2.The synthetic details have been reported in our previous studies 24,27.Generally, 1.5 g of SrNb2O6 powder was dispersed in 1.0 L of ultra-pure water containing a required amount of AgNO3, and the dissolved air in the solution was completely degassed by a flow of Ar gas.The suspension was irradiated under a 400 W high-pressure Hg lamp with a quartz filter using an inner-irradiation-type reaction vessel with Ar gas flowing for 1.5 h, followed by filtration and dried at room temperature. The crystal phase and structure of the samples were observed by powder X-ray diffractometry (Rigaku Multiflex) with Cu K radiation ( 0.154 nm) at a scan rate of 4 min -1 .Sample morphologies were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, SU-8220, Hitachi High Technologies) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F).The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas of the photocatalysts were measured by their N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K using a volumetric gas adsorption apparatus (BELSORP-mini II, BEL Japan, Inc.).Prior to the measurements, each sample was evacuated at 473 K for 1 h using a pretreatment system (BELPREP-vacII, BEL Japan, Inc.).UV-Vis diffuse-reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-visible spectrometer (V-650, JASCO) equipped with an integrated sphere accessory. The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 was carried out using a flow system with an inner-irradiation-type reaction vessel at ambient pressure.First, the synthesized photocatalyst (0.5 g) was dispersed in ultrapure water (1.0 L) containing 0.1 M NaHCO3. Second, CO2 was bubbled into the solution at a flow rate of 30 mL min -1 .Third, the suspension was illuminated using a 400-W high-pressure mercury lamp with a quartz filter connected to a water cooling system.The amounts of the evolved H2 and O2 were detected using a thermal conductivity detector-gas chromatography system (TCD-GC, Shimadzu Corp; MS-5A column, Ar carrier).The amount of evolved CO was analyzed by a flame ionization detector-GC with a methanizer (ShinCarbon ST column, N2 carrier). The selectivity toward CO evolution compared to H2 evolution and the balance between the consumed electrons (e -) and holes (h ) were expressed by eqns.( 1) and (2), respectively: Selectivity toward CO evolution () 100 2RCO / (2RCO 2RH2) (1) Here, RCO and RH2 represent the formation rates of CO and H2, respectively. In the isotopic experiment, 12 CO2 was replaced by 13 CO2.The formation rates of H2, O2, 13 CO, and 12 CO under photoirradiation were detected using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (BELMASS, Microtrac BEL) combined with a TCD-GC detector, the reactor set-up is shown in Figure S1."

    "content": "Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared SrNb2O6 and Sr2Nb2O7 fabricated by a flux method.All the diffraction peaks in the upper and lower patterns were accurately indexed to the pure monoclinic phase of SrNb2O6 with a P121/c space group (JCPDS 72-2088) and the orthorhombic phase of Sr2Nb2O7 with a Cmc21 space group (JCPDS 70-0114), respectively 32.No peaks corresponding to other impurity phases were observed, indicating that the pure phases of SrNb2O6 and Sr2Nb2O7 are successfully prepared by calcination at 1173 K for 2 h by the flux method.Figure S2A shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of as-synthesized SrNb2O6 and Sr2Nb2O7; diffuse reflectance spectra were converted to absorption spectra using the Kubelka-Munk equation.The band gaps of Sr2Nb2O7 and SrNb2O6 were estimated as 3.97 eV and 3.86 eV, respectively (Figure S2B), based on the Davis-Mott equation 40 using the Kubelka-Munk function F(R) obtained from the diffuse-reflectance spectrum; these values are similar to the reported values 31,32. Here, h, v, A, and n 1/2 represent the Planck's constant, vibrational frequency, proportionality constant, and direct allowed transition, respectively. Figure 2 shows the SEM images of as-prepared SrNb2O6 and SrNb2O7.SrNb2O6 predominantly consisted of 1D rod-like particles (Figure 2a).The diameters of the nanorods ranged from 100 nm to 1 m, and their lengths ranged from 500 nm to several tens of microns.On the other hand, Sr2Nb2O7 prepared by the same flux method predominantly exhibited a nanoflake structure with a thickness of 50-250 nm (Figure 2b). The surface areas of SrNb2O6 nanorod and SrNb2O7 nanoflake were 1.78 m 2 g -1 and 3.85 m 2 g -1 , respectively.The surface areas of Ag/SrNb2O6 and Ag/SrNb2O7 were 2.25 m 2 g 1 and 4.26 m 2 g 1 , respectively; these values are slightly greater than that of the bare catalyst.High selectivity (greater than 95) toward the photocatalytic evolution of CO over Ag/SrNb2O6 was observed.CO was obtained as the main product (44.1 mol h -1 ), with marginal amounts of H2 (2.7 mol h -1 ).A stoichiometric formation amount of O2 (22.4 mol h -1 ), in addition to H2 and CO, was observed, indicating that H2O serves as the electron donor for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.On the other hand, compared to Ag/SrNb2O6, Ag/Sr2Nb2O7 exhibited lower formation rates of H2, CO, and O2; H2 was the main product; and the photocatalytic activity also rapidly decreased after photoirradiation for 5 h.This result clearly indicated that Ag/SrNb2O6 with a nanorod structure exhibits better photocatalytic activity and higher selectivity toward CO evolution compared to Ag/Sr2Nb2O7 with a nanoflake structure. As SrNb2O6 and Sr2Nb2O7 exhibited different structures, SrNb2O6 with a nanorod structure was compared with catalysts with other nanostructures synthesized by the solidstate reaction (SSR) and solvothermal methods.As shown in the XRD patterns (Figure S3), a pure SrNb2O6 phase was successfully prepared, except using the SSR method, which contained few impurity phases of Sr2Nb2O7.From the SEM images shown in Figure 4, aggregated nanoparticles (Figure 4a) and a mixture of nanoparticles and nanorods (Figure 4b) were observed for SrNb2O6 fabricated by SSR and the solvothermal method, respectively.All of the Ag-loaded SrNb2O6 products were favorable for CO evolution; however, SrNb2O6 nanorods prepared by the flux method exhibited higher photocatalytic activity and selectivity toward CO evolution compared to the aggregated nanoparticles prepared by SSR and the solvothermal method (Figure 4c).On the other hand, the nanorod-containing SrNb2O6 products prepared by the solvothermal method also exhibited higher photocatalytic selectivity toward CO evolution although its photocatalytic activity was less than that of the SrNb2O6 nanoparticles synthesized by the SSR method.This result revealed that Ag/SrNb2O6 is promising for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2, and the nanorod structure is favorable for CO evolution, the reasons for the high selectivity toward CO evolution of SrNb2O6 nanorod will be discussed later. Figure 5 shows the blank tests using the SrNb2O6 nanorods.No product was detected in the dark (Figure 5a) and without a photocatalyst (Figure 5b).Marginal amounts of H2 and O2 were observed, while the formation rates of CO were rather low without a NaHCO3 additive and a Ag cocatalyst (Figure 5c and5d), indicating that the NaHCO3 additive and Ag cocatalyst are indispensable for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 in an aqueous solution.The use of inert Ar instead of CO2 led to the decreased formation rate of evolved CO (Figure 5e).The best performance for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 was using Ag-loaded SrNb2O6 nanorods in an aqueous NaHCO3 solution with bubbling CO2 under photoirradiation (Figure 5f).From the photocatalytic result mentioned above, the SrNb2O6 nanorods clearly exhibited good activity for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 by H2O under UV irradiation.The stoichiometric formation amount of H2, CO, and O2 indicated that H2O serves as electron donor for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. It is known that gaseous CO2 can dissolve in an aqueous solution, whereas, it is negligible in pure water 41.Adding additives in the aqueous solution could greatly affect the solubility of gaseous CO2 and pH value into a reactant solution for CO2 reduction 42.The effects of bases on the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 over Ag/SrNb2O6 are shown in Table 1.When NaHCO3 (0.1 mol L -1 ), Na2CO3 (0.05 mol L -1 ), and NaOH (0.1 mol L -1 ) were added into the reactant solution, it showed similar formation rates of products and pH values for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2. Because CO2 gas was continuously bubbled in solution, all the concentrations of CO2 (aq), HCO3 -, and CO3 2-achieve equilibrium in case that Na2CO3 and NaOH are added as well as NaHCO3 42.In our previous work, the concentration of CO2 (aq), HCO3 -, and CO3 2- in 0.1 mol L -1 NaHCO3 aqueous solution were calculated under different pH values, which showed higher dissolved amount of CO2 (aq) for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 (at pH 6.8) as compared to that in the pure water 43.Whereas, in the solutions of 0.05 mol L -1 H2SO4 and 0.1 mol L -1 NaCl, the SO4 2-and Cl -ions are hard to keep the high solubility of gaseous CO2 in solution, the concentrations of CO2 related species are similar to that in H2O during the bubbling of CO2 42.On the other hand, the high concentration of H in H2SO4 and NaCl solutions is in favor of water splitting, so H2 was the main products when H2SO4 and NaCl were used as additives. Figure 6 shows the gas chromatograms and mass spectra for the photocatalytic conversion of 13 CO2 by H2O over Ag/SrNb2O6.Peaks corresponding to H2, O2, and CO were observed in the TCD-GC chromatogram.The peak at m/z 29 corresponded to 13 CO; in contrast, no peak was detected at m/z 28.Therefore, CO evolved over Ag/SrNb2O6 originates from the CO2 introduced in the gas phase and not from the residual organic contaminants on the surface. Loading with Ag has been reported to affect the activity and selectivity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 25.Figure 7 shows the formation rates of H2, O2, and CO for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 in an aqueous NaHCO3 solution using Ag/SrNb2O6 modified by CR, IMP, and PD method.Ag-loaded SrNb2O6 prepared by all methods exhibited high photocatalytic selectivity toward CO evolution, and stoichiometric formation amount of H2, CO, and O2 were obtained.The amount of CO obtained as the reduction product of CO2 over Ag/SrNb2O6 prepared by CR method was greater than those obtained by IMP and PD methods.The photocatalytic activity clearly decreased after photoirradiation for 1 h and gradually became stable with the increase in the photoirradiation time using CR methods.However, the evolution rate of CO only slightly decreased during photoirradiation for 5 h by the loading of Ag using PD method. Figure 8 shows the SEM images of Ag/SrNb2O6 prepared by the three methods.Ag particles modified by CR method were uniformly scattered on the SrNb2O6 nanorod surface with a size less than 10 nm (Figure 8a).Ag cocatalysts prepared by IMP method were dispersed on the surface of SrNb2O6 nanorod with an aggregate size of 10-50 nm (Figure 8b).The Ag cocatalysts prepared by PD method were predominantly deposited on the top of SrNb2O6 nanorods as nanoparticles with a size of 30-70 nm (Figure 8c). This selective deposition of Ag cocatalysts was also observed for Ag/SrNb2O6 prepared by CR and IMP methods at a photoirradiation time of 1 h (Figure 8d and8e).The sizes of the Ag particles, which were prepared by CR and IMP methods, redeposited on the top of nanorods were 10-30 nm and 20-70 nm, respectively.The particle size of Ag on the top of nanorods was almost similar to the initial size of Ag/SrNb2O6 prepared by PD method after photoirradiation for 5 h (Figure 8f).Ag particles loaded on the top plane with a smaller size prepared by CR method exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 than those prepared by IMP and PDmethod.This result is consistent with those reported previously 12. Figure 9 shows the effect of the Ag cocatalyst loading amount on the photocatalytic activity for CO2 conversion.Modification of the catalyst with marginal amounts of Ag dramatically improved the formation rate of CO and suppressed the formation rate of H2, indicating that the modification of the Ag cocatalyst leads to increased reaction sites on the SrNb2O6 nanorod surface for the reduction of CO2 because of its good selectivity toward CO evolution 28.As the active sites for reduction increased with increasing amounts of added Ag cocatalyst, the formation rate of CO increased with the addition of a large amount of Ag from 0 to 0.5 wt.However, further increase in the amount of Ag led to the aggregation of Ag particles; hence, the photocatalytic activity decreases with the further modification by Ag with a loading from 0.5 to 2 wt.The particle size of the Ag cocatalysts increased with the increase in the Ag loading amount, followed by gradual aggregation, which was clearly observed from the SEM and TEM images in Figure S4. The highest formation rate of the evolved CO (51.2 mol h -1 ) was observed using 0.5 wt Ag-loaded SrNb2O6 nanorods, as well as high selectivity (98), although the conversion efficiency was very low (0.06). Figure 10 shows the time course for the evolution of CO, H2, and O2 during the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 by H2O over 0.5 wt Ag-loaded SrNb2O6.Stable selectivity toward CO was observed during photoirradiation (approximately 97).CO was evolved as the main reduction product, and marginal amounts of H2 were generated. Stoichiometric amounts of O2 as the oxidation product of H2O were obtained, in addition to CO and H2 as the reduction products, suggesting that H2O serves as the electron donor for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2.Notably, the formation rate of CO gradually decreased with the increase in the photoirradiation time for the first 6 h and then was maintained constant.As shown in the XRD pattern (Figure S5), the crystalline structures of SrNb2O6 were very stable under UV light irradiation, while the diffraction peak corresponding to metallic Ag was not observed because of the low amount of Ag. Figure 11 shows the TEM images, which clearly show the variation of Ag particles on the SrNb2O6 nanorod surface.Before the loading of Ag, a smooth SrNb2O6 nanorod surface was observed (Figure 11a).After the loading of the Ag cocatalyst by CR method, Ag nanoparticles with a size less than 10 nm were highly dispersed on the SrNb2O6 nanorod surface (Figure 11b), which were selectively redeposited on the top of the SrNb2O6 nanorod with photoirradiation (Figure 11c).The particle size of Ag increased with the increase in the photoirradiation time from 0 h to 6 h (Figure 11d) and gradually maintained constant with the further increase in the photoirradiation time to 15 h (Figure 11e and11f).The variation of Ag particles could also be confirmed by EDS analysis (Figure S6). Pt and PbO2 have been reported to be reductively and oxidatively photodeposited, respectively, on surfaces because of their anisotropic properties 38, 44 .Hence, a series of metals and PbO2 is examined to investigate the anisotropy property of the SrNb2O6 nanorod (Figure S7).Metallic Au, Pt, and Pd were reductively photodeposited from AuCl4 , PtCl6 2 , and Pd 2 on the top plane of the nanorod, respectively.In contrast, PbO2 was selectivity deposited from Pb 2 on the side plane of the nanorod, which was also confirmed by EDS (Figure S8).This selective photodeposition of different materials demonstrated that reduction and oxidation by the photogenerated e and h primary occur on the top and side planes of the nanorods, respectively, indicating that Ag loaded on the SrNb2O6 surface in this study is firstly dissolved by the photogenerated holes to Ag and then redeposited on the top plane under photoirradiation because of the anisotropy of the SrNb2O6 nanorod. Scheme 1 shows the possible mechanism for the redeposition of the Ag cocatalyst on the Ag/SrNb2O6 nanorod surface.The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 predominantly led to the formation of CO on the top of the Ag-loaded SrNb2O6 nanorods, while O2 was formed on the sides of the nanorods.The variation of the Ag particles on the SrNb2O6 nanorod surface, which were dissolved and redeposited on the top of SrNb2O6 nanorod possibly led to the decreased Ag active sites; hence, the photocatalytic activity decreases during photoirradiation, especially in the first 1 h.The separation of the reduction sites from the oxidation sites contributed to the decrease in the recombination of the photogenerated carriers; hence, Ag-loaded SrNb2O6 nanorods prepared by the flux method exhibit good activity and selectivity for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2."
