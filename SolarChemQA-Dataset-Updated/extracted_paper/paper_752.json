    "content": "According to literature reports 25, Co-porphyrin complex (Co-POR) was prepared by a short term method.Tetrakis (4-carboxy phenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) in the experiment was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Co. Ltd. 130 mL DMF and 0.39 g TCPP were added to the reflux device and then stirred at 100 C for 20 minutes. Co(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (587 mg) was added and the solution was stirred at 100 C for 3 h. Then the mixture was cooled for several minutes and 130 mL chilled deionized water was added.The precipitate was obtained by suction filtration and then washed with deionized water three times.After that, the synthesis samples were dried at 60 C.The synthesis process of Ni-POR is much similar to that of Co-POR, expect that Ni(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O (586.5 mg) was used to replace the Co(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was applied to determine the stretching bands of catalysts by a VERTEX 70 (Bruker, Germany).Before the test, 1 mg sample was mixed with 100 mg KBr and pressed into disk for subsequent analysis. BET surface area and pore information were obtained N 2 adsorption-desorption test by a gas sorption analyser (ASAP 2460) at -196 C.CO 2 adsorption isotherms was obtained by ASAP 2020.The morphologies and lattice information of catalysts were provided by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Sigma300, Carl Zeiss AG) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G 2 F30, FEI).X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS, AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W, Shimadzu-Kratos Inc, Japan) was used to perform surface chemical analysis of photocatalysts for further information with C 1s band at 284.6 eV as calibration.Absorption spectra was performed by a UVvis spectrophotometer (Lambda 35, PerkinElmer, USA) at room temperature (23-25 C).Photoluminescence spectra (PL) was obtained by a Raman microscope (LabRAM HR800, Horiba JobinYvon). The CO 2 photocatalytic performance test was taken place in a 250ml Off-line reactor (PQ 256, Perfectlight, China) under the gaseous phase.75 mg photocatalyst was loaded on the center of a quartz film and then 1 mL deionized water was added into the reactor.The reactor was thoroughly purged and swept for 20 minutes and then backfilled with pure CO 2 .At the end, the reactor was filled with 1.0 atm of CO 2 and then sealed.The light source for the reaction is provided by a 300 W Xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300, Perfectlight, China) with a UV and IR filter.The light with wavelength out of range of 420-780 nm was removed.A thermostat bath system (DC-0506, Perfectlight, China) was used to keep the reaction temperature at 60C. During the reaction for 4 h, 1.0 mL product gases were taken for gas chromatography analysis (GC9790 II , Fuli, China).A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionisation detector (FID) were used to detect the composition of gas.A methanizer was equipped for the detection of carbon monoxide.Argon (99.999) was selected as the carrier gas during the measurement process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed in Materials Studio software.The optimization setting of the geometry structures was consistent with previous reports 26,27.The type of core treatment was determined using DFT semicore pseudopots (DSPP), which is applied for DMol 3 calculations 28.In terms of optimization parameter setting, the convergence threshold parameters were 2 10 -5 (energy), (gradient), and (displacement), respectively.The real-4 10 -3 5 10 -3 space orbital global cutoff was 4.1A. The adsorption energy (AE) of adsorbates CO 2 with metalloporphyrin substrate was obtained by the following equation: A where is the energy of the whole optimized system, and the and correspond to the energy of the metalloporphyrin substrate and the adsorbate, ads E respectively.The enhancement of AE is beneficial for the capture of CO 2 by metalloporphyrin substrates."

    "content": "The structure of Co-POR is shown in Figure 1(a), which is corresponded to the reports by N. Sadeghi 25.In Co-POR, each nitrogen of pyrrole ring is coordinated with one Co 2 and the cobalt is coordinated with four nitrogen.Correspondingly, the carboxylate group is not coordinated with metal sites.The structure of Ni-POR is similar to that of Co-POR and the information of structure is verified by FTIR spectra. The FTIR spectra of catalysts is shown in Figure 1(b).The FTIR spectra between 700 and 1700 cm -1 is attributed to the stretching bands of pyrrole ring 29.The peak at 1 is corresponded to the C-O stretch 30.The stretching vibration and formation vibration of N-H in pyrrole ring was observed at 3317 cm -1 and 964 cm -1 in Figure 1 The surface area for mesoporous and CO 2 uptake quantity data for the catalysts are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2. From Table 1, the measured surface areas of Co-POR and Ni-POR are smaller than that of TCPP.This phenomenon can be attributed to the incorporation of cobalt and nickel metal sites, which slightly diminishes the surface area 21.However, the CO 2 uptake quantity of catalysts is not corresponding to their BET surface areas.Co-POR has much higher CO 2 uptake quantity than other catalysts and Ni-POR has the worst CO 2 adsorption capacity.In this study, it is considered that two main factors influence the CO 2 adsorption capacity of catalysts.nm have a positive effect on CO 2 adsorption because of the increase of adsorption surface 33.Although BET surface areas of metalloporphyrin are smaller than that of TCPP, Co-POR possesses the most mesopores while Ni-POR possesses the least mesopores in the range of 2-4 nm, which can partly account for the difference of CO 2 uptake quantity.On the other hand, the high CO 2 uptake quantity may be derived from the strong CO 2 adsorption energy, which may account for the enhanced CO 2 uptake ability of Co-POR based on its small BET surface area 24.Therefore, the CO 2 adsorption ability is the combined effect of pore volume distribution and CO 2 adsorption energy.According to subsequent DFT calculations, the low CO 2 uptake capacity of Ni-POR is mainly affected by its low specific surface area and less mesopore distribution at 2-4 nm. As shown in Figure 3 As shown in Figure 10, compared with TCPP and Ni-POR, Co-POR exhibits much enhanced activity.Co-POR shows higher CO yields (0.120 CO) in the CO 2 mol conversion than Ni-POR (0.073 CO), while using TCPP as catalyst under mol similar reaction conditions only products 0.047 CO after 4h reaction.Figure 11 mol shows the product evolution rate of CO 2 into CH 4 and CO by TCPP,Co-POR and Ni-POR as photocatalysts.As it can be seen, a little of CH 4 was produced in the photoreduction reaction, while the evolution rate of CO obtained by Co-POR(0.40) is about 2.55 times higher than TCPP(0.16 ) and 1.70 mol -1 h -1 mol -1 h -1 times higher than Ni-POR(0.24) after 4h visible irradiation.From the mol -1 h -1 experiment results, Co-POR has the highest product yields compared with Ni-POR, which indicates that Co-POR have the best photocatalytic performance. CO is the main reaction product in this study.Generally, photocatalytic CO 2 conversion into CO is carried out by a carboxyl intermediate (COOH ) 44.The reaction mechanism can be expressed in the following: where denotes a free active site and denotes an activated carbon dioxide 2 molecule.It is believed that the activation energy barrier of all intermediate formation is lower than that of the CO 2 to activation process 24.Therefore, the initial Co-POR rather than Ni-POR, which is directly linked to CO evolution.Therefore, Co-POR has higher catalytic activity than Ni-POR based on adsorption energies of CO 2 , which also accounts for the different photocatalytic performance of Co-POR and Ni-POR. On the other hand, the competing photocatalytic reactions, such as H 2 evolution, which is important for future practical implementation, also has an effect on the catalytic ability.In general, H 2 O molecules are thought to be more readily adsorbed on the catalyst surface compared with CO 2 because of the difference in structure, which means that H 2 O molecules have an advantage in competitive adsorption with CO 2 45. CO 2 and H 2 O adsorption energies of Co-POR and Ni-POR are shown in Figure 12(b), which also verifies the adsorption advantage of H 2 O.However, no H 2 was observed in our experimental products, which is consistent with existing reports 21,25.According to the reports in literature 46, the generated CO may transfer to hydrocarbons by further hydrogenation reaction in our gas-phase reaction system, which avoid H 2 evolution reaction.As a direct result, a small amount of CH 4 can be observed in our experimental products.Therefore, H 2 O molecules have an advantage during the competitive adsorption process but the competitive HER was not observed from the experimental results. From the results and discussions, the mechanism for photocatalytic performance difference of Co-POR and Ni-POR for CO 2 reduction has been illustrated in Figure 13."

    "title": "Conclusions",
    "content": "In conclusion, Co and Ni metalloporphyrin complexes was synthesized and used for CO 2 photoreduction conversion.For comparing the performance difference of Co and Ni metal sites in porphyrin units, several characterizations and DFT calculation were applied for the investigation of catalysts performance. (1) The experiment results indicate that Co-POR shows better CO 2 photoreduction performance than Ni-POR and the CO evolution rate is 0.40 , which is mol -1 h -1 about 1.7 times higher than that of Ni-POR. (2) The advantage of Co-POR in product evolution rate is attributed to the activity and adsorption ability of cobalt metal sites.After incorporation of metal nodes, the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs in Co-POR is much lower than that in Ni-POR. As shown by DFT calculation results, the CO 2 adsorption energy of Co-POR is higher than that of Ni-POR, which facilitates the occurrence of reaction.Therefore, cobalt has an advantage over nickel as metal sites in porphyrin units.2) Whether Co or Ni metalloporphyrin complexes exhibit better photocatalytic performance is elucidated. 3) The performance comparison was carried out for the mechanism illustration of performance difference in Co and Ni metal sites. 4) The relative strength of activity and CO 2 adsorption ability in Co and Ni sites is clarified. photocatalytic reduction recently. photocatalytic performance.From the previous reports, the possible effects of Co and (b), which indicated the presence of uncoordinated nitrogen sites31.Compared with FT-IR spectra of TCPP, the change in Co-POR and Ni-POR spectra is the disappearance of the peak corresponding to N-H bond, which supports the successful incorporation of metal sites into the porphyrin unit.The peak attributed to the CO stretch in carboxylic acids is observed at 1683 cm -1 in TCPP32.The peak at the similar position can still be observed in Co-POR and Ni-POR, which proves the central coordination of metal sites.Before the performance comparison of Co and Ni metal sites, FTIR spectra proves the successful synthesis and expectant framework structure of Co-POR and Ni-POR. Firstly, the pore volume distribution of TCPP, Co-POR and Ni-POR may affect the CO 2 adsorption property.As shown in Figure 2(b), pore volume distribution of catalysts is obtained from N 2 adsorption-desorption test.Generally, the tiny pores within the range of 2-4 , the thermal properties of catalysts are shown in the TG curves.The temperature is rised to 105 C at the heating speed of 10 C per minute and then kept at 105 C for 10 min.After that, the temperature is rised to 1000 C at the same heating speed in air atmosphere.In the TG curves, all samples show similarly good thermal stability, which enables samples to work at a high temperature.The curve below 300 C is mostly the dehydration phase.The decomposition of TCPP can be observed above 360 C, which is attributed to the decomposition of organic groups and collapse of frameworks34.Compared with TCPP, no obvious changes can be observed in the TG curves of Co-POR and Ni-POR, which indicates that the structure of Co-POR and Ni-POR has not changed substantially35.A plateau is observed in the TG curves of Co-POR and Ni-POR, indicating that the final formation amount of metallic oxide is 15.6 and 8.3, respectively.The morphology information of photocatalysts was obtained by the FESEM and elemental mapping images.From Figure4(a-c), the photocatalysts exhibit a uniformly ordered structure.For further information of the distribution of metal sites in porphyrin units, elemental mappings of Co and Ni in the samples were provided by EDS.As shown in Figure4(d-e), elemental mapping images indicate the uniform dispersion of metal sites in the framework.The pore volume mentioned above was verified by FESEM images of Co-POR and Ni-POR.The uniform distribution of metal sites shows the reliability of the subsequent performance comparison.For getting further information about the crystal face and lattice of catalysts, the TEM and HR-TEM images of catalysts are shown in Figure5.TEM images show the nanorod structure of the catalysts with dozens of nanometers in width.However, no obvious crystal lattice images can be observed in the HR-TEM images of TCPP, which indicates the non-crystalline nature of TCPP36.Correspondingly, the similar phenomena can be observed in the HR-TEM images of Co-POR and Ni-POR, which implies the non-crystalline nature of catalysts.Therefore, from the TEM images, the catalysts are all amorphously non-crystalline in nature.The chemical states and the changes of structure were analyzed by XPS.As revealed in Figure6(a), two symmetric peaks are observed at 796.4 and 781.3 eV which is corresponded to the characteristic Co 2p 1/2 and Co 2p 3/2 , indicates the existence of Co 2 in Co-POR 24.Figure 6(b) shows the characteristic Ni 2p 1/2 and Ni 2p 3/2 peaks at 872.5 and 855.3 eV, which confirms the existence of Ni 2 in Ni-POR 37.The similar existing form of Co and Ni metal ensures the veracity of performance comparison.From Figure7(a), the N 1s spectrum of TCPP is divided into three peaks at 403.3, 400.1 and 398.0 eV, which are attributed to oxidized-N, C-N-C and CN-C, respectively38.The XPS spectra indicates that N element mainly exists in the form of C-N-C and CN-C in photocatalysts, which proves the structure of TCPP.The N 1s spectrum of Co-POR and Ni-POR is shown in Figure7(b-c).Except the peaks corresponding to oxidized-N, the peak at 399.0 eV in Figure7(b) is attributed to N-Co porphyrin39, while the peak at 398.9 eV in Figure7(c) is attributed to N-Ni porphyrin 40.Compared with the spectra of TCPP, the disappearance of C-N-C and CN-C peaks and the appearance of metal porphyrin peaks reveal the successful insertion of Co 2 and Ni 2 into the framework.The similar high resolution N 1s spectrums of Co-POR and Ni-POR indicate that Co and Ni metal binds to organic ligands in the same manner during the preparation process, which corresponds to the results of FTIR spectra.Based on the same binding manner, Co-POR and Ni-POR can be distinguished only by metal sites.The UV-vis absorption spectra of catalysts is shown in Figure 8. From UV-vis absorption spectra of TCPP, it shows excellent photon absorption ability from 200 to 800 nm, which has a strong Soret band at 350 nm and four Q band at lower energies for the porphyrin family 41.After the incorporation of metal nodes, a slight red shift of Soret band to 380 and 373 nm is observed for Co-POR and Ni-POR in the UV-vis spectrum, which indicates the successful insertion of Co 2 and Ni 2 .From the UV-vis absorption spectra, Co-POR and Ni-POR remain the visible-light response characteristics of porphyrin structure.One or two weak split Q bands occupy the predominant positions because of better symmetry of the Co-POR and Ni-POR 42, which also proves the successful synthesis of sample structure on the other side.From the UV-vis absorption spectra, Co-POR and Ni-POR all show excellent absorption property for visible light because of the good characteristics inherited from porphyrin families.As such, the difference in the photocatalytic performance should not be attributed to visible light absorption property.For further information of electron-hole recombination in the photoreduction process, photoluminescence spectra (PL) was used for the investigation of electron transfer behavior.The PL spectra of photocatalysts is shown in Figure 9.In general, low fluorescence intensity indicates the reduction of charge carriers recombination 43.After the insertion of metal sites into the porphyrin framework, the fluorescence intensity of Co-POR and Ni-POR was obviously quenched.Compared with TCPP, the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is obviously inhibited and the separation of charge carriers is improved after the insertion of metal nodes.Co-POR shows lower fluorescence intensity than Ni-POR, which indicates that the insertion of Co metal sites can inhibit the recombination of charge carriers more effectively.This difference between Co-POR and Ni-POR may account for the different photocatalytic performance in the reaction experiment. adsorption of CO 2 on catalysts is an important step, which determines the reaction hardness.The adsorption energies of CO 2 or H 2 O onto TCPP, Co-POR and Ni-POR were calculated by DFT calculations.As shown in Figure 12(a), a theoretical model was established to simulate the adsorption of CO 2 on the Co metal sites.From the optimization results, the Co-OCO 2 bond (3.304A) on Co-POR is shorter than the Ni-OCO 2 bond (3.384A), which suggests a stronger binding interaction between CO 2 and Co metal sites.By calculation, the adsorption energy of CO 2 onto TCPP is only 5.89 kJmol -1 .From Figure 12(b), the adsorption energies of CO 2 on Co-POR and Ni-POR are clearly higher than that of TCPP, suggesting that the adsorption of CO 2 is significantly enhanced after the insertion of metal sites.The adsorption energy of CO 2 onto Co-POR is 17.92 kJmol -1 , which is stronger than that of Ni-POR(16.37kJmol -1 ), indicating the stronger CO 2 adsorption affinity of Co-POR.The difference in adsorption energy of CO 2 over Co-POR and Ni-POR may partly account for the results of CO 2 adsorption measurement.The strong CO 2 adsorption affinity of the active sites in Co-POR suggests that CO 2 molecules are more easily activated to on the surface of 2 Porphyrin structure can promote the absorption of visible light like an antenna, which is benefit from the excellent visible light absorption property of porphyrin families.Visible light absorption property mainly relies on the feature of organic ligands and is not related to the performance of metal sites.The presence of Co and Ni metal sites in metalloporphyrin provides various electron traps, which promotes the efficient charge carriers separation.Subsequently, the electron transfer from porphyrin units to metal sites generates lots of unsaturated active sites, which provides long-lived electrons for the reduction reaction.Co-POR shows better photocatalytic activity than Ni-POR because electrons are trapped easily by Co metal sites rather than Ni metal sites, which can restrain the recombination of charge carriers more effectively.Compared with Ni-POR, the stronger CO 2 adsorption affinity of Co-POR strengthens the interaction between CO 2 and metal sites, which can promote the CO 2 -to-CO conversion.Therefore, Co-POR displays highest activity and adsorption because of the presence of Co metal sites in the framework, which accounts for best CO 2 photocatalytic performance.In addition, Co-POR investigated in this work has individual performance advantages compared with parts of other photocatalysts reported.Compared with noble metal doped TiO 2 , where UV light plays a major role, Co-POR can make use of visible light more efficiently.As shown in Table 2, CO evolution rate of Co-POR under visible radiation is about 2.4 times than that of TiO 2 under UV-visible light.After the doping of noble metal (Ag or Pt) in TiO 2 , Co-POR still gets the similar product evolution rate by utilizing visible light.As the basic structure unit of porphyrin based MOFs, the performance difference shows the photocatalytic advantage of novel MOF material.Simultaneously, some parts of other MOFs were used as cocatalyst during the reaction process.Co-POR can achieve the similar product evolution rate with H 2 O as electron donor which is environmentally clean, non-toxicity, cheap and abundant.The replacement of TEOA solved in MeCN by H 2 O vapor used as sacrificial agent is also the advantage of Co-POR to some extent. The present work shows the unique performance advantages of Co metal sites in porphyrin units during the CO 2 photoreduction reaction.As the basic structure unit of porphyrin based MOFs, we anticipate that this strategy has illuminating significance for designing and constructing porphyrin based MOFs materials in the photoreduction region.
