    "content": "All reagents used in this study were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Hydrofluoric acid (48), melamine (99) and titanium butoxide (97) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was synthesized from heating melamine in a muffle furnace to 560 C at a 5 C/min ramp under static air for 4 h.Carbon nitride nanosheets (CNNS) were prepared by firstly sonicating the as prepared carbon nitride in water for 4 h.This was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min, the recovered supernatant was then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min to recover CNNS.The CNNS were then dispersed in ethanol by sonication for 4 h and further centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min.The CNNS in the supernatant was then collected.The stock solution of CNNS in ethanol had a CNNS concentration of 2.25 mg/mL, determined by thermogravimetric analysis. A hydrothermal synthesis was used to produce TiO2.Specifically, TiO2 nanosheets (TiO2-NS, 'NS' for nanosheet) were synthesized by adding titanium butoxide (3 mL), hydrofluoric acid (1.2 mL), and ethanol (30 mL) to a PTFE autoclave liner under mixing.The mixture was then heated to 180 C for 24 h.Following the reaction, the collected material was washed by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min) with 0.2 M NaOH, then deionized water until a neutral pH was reached, and finally with ethanol prior to drying overnight at 65 C.For TiO2 isometric bipyramidal (TiO2-ISO, 'ISO' for isotropic) synthesis the same procedure was used but 1.2 mL of deionised water was used instead of HF. A hydrothermal in-situ synthesis was used to form TiO2 in the presence of preformed CNNS to obtain TiO2/CNNS composites as shown in Scheme 1. Titanium butoxide (3 mL), hydrofluoric acid (1.2 mL), and CNNS stock solution (30 mL, i.e. 67.5 mg of CNNS) were added to a PTFE autoclave liner under mixing. The mixture was then heated to 180C for 24 h.Hydrofluoric acid was used to control the crystal facet formation and in particular for the development of nanocrystals with exposed 001 facets.Following the reaction, the collected material was washed by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min) with 0.2 M NaOH, then deionized water until a neutral pH was reached, and finally with ethanol prior to drying overnight at 65 C.The TiO2/CNNS composite synthesised in the presence of HF was named Ti-NS/CN.For synthesis in the absence of HF, named Ti-ISO/CN, 1.2 mL of deionised water used instead of HF.In this study, we assume that the effect of F -on the morphology of TiO2 particles remains the same either for the pure of the composite material.The expected composition for both composite materials was 95.4 2.0 TiO2.Scheme 1. Schematic representation of the synthesis process used to produce TiO2/CNNS composites. Following exfoliation of g-C3N4 to CNNS by sonication, TiO2 was synthesised in an autoclave in the presence of CNNS to form TiO2/CN nanocomposites.The TiO2 crystal shape was controlled by the addition of either HF or H2O to the synthesis vessel, leading to the formation of composites with TiO2 nanosheets and TiO2 isometric structures, respectively. X-ray diffraction measurements were performed with a PANalytical X'Pert PRO instrument at room temperature (reflection mode at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu K radiation (1 1.54057A, 2 1.54433A, weighted average 1.54178A).The interplanar spacing was calculated using Bragg's law: 2 sin Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform-infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra was collected using a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 100 Spectrometer equipped with an ATR cell at room temperature.The spectra was generated, collected 8 times, and corrected for the background noise.The experiments were performed using powdered samples, without KBr addition. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using a high resolution Zeiss Sigma 300 microscope in secondary electron mode (InLens detector).Prior to analysis, the samples were mounted on spectroscopy was captured using an Oxford Instruments INCA energy dispersive analytical system.Before analysis, the samples were sonicated in ethanol and then drop casted on a carbon coated copper grid.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under nitrogen (flowrate 100 mL min -1 ), from 100 to 900 C at a heating rate of 10 C min -1 using a Netzsch TG 209 F1 Libra instrument.Before analysis, the samples were vacuum dried at 120 C and stored in a desiccator. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured using a Micrometrics 3Flex sorption analyser at -196 C.The surface area was calculated from the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method 43.The total volume of pore was calculated from the volume adsorbed at P/P00.97.The volume of micropores was determined using the Dubinin-Radushkevich method 44.The volume of mesopores was calculated as the difference between the total pore volume and the volume of micropores. Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (DR-UV/Vis) spectroscopy was measured using a Agilent Cary 500 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere.Spectral band width was set to 2 nm, with Spectralon as a standard.Spectra were treated using Kubelka-Munk function 45 in order to eliminate any tailing contribution from the DR-UV-vis spectra.The following equation was applied: where R is the reflectance.The band-gap (Eg) values were estimated from the plot of F(R)hv 1/n versus energy by extrapolating the linear section. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements for elemental analysis were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum spectrometer equipped with a VSW Class WA hemispherical electron analyzer.A dual anode Al K X-ray source (1486.6 eV) was used as incident radiation and the constant pass energy mode (44 and 22 eV for survey and high resolution spectra respectively) was applied in all XPS measurements.The Binding energies (BEs) of all peaks were referenced to the C 1s main peak at 285 eV.The CASA XPS program with a Shirley background subtraction and Gaussian -Lorentzian peak shape was used for the analysis of the peaks.High resolution XPS measurements for band alignment were performed on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer equipped with an Al K X-Ray source (1486.6 eV) and an 180 double focusing hemispherical analyser with a 2D detector at an operating pressure of 1x10 -8 mbar as well as a flood gun to minimise charging from photoemission.Powders were mounted onto conductive carbon tape adhered to a sample holder.To further correct for charging, all core lines were corrected a C 1s (C-C) core line, assumed to be at 284.8 eV.Data was further processed and analysed in the Avantage and CASA XPS software packages. Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) data were acquired on a home-built setup and we used 355 nm excitation pulses of 100 J/cm 2 from an Nd:YAG laser (OPOTEK Opolette 355 II, 7 ns pulse width).A broadband probe light was generated from a quartz halogen lamp (Bentham IL1) and long pass filters were placed before the samples to reduce short wavelength irradiation of the sample.To avoid excessive heating, an IR filter consisting of a 5 cm path length cuvette filled with DI water was also placed before the samples. The light was collected in diffuse reflectance mode by a 2 diameter, 2 focal length lens and relayed to a monochromator to select the probe wavelength.A long pass filter was positioned at the entrance of the monochromator to block scattered laser light.The collected light was focused onto a Si photodiode detector (Hamamatsu S3071).Sub-ms data were processed by an electronic amplifier (Costronics) and recorded on an oscilloscope.Data on the ms timescale were simultaneously recorded by a DAQ card (National Instruments). Acquisitions were triggered by scatter from the laser excitation measured by a photodiode (Thorlabs DET10A).A minimum of 64 laser pulses were averaged together and processed using LabVIEW home-built software.The measurements were performed on the powdered samples in air. CO2 sorption isotherms at 25 C were measured up to 1 bara using the same instrument as for the porosity analysis.Prior to the measurements the samples were degassed at 0.2 mTorr, 120 C for 24 h.A home-built gas-solid reactor setup was used (Figure S1) 42.The photocatalysts (25 mg) were deposited on a stainless steel metal disc with a fixed area of 9.6 cm 2 .Research grade (99.999)CO2 and H2 (99.9995,Peak Scientific PH200 hydrogen generator) were flowed at controlled rates using mass flow controllers (Omega Engineering, 0-50 mL/min).For experiments requiring water vapor, this was generated from a was used for experiments using both these gases.A xenon arc lamp (150 W, 325 nm, LOT Quantum Design), equipped with a water filter was used as the irradiation source.Evolved gases were detected by a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer system (GC-MS, Agilent Technologies) with hayesep and molecular sieve packed columns in series, a GS-GASPRO capillary column, thermal conductivity (TCD), flame ionisation (FID) and mass selective (MSD) detectors.The stability of the photocatalysts was tested by repeating the above process after each 6 h illumination without opening the photoreactor.Reference reactions were conducted using N2 instead of CO2 in the gas mixture.In addition, isotopic tracing experiments were performed with 13 CO2 (BOC, 98 atom 13 CO2 compared to 12 CO2, 99).TiO2 P25 was tested in the same conditions for comparison.The error in CO evolution measurements is 10.The turnover number (TON) was calculated as the ratio of number of reacted photoelectrons to number of catalyst exposed sites: The quantity of the exposed catalyst sites was calculated considering the TiO2 component has 5x10 18 m 2 46, and the carbon nitride component which had 2.2 x10 18 sites/m 2 47.The number of catalytic sites used here corresponds to the number of OH sites on the surface of TiO2 as determined by Boehm titration 32 .The number of carbon nitride sites correspond to one site per melem unit.These values provide an upper bound to the number of active sites."

    "content": "The TiO2/CNNS composites were synthesized via an in-situ route during which TiO2, with or without the stabilizing agent (i.e.HF), was formed in the presence of preformed CNNS (see Scheme 1).This was done to ensure nanoscale mixing of the two components and improve charge carrier dynamics 42.Owing The presence of TiO2 and CNNS in the composites was first assessed using XRD.The patterns of the composites have been compared to those of the parent materials in Figure 1a.TiO2 in the anatase phase was observed for all samples (single phase and nanocomposite materials) either in the presence (TiO2-NS) or absence (TiO2-ISO) of the stabilizing agent 48.The g-C3N4 XRD pattern displayed peaks at 13.0 (100), characteristic of 0.680 nm interplanar spacing of the tri-s-triazine units, and at 27.4 (002), characteristic of 0.322 nm bulk CN interlayer stacking 22,49.Successful exfoliation of g-C3N4 to CNNS was evident from the significant decrease in the interlayer stacking peak (27.4) intensity.The TiO2/CNNS composites showed both TiO2 and CNNS diffraction patterns.This confirmed that both components were present and that the TiO2 synthesis was not altered significantly by the presence of CNNS.The effect of the stabilizing agent (HF) on TiO2 facet growth can be observed by comparing the XRD patterns of TiO2-NS and TiO2-ISO. Indeed, the (004) diffraction peak provides an indirect indicator of the abundance of 001 facet.This peak became significantly broader when using HF, indicating an increase of the 001 facets.This is because the 001 facet formation results in a plate morphology 50.Additionally, the (101) peaks were more intense relative to (004) due to less (001) planes, which is in line with prior studies 6,51.Further confirmation of the composite formation came from the ATR-FTIR spectroscopy analysis (Figure 1b).g-C3N4 showed the expected band vibrations, i.e.CN (1627 cm -1 ) and C-N (1312 cm -1 ) stretching, as well as out-of-plane C-N bending (803 cm -1 ) 19,52,53.The spectrum of the CNNS matched that of bulk g-C3N4 showing exfoliation did not alter its chemical features.TiO2 is relatively inactive in the IR region with mostly a broad Ti-O-Ti stretching bands across 1000-400 cm -1 ; this was evident for both TiO2 samples (TiO2-NS and TiO2-ISO) 40.The band at around 1630 cm -1 for these samples is assigned to the bending vibration of the O-H bond 54 from surface hydroxyl groups or water molecules.The scarcity of TiO2 features in the 1800-1000 cm -1 region allows the presence of CNNS in the TiO2/CNNS nanocomposites spectra to be clearly visible in Figure 1b.In addition, the Ti-O-Ti stretching band (1000-400 cm -1 ) was observed on the composites spectra confirming the presence of TiO2 in these samples.The shifts of the CN peaks at 1627 cm -1 and 1312 cm -1 towards higher wavenumbers in the composites compared to g-C3N4 may indicate a chemical interaction between TiO2 and the CNNS facilitated by nanocomposite formation. Investigation of the composition was carried out using XPS and TGA.Using the former technique, the presence of Ti, O, C, and N in the nanocomposites was confirmed (Figure S2a).Fluorine was not detected in the TiO2-NS and TiO2-NS/CN composite materials using EDX and XPS.The CNNS and pure TiO2-NS were characterized by two dominant contributions, C and N for the CNNS and Ti and O for the TiO2-NS (we note that no nitrogen was detected on TiO2).The Ti 2p3/2 binding energy (BE) for all TiO2 containing materials was found at 458.4 eV corresponding to Ti 4 surface species in TiO2 42.CNNS presented the typical chemical states of C and N in g-C3N4.The N 1s peak of the CNNS appeared at 398.6 eV (Figure S2b), characteristic of sp 2 hybridised nitrogen and the major contribution in the C 1s region centered at 288.4 eV was ascribed to sp 2 bonded carbon (N C -N) 55.Both Ti-ISO/CN and Ti-NS/CN composites presented an N 1s peak center at the same position as the CNNS sample (Figure S2b).The unchanged BE of both Ti 2p and N 1s in the composites compared with the bare TiO2 and CNNS materials, respectively, verified that the crystal structure of the individual parts in the composites was unaltered.This observation suggested the formation of a composite rather than modification of the crystal lattice structure, i.e.N doping of TiO2 via decomposition of CNNS.This is in line with the ATR-FTIR data presented above.The amount of TiO2 in the composites was measured by TGA under a nitrogen atmosphere (Figure S3), considering that the decomposition of CNNS occurred around 500 C.The TiO2 content of Ti-NS/CN and Ti-ISO/CN composites were 96.2 wt and 97.1wt -accurate to 1 wt. In addition to the above techniques, which allowed us to gain insights into the bulk structure and chemistry of the composites, SEM and TEM were employed for an in-depth understanding of the nanocomposite formation and details of the TiO2 facet growth.SEM of TiO2-NS (Figure 2a) revealed agglomerated TiO2 NS forming large sheets.The average particle size of the TiO2-NS was approximately 20 nm based on TEM (Figure S4).Lattice spacings corresponding to the (101) and (001) anatase TiO2 planes were measured for the top down and side on views, respectively (Figure 2b).51 The interfacial angle between these planes is in agreement with results reported in previous studies on TiO2 56,57.This confirmed the formation of nanoplatelets with exposed 001 facets 7.TEM of CNNS also confirmed exfoliation of g-C3N4 to CNNS; the nanosheets were hundreds of nanometers in length and around 300 nm in width (Figure 2c).TEM of Ti-NS/CN showed CNNS coated with TiO2-NS particles (Figure 2d).The TiO2 particle size and shape were not affected by the presence of CNNS.Additional evidence of the composite formation was provided by TEM-EDX of Ti-NS/CN (Figure 2e-f), with images of TiO2 particles covering a carbon nitride nanosheet on a nanometer scale.The EDX spectra (Figure 2f) showed only C and N atoms on the uncovered CNNS region (Area A in Figure 2e), with predominantly Ti and O atoms on the covered region (Area B in Figure 2e). The control of TiO2 facet growth, previously suggested by XRD patterns, was further confirmed by TEM of Ti-ISO/CN (Figure 2g).TiO2 nanoparticles deposited onto the carbon nitride nanosheets were observed showing successful nanocomposite synthesis for this composite.Compared to Ti-NS/CN (Figure 2d), the morphology of the TiO2 crystals was different: an isometric bipyramidal shape was formed, with a smaller average particle size of 15 nm (Figure S4).HRTEM provided further details of the crystal planes, with a lattice spacing corresponding to the (001) and (101) anatase TiO2 planes (Figure 2h) 51.The interfacial angle between the (101) and (011) planes aligned with the theoretical value 57.Overall, TEM provided direct evidence of TiO2/CNNS nanocomposite formation as well as the successful control of TiO2 As mentioned earlier, porosity and surface area are important aspects of a photocatalyst as it represents a way to enhance interactions between the reactants and the active sites.The textural parameters of the materials are reported in Table S1 (see Figure S5 for N2 isotherms).TiO2-NS exhibited low surface area with some degree of mesoporosity.Considering that no mesopores are expected for single-crystal nanosheets, the observed mesoporosity can be assigned to void space between aggregates of NS.TiO2-ISO exhibited a A N U S C R I P T higher surface area 58 and pore volume comprised of both mesopores and some micropores.We attributed the higher surface area of TiO2-ISO to its smaller particle size and less crystalline nature.Further evidence of exfoliation of g-C3N4 to CNNS was proven by the threefold increase of surface area of the CNNS 20, and the transition from a Type H4 to H3 hysteresis loop 58.The surface area and porosity of Ti-NS/CN were enhanced compared to the parent materials.This material exhibited the highest surface area among all.The increased porosity in Ti-NS/CN was assigned to the self-assembly of TiO2-NS in the presence of CNNS forming a porous structure.Such structure is important in photocatalytic reactions providing efficient transport pathways and increasing the concentration of reactants close to active sites.On the other hand, Ti-ISO/CN exhibited an isotherm dominated by the TiO2 component with a similar surface area to TiO2.We speculate that the different trends observed for the two types of composites may be due to the distinct morphologies of TiO2-NS and TiO2-ISO: TiO2-NS might allow a particular 'assembly' of the TiO2 nanosheets and CNNS due to their similar 2D morphology forming meso-and microporous structures with higher surface area. The CO2 adsorption capacity of the photocatalysts was measured at 25 C up to 1 bar (Figure 3a, Figure S6). The materials displayed varying CO2 uptakes and the trend followed overall that of surface area.Both TiO2 materials had a CO2 adsorption capacity typical for materials of this kind 42.The slightly higher capacity of TiO2-ISO compared to TiO2-NS may be related to its higher surface area and more defective nature.The exfoliation of g-C3N4 to CNNS resulted in a five-fold increase in the CO2 capacity, as reported in other studies 59.Both nanocomposites exhibited around a twofold increase in CO2 adsorption compared to their component materials.Ti-ISO/CN exhibited a capacity of 0.521 mmol g -1 which was similar to that of Ti-NS/CN (0.488 mmol g -1 ), which, given their similar composition, was expected as chemical features take precedence over porosity in controlling CO2 adsorption at ambient pressure.The small difference observed may be due to a slightly different proportion of reactive sites or access to these sites.The increase in CO2 uptake for the composite materials is highly desirable, as a higher concentration of CO2 on the catalyst surface is expected to improve photocatalytic activity 42,60. A N U S C R I P T Besides CO2 adsorption, another important property of a photocatalyst is light absorption.This aspect was investigated using UV-Vis spectroscopy.The Kuebelka-Munk formula was used to convert the data into a Tauc plot (Figure S7) from which the bandgap energies were measured (Table S2) -the TiO2 and carbon nitride samples were treated as indirect and direct semiconductors respectively 20,24,61.As expected, the TiO2 samples both exhibited light absorption onsets in the UV region with a bandgap energy around 3.2 eV for anatase TiO2 4.On the other hand, g-C3N4 absorbed in the visible range (bandgap of 2.86 eV). Following exfoliation to CNNS, a blue shift of 0.11 eV was measured.This shift was expected 62 and was attributed to the quantum size effect in nanostructures, which led to a shift of the valence and conduction bands in opposite directions 22.The TiO2/CNNS composites exhibited light absorption spectra in between those of their TiO2 and CNNS components. Considering the light harvesting properties of the materials, they were then tested for CO2 photocatalytic conversion.Given the nature of the reaction set-upa hetereogenous gas-solid batch reactoronly gaseous products were analyzed.The tests were carried out under UV-visible illumination, for 6 h, under a CO2/H2 or CO2/H2O vapor atmosphere.The evolution rates are given in mol g -1 h -1 and mol m -2 h -1 and the TON are calculated (Figure 3b and Table S3).Under these conditions, all photocatalysts successfully reduced CO2 into CO.No other CO2 reduction products were detected in the gas phase.Considering the TiO2 photocatalysts, TiO2-ISO evolved CO at a higher rate than TiO2-NS.The trend in perofmance may seem to contradict our initial claim that 101 facet should lead to an enhanced performance.However, we note that TiO2-ISO particles are smaller and adsorb more CO2 than TiO2-NS.For this reason, a direct comparison to highlight the importance of 101 facet is not fair.In addition, an optimisation study of TiO2 001/ facet formation has shown high F -concentrations to lead to a lower catalytic activity 6,8.g-C3N4 was the least active material; in comparison, CNNS reduced CO2 at almost twice the rate, proving that exfoliation leads to a superior photocatalyst.Both TiO2/CNNS nanocomposites showed enhanced CO evolution when compared to their components.Ti-NS/CN was observed to be the most active photocatalyst and notably produced CO at a rate over 12 times higher than TiO2-NS.A physical mixture of Ti-NS and CNNS with the same composition as Ti-NS/CN evolved CO at the same rate as Ti-NS, this showed the formation of the nanocomposites using an in-situ synthesis had successfully improved the photocatalytic activity.We note that the CO production of Ti-NS/CN was 37 higher than the benchmark material TiO2 P25 (tested under the same conditions) and higher than rates reported using similar photoreactor systems 63,64.As the most active photocatalyst, further investigations into the photocatalytic process using Ti-NS/CN were undertaken. Firstly, a control test under a N2 and H2 atmosphere for Ti-NS/CN yielded no CO2 reduction products (Table S3, entry 10).Additionally, isotopic tracing experiments using 13 CO2 yielded 13 CO (Figure S8).These analyses prove the photocatalytic origin of CO detected 65.Kinetic data of the CO evolution from Ti-NS/CN over the 6 h testing period (Figure 3c) produced a linear progression, indicating a constant catalytic activity.Repeated catalytic tests of Ti-NS/CN (Figure 3d) showed an initial drop then stabilisation of CO evolution over three cycles, which may due to formation of surface products and the lack of any catalyst regeneration process.Following completion of the above tests, the XRD pattern, the porosity, the UV Vis absorption profile as well the types of chemical bonds were maintained with no significant alteration (Figure S9), pointing to the robustness of the material. The influence of the reducing agent was studied by testing Ti-NS/CN with H2O vapor (Figure 3c). Under these conditions, H2 production from water splitting is a competing side reaction.CO and H2 were detected at rates of 0.80 mol g -1 h -1 and 2.67 mol g -1 h -1 respectively.This represents a third of the CO production rate obtained when using H2 as a reducing agent.The generation of photocatalytic oxidation products was also investigated with H2O as the reducing agent (Figure 3c), O2 was detected (test performed with a 300 W lamp under UV-Vis irradation with water; evolution rates: CO: 1.96 mol g -1 h -1 , O2: 0.98 mol g -1 h -1 ).Considering the above spectroscopic and photocatalytic results, multiple factors could have impacted the photocatalytic activity of the prepared materials.For instance, the surface area played a key role as evidenced by the improvement in CO evolution from exfoliation of g-C3N4 to CNNS, and the high activity of the composite materials.In addition, it is also well known that activity is linked to the ability to photogenerate and separate charges.In the prepared materials, it is likely that a combination of both the enhancement of CO2 adsorption at the active sites and improved charge separation influenced the photoactivity.Additionally, it was clear the TiO2 facets in the composites had a large impact on the photocatalytic activity.Whilst the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/CN composites compared to their parent materials can be explained by complimentary optoelectronic and textural properties (i.e. higher surface area, CO2 adsorption, and higher UV-visible light absorption), the difference in performance between the two composites might be counterintuitive at first since TiO2-NS/CN composite performs better than the TiO2-ISO/CN composite, yet TiO2-ISO proves to be a much better catalyst than TiO2-NS.This discrepancy may only be apparent.In fact, we hypothesise that the 'matching' morphology of CNNS and TiO2-NS is responsible for the higher performance of the related composite.Indeed, TiO2-NS presents a twodimensional (2D) structure, which enables effective contact interface with the 2D morphology of CNNS.This is not the case for TiO2-ISO and CNNNS.These morphology aspects could have had an impact on the charge dynamics leading to more efficient interfacial charge transfer.As such, a detailed study was undertaken to analyse the photo-excitation and relaxation processes. Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was used to investigate the photoexcited processes in the TiO2/CN composites.TAS can follow the population of excited states over time to give an insight into their nature and timescales of key photophysical processes 66.Photoexcitation of TiO2-NS gave rise to a broad absorption spanning the visible and NIR spectral ranges persisting for hundreds of milliseconds (Figure 4a). The initial signal, at 1 s, had a larger amplitude at shorter wavelengths.Over time, the spectra evolved and the dominant signal shifted to longer wavelengths.The spectral signatures of charges in TiO2 have been well-described and allow us to distinguish between charge carriers.Holes absorption typically increases toward shorter wavelengths while electron absorption peaks 900 nm.67 This is consistent with our observations.At early timescales, we observed significant contribution of both hole and electron signals (Figure 4b).Justified below, the reference electron spectrum was taken as the long-lived signal of TiO2, while the reference hole spectra as the long-lived signal of Ti-ISO/CN.Over time, the hole component decreased more quickly compared to the electron signal (Figure 4a).As balanced electron-hole recombination is expected for TiO2, 68 we assigned the faster sub-ms decay of holes to scavenging by residual organic surface adsorbates 69.As a result, only long-lived electrons were observed after hundreds of milliseconds since all holes have been consumed.We note that the influence of these surface organics complicate interpretation of the decay kinetics.We thus limited our analysis to the distinct shape of the TAS spectra for the different samples.Turning our attention to the Ti-NS/CN composite, we observed much less distinct spectral evolution on the microsecondmillisecond timescales (Figure S10).While the spectra at longer times were similar to those observed for the TiO2-NS sample, in comparison the hole signal at 1 s was suppressed (Figure 4c). This suggested a sub-s hole transfer from the TiO2 to the CNNS, in line with the favorable energetics from the relative valence band positions of the two materials.The spectra of CNNS alone instead showed a broad absorption peaking between 550 -700 nm (Figure S11).70 Here, we considered that the CNNS spectrum was dominated by the electron signal and as such the spectral signature of holes localised on CN was too weak to be observed. The TiO2/CN composite prepared without the stabilizing agent (Ti-ISO/CN) exhibited a spectrum dominated by a signal peaking near 500 nm (Figure S12).The spectrum did not show temporal evolution, indicating that the same species were dominant throughout the microsecondmillisecond timescales.The shape of the spectra was consistent with a TiO2 hole signal, and the long-lived signal of Ti-ISO/CN was accordingly taken as the reference hole spectra.As opposed to the Ti-NS/CN composite, no long-lived electron signal was observed when the stabilizing agent (HF) was omitted, and the initial spectrum was dominated by signal from holes (Figure 4d).The stabilizing agent thus seems to have played a role in dictating the trapping of charges in the TiO2.In the Ti-ISO/CN composite prepared without HF, hole transfer to CN was impeded and holes instead accumulated on TiO2 leading to low electron concentration in TiO2, owing to faster charge recombination, and lower CO2 reduction yields. Taking the above results into account, a possible reaction pathway is proposed for photocatalytic CO2 reduction over Ti-NS/CN (Figure 5).The band structure was constructed using the bandgap measured in this study (Table S1).The conduction bands were taken from computational studies in literature relative to the 44 eV: -0.96 V for CNNS 71, and -0.28 V for anatase TiO2 72.The band alignment was verified experimentally using high resolution XPS measurements.TiO2's valence band emission produced a shape typical of anatase 73, and presented a Fermi level c.a. 3.1 eV above the valance band during the measurement (Figure S13).The valance band (Figure S14) of the CNNS is distinct from that of the anatase nanosheets, both in terms of shape and distance from the Fermi level (2.3 eV).The composite Ti-NS/CN displayed identical chemical environments and binding energies to TiO2 and to the CNNS (Figures S15-16). This demonstrates that composite formation did not change the chemical nature of the Ti-NS or the CNNS, either by N-doping of the TiO2.ordegradation of the CNNS.The valence band photoemission exhibited a spectrum highly similar to anatase nanosheets both in terms of shape and the relative position of the valence band.This implies that the Fermi level of the anatase nanosheets is largely unaffected upon formation of the Ti-NS/CN composite.This result is broadly consistent with an Ti-NS:CNNS ratio more than 90 (in favour of Ti-NS) and the strong n-type character of the anatase nanosheets, as smaller amounts of slightly 'n-type' CNNS interfacing with larger quantities of highly n-type Ti-NS should be dominated by the chemical potential of the strongly n-doped doped anatase.The hypothesis that the Fermi level of the Ti-NS is largely unaffected upon composite formation can be further interrogated by comparing the oxide O 1s core level spectrum of the anatase nanosheets before and after composite formation.O 1s oxide core levels in metal oxides are broadly insensitive to local changes in bonding (e.g.metal oxidation state).As such, the changes in binding energydefined as the difference between the core level energy and the Fermi level energyof the O 1s oxide core line can be used to measure changes in Fermi level energy that occur upon modifying an oxide 74.(see supporting information for further details).Within an experimental error of (0 .15eV), the binding energy of the O 1s oxide peak of the Ti-NS is unchanged upon composite formation (Figure S16), again implying that the Fermi level is not strongly affected by forming a composite with CNNS.Intriguingly, the number of positions of the N 1s environments associated with the CNNS are also unaffected by composite formation.(Figure S15).This result would suggest that the Fermi level of the CNNS is not strongly affected by composite formation and therefore would imply that the absolute Fermi level energies of the Ti-NS and CNNS lie at similar energies. Using the absolute energy of the anatase conduction band (-0.25 V vs SHE, 75) to situate the relative energies measured using XPS and optical absorption spectroscopy on an absolute energy scale (SHE scale), a"

Figure 1.Material characterization analyses confirming the formation of the TiO2/CNNS composites: a) crystal growth.Synthesis in the presence of HF resulted in nanosheet TiO2 formation with more 001 facets; while the absence of HF led to the formation of isometric bipyramidal TiO2 with more 101 facets.

TAS spectra used to study photoexcitation processes in the powdered samples.a) Spectra at band diagram of the Ti-NS/CN system was constructed (FigureS17).Our estimate of the conduction band energy of CNNS using this method (-0.75 VSHE 0.15 VSHE) compares favourably to previously reported values obtained using other techniques76.As shown in Figure5, the composite heterojunction was Type II.Under UV-vis illumination, both the CNNS and TiO2 absorbed photons with sufficient energy to generate electron-hole pairs.Both CNNS and TiO2 reduced CO2 to CO as both sets of photoexcited electrons possess sufficient electrochemical potential.The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Ti-NS/CN can be explained by two main factors: availability of CO2, and availability of photoexcited electrons.Compared to their constituent materials, CO2 concentration was increased at the catalytic sites owing to their increased CO2 adsorption capacity.Recombination of electron-hole pairs was suppressed by interfacial charge transfer via the heterojunction present in this material.This increased the abundance of electrons available for catalysis and resulted in a further increase in CO2 conversion.
