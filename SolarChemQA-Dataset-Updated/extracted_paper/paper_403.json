    "content": "Exploring surface exposed highly active crystal facets for photocatalytic oxidations is promising in utilizing monoclinic WO 3 semiconductor.However, the previously reported high active facets for monoclinic WO 3 were mainly toward enhancing photocatalytic reductions.Here we report that the WO 3 with 100 facet orientation and tuned surface electronic band structure can effectively enhance photocatalytic oxidation properties.The 100 faceted WO 3 single crystals are synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method.The UV-visible diffuse reflectance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy valence band spectra, and photoelectrochemical measurements suggest that the 100 faceted WO 3 has a much higher energy level of valence band maximum in compared with the normal WO 3 crystals without preferred orientation of crystal face.The density functional theory calculations reveal that the shift of O 2p and W 5d states in 100 face induce such a unique band structure.In comparison with the normal WO 3 , the 100 faceted WO 3 exhibits an O 2 evolution rate about 5.1 times in water splitting, and also shows an acetone evolution rate of 4.2 times as well as CO 2 evolution rate of 3.8 times in gaseous degradation of 2propanol.This study demonstrates an efficient crystal face engineering route to tune the surface electronic band structure for enhanced photocatalytic oxidations."

    "content": "Preparation of Tungsten Oxides: The WO 3 materials were synthesized by hydrothermal method.In a typical process, tungsten acid (H 2 WO 4 , 0.002 mol, AR grade, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), and triethylamine (Et 3 NH, 15 mL, AR grade, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) were mixed together and dissolved in 400 mL of distilled water under vigorous magnetic stirring at room temperature.After the H 2 WO 4 dissolved completely, HCl solution was added dropwise into the solution to adjust the pH value to 2.1 -3.0.Then the white precipitates were generated promptly.The resulting suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (500 mL), which was subsequently heated at 180 C for 32 h.After natural cooling to room temperature, the product was filtered and washed for several times with deionized water and ethanol and then dried at 180 C for about 10 h. For water splitting to produce O 2 , the WO 3 powders (0.1 g) were dispersed in 100 ml of H 2 O in a quartz plate covered glass reaction cell.AgNO 3 (0.5 g) was added in the cell as sacrificial reagent.A 300W Xe arc lamp with a L42 UV-light cutoff filter ( 400 nm) was employed as the light source for the photocatalytic reactions.The amount of evolved O 2 was determined from a gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu, Japan).For decomposition of gaseous 2-propanol, the photocatalysts (0.2 g) were spread uniformly in a glass plate with area of 8 cm 2 , which was set in the bottom of a quartzmade vessel.Then the vessel was washed by artificial air V(N 2 ): V(O 2 ) 4:1 for 10 min to remove adsorbed gaseous impurities.Proper amount of gaseous 2-propanol was injected into the vessel and maintained in dark for 1 h to establish an adsorption-desorption equilibrium.The visible light was produced from 300 W Xe lamp with a L42 filter and a water filter.The gas phase products during the photocatalytic reactions were analyzed with a gas chromatograph system (GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan), using a flame ionization detector (FID) for organic compounds determination.For photoelectrochemical measurements, the detailed information was described in supporting information. The density of states (DOS) plots of WO 3 were obtained by using the first principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to specify the electronic structure of WO 3 and 100 facet in these models.CASTEP (Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package) was used to perform DFT calculations with the GGA-PBE adopted.The Brilloiouin zone k-point sampling was performed using a 3 3 3 Monkhorst -Pack (MP) mesh for whole WO 3 unit cell and 3 3 1 for 100 faceted WO 3 , and the cutoff energy of plane waves is set to 380 eV.The convergence criteria for structural optimization were set to be Ultra-fine quality with the tolerance for self-consistent field (SCF), energy, maximum force, and maximum displacement of 5.010 -6 eV per atom, 5.010 -6 eV per atom, 0.01 eVA -1 , and 5.010 -4 A, respectively. Characterizations: X-ray diffraction were performed by a RIGAKU Rint-2000 X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Cu-K radiation (1.54184A) equipped. Scanning electron microscopy images were recorded with a FEI Helios Nanolab 600i field emission scanning electron microscopy.Transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution were performed with a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 field emission transmission electron microscopy operated at 200 kV.UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2600 Spectrophotometer.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra were recorded on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi spectrophotometer.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas measurements were carried out in an ASAP 2020 HD88 Surface Area Analyzer.Time-resolved photofluorescent spectra were recorded from a Fluorolog 3-22 steady state time resolved fluorescence spectrometer."

    "content": "To fabricate the WO 3 products, tungsten acid was dissolved in alkaline solution firstly, and then the solution was transformed into autoclave for hydrothermal reactions after adding proper amount of acid to adjust the pH value.Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of WO 3 product prepared at pH value of 2.5 by using triethylamine (Et 3 NH) to dissolve H 2 WO 4 .All diffraction peaks are indexed to monoclinic phase of WO 3 with JCPDS cards No. 43-1035, indicating that the product has high purity.In comparison with the standard XRD profile, the relative strength of (200) diffraction peak in as-papered product is much stronger than other diffraction peaks such as (002) and (020).For instance, the diffraction intensity ratio of (200) / (002) (abbreviated as R ( 200) / ( 002) ) is about 6.0 for as prepared product, which is much larger than the R (200) / (002) 0.99 in standard XRD profile.This phenomenon suggests that the WO 3 synthesized in this condition have a preferred crystal face growth of 100 facets.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the morphology and structure of the product.Figure 2a illustrates a typical SEM image of WO 3 product prepared in pH value of 2.5 by using Et 3 NH to dissolve H 2 WO 4 .Most of the products exhibit plate-like morphology with wide size distributions (length is from 1 to 3 m and width is from 100 to 500 nm).The higher magnified SEM image in Figure 2b displays that these plates have a nanoscale thickness of 50-100 nm with rectangular cross section and most of the plates have well-developed flat facets and sharp facet edges, implying a preferred crystal face would be exposed.A TEM image in Figure 3c shows some nanoplate with width of 100 -600 nm and the constant contrast in each nanoplate indicates a uniform thickness in a single nanoplate. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern taken from a nanoplate (marked by the arrow in Figure 2c) is shown in Figure 2d.and (020) facets, respectively.All these characterizations serve as strong evidence that the single crystal WO 3 nanoplates with preferred growth of 100 facet is successfully fabricated.Base on above analysis, the structural model of the product is illustrated in Figure 2f.In a perfect nanoplate, the major exposed face in a nanoplate are 100 facets.Such a face distribution caused the much stronger (100) diffraction peak than other peaks in XRD profile including the (010) and (001) peaks.Figure 2g is the atomic structure of monoclinic WO 3 , displaying that every W atom is 6-fold coordinated and O atom is 2-fold coordinated.During the formation of WO 3 crystals, it was suggested that H 2 WO 4 dissolved in the alkali solution formed by Et 3 NH and water firstly: 27 Then, droppings of HCl solution provided an acid environment and tungstic acid precipitation was produced: transformed into m-WO 3 under the hydrothermal condition and grew into WO 3 crystals: 32 To study the key factors for the formation of 100 faceted WO 3 , some control experiments were carried out.Figure 3a agent to change the growth rate of some crystal faces as the case in our previous reports. 333435 More importantly, the formation of m-WO To determine the possible existed defect of W 5 generated in synthetic process, the charge states of the products were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS).In the following study, the bandgaps of the as synthesized products were evaluated.Figure 5a presents the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrum for 100 faceted WO 3 as well as the normal WO 3 for comparison purpose.The optical absorbance edges for both 100 faceted WO 3 and normal WO 3 are about 464 nm, exhibiting a good absorption ability in visible light region.The bandgaps are determined by equation (h) n/2 A(h -Eg), where the , , A, Eg, and n are the absorption coefficient, incident light frequency, constant, band gap, and an integer, respectively. 23,38 s an indirect band transition semiconductor, the value of n for m-WO 3 is 4. The band gap energy for the WO 3 products are obtained for the plot of (ah) 2 versus h.As shown in the inset of Figure 5a, these bandgaps are calculated to be 2.84 eV for 100 faceted WO 3 and 2.85 eV for normal WO 3 .After that, XPS valence band (VB) spectra were recorded to detect the relative VBM positions of WO 3 crystals.As illustrated in Figure 5b, 100 faceted WO 3 shows VBM about 2.36 eV, which is about 0.31 eV larger than 2.05 eV for normal WO 3 . Based on the bandgaps and VBM determined from Figure 5a and b, the relative band positions of 100 faceted WO 3 and normal WO 3 versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, pH 0) can be proposed.As shown in Figure 5c, the VBM in 100 faceted WO 3 is about 0.31 eV higher than that of the normal WO 3 .Correspondingly, the CBM of 100 faceted WO 3 is positioned at a lower energy level than that of the normal WO 3 as the bandgaps between the two products are similar.To further prove this band structure, especially the directly evidence for the difference in proposed CBM between the two products, a photochemical method was employed for determining the possibility of a shift in the flat-band positions between 100 faceted WO 3 and normal WO 3 . 3940041 The obtained results were given in Figure S5 of supporting information, which presented the dark and photo-currents vs. applied electrode potential curves.The flat-band potential for 100 faceted WO 3 was detected as about -0.24 V (vs.Ag / AgCl, pH 7). Otherwise, the flat-band potential for the normal WO 3 was approximately -0.27 V (vs.Ag / AgCl, pH 7), which was about -0.03 V smaller than that of 100 faceted WO 3 .These measurements suggested that the energy level of CBM for 100 faceted WO 3 was indeed lower than that of the normal WO 3 , consistent with the trend of proposed band structure in Figure 5c.Based on above analysis, tailoring the preferred orientation crystal facets of WO 3 to 100 appears to shift VBM toward higher energy level whereas CBM to lower energy level.The density of states (DOS) plots based on DFT calculations from these models are shown in Figure 6.In comparison with the whole WO 3 unit cell, the total VBM DOS of 100 locates at higher energy mainly due to the negatively shift of O 2p orbitals as illustrated in Figure 6. Correspondingly, the total DOS of CBM in 100 shows a same shift because of the W 5d DOS. Thus, the shift of both O 2p and W 5d states in 100 caused the diversity of VBM and CBM in compared with whole unit cell, which was a main reason why 100 faceted WO 3 nanoplates showed a higher energy level of VBM than that of the normal WO 3 crystals. According to the theory of photocatalysis, the VBM locates at higher energy level will induce stronger oxidation ability during photocatalytic reactions.To evaluate the photocatalytic oxidation ability, the water splitting to produce O 2 over the as synthesized 100 faceted WO 3 was studied.In the aqueous solution of AgNO 3 , the process that photogenerated holes oxidize 42,43 whereas the electrons are consumed by the Ag produced from AgNO 3 : Ag e - Ag E(Ag /Ag) 0.80 V vs. NHE, pH 0. 42,43 igure 7a shows a typical result for photocatalytic O 2 evolution from aqueous AgNO 3 solution under visible light irradiation ( 400nm).The produced O 2 over 100 facet orientated WO 3 and normal WO 3 in 4 h are about 33.9 mol and 17.7 mol, respectively.Obviously, the 100 faceted WO 3 shows higher evolution rate of O 2 than normal WO 3 in water splitting (8.5 molg -1 h -1 vs. 4.4 molg -1 h -1 ).It is known that the surface area of a photocatalyst greatly affects its catalytic efficiency.The Brunauer-Emmett- Teller (BET) surface areas are calculated as 4.7 m 2 g -1 for 100 faceted WO 3 and 12.6 m 2 g -1 for normal WO 3 (the detailed information is shown in Figure S7 of supporting information), the normalized evolution rate to produce O 2 in per square meter is thus calculated as 17.9 molh -1 m - 2 for 100 facet orientated WO 3 and 3.5 molh -1 m -2 for normal WO 3 as shown in Figure 7b; the The gaseous photocatalytic oxidation were also studied by degradation of 2-propanol over 100 facet orientated and normal WO 3 .The degradation of 2-propanol can be summarized as follows: firstly, the 2-propanol photo-oxidized in to acetone in a one-photon reaction: CH 3 CHOHCH 3 h CH 3 COCH 3 2H e -; then, the acetone is oxidized into CO 2 by a multiphoton reaction: 444546 Such a clear mechanism and typical intermediate product enable us to compare the photocatalytic oxidation performance over the 100 faceted WO 3 and normal WO 3 under the gaseous atmosphere.In our experiment, all products are kept in full adsorption of 2-propanol.The produced gaseous acetone in one-photon reaction from oxidation of 2-propanol is illustrated in Figure 8a, which displayed that the generated acetone is linear respect to the irradiation time in 1 h.The evolution rate of acetone over 100 faceted WO 3 and normal WO 3 are about 17.5 molh -1 and 11.2 molh -1 respectively. Taking account of the surface area effect, the 100 faceted WO 3 showed about 4.2 times activity than the normal WO 3 when the evolution rate of acetone is normalized by the BET surface areas (18.6 vs. 4.4 molh -1 m -2 , as shown in Figure 8c).For the multiphoton reaction to produce CO 2 , the 100 faceted WO 3 also shows enhanced activity as shown in Figure 8b.The produced CO 2 is 2.2 molh -1 over 100 faceted WO 3 and 1.7 molh -1 over normal WO 3 .Meanwhile, when the evolution rate of CO 2 is normalized by the BET surface areas, the evolution rate CO 2 over 100 faceted WO 3 shows about 3.8 times than normal WO 3 (2.3 vs. 0.7 molh -1 m -2 , as shown in Figure 1 Standard XRD profile of JCPDS cards No. 43-1035 and XRD profile of the prepared The diffraction spots are indexed to 100 zone axis of m-WO 3 , which indicates that this nanoplate is single crystal phase and the exposed crystal face is 100 facet.The directions of (001) and (010) diffraction spots suggest that the long dimension is along 001 whereas the lateral dimension is along 010.The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Figure 2e taken under the 100 displays two clear interplanars distance measured as 0.386 and 0.377 nm (also see in Figure S1 of supporting information), corresponding to (002) Figure 2 (a) SEM image, (b) enlarged SEM image, (c) TEM image, (d) SAED pattern under is the XRD profile for the product prepared at a controlled synthetic condition without Et 3 NH but kept other synthetic condition unchanged (in the presence of H 2 WO 4 , water, and HCl under hydrothermal environment of 180 C for 32 h in pH value of 2.5).It is observed that the preferred growth of 100 is diminished (the R (200) / (002) decreased to 0.96) and the relative intensity ratio of 100 to other diffraction peaks is close to the standard PDF card in Figure1, indicating there is no obvious preferred growth of crystal face appeared.The SEM and TEM images in FigureS2a-b of supporting information show that the product is composed of quasi-cubic-like nanocrystals with sizes from 50-200 nm.The HRTEM and SAED pattern FigureS2c-d of supporting information display that the (010) face is exposed on a face of cube (detailed analysis can be seen in FigureS2of supporting information).All characterizations implies a uniform distribution of 100, 010, and 001 on the surface, which is different to the as prepared 100 faceted WO 3 nanoplates.Furthermore, the Et 3 NH was replaced same amount of NaOH and NH 3 solutions were also carried out.The XRD profiles of the products in Figure3b and cshow that only pure phase hexagonal phase of tungsten oxide hydrates (WO 3 0.33H 2 O, indexes to JCPDS cards No. 35-1001) are generated.The SEM images in Figure S3a and b of supporting information display that nanorods are formed when the products are prepared by NaOH and NH 3 , which are much different to the product prepared by Et 3 NH.All these results strongly suggest that the addition of Et 3 NH in synthetic process played unique function in tuning the growth of monoclinic phase WO 3 with exposed 100 facets, which may be attributed to that the Et 3 NH 2 generated from Et 3 NH solution serves as capping 3 crystal growth was sensitive to the pH values during the synthesis.When the product was synthesized at pH value of 3.0 and kept other condition unchanged, the preferred orientation of 100 face was weakened with R (200) / (002) decreased to 3.0 as shown in the XRD profile of Figure 3d.Moreover, when pH value was decreased to 2.1, the 100 face preferred growth was almost diminished with R (200) / (002) decreased to 1.5 and the impurity of orthorhombic WO 3 0.33H 2 O is generated as shown in Figure 3e.Hence, the pH value of 2.5 was a relatively optimal condition for the formation of m-WO 3 with strongly preferred growth of 100 facet.Corresponding SEM images of WO 3 prepared at pH value of 3 and 2.1 are illustrated in Figure S3a and b of supporting information, respectively.Different from the product prepared at pH value of 2.5, WO 3 products obtained at pH value of 3.0 and 2.1 is mainly composed of nanorods with rectangle like cross section.The changes in morphology may be caused by the increase of other facets such as (010) and (001) in the surface. Figure 3 XRD profiles of WO 3 products prepared with (a) no base, (b) NaOH, and (c) NH 3 as Figure4b, the W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 locate at binding energy 35.2 eV and 37.4 eV, respectively.

Figure 5 (a) UV-Vis spectra of the 100 faceted WO 3 and normal WO 3 ; the inset is the 100 faceted WO 3 shows about 5.1 times O 2 evolution rate as normal WO 3 .Obviously, the 100 faceted WO 3 exhibited much enhanced performance than normal WO 3 in water oxidation to produce O 2 .The apparent quantum yield of 100 faceted WO 3 was calculated, which was 0.7 at wavelength of 400 10 nm.

    "content": "In summary, the surface electronic band structure could be tuned for enhanced photocatalytic oxidations by constructing m-WO 3 with preferred 100 facet orientation.The 100 faceted m-WO 3 was successfully fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method without high temperature calcinations.The Et 3 NH and pH value of 2.5 plays crucial role in the preferred growth of 100 facets.The VBM of 100 faceted WO 3 shows about 0.31 eV greater energy level than that of the normal WO 3 synthesized at similar condition.The DFT calculations revealed that such a unique surface band structure was caused by the shift of O 2p and W 5d states.During the evaluation of photocatalytic performance, the 100 faceted WO 3 showed about 5.1 times O 2 evolution rate as the normal WO 3 in oxidizing water to produce O 2 .Moreover, the 100 faceted WO 3 exhibited 4.2 times acetone evolution rate and 3.8 times CO 2 evolution rate as the normal WO 3 in oxidizing 2-propanol under air atmosphere.This work reveals a new high active crystal face in WO 3 and provides an efficient method to tune the surface electronic band structure for enhancing the photocatalytic oxidations both in liquid and gaseous phase.
