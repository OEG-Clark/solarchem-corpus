    "content": "A fundamental challenge in CO 2 photoreduction is to establish highly efficient photocatalysts with efficient charge separation, wide-spectrum absorption and effective CO 2 adsorption.The former two can be achieved by fabricating Z-scheme systems with narrow-bandgap semiconductor, and the last can be realized by creating vacancy defects in the catalyst.Herein, ZnSe/CdSe composites with different ZnSe/CdSe ratios are prepared via epitaxial growth of CdSe on ZnSe nanoparticles, which exhibit much higher CO 2 photoreduction performance than pristine ZnSe under visible-light irradiation.ZnSe/CdSe (precursor ratio Zn:Cd 1:0.125)exhibits an optimal CO yield (116.9 mol g -1 ), which is 33.4 times that of pristine ZnSe (3.5 mol g -1 ).Electron spin resonance (ESR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that charge transfer at the ZnSe/CdSe interface follows Z-scheme pathway.Improved light harvesting by loading CdSe can further promote charge generation.Se vacancy generated during the preparation can facilitate CO 2 adsorption."

    "content": "Zinc acetate (Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 , Sinopharm, AR, 99 ), selenium (Se, Macklin, AR, 99.99 ), diethanolamine (DEA, C 4 H 11 NO 2 , Macklin, AR, 99 ), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Tianjin Damao, AR), cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO 3 ) 2 4H 2 O Macklin, AR, 99 ), sodium borohydride (NaBH 4 , Aladdin, 98 ) triethanolamine (TEOA, C 6 H 15 NO 3 , Aladdin, 99.0 ) were used without further purification. ZnSe nanoparticles were synthesized through a modified hydrothermal route, with DEA as the morphology control agent 42.First, 0.02 mol of Se powder, 0.02 mol of Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 , and 0.16 mol of NaOH were dissolved in 60 ml of deionized water under constant stir for 1 h.Then, 6 ml of DEA was added into the above solution and stirred for 0.5 h.Subsequently, the mixture was transferred into an autoclave, and heated at 200 C for 24 h.The obtained precipitates were collected via centrifuge and washed with ethanol and deionized water for several times.Finally, the products were dried at 60 C for 12 h in vacuum. A facile cation-exchange route was used to synthesize the ZnSe/CdSe composites from the pristine ZnSe, using the solubility difference of ZnSe and CdSe as the driving force.Under constant stir and N 2 gas, 0.45 g of as-prepared ZnSe was added into the Cd(NO 3 ) 2 4H 2 O aqueous solution.The cation-exchange reaction (ZnSe Cd 2 CdSe Zn 2 ) was kept at 96 C for 8 h.The resultant precipitates were washed and dried in the same way as ZnSe nanoparticles.The obtained samples are denoted as ZnSe/CdSe-x (x 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), corresponding to the molar ratio of Zn: Cd in the precursor, i.e., 1:0.0625, 1:0.09375, 1:0.125, 1:0.5, 1:2.5, respectively. 5 mmol of Se and 0.013 mol of NaBH 4 were dissolved in 20 ml of water under N 2 flow.Then 50 ml of Cd(NO 3 ) 2 4H 2 O (0.25 mol L -1 ) aqueous solution was added into the above solution.After stirring for h, 50 ml of water, 5 mmol of NaOH and 1 mmol of glycine were added to the resultant solution.The obtained precipitant was washed several times and dried in vacuum. The microstructure and morphology of the obtained photocatalysts were analyzed by using scanning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi-SU8220) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN).X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Focus, Bruker) with Cu K radiation ( 1.5406 A).Element analysis was measured by a NexION 300X inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).Raman spectra were recorded on Thermo Fisher DXR Raman spectrometer.Binding energy of the element was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCA-LAB250Xi, Thermo Fisher).UV-vis diffuse-reflectance spectra of the samples were collected on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 spectrometer with an integrating sphere.Electron spin resonance (ESR) study for vacancy analysis was conducted on a Bruker E500 ESR spectrometer at -196 C. The ESR spectra of O 2 -radical were measured at room temperature using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as the trapping agent.Photoluminescence (PL) decay profiles were analyzed on an ultrafast lifetime spectrofluorometer (Delta flex, Horiba Jobinyvon IBH Inc.), with an excitation wavelength of 375 nm.CO 2 adsorption isotherm was acquired by using an automatic specific surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics Tristar II 3020). (Photo-)Electrochemical measurements were carried out on Zahner IM6 electrochemical workstation in CO 2 -saturated aqueous solution (0.5 mol L -1 Na 2 SO 4 , 20 vol. TEOA).Three-electrode configuration was used with FTO glass coated with the catalyst (1 cm 1 cm) as the working electrode, SCE reference electrode and Pt counter electrode.Visible-light illumination (420 nm 780 nm, 100 mW cm -2 ) in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photocurrent measurements was provided by a LED (WLC02, Zahner), which was controlled by a potentiostat (PP211, Zahner).EIS under dark and illumination were tested under open circuit potential (OCP) with a sinusoidal ac perturbation of 5 mV over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to kHz.Transient photocurrent measurements were performed under OCP with an illumination period of 10 s.Mott-Schottky characterization was carried out under a frequency of 1 kHz and an amplitude of 5 mV. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment was carried out in a gasclosed system connected to the gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using Porpak Q column (6 foot, 1/8 inch, 80/ 100) and molecular sieve 5A packed column (8 foot, 1/8 inch, 60/80) for online analysis of gas products.Liquid products were analyzed by the gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) equipped with an FID detector using a capillary column (HP-INNOWax, 30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 m). Typically, 30 mg of photocatalysts were dispersed in a mixed solution containing 80 ml of Milli-Q water and 20 ml of TEOA.The slurry system was vacuum treated for three times under constant stirring before the experiment.Then the high purity CO 2 was purged into the system for 2 h to reach CO 2 adsorption-desorption balance on the photocatalyst surface.After the gas inlet and outlet were shut down, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was performed in a closed system at 15 C under visiblelight irradiation (420 nm 780 nm, light intensity 286 mW cm -2 ) by a 300 W Xe lamp.Products were accumulated in the system over the reaction and were analyzed online every hour. All calculations have been performed by DFT within the frame work of projector-augmented-wave (PAW) 43 pseudopotentials implemented in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) 44,45.Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) 46 formulated by Perdew -Burke -Ernzerhof (PBE) 47 was used to describe the exchange and correlation potential.The ZnSe (111) and CdSe (111) surfaces were modeled using 6 and 2 layers, respectively, with thick layers of vacuum to eliminate the interactions among the periodic images of the surface. For band-decomposed charge density calculations, the ZnSe (111)/ CdSe (111) heterostructure was designed by placing 2 layers of CdSe (111) on 6 layers of ZnSe (111).The cutoff ; energy was set to 520 eV for the electronic wave function.The structures were successfully optimized by reducing the force and energy on each ion below 0.02 eV A -1 and 10 -6 eV, respectively.These optimized structures were further used to investigate the electronic structure of the materials.The electronic and optical properties of CdSe (111), ZnSe (111) and ZnSe (111)/CdSe (111) have been calculated by Heyd -Scuseria -Ernzerhof (HSE06) 48,49 part of electronelectron interaction, and represent the screening parameter and mixing coefficient, respectively. 0.2 A -1 and 0.325 were used throughout the calculations. Moreover, the adsorption energy of single CO 2 or CO molecule on perfect ZnSe (111) and ZnSe (111) with Se vacancy (V Se ) was calculated by using Eq. 2 50, taking the calculation of CO 2 as an example, where E CO2 /surface , E CO2 , E surface is the respective total energy of CO 2 molecule adsorbed on surface, isolated CO 2 molecule, and clean surface."

    "content": "ZnSe/CdSe was successfully synthesized via cation-exchange reaction, which is illustrated in detail in Section 2.3.Bare ZnSe nanoparticles with polyhedral shape were constructed as shown in Fig. 1a andb, which are well dispersed with a diameter of around 200 nm.Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns demonstrate its single crystalline nature and the facet on the top surface is indexed as (111) (Fig. 1c) 51.Pure CdSe exists as small nanoparticles (Fig. S1).In ZnSe/CdSe composites, CdSe nanoparticles preferentially grow along the edges and some surfaces of ZnSe crystal, while such modification causes almost no influence on the original morphology of ZnSe (Fig. S2).With increasing loading amount of CdSe, the ZnSe surface becomes rougher (Fig. S2).Here ZnSe/CdSe-3 is used as an example for detailed analysis.The CdSe nanoparticles can be clearly observed on ZnSe (Fig. 2a andb).The SAED pattern of ZnSe/CdSe-3 indicates that ZnSe still keeps the single crystal nature after CdSe deposition, while no diffraction points corresponding to CdSe show up due to its low content (Fig. 2c).High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image can further confirm the existence of CdSe (Fig. 2d).It is worth noting that a robust heterojunction can be readily constructed between them since ZnSe and CdSe share the same cubic crystal structure and possess minute lattice mismatch (7).In Fig. 2d, the parallel lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.200 nm and 0.215 nm are ascribed to the (220) facets of ZnSe and CdSe 35, respectively, The XRD patterns of pure ZnSe and CdSe match well with cubic blende ZnSe (PDF88-2345) and CdSe (PDF88-2346) (Fig. S3), respectively.The major peaks of ZnSe/CdSe composites with different ratios of CdSe appear at the same position as those of pristine ZnSe, with no diffraction peaks belonging to CdSe due to its low content.XPS and Raman spectra were further collected to confirm the presence of CdSe.In the Raman spectrum of ZnSe (Fig. 3), two prominent peaks at 183 and 230 cm -1 can be assigned to the transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) phonon modes of ZnSe 52,53, respectively, which also show up in the ZnSe/CdSe composites.A new peak in the vicinity of 392 cm -1 appears for all the ZnSe/CdSe composites, which is especially clear for ZnSe/CdSe-5 containing the largest CdSe ratio.This peak can be identified as surface optical (SO) LO phonon modes in CdSe 54, which can certify the existence of CdSe in the ZnSe/CdSe composites. The chemical composition is further confirmed by XPS analysis.All the signals of Zn, Auger Zn, Cd, Se and Auger Se can be observed in the XPS survey spectrum for ZnSe/CdSe-3 sample (Fig. 4a), further verifying the formation of CdSe in the composites.In detail, the two fitted peaks at the binding energy of 54.9 and 54.1 eV for ZnSe/CdSe-3 correspond to Se 3d 3/2 and Se 3d 5/2 of Se 2-(Fig.4b), and the peaks at 1044.3 and 1021.2 eV are assigned to Zn 2p 1/2 and Zn 2p 3/2 of Zn 2 (Fig. 4c) 14,55.It is noted that the binding energies of both Se 3d and Zn 2p for ZnSe/CdSe-3 are lower than that for ZnSe.The binding energies of Cd 3d are almost the same for CdSe and ZnSe/CdSe (Fig. 4d), with two peaks ascribed to Cd 3d 3/2 and Cd 3d 5/2 of Cd 2 centered respectively at 412.0 and 405.2 eV 55,56.Thus, it is speculated that low coordination Se atoms exist in the ZnSe of ZnSe/CdSe-3 sample.The electron cloud density around Zn atoms in pure ZnSe is lower than that of ZnSe/CdSe-3, implying the existence of Se vacancies (V Se ) in ZnSe/CdSe-3.This result can be evidenced by ESR spectra (Fig. 5), as ZnSe/CdSe-3 shows a strong ESR response at g-value of 2.0036 caused by the electron-trapped centers of V Se 57.Since there is no ESR signal for pristine ZnSe and CdSe, it is proposed that the V Se in ZnSe/CdSe is formed during the cation-exchange process through preferential generation of CdSe (10 -35.2 ) driven by its lower K sp compared to ZnSe (10 -25.4 ) 55, leaving V Se in the ZnSe part.Furthermore, ICP-MS was adopted to determine the atomic ratio of Zn to Cd in different samples.It is found that the Cd amount grows in sequence from ZnSe/CdSe-1 to ZnSe/CdSe-5 (Table S1), which is consistent with the precursor amount. Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was carried out in aqueous solution with TEOA as the sacrificial agent over the as-prepared samples since no product can be detected using water as the electron donor even under the full spectrum irradiation (Fig. S4a).Except that no any products are detected over CdSe, CO is observed as the only product for all the catalysts.Furthermore, control experiments were conducted without CO 2 or light, with no product detected, confirming CO 2 is the only carbon source of the produced CO (Fig. S4b).There are no any liquid products either, as confirmed by GC results (Fig. S4c).As shown in Fig. 6a, the yield of CO for ZnSe/CdSe composites is much higher than that of pristine ZnSe after 6 h continuous irradiation.It is noted that the CO yield for ZnSe/CdSe-3 reaches 116.9 mol g -1 , about 33.4 times of that for pristine ZnSe (3.5 mol g -1 ).In addition, long-term reaction test has manifested the relatively stable performance of ZnSe/CdSe-3 (Fig. 6b), as the CO yield increases at a near-linear trend under continuous irradiation for 12 h.Moreover, there was little change in the morphology of ZnSe/CdSe-3 after being used for CO 2 photoreduction experiment (Fig. S5a).HRTEM, XRD patterns and XPS analysis further confirm no variation in the composition of ZnSe/CdSe-3 after the reaction, suggesting its potential for long-term application (Fig. S5b-d). The generation, separation and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers play an important role in the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and are thus investigated to elucidate the enhanced performance of ZnSe/ CdSe.The light absorption property was evaluated by recording the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra.As shown in Fig. 7, ZnSe exhibits light absorption at wavelength shorter than 470 nm, while CdSe responds to a wider wavelength range that extends to more than 700 nm.The visible-light absorption is remarkably enhanced once ZnSe is loaded by CdSe, indicating increased ability of the charge carrier generation. The photoelectrochemical measurements under OCP were carried out to gain more information on the charge behavior of different samples.Fig. 8a depicts the transient photocurrent response of the samples upon chopped-light irradiation.Generally, high photocurrent is an indicator of highly efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers, as the photocurrent under OCP mainly results from the photoinduced charge diffusion.It is evident that ZnSe/CdSe-3 displays much higher photocurrent response than ZnSe, demonstrating better photoinduced charge carrier separation and transfer of ZnSe/CdSe-3. EIS analysis was employed to further evaluate the performance of charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.It is normally accepted that a small radius of the semicircle in Nyquist plot indicates a low charge transfer resistance and high electron-hole separation efficiency.The resistance under irradiation is lower than the corresponding value in dark for both samples (Fig. 8b), due to higher charge carrier density caused by the photogenerated charge carriers.Moreover, the arc radius for ZnSe/CdSe-3 is smaller than that of ZnSe both in dark and under irradiation, suggesting an enhanced charge carrier separation and faster interfacial charge transfer in ZnSe/CdSe-3.Furthermore, charge transfer dynamics are studied by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra (Fig. 8c), fitted by a biexponential model (Table S2).The average lifetime for ZnSe/CdSe-3 (0.97 ns) is shorter than that for ZnSe (1.17 ns), indicating an accelerated charge transfer between ZnSe and CdSe in ZnSe/CdSe-3. It is generally acknowledged that the charge separation in a composite is closely related to its band alignment.Based on the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the bandgap is determined to be 2.64 and 1.75 eV for ZnSe and CdSe, respectively (Fig. S6a).The band edge position of ZnSe and CdSe can be derived from the Mott-Schottky measurements.The positive slope for both ZnSe (Fig. S6b) and CdSe (Fig. S6c) indicates that they are n-type semiconductors, which agrees well with the anodic photocurrent response results (Fig. 8a).The flat band potential (E fb ) is determined to be -1.29 and -0.28 V (vs NHE) for ZnSe and CdSe, respectively.Considering that the E fb of an n-type semiconductor is close to its conduction band (CB), the respective CB potential for ZnSe and CdSe is estimated approximately to be -1.29 and -0.28 V (vs NHE) and, accordingly, the valence band (VB) potential is 1.35 and 1.47 V (vs NHE), respectively.Hence, the band alignment of ZnSe/CdSe presents as a staggered structure, as shown in Fig. S6d. ESR analysis was carried out to detect signal would be detected.Such a Z-scheme charge transfer pathway was further verified by DFT theoretical calculations.The (111) facet of both ZnSe and CdSe is adopted for the calculation since the surface at the contact interface is (111) for both materials according to Fig. 2. The band-decomposed charge density of both valance band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) for the ZnSe/CdSe composite has been calculated.As shown in Fig. 10a (also see Fig. S7), the CBM and VBM are not localized in ZnSe/CdSe because the contribution is from all of the states (i.e., Zn and Se from ZnSe, Cd and Se from CdSe).In other words, the photogenerated electrons and holes are not spatially separated like those in the type-II heterojunction since they are delocalized.So fast recombination of charge carriers can occur in the ZnSe/CdSe composite 58,59.Furthermore, the calculated work function of the exposed ZnSe (111) and CdSe (111) surface is 4.95 and 5.65 eV, respectively (Fig. 10b andc).When the surface of ZnSe (111) gets into contact with CdSe (111), a built-in electric field directed from ZnSe to CdSe will be established which can facilitate the charge carrier transfer that follows the Z-scheme pathway between ZnSe and CdSe. Therefore, the reaction mechanism is established based on the above charge transfer analysis and the band structure presented in Fig. S6d.As shown in Fig. 11, under irradiation the built-in electric field can restrain Moreover, the CO 2 photoreduction performance is highly related to the adsorption and activation of CO 2 , as well as the prompt desorption of the product (here the CO).It is reported that the vacancies in a photocatalyst are in favor of molecule adsorption 606162.Accordingly, DFT theoretical calculations were carried out to investigate the role of V Se in CO 2 and CO adsorption so as to elucidate the enhanced photocatalytic reduction performance of ZnSe/CdSe composites, especially ZnSe/CdSe-3.The model of theoretical calculation is simplified by only using the ZnSe since the V Se is on the ZnSe side in the composite in light of the XPS analysis.The optimized geometry structure and adsorption energy of CO 2 and CO on pristine ZnSe and ZnSe with V Se are presented in Table 1, which are calculated using the total energy given in Table S3.It is noted that pristine ZnSe shows relatively weaker molecule affinity for both CO 2 and CO gases as compared to ZnSe with V Se .Although the CO desorption from pristine ZnSe surface is easy, its CO 2 adsorption capacity is rather low, which is unfavorable for CO 2 reduction, as the retention time of CO 2 on the photocatalyst should be long enough for the reaction to occur.Thus, the V Se in ZnSe/CdSe composites introduced by the cation-exchange reaction can be the factor that favors the CO reduction.This speculation is further supported by the experimental results of CO 2 adsorption isotherms (Fig. 12).The pure ZnSe exhibits a weak CO 2 molecule adsorption capacity.In comparison, all the ZnSe/CdSe composites show boosted CO 2 adsorption capability, with ZnSe/CdSe-3 the highest.Moreover, it is claimed that vacancies are also in favor of charge carrier separation by working as electron-trapping sites 636465.Thus, the influence from V Se on enhanced CO 2 adsorption ability and promoted electron trapping ability, as well as on charge carrier separation, may synergistically contribute to improved CO reduction performance."

    "content": "In summary, the ZnSe/CdSe composites have been developed via epitaxial growth of CdSe on ZnSe through the cation-exchange reaction, which exhibit considerably enhanced photocatalytic performance of CO 2 reduction to CO under visible-light irradiation, as compared to pristine ZnSe.The ZnSe/CdSe prepared using the precursor ratio of Zn: Cd 1:0.125achieves an optimal CO yield (116.9 mol g -1 ), which is 33.4 times that of pristine ZnSe (3.5 mol g -1 ).The results of experiments and DFT calculations can confirm the direct Z-scheme charge transfer between the ZnSe and CdSe, resulting in greatly enhanced effective utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes with high redox ability in the respective reaction.Moreover, the introduction of CdSe can improve the light absorption due to its narrow bandgap and, hence, more photoinduced charge carriers can participate in the CO 2 reduction.In addition, Se vacancy in ZnSe/CdSe generated during the cation-exchange process is in favor of the CO 2 adsorption.All these account for the significantly enhanced performance of photocatalytic CO 2 conversion to CO over ZnSe/CdSe catalysts.Therefore, this work has offered an efficient ZnSe/CdSe system for CO 2 reduction and helps to systematically understand the underlying mechanism via both experimental and theoretical calculation analysis, which is useful for future development of highly efficient photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction. energy is given by Eq. 1, where E SR X (), E SR,PBE X () represent the short-range (SR) part and E LR,PBE X () is the long-range (LR) Fig. 1.(a) SEM image, (b) TEM image and (c) SAED patterns of pristine ZnSe.The inset on the upper right corner of (a) is the corresponding schematic illustration.
