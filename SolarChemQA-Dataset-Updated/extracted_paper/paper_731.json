    "content": "CO2 photoreduction to valuable hydrocarbons is attractive and promising.Nevertheless, the photoactivity is pretty low to date, and deeper insights into improving CO2 conversion efficiency remain a challenge.Here, BiVO4 atomic layers have been synthesized as ideal platforms to investigate the correlation between the electronic structures and activities for CO2 photoreduction.Cobalt (Co) is then deliberately doped in BiVO4 atomic layers to adjust the electronic structures.XPS analysis, CO2 TPD and electrochemical experiments indicate that Co doping makes the electron densities around O anions increase, which could likely facilitate CO2 activation and electrons transferring to CO2 molecules, while photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic oxygen evolution experiments demonstrate that Co doping could also promote water oxidation reactions.Further investigations by Density functional theory calculation reveal that the presence of Co doping results in the generation of new defect levels above the Fermi level, inferring higher hole concentration in favor of water oxidation, and the doped Co 3d orbits located at the top of valence bands might serve as active centers for water oxidation.As a result, Co-doped BiVO4 atomic layers achieve an efficient and stable CH4 production rate of 23.8 molg -1 h -1 under atmospheric CO2 concentration (400 ppm), which is about three times the activity of pristine BiVO4 atomic layers.This work might help to shed light on deeper insights for the design of CO2 photoreduction catalysts."

    "content": "All reagents were of analytical purity and received from Shanghai Chemical Company without further purification.BVO atomic layers were synthesized by a reported lamellar hybrid intermediate strategy. 7Typically, BiCl 3 (0.221 g, 0.7 mmol) was first dissolved in ethylene glycol (30 mL), and CTAB (0.105 g, 0.288 mmol) was subsequently added to form artificial lamellar hybrid precursors.After vigorous stirring for 40 minutes, Na 3 VO 4 12H 2 O (0.28 g, 0.7 mmol) was added to above solution.The system was then maintaining stirring for another three hours.The final product was collected by centrifuging, washed with ethanol and water for three times, respectively, and then freeze-dried for further characterization.As for Co-doped BVO atomic layers, BiCl 3 and Co(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O of different stoichiometric ratios (Co Bi 0.7 mmol, Co 2, 5, 10, 15, 20) were first dissolved in ethylene glycol (30 mL), while the subsequent process was the same as that of BVO atomic layers.The corresponding products were denoted as BVO-2Co, BVO-5Co, BVO-10Co, BVO-15Co, BVO-20Co, respectively The crystallinity of the as-prepared catalyst sample was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Rigaku D/MAX 2250 V diffractometer using monochromatized Cu K ( 0.15418 nm) radiation while the voltage and electric current were held at 40 kV and 100 mA.The morphologies and microstructures characterizations were performed on the transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F, accelerating voltage 200 kV).UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples were obtained on an UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3010).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALAB 250, Thermo Scientific Ltd. with a 320 m diameter spot of monochromated aluminum K X-rays at 1486.6 eV under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions.Raman spectra were recorded on a Horiba LABRAM HR, with a 785 nm excitation laser line.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area was measured by a surface area analyzer (V-sorb 2008P, Gold APP).Carbon dioxide temperature-programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) measurements were performed on a ChemiSorb 2750 instrument.IR spectra presented in this work were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer.Atomic force microscopy (AFM) study was performed as follows: 5 mg sample was uniformly dispersed into 50 mL ethanol under ultrasonication, then the colloidal dispersion was dropped by syringe (10 uL) on the flat surface of Mica sheet and dried naturally for further characterization (NT-MDT, NTEGRA). The experiments of gas-phase CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O on photocatalysts were carried out in a closed pyrex cell (600 mL) with a quartz window, while the whole reaction process was maintained at 60 o C. In order to simplify the system, a cheap ultroviolet lamp (Cnlight, 25 W) with specific wavelength of 254 nm, instead of expensive Xe lamp with fullspectra, is utilized as the light source.Generally, BVO powder (30 mg) was sprinkled on bottom of the pyrex cell.Water (0.5 mL) was sprayed around the catalyst.Prior to the irradiation, the cell was purged with dry nitrogen, followed by injection of CO 2 (0.25 ml, about 400 ppm).The CO and CH 4 products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Tianmei 7900) equipped with a column (TDX-01) and a flame ionization detector (FID), while H 2 and O 2 products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Tianmei 7890 ) equipped with a column (Molecular Sieve 5A) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Cycle experiments of CO 2 photoreduction were conducted as follow: after one cycle of test, the reaction cell was thoroughly purged with dry nitrogen to exhaust all other gas species, followed by injection of CO 2 and H 2 O to repeat experiments. The electrochemical analysis was performed on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China) using Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins a standard three-electrode quartz cell with a working electrode, a platinum slice as the counter electrode, and a standard saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in saturated KCl as the reference electrode.A Xe lamp (CHF-XM500) was used as light source.To make a working electrode, catalyst powders were deposited on a 2 cm 1.5 cm fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate by nafion coating.Briefly, 10 mg of catalyst was suspended in 1 mL of 1wt nafion-ethanol solution and the mixtures were ultrasonically scattered for 15 min.Then, 100 L of above slurry was coated on the FTO glass.After natural evaporation of ethanol, the catalyst coated FTO substrate was used as the working electrode.The flat-band potential (E fb ) was estimated from Mott-Schottky plot by electrochemical method, performed at a fixed frequency of 100 Hz with 5 mV amplitude.The electron transfer number for CO 2 reduction was obtained from electrochemical cyclic voltammetry curves conducted at different potential scan rates (mV/s), while the oxygen evolution activities were characterized by the linear sweep voltammetry curves performed at 20 mV/s.During the measurements, the electrolyte of 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution (pH 6.8) was bubbled with carbon dioxide or argon. The electron transfer number is calculated according to Laviron, 18 where E p is defined by the following equation: E p E 0 (RT/anF) ln(RTk 0 /anF) (RT/anF) lnv.The parameter R is the molar gas constant, and T represents the thermodynamic temperature.F is the Faraday constant, while a is the transfer coefficient (for an irreversible electrode process, a 0.5).E 0 is the formal potential, and k 0 is the standard rate constant of the reaction.The parameter n is the electron transfer number, while v represents the potential scan rate (mV/s). All of the DFT calculations in this work were performed using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) with the ultrasoft pseudopotential, while exchange and correlation effects were described by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation. 19-21Bi 6s 2 6p 3 , V 3s 2 3p 6 3d 3 4s 2 , O 2s 2 2p 4 , Co 3d 7 4s 2 were regarded as valence electrons.The energy cutoff of plane-wave basis set was chosen as 380 eV, and the relaxation run was considered converged when the energy change, the force, and the displacement on each atom was less than 510 -6 eV, 0.01 eV/A, and 510 -4 A, respectively.A half thickness of the as-prepared 1.85 nm BiVO 4 thin layer (containing 6 Bi, 6 V, and 24 O atoms) along 112 direction with 1.0 nm vacuum layer was built to simulate the experiments, and a 341 k-point mesh for Brillouin Zone integration was used."

    "content": "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images for asprepared BVO and Co-doped BVO samples are shown in Figure 1.From the high-resolution TEM image of BVO (Figure 1C), the interplanar spacings of 0.253 nm and 0.226 nm are observed, which agrees well with the (020) and (211) plane of BVO.Moreover, the intersection angle of 63.6 between (020) and (211) plane is identically consistent with the theoretical angle value (63.8) of monoclinic BVO, indicating the BVO phase of synthesized sample.The high-resolution TEM images of Codoped BVO is displayed in Figure 1D, it can be found that the change the crystalline phase of BVO atomic layers.Besides, a slight and regular shift to higher angle for (112) peak is observed with the increasing amount of Co.This is likely due to a smaller ion radius of Co in comparison with Bi, resulting in a decrease of interplanar spacings, which corresponds well with the HRTEM images.Raman spectra were then conducted to provide further structural composition information.As shown in Figure 2, the broad band around 846 cm -1 is attributed to the symmetric V-O stretching vibration mode, while the two sharp bands at 203 cm -1 and 147 cm -1 could be assigned to external lattice vibration modes. 22From the magnified view of the two bands, it can be found that the bands located at 199 cm -1 and 144 cm -1 of BVO reveal a blueshift to 203 cm -1 and 147 cm -1 after the addition of Co, confirming Co atoms are successfully doped in the structure of BVO atomic layers.Moreover, no peaks for the impurities or phase transformations are observed for BVO and Co-doped BVO atomic layers.The optical absorption properties of synthesized samples were uncovered by UV-visible absorption spectra.As shown in Figure 3, the Co-doped BVO atomic layers display a bulged optical absorption band around 580 nm, 23 which could likely be ascribed to the electron transition of doped energy band, deducing the lattice entering of Co element.UV-visible absorption spectrum and the associated Tauc plot (Figure 4A-4B) reveals that the optical band gap for BVO atomic layers is 2.7 eV.To determine the positions of band edge related to redox potentials of CO 2 photoreduction, electrochemical experiment for Mott-Schottky plot was performed to measure the flat-band potential (E fb ) of BVO atomic layers.As shown in Figure 4C, the positive slope of the plot indicates that BVO is a characteristic n-type semiconductor.The E fb of BVO measured from the intercept of the axis with potential value is -0.26V vs NHE (-0.5 V vs SCE) at pH 7. Generally, the position of E fb is strongly related to the bottom of the conduction band (E cb ) and is considered to be about 0.1 V below E cb for many n-type semiconductors. Therefore, the E cb of BVO is supposed to be -0.36V vs NHE, and the corresponding valence band (E vb ) is then calculated to be about 2.34 eV vs NHE according to the band gap (2.7 eV).As can be seen in Figure 4D, the positions of the conduction band edge and the valence band edge sit astride the redox potentials of CO 2 reduction and water oxidation, indicating the feasibility of CO 2 photoreduction for BVO atomic layers. In order to shed light on the compositions and elementary valence states of the samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was then carried out.There were no impurity elements existing in BVO and Co-doped BVO (Figure S5), and the element ratios were revealed by the X-ray fluorescence spectra (Figure S6).As displayed in Figure 5, the high resolution spectra of V 2p presents two strong peaks at 524.4 eV and 516.8 eV for BVO sample, which could be severally assigned to V 2p 1/2 and V 2p 3/2 of V 5 , while the signal of Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 are located at 164.4 eV and 159.2 eV, respectively. 26, 27 The peaks of Co 2p 3/2 around 781 eV can be de-convoluted into two distinct peaks: the main peak at 781.2 eV indicative of cobalt (II) and additional peak at 780.3 eV indicative of cobalt (III). 28,29Apparently, it can be observed that Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Photocatalytic reaction was conducted in a closed pyrex cell to detect the target product of CH 4 molecules.To exclude the possible influence of environmental contamination on photocatalysts and reaction equipment, the samples to be measured were first illuminated in a closed pyrex cell for five hours without injecting water or CO 2 , and no CH 4 product was released, confirming CO 2 was indeed the carbon source (Figure S7).Another control experiment was carried out without either photocatalysts or photoillumination, no products were detected in gas chromatograph, indicating that both the photocatalysts and light irradiation were indispensable for CO 2 photoreduction.BVO samples doped with different amount of Co were then performed under normal condition for five hours' reaction.Corresponding results are summarized in Table 1.It can be seen that CH 4 was the primary product in most cases and BVO-10Co indicating the superior effect of Co doping on BVO.In addition, BVO-10Co sample was implemented for three cycles of repetition test.As displayed in Figure 6B, the yield of CH 4 production just showed a slight decrease after three cycles, deducing the stability of BVO-10Co catalyst. Although the strategy of Co doping indeed improves the activity of CO 2 photoreduction for BVO atomic layers, deep insights for the reason are not clear yet.In view of the almost equal specific surface areas of Co-doped BVO with different stoichiometric ratios (0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20), it is reasonable to obviate the influence factor of superficial area (Figure S9).In order to explore the origins, two basic aspects of CO 2 photoreduction are supposed to be considered: CO 2 activation and water oxidation, which will be discussed in detail in this section.three major desorption peaks, indicating that three kinds of Lewis basic sites with different strengths exist on the surface. The higher the desorption temperature of CO 2 is, the stronger the basic site will be. 35The medium desorption peaks between 200 o C and 400 o C is most likely associated with the lattice oxygen anions, while the peak above 400 o C could be probably due to the strong basic sites of low-coordination oxygen. 35As for Co-doped BVO, it can be found that the chemical desorption peaks have severally moved to higher temperatures compared with that of BVO, implying the basicity of adsorption sites become stronger after Co doping.Of note, Lewis basicity is characterized by the ability of electron giving.The improvement of Lewis basicity could likely be attributed to that Co doping has brought about an increase of electron density around the adsorption sites like oxygen anions, which is in accord with the deductive results of XPS that the electron densities of surface oxygen atoms increase after Co doping, and it is expected that the electron enrichment of adsorption sites could be favourable to activate CO 2 molecules. In addition to CO 2 TPD measurements, electrochemical cyclic voltammetry experiments were further carried out to characterize CO 2 activation.It could be inferred from the control experiment (Figure S10) that the additional peak around -0.78 V belongs to CO 2 reduction peak.As shown in Figure 8, the peak current density improves with the increase of scan rate (v), while the peak voltage (Ep) of CO 2 reduction peak shifts toward more negative locations.The electron transfer number (n) involved in CO 2 reduction could be calculated from the function between Ep and ln v.The value of n for BVO is calculated to be 0.78, indicating a slow kinetic process of CO 2 reduction and poor activation on the surface of BVO.In contrast, the corresponding electron transfer number for Co-doped BVO is counted to be 1.32, which means that more electrons are transferred from active sites of Co-doped BVO to CO 2 molecules compared with BVO, deducing a faster kinetic process and more efficient activation of CO 2 on Co-doped BVO. 37The results above could be possibly ascribed to the enrichment of electron density around active sites after Co doping, conforming to the XPS and CO 2 TPD analysis. Apart from CO 2 activation, water oxidation is another nonnegligible aspect on account of the necessary protons for CH 4 generation. Therefore, the electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution activities of BVO and Co-doped BVO were studied in neutral conditions.shows that the linear sweep voltammetry curve of Co-doped BVO is above the linear sweep voltammetry curve of BVO, and the requisite voltage of Co-doped BVO is approximately 0.09 V smaller than that of BVO when current density reaches 1 mA, demonstrating the good effect of Co doping on BVO.As light is added to the system (Figure 9A), a larger gap of 0.2 V for onset Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins potential of oxygen evolution reaction is observed between BVO and Co-doped BVO, indicating an efficient promotion of water oxidation after Co doping.Moreover, the photocatalytic activities toward oxygen evolution are evaluated in an aqueous solution containing silver nitrate (0.01M) as the electron scavenger.As shown in Figure 9B, Co-doped BVO displays a higher rate of oxygen evolution compared with BVO, illustrating the property of Co doping for boosting water oxidation further. To gain deeper insights into the nature of Co doping, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to elucidate the role of Co doping on the electronic structures.The calculated bad gap of BVO atomic layers is about 2.5 eV (Figure S12a), which is pretty closed to the typical experimental value. Additionally, the energy band structure of Co-doped BVO reveals that the presence of Co doping results in the appearance of new defect levels in band gap (Figure S12b), which might account for the bulged optical absorption band in UV-visible absorption spectra after Co doping.The corresponding density of state (DOS) curves for BVO and Co-doped BVO atomic layers are displayed in Figure 9C and Figure 9D.It can be found that the defect levels are mainly composed of Co orbits, and the density of states of Codoped BVO above the Fermi level are relatively higher than that of BVO, inferring higher hole concentration, which could be in favour of water oxidation.In addition, it is worth noting that the top of valence bands for BVO atomic layers are primarily made up of O 2p orbits (Figure S12c and Figure S13), while the top of valence bands for Co-doped BVO atomic layers are mainly attributed to Co 3d orbits (Figure S12d).This implies that once the electrons were excited from the valence bands of Co-doped BVO, there will be affluent holes left at Co 3d orbits contributing to water oxidation, which possibly means it is the Co atoms in BVO atomic layers that serve as active centres for water oxidation."

    "content": "In summary, BVO atomic layers have been successfully synthesized as an ideal model to investigate the effect of Co doping on CO 2 photoreduction.Co-doped BVO atomic layers have exhibited an efficient and stable activity for CO 2 photoreduction to CH 4 .The optimized CH 4 production rate of 23.8 molg is achieved under atmospheric CO 2 concentration (about 400 ppm), which is about three times the activity of pristine BVO atomic layers.XPS analysis, CO 2 TPD and electrochemical cyclic voltammetry experiments indicate that Co doping makes the electron density around O anion increased, which might facilitate CO 2 activation and electrons transferring to CO 2 molecules.On the other hand, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic OER experiments demonstrate that Co doping could also promote water oxidation reaction.Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the presence of Co doping results in the generation of new defect levels above the Fermi level, inferring higher hole concentration in favour of water oxidation.In addition, the top of valence band for Co doped BVO is mainly constituted by Co 3d orbits, which possibly means that the photo-excited holes located at Co act as active centres for water oxidation.
