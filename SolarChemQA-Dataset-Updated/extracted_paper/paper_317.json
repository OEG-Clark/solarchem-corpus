    "content": "All chemical reagents were of analytical grade.All aqueous solutions were developed with deionized (DI) water (418.2M cm resistivity).Bulk g-C 3 N 4 was fabricated by the thermal polymerization of urea based on our previous reports 25,32.Briefly, 3 g of urea was added in a semiclosed ceramic crucible with a lid to decrease sublimation of urea.The crucible was calcined at 520 1C with the furnace heating rate set at 10 1C min A 1 for 2.5 h.After the crucible was cooled to room temperature, the light yellow product was collected and ground into powder form. In a typical process, 1 g of the as-obtained bulk g-C 3 N 4 was added into 200 mL of HCl aqueous solution (0.5 mol L A 1 ) and ultrasound-treated for 1 h.After that, the exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 in the acid suspension was vigorously stirred for another 4 h at room temperature for its further protonation.The mixture was filtered and repeatedly washed with DI water to remove superfluous HCl until the pH of the filtrate water became neutral.Finally, the pCN product was dried at 70 1C for 12 h and then ground into powder. Synthesis of rGO-modified pCN (rGO/pCN) hybrid photocatalysts GO was synthesized from natural graphite using the modified Hummers' method as reported previously 25,33.The detail of GO synthesis is elucidated in Supporting Information.Firstly, a measured amount of graphite oxide was dispersed in 150 mL of DI water and ultrasonicated for 30 min to fully exfoliate graphite oxide into GO sheets.0.5 g of the as-prepared pCN was then added into the GO suspension and ultrasound-treated for additional 30 min.After that, the mixture was vigorously stirred for 1 h to achieve homogeneous suspension.To reduce GO in the synthesis mixture, a pre-determined amount of NaBH 4 was subsequently added.The resulting mixture was stirred at 80 1C for 3 h, after which the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and washed several times with ethanol and DI water to remove excess NaBH 4 .Finally, the asobtained precipitate was dried at 70 1C in an oven for 12 h.For optimization, rGO/pCN hybrid nanocomposites with various ratios of rGO were also constructed, in which the weight fractions of rGO in the samples were 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt.The resulting samples were denoted as xrGO/ pCN, where x 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20, respectively.For comparison, 15rGO/CN nanocomposite synthesized without the surface charge modification of g-C 3 N 4 was prepared under the similar experimental conditions. Zeta potential measurements were obtained by dynamic light-scattering analysis using the Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments).In brief, 20 mg of the sample was dispersed in 50 mL of DI water by sonication at room temperature.The surface morphology of the as-developed samples was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Hitachi SU8010) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).High resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope (accelerating voltage 200 kV).The TEM sample was prepared by placing a drop of diluted ethanol suspension on a lacey-filmcoated copper grid.Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken over the diffraction angle range (2) 5-45 o using a Bruker D8 Discover X-Ray Diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu K radiation ( 0.154056 nm) at a scan rate of 0.021 s A 1 operated at 40 kV and 40 mA.The molecular structural information was determined from a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Thermo-Nicolet iS10) using a standard KBr pellet method.Each spectrum was recorded as the average of 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm A 1 from 4000 to 400 cm A 1 .The absorbance spectra of the samples were analyzed by a Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 100) equipped with an integrated sphere.The optical properties were measured at ambient temperature in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm.The Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Kratos Axis-Ultra DLD instrument with the Al K X-ray source (15 kV, 200 W) at a pressure of 7.6 A 10 A 9 Torr and a pass energy of 20 eV.The C 1 s peak at 284.6 eV of the surface carbon was used as an internal standard.Peak deconvolution was performed using OriginPro 8.5.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was done on a TA Instrument Q50 from room temperature to 900 1C at a constant heating rate of 10 1C min A 1 under N 2 condition.The specific surface area of the samples was evaluated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) of N 2 sorption at 77 K using the Micrometrics ASAP 2020.The samples were degassed at 180 1C for 4 h prior to the adsorption measurement.The photoluminescence (PL) measurements were recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, LS55) at room temperature.The samples were excited at a wavelength of 370 nm with a scanning speed of 600 nm min A 1 .The widths of excitation slit and emission slit were fixed at 10 nm. The catalytic activities were evaluated by the photoreduction of CO 2 at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure in a continuous, homemade gas flow photoreactor as reported in our previous work 45625,32.A 15 W energy-saving daylight lamp (Philips, TORNADO 15 W WW E27 220-240 V 1CT) was used as a visible light source and its light spectrum was provided in the previous reports 4,6,25.High purity of CO 2 (99.99) was bubbled in the water forming a mixture of CO 2 and water vapor into the reactor.Prior to light irradiation, wet CO 2 at a flow rate of 5 mL/min using a mass flow controller was purged inside the reactor loaded with 100 mg of photocatalysts for 30 min to ensure that the air in the reactor system was totally eliminated and also to achieve complete adsorption of gas molecules.After 30 min of purging, the light was turned on to initiate the photocatalytic reaction.The temperature in the reactor was closely monitored with a thermocouple attached to a digital temperature reader.The average focused intensity of the light was 8.5 mW cm A 2 by measuring with a pyranometer (Kipp and Zonen type CMP 6).The distance between the light source and the reactor was separated by 5 cm.During the reaction process, the product gases were collected every hour and then analyzed by a gas chromatography (GC) (Agilent 7890A) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) to determine the production rate of CH 4 .The entire reactor was enclosed in a black box to avoid any light interference from the surroundings.The photocatalytic experiments were conducted at least two times under the same experimental conditions to confirm the reproducibility of the photoactivity, in which concordant results with substantial small discrepancies (percentage errors of less than 5) were acquired.A detailed schematic diagram of the experimental set-up was depicted in Figure S2.The total evolution of CH 4 after 10 h of reaction was calculated based on Eq. 1.

    "content": "The rGO/pCN hybrid nanocomposites were fabricated via a facile and effective sonication-assisted electrostatic selfassembly strategy, which was pictorially shown in Figure 1.Owing to the presence of abundant -C-Nmotifs in the g-C 3 N 4 framework, g-C 3 N 4 could be protonated by HCl easily.This resulted in the surface charge modification from a negatively charged surface to a positively charged surface.Evidently, the zeta potential value of pCN was measured to be 14.0 mV when dispersed in DI water as compared to that of -15.4 mV for pristine g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 2).On the other hand, GO demonstrated a markedly negatively charged surface (-43.6 mV) (Figure 2) attributed to the plenty of oxygen-containing functional groups such as carboxyl groups (-COO A ).Therefore, it is clear that the spontaneous selfassembly between the positively charged exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 (pCN) and the negatively charged GO was realized by the electrostatic and - stacking interactions to construct the GO/pCN hybrid nanostructures.This was followed by the reduction of GO to rGO using NaBH 4 as a reducing agent to obtain the 2D/2D rGO/pCN nanostructures.Thus, the surface charge modification could be evidenced by the zeta potential measurements (Figures 2 andS3). The microscopic morphologies of the as-prepared samples were examined using TEM and FESEM.As depicted in Figure 3A, pure g-C 3 N 4 displayed a 2D morphology with abundant porous structures of several tens of nanometers (indicated by the white dotted circles) during the thermal polymerization of urea.Upon acid pretreatment of pure g-C 3 N 4 , the exfoliated pCN presented a thin layered structure without obvious bulk domains of g-C 3 N 4 (Figure 3B).This implied that the dispersion process of pCN in water was of high efficiency and remarkable due to the well-matched surface energies of pCN (115 mJ m A 2 ) and water (102 mJ m A 2 ) 34,35.By employing this green liquid exfoliation route, we have further incorporated the 2D structures of pCN with GO.For 15rGO/pCN, exfoliation of pCN successfully coupled with the negatively charged GO via electrostatic attraction, forming a more compact and well-dispersed sheet-on-sheet structure (Figure 3C).Meanwhile, clear lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.325 nm corresponding to the (002) plane of g-C 3 N 4 was observed from the HRTEM image (Figure 3D).Few-layered exfoliated pCN comprised of ca.7-15 layers was observed as labeled in the HRTEM image (Figure 3D).Further observation revealed that the resulting hybrid photocatalysts well-remained the original 2D structure without distinct change in the morphology and simultaneously, establishing a good interfacial contact as shown in the FESEM image (Figure 3E). Insets of Figure 3B and C show the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of pCN and 15rGO/pCN samples.From the inset of Figure 3B, the SAED pattern of pCN exhibited a weak and diffuse ring, which was consistent with several studies 36,37.This was indexed to the characteristic (002) plane of g-C 3 N 4 .On the other hand, for the SAED pattern of 15rGO/pCN sample (inset of Figure 3C), the diffraction ring ascribed to the (002) plane of g-C 3 N 4 was also present similar to that of pCN.Interestingly, a 6-fold symmetry diffraction pattern corresponding to the hexagonal (1100) crystalline plane of rGO structure was observed, matching well with the literatures 38,39. However, the surface morphology of 15rGO/CN synthesized in the similar approach using unmodified g-C 3 N 4 was found to be different in comparison to 15rGO/pCN.For 15rGO/CN, it could be seen from Figure 3F that unmodified g-C 3 N 4 tend to aggregate together due to van der Waals forces between the sheets without anchoring and coupling with rGO firmly.A rational reason for the variation in morphology in the 15rGO/CN sample was due to the mutual electrostatic repulsive force between the negatively charged unmodified g-C 3 N 4 and GO.This significantly inhibited the efficient hybridization of g-C 3 N 4 and rGO leading to insufficient interfacial contact to form the coherent and distinguished heterojunction nanostructures.Therefore, it is evident that the intimate interfacial 2D/2D contact between rGO and pCN in the rGO/pCN system resulted from the surface charge modification, which could be elucidated by zeta potential analysis as mentioned earlier in Section Synthesis approach.This will in turn improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and also increase photocatalytic reaction centers for enhanced catalytic performance.Similar effects of modification of surface charge for hybrid nanocomposites were also reported in recent published studies 30,404142. Figure 4 shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 , 15rGO/CN and a series of rGO/pCN nanocomposites.As seen, no characteristic diffraction peak of GO at 2 9.51 was observed in all the 15rGO/CN and rGO/pCN samples attributed to the exfoliation of regular stacking of GO and reduction of GO to rGO with significantly fewer oxygencontaining functional groups 43.In addition, two typical diffraction peaks of g-C 3 N 4 were still present in the pCN after acid pretreatment process, highlighting that the atomic structures of g-C 3 N 4 were well-maintained.The strong diffraction peak at 27.31 (d 0.325 nm) was ascribed to the interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic systems, corresponding to the (002) diffraction planes 44.On the other hand, the weak diffraction peak at ca. 13.11 (d 0.675 nm) was originated from the in-plane repeated tri-s-triazine units, which can be indexed to the (100) planes (JCPDS 087-1526) 45.When hybridizing pCN with rGO, there was no obvious difference of XRD peaks among all the rGO/pCN samples.More importantly, no diffraction peak of graphene at 2 24.51 was shown due to the low content and fairly low diffraction intensity of rGO 40.Further observation of the XRD patterns confirmed that the basic framework of pCN remained unchanged in spite of being conjugated with rGO, which was adequate to alter the semiconductor properties that will be discussed in the latter part. The structural information of the as-developed g-C 3 N 4 , 15rGO/CN and rGO/pCN samples was confirmed by the FTIR analysis (Figure 5A).FTIR spectrum of GO showed the presence of polar oxygen-containing functionalities at 1062 (C-O-C stretching), 1205 (phenolic C-OH stretching), 1728 (C O stretching vibrations in carbonyl groups) and 3412 cm A 1 (structural O-H groups) 46.Compared with GO, the intensity of most of the oxygenated groups in the rGO/ pCN and 15rGO/CN samples diminished or significantly decreased after the NaBH 4 -reduction route, indicating that most of the oxygen functional groups in GO have been partially reduced.In contrary, the characteristic peaks of pCN were found to be almost identical to the pure g-C 3 N 4 , inferring that the acid pretreatment did not destroy the inplane tri-s-triazine units.All the rGO/pCN and 15rGO/CN samples revealed almost similar characteristic features to the pure g-C 3 N 4 , verifying that the structural integrity of g-C 3 N 4 remained intact after the incorporation with rGO.Several strong absorption bands in the range of 1200-1650 cm A 1 was derived from the skeletal stretching of C-N heterocycles with peaks positioned at 1632, 1570, 1420, 1329 and 1255 cm A 1 , comprising both trigonal (N-(C) 3 ) (full condensation) and bridging C-NH-C units (partial condensation) 47,48.This exemplified the successful development of the extended C-N-C network.The broad peak ranging from 3000 to 3700 cm A 1 was assigned to the N-H and O-H stretches due to the free amino groups and adsorbed hydroxyl species, respectively, whereas the sharp band at ca. 812 cm A 1 was originated from the breathing vibration of tri-s-triazine units 49.Notably, the peak at 812 cm A 1 in the pCN illustrated a slight red shift to a lower wavenumber of ca.807 cm A 1 in the rGO/pCN hybrid (Figure 5B).This suggested that an interaction between rGO and pCN was formed by an electrostatic self-assembly approach, which was consistent with our zeta potential and TEM results. To examine the chemical composition and chemical status of the constituent elements in the pCN and 15rGO/pCN samples, XPS measurements were conducted (Figure 6).Referring to Figure 6A, the XPS survey spectra depicted that the C, N and O elements were detected on the pCN and 15rGO/pCN photocatalysts.By employing a Gaussian curve fitting approach, it was observed that the XPS spectra of C 1s (Figure 6B) was deconvoluted into three peaks appearing at ca. 284.6, 286.0 and 288.1 eV for both samples as well as an additional new peak at 289.3 eV for 15rGO/pCN.The peak at 284.6 eV was assigned to the adventitious carbon or sp 2 C-C bonds of graphitic carbon from the rGO 29.In addition, the peaks at 286.0 and 288.1 eV in the pCN corresponded to C N coordination and sp 2 -hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic rings (N-C N), respectively 16.On the other hand, for 15rGO/pCN sample, the emergence peaks at 285.6 and 289.3 eV were due to the existence of C-OH and OH-C O bonds, respectively, coming from the rGO after undergoing the reduction of GO 50.This result coincided well with the high resolution O 1 s spectrum of the 15rGO/pCN, in which the deconvoluted peaks centered at 531.5 and 533.2 eV corresponded to HO-C O and C-OH, respectively (Figure 6C) 51.A weak O 1s peak at 532.1 eV in the pCN was accredited to the adsorbed H 2 O or CO 2 , which is a common phenomenon found in literatures 52. Additionally, the high resolution N 1s spectra displayed four deconvolution peaks with binding energies of ca.398.6, 399.9, 401.2 and 404.2 eV (Figure 6D), demonstrating four types of N bonding in the samples.The dominant peaks at ca. 398.6 and 399.9 eV were characteristic of the sp 2bonded aromatic N bound to C atoms in the triazine units (C-N C) and the bridging N atoms in N-(C) 3 , respectively 53.Another peak at 401.2 eV was identified as the terminal amino groups (C-N-H) due to incomplete condensation during the thermal polymerization process 36.The weak peak at 404.2 eV was owing to the successful protonation of g-C 3 N 4 , rendering the g-C 3 N 4 heterocycles positively charged, which correlated well with our zeta potential results.In pCN and 15rGO/pCN samples, both C-N C and N-(C) 3 along with N-C N formed the heptazine heterocyclic ring unit, which was the fundamental substructure of g-C 3 N 4 .Based on the percentages of C and N elements estimated from the XPS analysis, it was determined that the atomic ratio of C/N increased from 0.73 (for pCN) to 1.25 (for 15rGO/pCN) as a result of the introduction of rGO.More importantly, the deconvoluted peaks for N 1s in the 15rGO/pCN sample were all shifted to higher binding energies when pCN was incorporated with rGO (Figure 6D).The slight shift in the binding energies inferred that an electronic interaction was formed between these two components, developing a hybrid heterojunction in the 15rGO/pCN, which was consistent with our FTIR results.This observation was in essence similar to the recent studies on the design of g-C 3 N 4 /CdS via electronic interaction 54.On the basis of the above TEM, FTIR and XPS analyses, a strong coupling and hybridization between pCN and rGO in the 2D layered rGO/pCN photocatalysts was evidenced.We can deduce that the driving force for the spontaneous assembly of pCN and rGO was afforded by two features: (1) the electrostatic attraction between the oxygenated groups on the GO and the positively charged g-C 3 N 4 , and (2) the - stacking interaction between the rGO and the conjugated tri-s-triazine units in the pCN. The optical properties of the g-C 3 N 4 , 15rGO/CN and rGO/ pCN photocatalysts were investigated using UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) measurement.As shown in Figure 7A, an absorption edge onset at ca. 440 nm was displayed in pure g-C 3 N 4 , corresponding to the band gap energy of 2.82 eV.Noticeably, there was no pronounced deviation in the optical absorption between pCN and pure g-C 3 N 4 , signifying that the optical properties were wellpreserved, despite protons were simultaneously introduced into g-C 3 N 4 during protonation and sonication processes as evidenced by the zeta potential analysis.With the introduction of rGO, the rGO/pCN nanocomposites exhibited similar absorption edge relative to that of pCN.Similar observations could be found in other graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts as widely reported by researchers 55,56.Instead, the layered rGO in the hybrid nanostructures served as a conducting substrate for the immobilization of pCN via a surface charge promoted self-assembly strategy for the efficient 2D/2D interfacial contact.The band gap energies of the as-fabricated rGO/pCN samples were estimated to be ca.2.8 eV based on the Tauc plot (Figure 7B).This inferred that the intrinsic band gap of the rGO/pCN photocatalysts was originated from the electron transitions from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of pCN.Furthermore, the rGO/pCN samples demonstrated broad background absorption and improved light absorption intensity in the region of visible light ranging from 450 to 800 nm with increasing rGO content in comparison to the pure g-C 3 N 4 and pCN.This was accredited to the existence of rGO in the hybrid nanocomposites, which was in agreement with the color change of the corresponding samples from light yellow to gray (inset of Figure 7A).It is anticipated to improve the photoexcitation efficiency of pCN, thereby contributing to the overall enhancement in the photoactivity to a certain extent.This hypothesis was confirmed by conducting the photoreduction of CO 2 at ambient conditions. The evaluation of photocatalytic performance of the asdeveloped nanocomposites was performed by the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 at ambient conditions using water vapor as a scavenger under a low-power 15 W energy-saving daylight bulb as a visible light source.Control experiments were carried out under four different scenarios (Figure S6) namely (1) in the dark, (2) without photocatalysts, (3) without H 2 O vapor, and (4) under N 2 and H 2 O vapor flow.In all conditions, no considerable CH 4 evolution was detected, implying that light and catalysts were two determining reasons for the successful reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 .This clearly confirmed that the generation of CH 4 product was totally come from the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O under visible light. As depicted in Figure 8A, the rGO hybridization has a substantial effect on the photocatalytic activity of rGO/pCN for the CO 2 reduction.In the absence of rGO, pure g-C 3 N 4 demonstrated a minimal total CH 4 evolution of 2.55 mmol g catalyst A 1 over 10 h of reaction due to the rapid recombination of charge carriers.Meanwhile, pCN exhibited almost similar photocatalytic performance to the pure g-C 3 N 4 with a total CH 4 production of 2.58 mmol g catalyst A 1 (Figure 8B), implying that acid pre-treatment did not significantly destroy the active sites of g-C 3 N 4 and more importantly, protons were incorporated into the g-C 3 N 4 for the surface charge modification.Surprisingly, the photoactivity of 1rGO/pCN sample was increased after the addition of a small amount of rGO.The photoactivity of rGO/pCN samples was further enhanced with higher rGO content from 1 to 15 wt in comparison to pCN.Among all the studied samples, the highest CH 4 production was recorded for the 15rGO/pCN, achieving a maximum production of 13.93 mmol g catalyst A 1 , which manifested a remarkable 5.4-fold enhancement of CH 4 production over pCN.It is known that rGO, which is an excellent co-catalyst for various reduction reactions, would result in the concentration-dependent influences on the g-C 3 N 4 as well as lower the overpotential to inhibit the charge carriers recombination 56.This highlighted that a low rGO content in the rGO/pCN sample did not provide adequate electron storage sites to suppress the recombination of charge carriers leading to a reduced photocatalytic performance.Upon increasing the rGO content from 1 to 15 wt, the intimate contact area and interfacial interaction between rGO and pCN were improved for the effective charge transport and separation from pCN to rGO to react with CO 2 and H 2 O to form CH 4 .This result could be further evidenced by the PL analysis, which will be corroborated later.Thus, the unique features of rGO make it an outstanding substrate for g-C 3 N 4 as well as an excellent electron storage center. There always exists an optimum concentration of rGO content to attain the highest photocatalytic activity, which is in principle similar to any types of dopants such as metal, metal oxide and non-metal 11,57,58.In our present study, when the rGO content was higher than 15 wt, a further increase in the rGO content (20 wt) resulted in a deterioration in the total CH 4 evolution (11.70 mmol g catalyst A 1 ) although the optical absorption was improved.This clearly exemplified that too high rGO content in the hybrid system was not beneficial to the CO 2 reduction process.This was due to the fact that an excess of rGO significantly occupied the active sites on pCN, shielding them from the efficient utilization of visible light.This caused a drastic reduction in the number of photogenerated electrons from pCN to rGO.Similar observations have been reported in our previous work 4,25,33, elucidating that a suitable rGO content is of utmost importance for the synergistic effect between pCN and rGO in the rGO/pCN hybrid nanoarchitectures for enhanced photocatalytic activity. For comparison with 15rGO/pCN, the photoactivity of 15rGO/CN sample prepared without the surface charge modification of g-C 3 N 4 for the CO 2 reduction was also determined under similar experimental conditions (Figure 8B andC).As expected, the total CH 4 production of 15rGO/CN (8.29 mmol g catalyst A 1 ) was lower than that of 15rGO/pCN photocatalysts (13.93 mmol g catalyst A 1 ) despite demonstrating almost similar optical properties (Figure 7).The eminently enhanced visible-light photocatalytic performance of 15rGO/pCN hybrid nanostructures was mainly accredited to the intimate interfacial contact of rGO and pCN as evidenced by the TEM and FESEM images in the earlier section.In addition, the well-contacted heterointerface of 15rGO/pCN possessed a larger BET surface area (33.44 m 2 g A 1 ) than those of the 15rGO/CN (27.66 m 2 g A 1 ) and pCN samples (22.30m 2 g A 1 ) (Figure S7).This clearly implied that a relatively large surface area of the 15rGO/ pCN was essential for providing more active sites for the photocatalytic reaction leading to an enhanced CH 4 production.This photocatalytic result could also be further supported by the PL analysis, which will be discussed later. The photochemical quantum yield of CO 2 reduction to CH 4 was determined based on Eq. ( 2) as discussed in our earlier study 4. Since the band gap energy of the 15rGO/pCN was estimated to be ca.2.8 eV (Figure 7), photons with 4444 nm could not generate unbound and free electron-hole pairs.Thus, the incident light intensity in the effective range of visible light on the photocatalyst surface was measured to be 1.13 mW cm A 2 .Using the approach employed by Wang et al. 59, the average photon energy was 4.71 A 10 A 19 J. Based on the photocatalytic results under a low-power 15 W daylight bulb, the photochemical quantum yield for the production of CH 4 in 15rGO/pCN was found to be 0.560, which was generally higher than some of the previously reported data that utilized high power Xenon arc lamp 52,60,61, rendering our process more practically feasible. To investigate the stability of the photocatalysts, cyclic performance toward the reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 through consecutive three test cycles was carried out over the 15rGO/pCN as a representative nanocomposite.As depicted in Figure 9, the 15rGO/pCN sample maintained its high photoactivity for the CO 2 reduction after three cycles under identical experimental conditions.Evidently, there was no significant change in the CH 4 production after several cycles under visible light illumination, demonstrating that the developed photocatalyst was stable with the prolonged reaction duration.Based on the XRD and FTIR analyses, no substantial changes in the phase and chemical structure of the 15rGO/pCN sample were observed after three successive cycles (Figure S9), confirming high durability of the photocatalyst. In order to examine the influence of the rGO modification and interfacial contact between pCN and rGO on the photocatalytic reaction mechanism, PL was employed to reveal the efficiency of charge carrier transfer, trapping and separation.Based on Figure 10A, the PL intensity was found to follow the sequence: pCN41rGO/pCN45rGO/ pCN410rGO/pCN420rGO/pCN415rGO/pCN.The order in the degree of PL quenching was in accordance with the photocatalytic results of rGO/pCN samples.Compared with pCN and other rGO/pCN samples, a drastic diminished PL intensity was observed for the 15rGO/pCN photocatalyst, implying that the 15rGO/pCN has the most efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the hybrid heterojunction.This phenomenon was originated from the effective electron shuttling from pCN to rGO at the optimal ratio, which retarded the direct recombination of holes and electrons.Furthermore, as displayed in Figure 10B, the 15rGO/pCN exhibited a considerable PL quenching relative to that of the 15rGO/CN nanocomposites.This was vividly ascribed to the sufficient interfacial interaction in the 15rGO/pCN nanocomposites via electrostatic attractive forces, which confirmed well with the aforementioned TEM, FESEM and photocatalytic trends.Therefore, a strong interfacial coupling between rGO and pCN with surface charge modification is indispensable to remarkably increase the face-to-face contact area for effective charge transfer across the 2D/2D layered heterojunction to inhibit the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs. On the basis of the above discussion, a visible-light photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 mechanism over the rGO/pCN sample was delineated in Figure 11.Upon visible light irradiation, the photo-excitation of electrons took place from the VB by N 2p to the CB formed by C 2p orbitals of pCN, leaving holes in the VB.With the incorporation of rGO as a 2D conducting material, both pCN and rGO were electrostatically combined together and formed effective interface.The photogenerated electrons from pCN were then migrated to the rGO framework via a percolation mechanism owing to its remarkable electron conductivity and high electron storage capacity 4.The VB maximum energy level of pCN was measured by the VB XPS 25,62,63.As exemplified in Figure S10, the VB edge of pCN was positioned at 1.40 eV, which was concordant with our previous results for pure g-C 3 N 4 25.Meanwhile, the CB minimum of pCN was found to be -1.42 eV.The successful electron transfer was attributed to the lower Fermi level of rGO (-0.08 eV vs. NHE) 46,64 relative to the CB of pCN (-1.42 eV vs. NHE) through the heterojunction formed at the rGO/pCN interface to hinder the charge recombination.Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes on the VB of pCN reacted with H 2 O molecules to produce hydroxyl radicals (OH) followed by the formation of protons (H ).The protons interacted with the photoexcited electrons on the hybrid nanocomposites to generate H radicals.Seeing that CO 2 molecules possess delocalized -conjugated binding II 3 , this resulted in the adsorption of CO 2 onto the rGO sheets via - conjugation interaction leading to activation and destabilization of CO 2 molecules 65.Owing to that, this led to the formation of superoxide (CO 2 A ) radicals via the reaction between activated CO 2 and electrons.Therefore, due to the - interactions, the number of activated CO 2 molecules and CO 2 A radicals increased.It is widely known that one photon results in the transfer of only one electron in a reaction, but reduction of CO 2 involves an 8-electron process to form CH 4 18.The enriched electron density on the rGO sheets favored the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 through a series of radical reactions between CO 2 A and H.As a result, the high photocatalytic performance of rGO/pCN hybrid nanoarchitectures was achieved on account of the modification of rGO by a simple surface charge interaction.The main reaction steps for the photoactivity were summarized by Eqs.(3)(4)(5).Overall, it can be concluded that surface charge modification plays a prominent role in engineering rGO/pCN photocatalysts with intimate interfacial contact through an electrostatic selfassembly approach.The synergistic effect between pCN and rGO not only significantly enhanced the 2D/2D layered heterointerface region, but also promoted the separation of electron-hole pairs, thereby leading to improved photocatalytic activity."

    "content": "In summary, metal-free rGO/pCN photocatalyst was successfully developed by a sonication-assisted and electrostatic self-assembly approach via a facile surface charge modification on the g-C 3 N 4 followed by a NaBH 4 -reduction process. The protonation pretreatment resulted in the positively charged g-C 3 N 4 , which was beneficial for improved interaction with negatively charged GO sheets.The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 under a low-power energy-saving daylight lamp was considerably enhanced after the hybridization of rGO with pCN.For comparison, rGO/CN synthesized without any modification of surface charge of g-C 3 N 4 has also been prepared.The results indicated that the 15rGO/pCN produced remarkable 5.4-and 1.7-folds enhancement of CH 4 evolution over pCN and 15rGO/CN nanocomposites, respectively.The enhanced photocatalytic activity of 15rGO/pCN was attributed to the addition of rGO with pCN in a controlled manner and adequate intimate contact between rGO and pCN for effective charge transfer across the 2D/2D rGO/pCN layered heterojunction to retard the recombination of electron-hole pairs as supported by TEM, HRTEM, XPS and PL studies.Furthermore, the asprepared 15rGO/pCN photocatalyst demonstrated a high stability even after three test cycles under visible light irradiation without significant change in the CH 4 production.As a whole, our results highlight the significance of wellcontacted heterojunction interface between semiconductor and rGO, which could be engineered by a facile surface charge mediated self-assembly route.It is expected that our current work provides a new doorway on the fabrication of 2D/2D layered heterojunction with efficient charge separation.We hope that the simple charge modification strategy herein could be extended to the development of other rGO-based semiconductor photocatalysts and various multicomponent nanocomposites toward diverse photoredox processes for environmental remediation and energy conversion to combat the ever-increasing environmental alarms and fossil fuel depletion crisis.
