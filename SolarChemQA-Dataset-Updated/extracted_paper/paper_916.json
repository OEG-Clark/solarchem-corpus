    "content": "In the paper, two kinds of Cu2O-decorated CuO microspheres composed with nanoflakes were prepared by using two different methods.Their electron behaviors were studied from the XPS spectra and photoelectrochemical measurements.Both samples are p-type CuO covered with an amount of Cu2O nanoparticles on their surface.Combined with their bandgaps and flat band potentials, CuO-Mic has a well-matched bandgap alignment between Cu2O and CuO, which is favorable for the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Those photogenerated carriers are beneficial for the conversion of CO2 to CH4, as an 8-electron process for the conversion of CO2 to CH4 will consume more photogenerated electrons for the chemical reactions than that of the 2-electron process for CO2 reduction to CO.Therefore, CuO-Mic has much better photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to CH4 with a CH4 yield ten times higher than that of CuO-Hyd under a visible light irradiation, the CO yields of the CO2 reduction are identical."

    "content": "CuO microspheres were prepared by two different methods, the standard one-step hydrothermal procedure (CuO-Hyd) and microwave process (CuO-Mic) respectively.All chemicals used in this study had analytical-grade purity.In detail, 1.165 g Cu(NO3)23H2O was dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water under constant magnetic stirring for approximately 10 min.After that, 2 mL of ammonium hydroxide (25 wt ) was added dropwise to the green aqueous solution.On the one hand, the solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, it retained sealed at 90 C for 3 h.When CuO samples were grown in a reaction tank at 90 C for 2.5 h by microwave approach, following above procedure, the obtained black precipitates (CuO-Hyd and CuO-Mic) were separated by centrifugation, washed 3 times with water and ethanol, and dried in air at approximately 60 C for 8 h respectively. The morphologies of the obtained products were checked by a Hitachi S4800 filed-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM).Crystal phases were analyzed by a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, MiniFlex 600, Rigaku) with mono-chromatized Cu K radiation.High-A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN) was obtained at the accelerating voltage of 300 kV.Raman measurements were conducted at room temperature using a Renishaw in Via Reflex Raman spectrometer with 532 nm lines.A 532 nm laser caused an incident power at the prepared nanomaterials of 3 mW, which used output power of 20 mW and objective lens magnified 50 times.Light absorption measurements were carried out using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-vis, Cary-5000, Varian) with an integrating sphere.In addition, the chemical states of Sn and O elements were analyzed by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB250Xi) which was equipped with a standard monochromatic Al-K source (h1486.6eV). CO2 reduction.The photocatalyst CuO was firstly placed in the photocatalytic evaluation unit with the volume of the reaction system about 230 ml.Then 0.1g samples were evenly spread in an acetabuliform reactor of glass with an area of 4.2 cm 2 .In the photocatalytic evaluation unit, the xenon lamp of 300 W was used as the light source.Before the high-purity CO2 gas injection into glass, waters should be added to the photocatalytic evaluation device and the device must be kept vacuum.After dark adsorption for 12 hours, the photocatalytic reaction was carried out under light conditions.The gas in the photocatalytic evaluation device was extracted for detection for every hour, until the gas production became balanced which indicated the catalytic process was completed.The measurements were carried out in Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Nano Technology, Nanjing University.The setup can be found in Figure S5 of Ref. 23 XRD measurements of the prepared samples were carried out to describe the structures, as displayed in Figure 1a).The XRD patterns show that the crystalline structures of both samples can well match toCuO(JCPDS No. 48-1548).Raman spectra were carried out to determine the constituents of the preparedsamples, as shown in Figure 1b).It shows that there are three obvious peaks at 287, 338 and 620 cm -1 .The Raman spectra of pure CuO nanorods with three peaks at 297, 346 and 633 cm -1 were regarded as the Ag, B1g, and B2g characteristic modes of CuO with monoclinic crystal symmetry 24,25 .As reported by Chen et al., Raman phonon modes will red-shift with increasing surface areas. 26The temperature also led to the mode's redshift. 27In Ref. 28, Raman mode with about 30cm -1 red-shift was observed."

    "content": "Therefore, the modes at 287, 338 and 620 cm -1 can be ascribed to the Ag, B1g, and B2g modes of CuO, respectively.XPS measurements were used to determine the chemical constituents, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3a is the XPS spectra of Cu core level regions, where the peak at 933 eV is for Cu 2p3/2, and 954 eV for Cu 2p1/2.Both 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 can be deconvolved with two peaks, as shown in Figure 3b-e).Figure 3b) and 3c) exhibits the deconvolved Cu 2p3/2 peaks, where the lower energy is located at 932.6 eV and higher one at 934.2 eV. Figure 3d) and 3e) displays the deconvolved Cu 2p1/2 peaks, one is located at 952.3 eV, the other at 953.3 eV.The peaks at 932.6 eV and 952.2 eV correspond to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Cu , while the peaks at 934.6 eV and 953.3 eV are assigned to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Cu 2 . 29 , 30 , 31 , 32The peak at 953.3eV accompanied by its shakeup satellite peaks at 942 and 962 eV indicates the existence of Cu 2 2p. 33,34 nd the fitted peaks of Cu 2p3/2, and the 2p3/2 integrated ratios of Cu to Cu 2 are shown in Table 1.From the table, we found that the contents of Cu to Cu 2 on the surface are identical for the two samples.Furthermore, Cu LMM Auger spectra were also presented in Figure 3f) to study the CuxO.The binding energies of the main Auger peak located at 568.3 and 571.8 eV correspond to Cu and Cu 2 formal oxidation states, respectively 35,36,37 .The above results reveal that there are an amount of Cu2O contents on the surface of the prepared samples.There are two obvious peaks in O 1s spectra, as shown inFigure 4a.The main component located at 529.0 eV is attributed to oxygen in the CuO lattice, while the shoulder peak at 530.3 eV was regarded as the oxygen in the Cu2O lattice. 38The fitted peaks and their integrated intensities are displayed the Table 1.From the table, we can find that the component from the oxygen in the Cu2O lattice is higher in sample CuO-Mic .UV-vis-NIR absorption measurements were carried out to explore the difference in the absorption for the microspheres in the range of 2001200 nm, as shown in Figure 4b).From the Figure, we find that there is a strong absorption from 200 to 800 nm for two samples, where sample CuO-Mic has a slightly stronger absorption than CuO-Hyd.The band gap Eg was calculated from (h) 2 A(h -Eg), where A is a constant, h is an incident light energy. The band gap is obtained as 1.34 and 1.37 eV for CuO-Hyd and CuO-Mic, respectively, as shown in the inset of Figure 4b).The obtained band gap is larger than 1.31 eV 39 and smaller A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t than 1.44 eV. 40e valence bands of CuO-Hyd and CuO-Mic were also determined by the Mott-Schottky method, as demonstrated in Figure 5 a) and b).The negative slopes suggest that both samples are p-type semiconductors.From the Mott-Schottky plots, it is observed that the flat band potential of CuO-Hyd is 1.5 V vs Ag/AgCl (i.e.1.7 V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) and CuO-Mic is 1.18 V vs Ag/AgCl (i.e., 1.38 V vs NHE), respectively.The obtained flat band potentials are more positive than the reported values 41 , but approximate to 0.92 V vs Ag/AgCl for p-n Cu2O homojunction film 42 and 0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl of Cu2O here e0, and 0are the electron charge with a value of 1.610 19 C, dielectric constant with a value of 18.1, and permittivity of vacuum with a value of 8.8510 -12 F.m -1 , respectively.A, V andCsc are the area of thefilm electrode, the bias applied on the electrode and surface capacitance, respectively.Thus, NAvalues of CuO-Hyd and CuO-Mic electrodes are estimated to be 2.6610 21 and 9.910 20 cm -3 , the values are in consistent with the reported by Septina et al. 45 A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t The electrochemical specific surface was investigated from the difference in current density variation plotted against scan rate, as shown in Figure 5c).The linear slope is equivalent to twice of the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), the bigger slope the larger electrochemical specific surface area will be.The Figure shows that CuO-Mic has a slightly larger electrochemical specific surface area, which will be beneficial to the photocatalytic activity.Furthermore, the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm indicates that the specific surface area of sample Mic is equal to5.52 m 2 g -1 , slightly larger than that of sample Hyd (5.13 m 2 g -1 ), as shown in Figure 6. The measurement of the self-powered PEC-type detector was carried out using a continuous visible-light pulse with an on-off interval of 10 s (or 20 s) at different intensities under a Xe lamp with a wavelength of 56460 nm, as shown in Figures 5d).reduction to CH4.The CH4 yield of CuO-Mic is ten times of that of CuO-Hyd, while the CO production yields are approximately identical.This value is comparable to the 0.14 mol CH4/g for the gas reduction under UV lamp irradiation, 14 but smaller than the reported CH4 yields under UV irradiation. 17The quantum efficiency of CH4 and CO from the different CO2 reductions was used to judge the photocatalytic performance.Using the same method in Ref. 46, we obtained a quantum efficiency of CH4 and CO as 1.3 and 0.11 for sample Mic-CuO, as shown in Table 2. Our result is much better than that of C coated Cu2O nanorod-like 46 and Cl-doped Cu2O nanorods 48 , especially the quantum efficiency of the reduction of CO2 to CH4 is almost two times higher.But the quantum efficiency of CO is lower than that of Cu2O/WO3 nanosheets. 47Cu2O is regarded as a p-type, as there is no V-shape in the M-S curve.The band gap structure of Cu2O is referred to Ref. 49, where the minimal conduction band and maximal valence band are equal to -1.5 and 0.5 V vs NHE, respectively.Then the energy band gap alignment can be constructed, which is a type-II heterostructure, as shown in Scheme 1 a) and b).As the conduction band potential of Cu2O (-1.5 V vs NHE) is more negative than CO2 reduction potentials to CO (-0.92 V vs NHE) and CH4 (-0.24 V vs NHE), the reduction of CO2 to CH4 and CO occurs under a visible light illumination.From Scheme 1, the photogerated electrons take part in reducing CO2 to CH4 and CO, and the photogenerated holes make water hydrolyze to O2 (H2O 2h 1/2O2 2H ).As a p-type semiconductor, the photogerated holes from CuO will transfer to the valence band of Cu2O, then the electron-hole pairs in Cu2O can be separated effectively. As the yields of CH4 and CO depend on the following reactions 50,51 , CO2 2H 2e - CO H2O, E 0 -0.53V at pH7.0, CO2 8H 8e - CH4 2H2O, E0-0.24V at pH7.0, (4) From Eq. ( 3), CO production is a 2-electron process, either for H2.As the conversion of CO2 A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t to CH4 is an 8-electron process (Eq.( 4)), meaning that each individual process will consume more photogenerated electrons.From the bandgap alignments (Scheme 1a), the conduction band of CuO-Hyd is more positive, close to the valence conduction of Cu2O.Therefore, the efficiency of the e-p pair separation is not high, as more photogenerated electron-hole pairs from CuO-Hyd will quickly recombine.Contrary to CuO-Hyd, CuO-Mic has a more negative conduction band position, more photogenerated holes from the valence band of CuO-Mic will transfer to the valence band of Cu2O, hence, photogenerated electron-hole pairs can be separated effectively to ensurethe chemical reactions in progress (Eq.( 4)).Therefore, CuO-Mic has much better photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to CH4.

    "content": "The Cu2O-decorated CuO Microspheres were prepared and used to reduce CO2 to CO or to CH4.As discussed above, the existence of Cu2O is very important for the reduction of CO2 to CO or to CH4, since the photogenerated electrons have more negative potential than the reduction potential of CO2 to CO or to CH4, which guarantees the occurrence of the reduction of CO2.Because of the type-II heterostructure Cu2O/CuO, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs can be effectively separated under a visible light.Sample CuO-Mic has a good energy band alignment and higher donor carrier density, it has much better photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to CH4.The results will be helpful for understanding the reduction process of Figure 1: (a) XRD patterns of samples CuO-Hyd and CuO-Mic; (b) Ramanspectrum with excitation at 532 nm; SEM images of (c) CuO-Hyd and (d) CuO-Mic. Figure 1c) and 1d) is the SEM images of CuO-Hyd and CuO-Mic, respectively.The Figure shows that both samples are composed with microspheres, where microspheres are self-assembled with nanoflakes.While the nanoflakes in CuO-Hyd are more thicker and denser than that in CuO-Mic, meaning that sample CuO-Mic may have a larger specific surface area than CuO-Hyd.

Figure 7 CO2 reduction to CO and CH4 using (a) CuO-Hyd and (b) CuO-Mic catalysts.Photoreduction of CO2 with H2O on the CuO composites was conducted in a continuous flow reactor at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure as discussed above.With the 300 W xenon lamp as an irradiation light source, CO2 reduction in H2O solution was measured with two CuO-Hyd and CuO-Mic catalysts, as shown in Figure 7a) and 7b).From the gases (CO and CH4) evolution with time, CuO-Mic has much better photocatalytic activity for CO2 n u s c r i p t A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t The fitted peaks of Cu 2p3/2and O 1s for two samples 44.As the valence band energy (EVB) is close to the flat band potential for p-type semiconductors,the EVB of CuO-Hyd and CuO-Mic can be determined as 1.38 and 1.7 V (vs NHE), respectively.According to their band gap values, the conduction band energy (ECB) of CuO-Hyd and CuO-Mic can be calculated to be 0.1 and 0.36 V (vs NHE), respectively.The ECB position of CuO is more negative than the reported by Li et al., where the ECB and EVB for hierarchical CuO are 0.71 and 1.92 V vs NHE, respectively.44And th hole carrier density NA can be calculated from Comparison of the quantum efficiency of CH4 and CO between different cupric oxideAs discussed above, both XPS spectra of Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 and Cu LMM spectra reveal that there are an amount of Cu (Cu2O) nanoparticles on the surface of CuO nanoflakes.Therefore, heterogenous Cu2O/CuO structures are formed on the surface of the prepared samples.Here This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFB0403101), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 61604127, 61474096), and Jiangsu Province College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship training program (201911117073Y).Many thanks for Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Nano Technology, National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, Nanjing University to their support for doing the CO2 reduction experiments."
