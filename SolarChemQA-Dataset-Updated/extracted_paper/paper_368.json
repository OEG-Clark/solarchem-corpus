    "content": "Tix SiMCM-41 is a mesoporous photocatalyst with a tetragonal framework and high structural regularity.In this study, Ca was introduced to the Ti x SiMCM-41 surfaces to improve CO 2 absorption.The catalytic performance of mesoporous Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41 was superior to that of the reported Ca/Ti x SiO 2 nano-sized composite catalyst.The photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 improved remarkably over the Ca(10.0wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 catalyst, producing 82.0 mol g -1 cat L -1 after an 8 h reaction.A model for the enhanced photoactivity over Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41 was suggested, and the results were attributed to the effective charge separation and inhibited recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs over Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41."

    "content": "The hydrothermal method for MCM-41 synthesis has been reported in many papers 262728, and was also considered in this study.Cetylmethylammonium bromide (CTABr, Aldrich co.) as a template was dropped slowly into a mixed solvent of water and ethanol to produce the mesopores.NH 4 OH and TEOS (tetraethylorthosilicate, Aldrich co.) were dropped step by step into the solution.The composition of the final sol solution was 6.0SiO 2 :1.0CTABr:0.15(NH4 ) 2 O:350H 2 O.The pH was fixed to 11.The final solution was stirred until it was homogeneous, and crystallization was performed at 100 C for 24 h in an autoclave.After synthesis, the resulting powder was washed, filtered and then calcined at 550 C for 5 h in air (named SiMCM-41).On the other hand, titanium ions (TTIP, Titanium tetraisopropoxide, Junsei Co.) substituted for silicon sites in the mesoporous framework, and the Si:Ti molar ratios were 0, 15, 35, and 50 (named Ti x SiMCM-41).Ca doping was conducted in the final step using an impregnation method.CaO (CaCl 2 , Aldrich Co.) at 1.0, 5.0 (standard sample), 10.0, and 15.0 wt. were added to 25.0 mL of an ethanol solution containing the Ti x SiMCM-41 powders.The slurries were stirred at 40 C for 3 h, evaporated at 80 C for 3 h, and dried at 50 C for 24 h in an oven.The final samples were treated thermally at 500 C for 2 h in air (named Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41). The synthesized Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 (x 0, 15, 35, and 50) powders were examined by XRD (MPD, PANalytical) using nickel-filtered CuK radiation (30 kV, 30 mA).The morphology of the particles were studied by TEM (JEOL 2000EX) and the atomic compositions of the film was measured by energy dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDAX, EX-250, Horiba) operated at 120 kV.XPS (Axis-Nova, Kratos Inc.) of Ti 2p, Ca 2p, Si 2p, and O1s in the samples was performed using a non-monochromatic AlK (1486.6 eV) X-ray source.The reflectance UV-vis spectra were obtained using a Cary 500 spectrometer with a reflectance sphere in the range, 200-800 nm.The recombination tendency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs (e -/h ) was estimated by PL (Perkin Elmer) using a He-Cd laser source at a wavelength of 325 nm.The BET surface areas of the catalysts were measured using a Belsorp II instrument.All the catalysts were degassed under vacuum at 150 C for 30 min before measuring the BET surface area, and were measured by nitrogen gas adsorption using a continuous flow method with a mixture of nitrogen and helium as the carrier gas.A tube was filled with 0.2 g of the samples under a N 2 atmosphere and then out-gassed for 2 h at 150 C before the measurements.After a pre-treatment, the samples were exposed to liquid nitrogen for 2 h.Finally, the samples were heated to 350 C at a programmed heating rate of 10 C min -1 .In the -plot method, the adsorption volume (V ads , p/p 0 ), which was normalized to V ads for the reference material, and (p/p 0 ), which is used as a new x-axis to plot the adsorption isotherms for the samples of interest, were employed.Photocurrent densities were measured with an electrochemical station (Com-pactStat, IVIUM STAT tech.) using three-electrode mode in 1.0 M NaOH aqueous solution, and an AM 1.5 Solar simulator (ABE tech.) as the light sources.Platinum wire and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.10 mg of sample was dispersed to the 1.0 mL of ethanol to form a homogeneous turbid liquid.The turbid liquid was deposited on FTO conductive glass with an area of 0.4 cm 2 to form the working electrode.The adsorption ability of the catalysts for CO 2 gas was measured from the CO 2 -TPD (temperature programmed desorption) experiments in the same manner using BELCAT (Bel Japan Inc., Japan).Each catalyst (0.05 g) was charged in the quartz reactor of the TPD apparatus.The catalysts were pretreated at 300 C for 1 h under a He flow (30 mL min -1 ) to remove the physically absorbed water and impurities.CO 2 (5 vol.CO 2 /He) gas was injected into the reactor for 1 h at a rate of 50 mL min -1 at 50 C. The physically absorbed CO 2 gases were removed by evacuating the catalyst samples at 50 C for 30 min.The furnace temperature was then increased from 50 to 900 C at a rate of 10 C min -1 under He flow.The desorbed CO 2 gases were detected using a TCD detector. Fig. 1 presents a schematic diagram of the batch type photoreactor designed in the laboratory.The reactor consisted of a rectangular quartz cell with a total volume of 15.0 mL.The photocatalytic activity was examined using 0.20 g of powdered Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41 catalyst distributed uniformly at the bottom of the reaction chamber.A 1.0 mm thick quartz glass window cover was placed on the top of the reactor to enable the effective transfer of irradiation from a 6.0-W cm -2 mercury lamp with a 365 nm wavelength.The reactor chamber and lamp were covered with aluminum foil to ensure that all the irradiation that participated in the reaction had passed through the quartz window only.The reactor, which had been checked for leakage at atmospheric pressure for several hours, was purged with helium carrier gas.The CO 2 concentration was controlled using helium (99.99) as the diluent gas.The reaction temperature and pressure were maintained at 303 K and 1.0 atm.Before starting the experiment, the reactor was purged for 1 h with a mixture of CO 2 and helium.The CO 2 :H 2 O ratio introduced was fixed to 1:2.During the photocatalysis process, the product mixture was sampled off-line using a gas tight syringe (Agilent, 250 m) with the same volume, and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, iGC7200, Donam Co., Korea) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame-ionized detector (FID).First, the gaseous products produced by the in-situ system were flowed into the TCD detector, which was connected to a Carboxen 1000 (Young Lin Instrumentals Co., Korea) column, to analyze the light gases (H 2 , O 2 , and CO), and the extracted gases were then inserted into the FID detector to separate the C 1 (methane)-C 3 light hydrocarbons, and oxygenated compounds, such as methanol, acetaldehyde and formic acid.The selectivity of the product was calculated using the following equation: C i () C i moles in product/total moles of C produced 100."

    "content": "3.1.Physical properties of the synthesized Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 powders Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows XRD patterns of the prepared Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 (x 0, 15, 35, and 50) powders.In Fig. 1(a), a shape reflection peak corresponding to the (100) plane was observed at a low angle (2-2.5 2) in all Ca non-loaded Ti x SiMCM-41 (x 0, 15, 35, and 50) samples, highlighting the typical hexagonal SiMCM-41 structure 29.On the other hand, this peak was absent in the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 50 Si 50 MCM-41 sample after Caloading.Fortunately, the sign of a very small peak remained until 35 mol.Ti-insertion in the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 sample.This was attributed to the larger mesopores due to the insertion of many larger sized titanium ions than silicon ions into the SiMCM-41 framework.Eventually, the loaded calcium ions penetrated further into the pores, which led to pore clogging.In addition to the main reflection peak, three reflection peaks, which were indexed to the (1 1 0), (2 0 0) and (2 1 0) planes, were clearly visible at 3-7 2A in the XRD patterns of the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 15 Si 85 MCM-41 sample.The presence of well-defined and intense XRD peaks indicates the excellent degree of ordering of the mesoporous molecular sieves.In addition, slight decreases in inter planar spacing d 1 0 0 with increasing Ti content were observed.This could be related to the probable incorporation of Ti atoms into the silica framework.Because the ionic radius of Ti 4 (0.068 nm) is larger than that of Si 4 (0.041 nm), the substitution of Si 4 with Ti 4 should invariably distort the geometry around Ti from an ideal tetrahedral coordination.No peaks assignable to CaO were observed in the high-angle region (figure not shown).Therefore, the metal ions are either dispersed atomically in the framework of TiSiMCM-41 or achieve amorphous form outside the framework.On the other hand, in wide angle range of Fig. 1(b), the anatase TiO 2 tetragonal structured peaks were clearly observed in the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 15 Si 85 MCM-41 sample.In the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 50 Si 50 MCM-41 sample, however, the peaks disappeared and new some small peaks assigned to the perovskite cubic CaTiO 3 structure 30 were observed.These results suggest that the loaded Ca ions exist in close proximity to the Ti ions.The hexagonal array of the mesoporous materials could be observed clearly with an electronic beam passing through both the parallel and vertical directions of the axis of channels, which further indicates the order of the hexagonal structure 31.When a small amount of Ti ions was introduced, the ordered structure was disturbed slightly, but some uniform pore collapse was observed with increasing Ti content.This confirms that incorporating Ti ions interrupts the Si O framework and weakens its integrity.Generally, when the Si/Ti ratio decreases, the regular arrays are no longer observable.These observations are in good agreement with XRD.On the other hand, the loaded CaO particles were observed as dark spots on the surface of the mesoporous TiSiMCM-41 depending on the Ti level.This might due to the decreases in inter-planar spacing, d 1 0 0 , with increasing Ti content, resulting in CaO ingredients only partially penetrating into the meso-pores.EDAX confirmed the presence of metals on the surface of the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 particles, as illustrated in Fig. 4 and Table 1.EDAX revealed the presence of O, Si, Ca, and Ti, showing that the other components in the precursors were not present in any of the samples.Table 1 lists the atomic compositions on the surface of all the samples determined by EDAX.The Ti/Si and Ca/Ti atomic molar ratios in the samples did not appear to be quantitative.EDAX is a very good surface analytical method, but it is prone to error, because the composition may vary according to the location.In particular, the variation is large when the sample is non-uniform.On the other hand, the actual Ti amounts in the samples increased gradually with increasing amount of Ti added in the synthesis steps. Fig. 5 presents the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 samples, and results are listed in Table 2.All samples gave typical irreversible type IV adsorption isotherms, as defined by IUPAC 32.N 2 adsorption at low relative pressure (p/p 0 0.25) accounted for the monolayer adsorption of N 2 , followed by multilayer adsorption on the walls of the mesopores, and did not indicate the presence of micropores 33.As the relative pressure increases, all samples exhibited sharp inflections at relative pressures ranging from 0.25 to 0.45, which is characteristic of capillary condensation inside the primary mesopores, showing that all the samples have a typical meso-structure with a regular and uniform pore size distribution.The relative pressure position of the inflection point is clearly related to the size of the mesopore, and the sharpness of these steps indicates the uniformity of the mesopore size.With the exception of the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 15 Si 85 MCM-41 sample, the isotherms of the other Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41 samples showed similar inflection points with a slight shift toward higher relative pressures with increasing Ti-insertion, indicating an increase in the adsorption pore volume and an increase in the size of the most probable pore.Table 2 lists the structure parameters calculated from N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms.The specific surface area (1149.40m 2 g -1 for Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41) increased with increasing Ti content to 35 mol.; the same tendency was also observed for the pore volume and mean pore diameter.In contrast, the BET surface area of the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 50 Si 50 MCM-41 sample decreased but the pore volume and pore diameter increased.The lowest pore volume has the largest average pore diameter because of the increasing nonstructural porosity consisting of some irregular cavities that permeate the entire bulk and give rise to secondary porosity.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis for two samples, Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 and Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41, was employed to obtain detailed information on the oxidation states of all of the elements.The high-resolution survey spectra exhibit the presence of Ti 2p, Ca 2p, Si 2p, and O 1s photoelectron lines in Fig. 6.For Ti 2p spectra, the ratio between the Ti2p doublet areas is to Ti 2p 3/2 /Ti 2p 1/2 0.5: it was satisfactory in both samples.Generally, the binding energy of Ti 2p 3/2 at 458.8 eV confirmed to the presence of Ti(IV) in an octahedral coordination (extraframework or anatase) 34.However, the high binding energy contributions in both samples of Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 and Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41, observed at 459.1 eV may be due to the presence of terminal Ti(IV) associated with silica (Ti O Si) 35.These species are related to photocatalytic activity on Si O Ti systems, perhaps acting as adsorption sites of the reactants.Additionally the broad Ti 2p peak suggests the presence of titanium with lower oxidation states, and the line slightly became broad with added calcium element 34.For the survey of Ca 2p, two feature peaks of Ca 2p 1/2 and Ca 2p 3/2 emerged clearly at round 346.5 eV and 350.1 eV 36, respectively, this implies that Ca element exists as Ca 2 in Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41.The binding energies of Si 2p were shown at 103.0 eV 34, and the peak shifted with the Ca loading to high binding energy, which meaning more oxidized state.Generally the O 1s binding energies are located in the 530.9-536.2eV regions 35.In this study, the binding energy at 530.9 eV and 533.7 eV can be assigned to TiO 2 and SiO 2 , respectively.These peaks were seen in both samples, but the calcium is considered to be loaded onto the oxygen in Si O, from which the O 1s peak of TiO 2 is larger than that of SiO 2 .Fig. 7(a) and (b) shows the diffuse reflectance-UV-vis absorption spectra of the synthesized Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 powders and their Tauc's plots 37.All samples had a maximum band located in the region, 250-280 nm, suggesting that the polymerized Ti O Ti species in higher coordination, such as hexahedral coordination Ti species, co-exist with the tetrahedral Ti sites 38.Therefore, in all the synthesized Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 samples, most of the Ti(IV) species are located at the tetrahedral positions in the framework.UV-vis spectroscopy showed that the Ti atoms entered the silica framework and no extra framework titanium formed during the microwave irradiation synthesis.In addition, the absorption intensity increased depending on the amount of Ti inserted.On the other hand, the absorption spectra showed a steeper absorption edge, which was similar to the results obtained by the Tauc equation.The band gap was estimated using the Tauc equation: ( h ) n B(h -E g ), where h is the photon energy, is the absorption coefficient, B is a constant relative to the material, and the exponent n is a value that depends on the nature of the transition (2 for a direct allowed transition, 2/3 for direct forbidden transition and 1/2 for indirect allowed transition).The estimated band-gaps of the Ca(5.0 wt.)/SiMCM-41, Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 15 Si 85 MCM-41, Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41, and Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 50 Si 50 MCM-41 particles were 2.76, 2.70, 2.58, and 2.45 eV, respectively; the band-gap decreased with increasing Ti-insertion.Moreover, different band-heights were also affected by Ti-insertion.Generally, a lower band gap is better for enhancing the photocatalytic performance under weak solar radiation 39, but this principle is not always true because there is less band gap to facilitate recombination between the electrons and holes. Fig. 8 shows the PL spectra of the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 particles with different Ti contents.The Ca(5.0 wt.)/SiMCM-41 particles exhibited a wide and strong PL signal in the range, 380-600 nm, with the maximum excitation wavelength of 444 nm, whereas the intensities of the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 curves decreased gradually with an increase of Ti insertion except for completely collapsed Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 50 Si 50 MCM-41 sample.Generally, due to the formation of new oxygen vacancies by metal-doping, the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band initially reach the vacant space and then recombine with the photogenerated holes in the valance band to produce fluorescence emission 40.The relatively strong emission peak was also observed in the Ca-non loaded TiSiMCM-41 samples, indicating the higher electron-hole recombination.After loading CaO, the PL emission peak decreased, suggesting a decrease in electron-hole recombination.This suggests that the CaO species are more effective in CO 2 absorption.Therefore, the photocatalytic activities over these Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 materials can be correlated and rationalized by the photoluminescence studies.The reduced PL intensities for the Ca loaded Ti x SiMCM-41 samples might be due to defects (regardless of the chemical stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric) generated by Ca ions partially incorporated into the SiMCM-41 structure.In other words, Ca-ions suppressed the recombination of photogenerated carriers via a transition from the structural defects or oxygen vacancies to Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 conduction band.Consequently, a lower PL intensity means the hindering of electron-hole pair recombination on the Ti x SiMCM-41 surface as well accelerating electron transfer in this study.In addition, the mesoporous Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 material did not show any significant emission, as indicated in this figure, suggesting that electron-hole recombination is significantly minimized in this material compared to nano-sized Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 O 200 composite, possibly due to their pore effect.Accordingly, the photocatalytic activity of mesoporous Ti x SiMCM-41 is superior to that of the nano-sized Ti x SiO 2 composite.According to the CO 2 photoreduction mechanism, water and CO 2 gases are adsorbed onto the surface of the photocatalysts in the first step, and the photoreduction reaction then progresses 41.Therefore, the photocatalytic performance depends on the absorption capacities of these two gases, which are injected from outside the reactor.Here, the CO 2 adsorption ability was determined for all samples.In this study, the CO 2 adsorption profiles were obtained at high temperatures (700 C) corresponding to CO 2 desorption on the metal oxide species, as shown in Fig. 9.The curve intensity increased significantly in the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 sample, which means considerably more CO 2 molecules were adsorbed on the surface of the exposed Ca O Ti than on the Ca O Si surface.In general, a rapid catalytic reaction occurs when many reactants are well-adsorbed over the catalyst.The harmonic presence of Ca and Ti ions most likely caused the relative increase in the number of CO 2 molecules.Photocatalytic reduction processes require a catalyst, feed (CO 2 and H 2 O) and light source.All the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were repeated at least in triplicate and the average results are reported.Generally, the mechanism for methane production from CO 2 reduction 42 can be divided into three subprocesses: proton production from H 2 O photodecomposition, CO radical production from CO 2 photo cleavage and methane production from photosynthesis between the CO radical and proton.The photogenerated electrons on the photocatalysts by UV-radiation induce CO 2 reduction to produce CO 2 radicals, whereas the holes react with the adsorbed H 2 O molecules to perform oxidation.The intermediate photogenerated species undergo different reactions to produce CO and CH 4 .The production of CH 4 from methyl radicals ( CH 3 ) was confirmed because all of the above products were detected experimentally.These radicals are dependent directly on the formation of the intermediate product, CO.From the reaction summary and the above observations, there is the possibility of producing hydrocarbons using photocatalysts with good reduction potentials.Fig. 10 presents the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O vapor to CH 4 over the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 catalysts.The higher Ti-insertion into the SiMCM-41 framework led to higher photoactivity for CO 2 photoreduction.CH 4 was not produced over pure Ca(5.0 wt.)/SiMCM-41, but the level of production increased gradually with increasing Ti-content.On the other hand, in Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 sample without Ca ingredient loading, the methane generation did not significantly increase compared to the Ca loaded Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 sample.This is an evidence that the Ca ingredient affects the photoreaction of CO 2 perhaps increasing the amount of adsorption of carbon dioxide on the calcium surfaces.The maximum CH 4 yield was 9.8 mol g -1 cat L -1 over the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 catalyst after 8 h compared to 2.6 mol g -1 cat L -1 using the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 O 2 nanocomposite (reference material, hydrothermal synthesis, 20-50 nm particle size, 80.0 m 3 g -1 specific surface area); however, the yield was lower in the more Ti-inserted Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 50 Si 50 MCM-41 catalyst due to pore collapse.These results show that the effects of the mesopores are more extensive in photoreaction. On the other hand, Fig. 11 shows the effect of the Ca loading remarkably and reached 82 mol g -1 cat L -1 after 8 h over Ca(10.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41; this value was 8 times higher than that over Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41.This means that CO 2 absorption increased stably over the 10 wt. CaO, which led to an increase in the proportion of methane.In contrast, when Ca(15.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 was used, the CH 4 yield decreased to 8 mol g -1 cat L -1 after irradiation for 8 h.This was attributed to an increase in the number of photons from the light source that reached the large pores over the surfaces of the Ca(10.0wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 catalyst, allowing the electrons generated from the catalysts to be transferred efficiently to the CO 2 gas.In the case of the 15 Ca-loading, however, the Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 surface was covered with CaO; hence, the number of photons from the light source that reached the large pores decreased. The efficiency for the photogenerated electron-hole production in Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 and Ca(10.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 films was measured by photocurrent response under solar light irradiation at an applied potential of 0.7 V versus SCE.Fig. 12 shows the typical real time photocurrent response of the Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 and Ca(10.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 films, when the light source is switched on and off, exhibiting rapid photocurrent rise and decay.In semiconductor systems, when an irradiation provides energy higher than the band gap of semiconductor, the energy excites the electrons from valence band to conduction band and leaves a hole in valence band.The electron-hole is responsible of the photocurrent.When the light was turned on, a rapid increase in the photoreduction current was observed, and the photocurrent then turned to a steady state after a few seconds, as light off, the photocurrent dropped to nearly zero instantaneously 43.When the light was turned on, the maximum photocurrent was obtained for the Ca(10.0wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 film with 137 nA cm -2 , which is 9.6 higher than that achieved on Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 film (113 nA cm -2 ).Additionally there are no Scheme 1. Model for CO2 photoreduction over Ca/TixSiMCM-41s.current transients in both the light-on and the light-off regions in samples falling off with time in 50 s to a steady state value which indicates that there are few surface recombination processes happened.Therefore Ca ingredient has a beneficial effect on photocurrent: it plays a role as the intermediate for the efficient separation of photogenerated hole-electron pairs.However, we have confirmed that the increase of e -/h recombination is rather observed for 15 loading, thus this study suggests a suitable loading amount of calcium is present. Scheme 1 presents a proposed model for CO 2 photoreduction over Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41.Photon excitation over Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41 will start fast because it has a very short band-gap, otherwise its photocatalytic activity will decrease due to rapid recombination of the electron-holes induced by the short band-gap.On the other hand, if CaO is present on the surface of Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41, photocatalysis is possible because of the ability of CaO to trap and release electrons into the conduction band of TiO 2 together with significant CO 2 absorption, resulting in a significant increase in the CH 4 yield over Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41.Therefore, the Ca loading can promote charge pair separation of the Ti x SiMCM-41 photocatalyst to achieve higher CO 2 reduction efficiency.Photo-excited electrons on the Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41 conductance band can be accepted and transferred efficiently to CO 2 adsorbed on CaO, functioning as an efficient reducing agent.The positive holes on the Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41 valance band can be trapped by OH -or H 2 O species.These processes promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs (e -/h ) to accelerate the CO 2 reduction process, and enhance the Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41 catalytic performance.Note that an excess metal content reduces the photoactivity, as observed with the 15.0 wt. loaded Ca/Ti x SiMCM-41 sample, possibly due to the establishment of charge recombination centers inside the semiconductor structure 44."

    "content": "To enhance the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 , this study evaluated a new type of photocatalyst, Ti x SiMCM-41(x 5, 15, 35, and 50 mol.), in which Ti was partially incorporated into the SiMCM-41 framework using a controlled hydrothermal method, and to improve CO 2 adsorption, Ca(1.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 wt.) was loaded on the surface of Ti x SiMCM-41.XRD and TEM confirmed that the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 exhibited a hexagonal porous crystal structure, approximately the hexagons 2-4 nm in size.The bandgap decreased according to Ti addition, whereas the PL intensities exhibited an opposite trend.The photocurrent was improved by Ca loading and an appropriate amount value, 10.0 wt., was existed in there.The CH 4 generation was enhanced dramatically, and it was 3 times higher over mesoporous Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 after an 8 h reaction than over nano-sized Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 O 200 .In particular, the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O revealed a remarkable increase in CH 4 generation over the Ca 10.0 wt. loaded Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 catalyst to 82.0 mol g -1 cat L -1 after an 8 h reaction.The enhanced photoactivity in mesoporous Ca/TiSiMCM-41 can be attributed to effective charge separation over the Ca and Ti additives, which inhibited the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.

Fig.2(a) and (b) shows XRD patterns of the prepared Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti x SiMCM-41 (x 0, 15, 35, and 50) powders.In Fig.1(a), a shape reflection peak corresponding to the (100) plane was observed at a low angle (2-2.5 2) in all Ca non-loaded Ti x SiMCM-41 (x 0, 15, 35, and 50) samples, highlighting the typical hexagonal SiMCM-41 structure29.On the other hand, this peak was absent in the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 50 Si 50 MCM-41 sample after Caloading.Fortunately, the sign of a very small peak remained until 35 mol.Ti-insertion in the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 35 Si 65 MCM-41 sample.This was attributed to the larger mesopores due to the insertion of many larger sized titanium ions than silicon ions into the SiMCM-41 framework.Eventually, the loaded calcium ions penetrated further into the pores, which led to pore clogging.In addition to the main reflection peak, three reflection peaks, which were indexed to the (1 1 0), (2 0 0) and (2 1 0) planes, were clearly visible at 3-7 2A in the XRD patterns of the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 15 Si 85 MCM-41 sample.The presence of well-defined and intense XRD peaks indicates the excellent degree of ordering of the mesoporous molecular sieves.In addition, slight decreases in inter planar spacing d 1 0 0 with increasing Ti content were observed.This could be related to the probable incorporation of Ti atoms into the silica framework.Because the ionic radius of Ti 4 (0.068 nm) is larger than that of Si 4 (0.041 nm), the substitution of Si 4 with Ti 4 should invariably distort the geometry around Ti from an ideal tetrahedral coordination.No peaks assignable to CaO were observed in the high-angle region (figure not shown).Therefore, the metal ions are either dispersed atomically in the framework of TiSiMCM-41 or achieve amorphous form outside the framework.On the other hand, in wide angle range of Fig.1(b), the anatase TiO 2 tetragonal structured peaks were clearly observed in the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 15 Si 85 MCM-41 sample.In the Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 50 Si 50 MCM-41 sample, however, the peaks disappeared and new some small peaks assigned to the perovskite cubic CaTiO 3 structure30 were observed.These results suggest that the loaded Ca ions exist in close proximity to the Ti ions.Fig. 3 presents the TEM images of the four samples, Ca(5.0 wt.)/SiMCM-41, Ca(5.0 wt.)/Ti 15 Si 85 MCM-41, Fig. 2.
