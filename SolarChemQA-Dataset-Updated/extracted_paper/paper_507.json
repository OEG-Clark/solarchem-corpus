    "content": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in aqueous solution was performed using TiO 2 photocatalysts modified with Ce and La under fluorescent light irradiation.The photocatalysts were prepared using modified sol-gel method with Ce doping content varied between 0 and 2 wt.Comprehensive characterization using XRD, XPS, nitrogen physisorption, SEM, EDX, PL and UV-vis spectroscopy revealed that the introduction of cerium affected the surface, structural and optical properties of the photocatalyts.Among all the doped photocatalysts, 1.5 wt Ce/La/TiO 2 showed the highest photocatalytic activity under fluorescent light irradiation.In the liquid phase, a maximum yield of 317.7 mol/g cat for CH 3 OH was achieved whereas CH 4 and CO were the main products in the gas phase with maximum yields of 262.8 and 119.4 mol/g cat, respectively.The addition of Ce and La was found to inhibit the growth of anatase TiO 2 , increase the surface area and improve the optical properties of the photocatalyst.The existence of Ce 3 /Ce 4 mixture was also found to effectively inhibit the electron-hole recombination, enhancing the photocatalytic activity of Ce/La co-doped TiO 2 ."

    "content": "Absolute ethanol and glacial acetic acid were purchased from Merck.Tetrabutyl orthotitanate (Ti(O(C 4 H 9 )) 4 ) was purchased from Acros Organics and cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O) and lanthanum (III) nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O) were purchased from Fluka.Deionized and distilled water was used for hydrolysis and washing, respectively.All the chemicals were used as received without any purification. Pure TiO 2 , La doped TiO 2 and a series of Ce and La co-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts (with 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 wt of Ce) were synthesized using a modified sol-gel method 25.The amount of La used for La doped TiO 2 and Ce and La co-doped TiO 2 was not varied and fixed at 2 wt.The synthesis method for pure TiO 2 was as follows: 5 ml of glacial acetic acid and 10 ml of absolute ethanol were added into 10 ml of tetrabutyl titanate under continuous stirring condition (solution A). 4 ml of deionized water, 6 ml of acetic acid and 30 ml of ethanol were mixed together to form solution B. Solution A was then added dropwise into solution B with constant stirring for 30 min.The solution was then sealed and heated up to 60 C for 2 h under continuous stirring.The resultant gel was then aged at 0 C for 24 h and dried in an oven at 80 C. The samples were washed with distilled water to remove any un-reactant chemical and dried again at 80 C. The dried samples were then milled using an agate mortar followed by calcination at 500 C for 4 h at a heating rate of 1 C/min.In the case of mono-and co-doped TiO 2 photocatalysts, appropriate amounts of Ce and La salt were added into deionized water. The crystal structure of the synthesized photocatalysts were identified using X-ray diffractometer (Siemens 2000x series) with Cu-k radiation ( 1.5406A), operated in the range of 2A 20-90.The crystallite size of the photocatalysts was calculated by using the Scherrer's equation, D K /cos A where D is the average crystallite size (nm), K is the Scherrer constant (0.89), is the wavelength of the X-ray source, is the full width at half maximum and A is the Bragg's angle.The crystallite size of the photocatalysts was calculated with respect to anatase (101) plane.Nitrogen sorption isotherms were obtained using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface analyzer.Based on the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, surface characteristic including BET surface area, total pore volume and average pore size were calculated.Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis was performed using a Quanta 450 FEG scanning electron microscope equipment operated at 15 kV.The elemental composition on the surface of the photocatalyst was determined using Oxford X-max energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) system using Mn K as the energy source that was attached to the SEM unit.Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was carried out using a Perkin Elmer Lambda S55 spectrofluorometer using a Xe lamp with an excitation wavelength of 290 nm.The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using Kratos Axis Ultra DLD High Resolution Multi Technique X-ray spectrometer.The XPS spectrum was recorded using an analyzer with the pass energy of 40 eV and X-ray power of 225 W. The XPS data was analyzed using CasaXPS software to obtain information regarding the state and composition of the species present on the surface of the photocatalysts.The diffuse reflectance spectra of the photocatalysts were recorded using Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 UV-vis spectrophotometer and BaSO 4 was used for baseline correction.The obtained reflectance data was converted to equivalent absorption spectra and was used to estimate band gap energy of the photocatalysts using Kubelka-Munk function (Eq.( 1)). The photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O was carried out in a stirred batch annular reactor with a volume of 500 ml with suspended catalyst.A 15 W fluorescent lamp (Osram DULUXSTAR MINI TWIST 11W/826 E27) was used as the light source for visible light irradiation.The lamp was situated at the center of a quartz tube.NaOH 0.2 M was used as the reaction medium with a catalyst loading of 1 g/L.Supercritical fluid-grade CO 2 with a certified maximum hydrocarbon less than 1 ppm was used as the carbon source.Prior to the illumination, N 2 gas was bubbled at a constant rate for 30 min to make the reaction environment inert.Then, CO 2 gas was bubbled in at a constant rate (20 cm 3 /min) to purge the N 2 and saturate the solution.Liquid and gaseous samples were taken every 30 min for product analysis using gas chromatograph (GC).For gaseous sample, a GC equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a carbon molecular sieve (carbolite) column with H 2 as carrier gas was used.Certified calibration gases were used to calibrate the GC before each experimental run.The gases were injected into the GC to determine the retention time and peak areas for each component.The liquid sample was analyzed using a GC equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a molecular sieve (Hysep-T) column for hydrocarbon analysis with He as the carrier gas.All the liquid samples were filtered using a Millipore filter prior to GC injection.The GC was calibrated using a five-point calibration using standard sample before each experimental run.Three blank tests were conducted to obtain a baseline: (1) with catalyst but without light irradiation, (2) without catalyst but with light irradiation, (3) with catalyst and light irradiation but with N 2 as the feed gas instead of CO 2 ."

    "content": "The phase composition, crystallinity and crystallite size of Ce/La/TiO 2 were elucidated using XRD analysis.The XRD spectra for TiO 2 , 2 wt La/TiO 2 and Ce/La co-doped TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 1.The diffraction spectra for all the photocatalysts correspond to the tetragonal anatase phase with no peaks for rutile or brookite.The diffraction peaks around 2A 25.3, 37.7, 48.2 53.9, 55.1 and 62.7 are identified and can be attributed to the diffraction faces of (101), (004), ( 200), ( 105), ( 211) and (204), respectively.According to Fig. 1, the introduction of Ce and La caused the broadening of the diffraction peaks and the decrease in the intensity of the anatase peaks.On top of that, no diffraction peaks for Ce or La oxides are observed for all the photocatalysts. The absence of Ce peaks and reduction of anatase reflection in the diffraction pattern may indicate that cerium might exist in the form of amorphous ceria phase, small CeO 2 nuclei or Ce ions that was incorporated into TiO 2 lattice structure.Furthermore, these observations also indicated that the degree of crystallinity as well as the titania crystallite size was influenced by the Ce loading 26.The form of Ce on the photocatalysts also depends on photocatalyst synthesis method and Ce doping content.Matejova et al. 18 reported the synthesis of Ce doped TiO 2 using sol-gel method (0-10 mol Ce doping).They found that when the Ce doping content was low (5 mol) but Ce could be successfully incorporated into the lattice of TiO 2 .However, higher Ce doping content (5-10 mol) would saturate the TiO 2 lattice resulting in Ce existing in the form of amorphous CeO 2 or small nuclei.According to Lopez et al. 27, Ce could be incorporated into TiO 2 lattice because anatase crystalline structure has interstitial channels in which Ce 4 ions can get access in order to substitute some Ti 4 moieties.During sol state, when Ti O -chains are formed, Ce 4 can be inserted between these chains by direct linking or substitution to finally obtain a Ti O Ce O Ti xerogel arrangement.Since the Ce atomic radius is relatively large compared to that of Ti, TiO 2 can easily be saturated with just small amounts of Ce.As for La, the absence of any diffraction peaks might be due to the very small particle sizes of lanthanum oxide that were highly dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 or due to the incorporation La 3 into the lattice structure of TiO 2 .La might also present in the amorphous phase at high La loading 28.In the present work, the incorporation of La into the lattice structure of TiO 2 was unlikely as the change in the lattice parameter observed was very small.A more plausible explanation for the lattice distortion is the substitution of La 3 atoms in the lattice of La 2 O 3 by Ti 4 29.The Ti O La bond is formed at the interface as a consequence of part of La 3 being replaced by Ti 4 .The formation of this bond would produce a stabilizing effect on the Ti O since the more electropositive La 3 would render its electronic concentration of O 2 , thus restraining the anatase to rutile transformation 21. A closer observation of the (101) anatase peaks in the XRD patterns indicated that there was a slight shift in the peak position to the lower diffraction angle with the addition of Ce and La.The shift in the diffraction peak was more prominent with the increase in Ce doping content (Fig. 2).This may be due to the difference in atomic radii of Ce 3 /Ce 4 and Ti 4 .It was suggested that if the dopant has a larger ionic radii than that of the lattice ions, the position of the diffraction peaks in XRD patterns should be shifted to lower diffraction 30.The shift of the diffraction peaks to the lower angle was also an evident of the successful incorporation of Ce into the lattice structure of TiO 2 31. The crystallite sizes of Ce/La/TiO 2 photocatalysts were calculated using Scherrer's equation by using (101) peak.The crystallite size together with the lattice parameters for all the photocatalysts are tabulated in Table 1.It can be seen that with increasing doping content, the crystallite size of the co-doped TiO 2 reduces.The crystallite size reduction is most significant for 2 wtCe/La/TiO 2 having the smallest crystallite size of 11.39 nm.As for the changes in the lattice parameters, the anatase cell volume increased monotonically for Ce doping content up to 1.5 wt, while the increase in cell volume was limited at higher Ce content.After 1.5 wt of Ce loading, the lattice was already saturated with Ce 4 ions.Based the reported work in literature 18,2627282948, and the result in the present study, it can be concluded that Ce was successfully incorporated into the lattice structure of TiO 2 at lower doping content (1.5 wt Ce) and at higher doping content, the rest of Ce might exist as small CeO 2 nuclei or as amorphous CeO 2 .In the case of La, it was not incorporated into the lattice structure but instead was dispersed uniformly onto the surface of TiO 2 as small cluster of La 2 O 3 and the substitution of La 3 atoms in the lattice of La 2 O 3 by Ti 4 is further justified by XPS analysis as described in Section 3.1.5. The surface characteristics of Ce/La/TiO 2 photocatalysts were investigated using nitrogen sorption measurement.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms for Ce/La/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 3.As shown in the figure, the isotherms are characteristic of type IV isotherm with a H2 hysteresis loop.According to IUPAC classification it is a typical characteristic of mesoporous materials.The H2 hysteresis loop can be attributed to the difference in adsorption and desorption mechanism and the existence of pore cavities larger than the openings (throats), leading to ink-bottle pores 32.The steepness of the desorption branch indicates the uniformity in the diameter of the throats which can be attributed to the synthesis method used in this study 33. The BET surface area, average pore diameter and pore volume for all the photocatalysts are listed in Table 2.It is evident that the addition of Ce and La influenced the textural properties of the photocatalysts.The influence is more prominent for Ce doping compared to that with the addition of La.The surface areas were within the range of 95.5-175.2m 2 /g.For Ce/La/TiO 2 the BET surface area increased with increasing Ce loading up to 1.5 wt and then decreased for higher Ce doping contents.The surface area result was not in good agreement with the XRD result which saw the reduction of crystal size with increasing metal loading.The slight decrease in the BET surface area for both sets of photocatalysts might be due to the blockage of TiO 2 pores by the higher metal loading 34. The optical absorption properties Ce/La/TiO 2 photocatalysts was investigated using UV-vis DRS analysis in the range of 300-800 nm.The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra for pure and all the modified TiO 2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 4. The band gap energy for the prepared photocatalysts was calculated using the Kubelka-Munk function.The obtained spectra are transformed to the dependency (F(R) hv) 1/2 against hv with the assumption that absorption coefficient ( ) is proportional to F(R) with the narrow range of energy containing the absorption edge features 35.It can be seen that the shape of the curve for La/TiO 2 spectra did not change significantly with the introduction of La.However, there was a decrease in the reflectance intensity after the introduction of La into TiO 2 nanoparticles.Based on the work done by El Sherif et al. 36, they found that the absorption capability of a material has an inverse relationship with its reflectance.Therefore, it can be said that adding TiO 2 with La increased the light absorption capability of TiO 2 photocatalyst.The increase in absorption ability might be due to the presence of surface state involving oxygen vacancies which might form localization levels with the band gap 37.According to Sadhu and Poddar 38, oxygen vacancies might be generated due to the difference in the valance state of lanthanum and titanium.The addition of Ce evidently enhanced the visible absorption capability of the doped TiO 2 photocatalyst and a red shift of the absorption edge toward the visible light region was observed.The red shift of the absorption edge increased with the increase in Ce doping content.The red shift revealed the presence of Ti O Ce bonds and created a new energy level in the band gap, which reduced the band gap of Ce doped TiO 2 30.It was proposed that the red shift could be attributed to charge transfer transition between the Ce ion f electron and TiO 2 conduction or valence band 39.This result was corroborated by Xie et al. 40 and Yan et al. 41.They suggested that the Ce 4f level plays an important role in the generating of electron-holes pairs under visible light irradiation.The band gap of all the prepared photocatalysts was calculated using Kubelka-Munk method and are tabulated in Table 2. Fig. 5 shows the Kubelka-Munk plot for Ce/La/TiO 2 photocatalysts.Based on the data in Table 2, all the photocatalysts showed good visible light responsiveness with the band gaps in the range of 2.7 and 3.05.The largest red shift was observed for 2 wtCe/La/TiO 2 .It can be concluded that the visible light responsiveness for all the photo- catalysts can be ascribed to the presence of Ce and the doping of La did not have significant effect on the band gap of TiO 2 photocatalyst. Fig. 6 shows the PL spectra for pure and Ce/La/TiO 2 photocatalysts.The PL spectra emission is used to elucidate the efficiency of separation of electron-holes pairs.It is widely accepted that the rate of electrons and holes recombination rates are directly proportional to the intensity of the luminous spectra.The PL spectra were examined in the range of 350-550 nm under UV excitation at around 290 nm.It is observed that all the PL spectra have similar shape and curve with pure TiO 2 .This indicated that introduction of metal ions did not give rise to a new luminescence phenomenon 42.However, the addition of metals did have a significant effect on the intensity of the PL spectra.All the samples exhibited obvious PL peaks at around 420 nm and 470 nm.The peak around 420 nm represents the band-edge free exciton luminescence 43, while that at around 470 nm is attributed to the bound exciton luminescence 44. It can be seen in Fig. 6 that the intensity of the PL spectrum decreases with increasing Ce loading.The weakest luminous peak intensity was detected with 1.5 wt Ce doping content.Further increase in the Ce loading causes the peak intensity to increase.Compared to La/TiO 2 , the PL spectra for TiO 2 nanoparticles with the presence of both Ce and La have much lower peak intensities.This might be due to the longer nonradiative channels (channels comprising of Ce 3 , La 3 and defects) in the co-doped TiO 2 where the charge carriers relax for a longer time than that in individual doped TiO 2 photocatalyst 31.Closer examination of the PL spectra shows that there is a small shift in the peaks to the left (lower wavelength) for Ce doped TiO 2 .This can be ascribed to the incorporation of Ce ions into the lattice structure of TiO 2 45. The surface chemical state of Ti, O and dopant Ce and La in the Ce/La/TiO 2 photocatalyst was investigated using XPS analysis.The elemental composition of each of the component on the surface of the 1.5 wt Ce/La/TiO 2 photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 7 and Table 3 shows the elemental compositions for the rest of the photocatalysts.Fig. 7a shows the Ti 2p XPS spectrum.Based on the figure, the two peaks that appear at approximately 464.85 and 459.21 eV can be assigned to Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 , respectively.This suggested that Ti element existed mainly in the form of Ti 4 in a tetragonal structure 20.Comparison with the binding energy of pure TiO 2 showed that the binding energies for the co-doped TiO 2 were shifted to a lower energy levels.This suggested a different electronic interaction between Ti and metal ions, which caused partial electron transfer between Ti and metal ions due to the difference in electronegativity 34. The deconvoluted peaks for O 1s are shown in Fig. 7b.There are three distinctive peaks appearing at 530.1, 531.5 and 532.8 eV.The peak at a binding energy of 530.1 can be assigned to bulk oxygen bound on TiO 2 .The second peak at 531.5 eV can be attributed to the surface oxygen by hydroxyl species or chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of the photocatalyst whereas the peak at 532.8 eV is for the water adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalysts.The presence of chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of the photocatalyst is favorable as the recombination of electrons and holes can be suppressed by the interaction between the photogenerated electron and hole pair with the readily available chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of the photocatalyst 46.It can be seen in Table 3 that the introduc-tion of Ce could enhance the concentration of chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of photocatalysts, with the maximum amount of chemisorbed oxygen detected at 1.5 wt of Ce loading.The presence of chemisorbed oxygen could be related to existence of Ce 3 species on the surface of the photocatalyst.The increase of Ce 3 content could be helpful for the chemisorbed oxygen.This might be due to the ability of Ce 3 to create charge imbalance, vacancies and unsaturated chemical bonds on the surface of the photocatalysts 47.This result was in good agreement with the result reported by Xiong et al. 48 and Wang et al. 49.They reported that the ratio of chemisorbed oxygen increased with increasing Ce doping content but started to decrease as the surface was saturated with Ce species at high doping concentrations. The Ce 3d spectrum of 1.5 wt Ce/La/TiO 2 is shown in Fig. 7c. The two main peak for Ce 3d, Ce 3d 5/2 and Ce 3d 3/2 are labeled v and u, respectively based on the work by Burroughs et al. 50.For all the photocatalysts studied, Ce existed as a mixture of Ce 3 and Ce 4 oxidation state.XPS peaks denoted as u, u , u , and v, v , v are assigned to Ce 4 , whereas u and v are ascribed to Ce 3 .As seen in Table 4, the variation in Ce loading affected the composition of Ce 3 and Ce 4 .Wang et al. 49 suggested that the presence of Ce 3 /Ce 4 oxidation state can enhance the photocatalytic activity as Ce 3 can act as holes quencher.Fig. 7d shows the La 3d XPS spectrum for 1.5 wt Ce/La/TiO 2 .It can be seen that the spectrum mainly consists of two main peaks at 834.7 and 852 eV which could be assigned to La 3d 5/2 and La 3d 3/2 .The peaks at 838.7 and 855.3 are the shake-up satellite peak for La 3d 5/2 and La 3d 3/2 , respectively 51. The performances of Ce/La/TiO 2 photocatalysts were tested for the photoreduction of CO 2 under fluorescent light irradiation.The three blank runs conducted as mentioned in Section 2.4 resulted in no formation of hydrocarbon.This indicated that CO 2 that was bubbled into the solution was the only source of carbon for the product formation and that both light irradiation and the presence of catalyst were necessary for the CO 2 reduction.Fig. 8 shows the evolution of reaction products as a function of irradiation time for all photocatalysts.CH 4 and CO were detected as gaseous products whereas CH 3 OH was detected in the liquid product.It can be seen that the yield of the products increased with the irradiation time for all photocatalysts except for TiO 2 photocatalyst.According to Fig. 8, TiO 2 did not show any photocatalytic activity under fluorescent light irradiation.This might be due to the threshold wavelength of 387.5 nm (based on UV-vis spectrum) of anatase TiO 2 that falls in the UV region.According to Usubharatana et al. 52, the minimal photon energy required to promote the excited state for anatase TiO 2 is at a wavelength of 387.5 nm.Since fluorescent light irradiation falls in the visible light region, the photon energy was not sufficient to excite electron from the valence band of TiO 2 .This photoreduction results showed that the modification done to TiO 2 by adding Ce and La could increase the product yield compared to pristine TiO 2 photocatalyst. Based on the photoreduction studies, it is obvious that the modification of TiO 2 with two rare earth metals increased the rate of products formation compared to pure or TiO 2 modified with one rare earth metal.As shown in Fig. 8, the product rate of CH 3 OH, CH 4 and CO increased with an increase in Ce doping to give an optimal Ce doping content of 1.5 wt Ce, after which the product rates decreased for the subsequent increase in Ce loading.The rate of CH 3 OH, CH 4 and CO was observed to evolve rapidly over the period of 6 h: with a maximum production rate of 355.2, 289.1 and 132.6 mol/g cat, respectively for 1.5 wt Ce/La/TiO 2 photocatalyst.Changing Ce loading clearly affected the TiO 2 surface properties such as the level of surface coverage by CeO 2 , the ratio of Ce 3 /Ce 4 species and the presence of chemisorbed oxygen and/or hydroxyl groups on the photocatalyst surface.Based on the XRD and XPS analysis, Ce was incorporated into the lattice structure and also presented on the surface of the photocatalyst.The incorporation of Ce into the lattice structure could create electron trap below the conduction band.Consequently, the excited electrons become trap at these levels before participating in reduction reaction on the surface while providing enough time to the holes to undergo oxidation reactions 62. Other than that, the ability of Ce 3 /Ce 4 redox couple due to the presence of Ce on the surface of the photocatalyst could also reduce electron-holes recombination by enabling faster electron transfer along the TiO 2 surface 53.The concept of the ability of Ce ions that can reduce the recombination rate of electrons and holes was explained in detail by Magesh et al. 54.They found that the difference in reduction potential of Ce 4 and oxidation potential of Ce 3 to CB and VB of TiO 2 respectively makes it the CB electron to reduce Ce 4 and VB electron to oxidize Ce 3 .These species could then transfer the charges to the species in the reaction media, hence retarding the charge carrier recombination 61.Furthermore, an increase in surface chemisorbed oxygen by the addition of Ce could also improve the charge carrier separation.Wang et al. 49 found that these oxygen species could easily capture electrons and produce surface oxygen species with strong reduction capability, inhibiting the recombination of photo generated electrons and holes.This result was corroborated by those of Matejova et al. 18, Xiong et al. 48 and Abdullah et al. 26.They found that with an increasing in Ce doping, the population of Ce 3 ions and chemisorbed oxygen increased up to a certain level of Ce loading and then there was a decrease for both chemisorbed oxygen and Ce 3 population with further increase in Ce loading.These trends indicate the existence of optimum Ce loading which correlates the ability of Ce 3 /Ce 4 ions transformation and chemisorbed oxygen with the performance of the photocatalyst. The reduction of product rates after the optimal doping ratio was around 12 for 2 wt Ce/La/TiO 2 photocatalyst.The reduction in photoactivity might be due to coverage of the surface of TiO 2 from the increasing metal concentration, thus inhibiting the interfacial charge transfer.At high doping metal concentration, Tseng et al. 55 reported that low photocatalytic efficiency was observed because of reduced photon absorption by TiO 2 .The limited amount of energy available for activation of all the pho-tocatalyst particles inhibited the interfacial charge transfer 56.The reduction in the photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the excess dopant metal that act as electron and hole recombination centers.According to Fox and Dulay 57, as the concentration of metal increases, the space-charge becomes narrower and the electron and hole pairs within this region are affectively separated by a large electric field before recombination.At optimal doping concentration, the thickness of the space-charge layer is similar to the depth of light penetration.However, with the metal concentration exceeding the optimal concentration, the space-charge region becomes very narrow causing the light penetration into TiO 2 to greatly exceed the width of the space-charge layer.Thus, the rate of electrons and holes recombination increased because there were no driving forces to separate them 58.Other than that, smaller surface area at higher doping concentration could also affect the efficiency of the photocatalytic process.While using TiO 2 co-doped with Sm and N, Ma et al. 34 found that when the dopant concentration was less than the optimal concentration, the crystallite was bigger and the surface area was smaller.This translated into lower absorption capacity, thus lower catalytic activity. The comparison between TiO 2 photocatalyst modified with two metal and one metal showed that the photocatalytic efficiency was higher with the presence of two rare earth metals.The main reason for the improvement in the photocatalytic activity was the enhancement of electrons and holes separation.The enhanced electron and hole separation was clearly illustrated by the quenched intensity in the photoluminescence spectra (Fig. 6).It is generally accepted that lower photoluminescence intensity translates into lower electrons and holes recombination.According to photoluminescence study conducted by Choudhury et al. 31, the presence of two metals instead of one is beneficial as the synergy between two metals could increase the number of non-radiative oxygen defect centers that plays an active part in quenching the emission intensity of the photocatalyst.The higher number of these defect sites increases the possibility of non-radiative energy transfer along the channels consisting of the dopant and the defect sites.As the nonradiative channel is longer with the addition of two metals, the charge carriers can relax for a longer time, thus reducing the charge carrier recombination probability. Other than that, the improved photocatalytic activity could also be related to larger surface area and enhanced light absorption capability.In the work reported by Ma et al. 34 and Shi et al. 60, having an appropriate crystallite size and large surface area would lead to more active sites for the reaction to occur.A large increase in CO formation NiO and ln 2 O 3 co-metal doped TiO 2 prepared by Tahir and Amin 24 was possibly due to the increase in the surface area and higher adsorption-desorption processes.Furthermore, Wang et al. 59 also found that co-doping TiO 2 with Gd and La enhanced the absorption intensity significantly, which indicated the photogeneration of more electron and hole pairs under the light irradiation.Therefore, the enhanced photocatalytic activity for the co-doped TiO 2 was likely due to the longer charge carrier lifetime, larger surface area and improved light absorption capability. Other than having a high photocatalytic activity, reusability is also an important aspect for a practical and industrial application of a photocatalyst.Generally, the reusability of the photocatalyst is gauged based on the stability of the photocatalyst to sustain a high activity over an extended period of time.The reusability of 1.5 wt Ce/La/TiO 2 was tested by reusing the photocatalyst for 5 cycles.The photocatalytic test was carried out using 200 ml of 0.2 M NaOH solution with 1 g/L catalyst loading at ambient condition under fluorescent light irradiation.After each reaction run, the photocatalyst was separated by centrifuging the mixture for 10 min at 4000 rpm.The separated photocatalyst was then washed thoroughly with DI water and dried at 80 C for 12 h.The photocatalyst was then reused for CO 2 photoreduction experiment and the results are shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that there was a slight reduction in the product yield with consecutive cycle.However, it should be noted that the overall reduction in product yield was only around 12 between the fresh run and the fourth cycle.The reduction in photocatalytic activity could be derived from the accumulation of intermediate and products on the surface of the photocatalyst and the loss of a small amount of photocatalyst during the recovery process 48.The XRD patterns and SEM images with EDX for the fresh and used photocatalyst are shown in Figs. 10 and11, respectively.It can be seen that no changes are observed in the XRD pattern of the used photocatalyst.The crystal phase remained as anatase with no substantial change in crystalline size.Based on the SEM images, there was no apparent modification to the morphology of the photocatalyst even after the fourth cycle.EDX mapping indicated that there was no metal leaching from the surface, indicating that the photocatalyst was still relatively stable to be used."

    "content": "Fabrications of efficient Ce/La/TiO 2 nanoparticles were successfully demonstrated.The characterization results revealed that Ce was successfully incorporated into the lattice structure of TiO 2 whereas La was merely deposited on the surface of the photocatalyst.Above 1.5 wt of Ce loading, the anatase lattice was saturated with Ce ions and the formation of amorphous ceria and/or ceria nucleation occurred.The fact nicely correlated with the BET surface area which decreased at higher Ce loading.The optical properties of the prepared photocatalyst were also affected by the addition of Ce and La.The addition of La and Ce increased the light absorption capability and caused a red shift in the absorption edge of the photocatalyst.The photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalyst was effectively improved with the addition of Ce and La.CH 3 OH was the primary product in the liquid phase and CO and CH 4 were detected in the gas phase.The product yields for 1.5 wt Ce/La/TiO 2 was around 1.8, 1.9 and 2.1 times higher than that of La/TiO 2 for CH 3 OH, CH 4 and CO, respectively.The improved photocatalytic activity of 1.5 wt Ce/La/TiO 2 could be attributed to the large surface area and the enhanced inhibition of electron and hole recombination rates.The inhibitory effect of Ce and La was demonstrated by the reduced intensity of the PL spectrum.The prepared photocatalyst also showed good reusability and stability properties.There were no structural and morphological changes observed after the fourth cycle as suggested by the XRD and SEM analysis.
