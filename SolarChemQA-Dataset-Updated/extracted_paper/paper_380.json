    "content": "Copper-doped titanium dioxide materials with anatase phase (Cu-TiO 2 , atomic Cu contents ranging from 0 to 3 relative to the sum of Cu and Ti), and particle sizes of 12-15 nm, were synthesised by a solvo-thermal method using ethanol as the solvent and small amounts of water to promote the hydrolysiscondensation processes.Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy show that the edges of absorption of the titania materials are somewhat shifted to higher wavelengths due to the presence of Cu.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicate that Cu(II) is predominant.Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiments were performed in aqueous Cu-TiO 2 suspensions under UV-rich light and in the presence of different solutes.Sulfide was found to promote the efficient production of H 2 from water and formic acid from CO 2 .The effect of the Cu content on the photoactivity of Cu-TiO 2 was also studied, showing that copper plays a role on the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 ."

The copper-doped materials with 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 Cu molar ratios (relative to the sum of Cu and Ti; XCu-TiO 2 , where X 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0, respectively) were prepared following a solvo-thermal methodology.Briefly, the proper amounts of Ti(O i Pr) 4 and Cu(OAc) 2 H 2 O for obtaining 1 g of the oxide were dissolved in a mixture of ethanol (50 mL) and water (0.9 mL).Acetylacetone (acac) was added in a metal/acac ratio of 1:2 and stirred for 15 min.Then, the solution was transferred into a 125 mL teflonlined autoclave and heated to 180 C for 24 h.The products were washed with ethanol several times, collected by centrifugation and dried to yield the as-prepared ( AP XCu-TiO 2 ) materials.Finally, the air-dried powders were annealed in air at 500 C for 2 h, giving rise to the final XCu-TiO 2 materials. The copper-impregnated sample ( IM 3.0Cu/TiO 2 ) was prepared by an incipient wetness method.A solution of CuNO 3 2 21/2H 2 O (57.0 mg) in water (1.1 mL) was slowly added to ground Aeroxide P25 TiO 2 (519 mg) to obtain a homogeneous slurry, which was dried in a dessicator (ca. 10 mbar) at room temperature for 1 h.The resulting pale blue powder was calcined at increasing temperatures (up to 150 C at 3 C min -1 , then maintained for 2 h, and finally up to 500 C at 5 C min -1 and held at that temperature for 0.5 h).After cooling down to room temperature and grinding on a mortar, IM 3.0Cu/TiO 2 was obtained as a green-grey solid. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed by means of a PANalytical Cubix'Pro diffractometer equipped with an X'Celerator detector and automatic divergence and reception slits using Cu-K radiation (0.154056 nm).The mean size of the ordered (crystalline) domains (d) was estimated using the Scherrer equation.The equation can be written as d 0.9 cos A , where is the X-ray wavelength, is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM), after subtracting the instrumental line broadening, in radians, and A is the Bragg angle.Raman spectra were recorded with a spectral window of 1000-100 cm -1 on a Jasco NRS-3100 laser Raman spectrophotometer ( exc 785 nm).Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were collected on a Micromeritics Gemini V gas adsorption analyzer at 77 K, after degassing the samples at 423 K overnight in a Micromeritics Flow prep 060 system with nitrogen flux gas.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were calculated from the adsorption branch of the isotherm according to the BJH method.Diffuse reflectance UV-vis (DRUV-vis) absorption spectra were carried out on a CARY 500 SCAN VARIAN spectrophotometer in the 300-800 nm range.Scanning electron micrographs of the samples were taken with a field emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) model JEOL 7001F, equipped with a spectrometer of energy dispersion of X-ray (EDX) from Oxford instruments by using the following operational parameters: acceleration voltage 20 kV, measuring time 100 s, working distance 25 mm, counting rate 1.2 kcps.Characterisation by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was carried out in a Jem-2100 LaB 6 (Jeol) microscope, at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV, coupled with an Inca Energy TEM 200 (Oxford) energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and a highangle annular dark field (HAADF) detector.Samples were deposited on carbon-coated nickel grids, in order to avoid interference effects associated with copper analogues.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDATA851e thermo-balance under air from room temperature to 800 C. Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected on a SPECS spectrometer equipped with a 150-MCD-9 detector and using a non-monochromatic Al K (1486.6 eV) X-ray source.Spectra were recorded at 175 C, using an analyzer pass energy of 30 eV, an X-ray power of 50 W and under an operating pressure of 10 -9 mbar.During data processing of the XPS spectra, binding energy (BE) values were referenced to the C1s signal (284.6 eV).Spectra treatment has been performed using the CASA software. In a typical experiment, the photocatalyst powder (25 mg) was suspended in water (25 mL) by sonication for 15 min.For some experiments, a certain amount (generally, 13 mM) of a sacrificial electron donor (e.g.Na 2 S) was dissolved in the aqueous liquid.The resulting suspension was then transferred to a cylindrical quartz reactor (diameter 44 mm, volume 50 mL, equipped with a gas inlet valve, a gas outlet valve and a pressure gauge) and purged with the desired gas (generally CO 2 , 5 mL min -1 for 15 min, and then pressurised-depressurised to 1.4 bar for five cycles); the reactor was finally loaded with the desired gas (1.4 bar) and tightly closed.The suspension was stirred (500 min -1 ) and irradiated with a medium pressure Hg lamp (125 W, irradiance 1.5 kW m -2 ) for 15 h; the reactor vessel was kept in a water bath at ca. 25 C throughout the experiment.After the light had been switched off, the reaction mixtures were stirred until the pressure reading had stabilised.Two different gaseous samples were taken: (g1) a 2.5 cm 3 sample which was injected on a two-channel chromatograph (Agilent 490 Micro GC, carrier gas: Ar) equipped with thermal conductivity detectors (TCD), and a MolSieve 5 A column (first channel) for the quantification of H 2 and CO, and a PoraPLOT Q column (second channel) for the quantification of CO 2 and CH 4 ; and (g2) a 50 cm 3 sample, which was then taken by collecting the entire amount of headspace gas in the reactor and further flushing with more CO 2 and injected on a three-channel chromatographic system (Varian 450-GC Rapid Refinery Gas Analyser) equipped with one TCD for the quantification of H 2 (first channel), one TCD for the quantification of CO 2 and CO (second channel), and one flame ionisation detector (FID) for the quantification of CH 4 (third channel), using Ar (first channel) and He (second and third channels) as the carrier gases.The amounts of H 2 , CH 4 and CO were averaged over the figures obtained by analyses of both gaseous samples (g1 and g2), which agreed within a standard deviation of ca.4.Moreover, two different liquid samples, obtained from centrifuged and decanted aliquots of the final suspension, were analysed as follows: (l1) a ca.0.5 g sample was diluted with ultrapure water (ca.4.5 g), acidified by addition of a 1.4 M aqueous H 2 SO 4 solution (ca.0.015 g), and analysed by liquid chromatography on a Coregel 87H column (Waters 1525 Binary HPLC Pump, injection volume 10 L, column temperature 70 C, eluent: 4 mM aqueous H 2 SO 4 , flow rate 0.7 mL min -1 ) and a refractive index detector (Waters 2410) for the quantification of formic acid; and (l2) a liquid sample was injected without any further treatment (actual injection volume 1 L) on a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies 7890A GC System) equipped with a DB-wax column (carrier gas: He, flow rate 1 mL min -1 ) and a FID, aiming at the detection of methanol.In some cases, the liquid phases of the final reaction mixtures (after separation of the catalyst) were analysed by 13 C NMR spectroscopy (75.48 MHz, 25 C, 2056 scans) on a Bruker Avance-300 spectrometer, using dimethyl sulfoxide-d 6 (dmso-d 6 ) inside a co-axial capillary tube as the reference solvent. At the end of the photocatalytic reactions performed in the presence of Na 2 S, an off-white solid floating on the liquid was observed.After allowing the suspensions to settle, the solid remained on top and could be separated by skimming.For a quantitative analysis of such solid, an extraction was performed.In a typical separation, the final suspension from the reaction catalysed by 2.0Cu-TiO 2 was mixed with tetrachloroethylene (10 mL) and the resulting colourless bottom phase further washed using the same solvent (3 2 mL).The combined organic extracts were dried by mixing with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and subsequent separation by filtration.The solvent was removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator, yielding a pale yellow solid (4.0 mg; corresponding mainly to elemental sulfur according to elemental analysis; 0.12 mmol)."

    "content": "Nanoparticulate copper-doped TiO 2 materials have been prepared by a solvo-thermal method based on the hydrolysiscondensation of a titanium alkoxyde (2-propoxide) using ethanol as the solvent and a small amount of water in order to promote the hydrolysis reaction.Copper acetate was used as the Cu precursor, and acetylacetone was added in order to form the corresponding complex.Then, the solubility of the metallic cation increases and the availability of copper to be incorporated into the nascent TiO 2 lattice is kinetically controlled.The result is the effective introduction of Cu in the as-prepared Cu-TiO 2 materials.A range of these samples, designated here as AP XCu-TiO 2 (X 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0, where X is the atomic percentage of Cu relative to the sum of Cu and Ti, and AP stands for \"as-prepared\") were synthesised in this study, in addition to an analogous material without copper (X 0.0). The thermal behaviour of AP 3.0Cu-TiO 2 was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, see Supplementary data) as a representative example.The thermal curves of this as-prepared material exhibit two steps: a first weight loss was recorded at around 80 C (most likely due to desorption of both water and residual solvents), and a second one at around 275 C (probably related to the combustion of organic moieties from acetate and acetylacetone derivatives, and corresponding to ca. 10 organic matter by weight).According to the TGA results, the AP XCu-TiO 2 materials were calcined in air at 500 C in order to remove any possible organic matter, thus, yielding the final XCu-TiO 2 (X 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0; 0.0Cu-TiO 2 designated herein also as TiO 2 for simplicity). All the prepared Cu-doped titanium dioxide materials were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD).Fig. 1(a) and(b) shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared and calcined materials, respectively.The as-prepared samples show broad diffraction peaks associated to nanocrystalline TiO 2 anatase phase (JCPDS 21-1272).The crystallite size calculated using the Scherrer equation is around 7 nm for all samples (see Table 1 for more details, and supplementary data for confirmation by transmission electron microscopy).After annealing at 500 C the anatase phase is preserved, but the peaks become sharper as a consequence of the crystallisation of any amorphous material remaining, diminution of lattice defects and crystal growth.The Scherrer calculations indicate larger, but still nanometric, crystallite sizes of around 13 nm (Table 1).In contrast to the as-synthesised materials, the patterns of the annealed Cu- doped samples show a shift towards lower 2A values in comparison to the TiO 2 reference.This is the case for the diffraction associated with the (1 0 1) planes at ca. 25.3 (see Fig. 1, bottom right).Taking into account the ionic radii of the copper and titanium ions in octahedral coordination (Cu 2 : 73 pm and Ti 4 : 60.5 pm) 31, the shift agrees with a substitutional solid solution in which Cu ions would occupy the Ti sites in the TiO 2 lattice.No peaks from CuO or Cu 2 O phases were observed.In summary, XRD data indicate that copper should occur as a dopant within the TiO 2 lattice (at least in anatase), although the occurrence of other copper species, such as copper oxides in small amounts cannot be ruled out due to limitations of the experimental technique. Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra of the Cu-TiO 2 samples.All the signals recorded correspond to the anatase phase, in good agreement with the XRD analysis of calcined samples.The spectra are characterised by intense bands at 144 cm -1 , three less intense bands at 396, 517, 639 cm -1 and a shoulder at 196 cm -1 , which correspond to the TiO 2 vibrational modes of E g , B 1g , A 1g , B 1g , and E g , symmetries, respectively 32.As in the case of XRD, the presence of CuO or Cu 2 O could not be detected by Raman, although that possibility cannot be completely ruled on the bases of these techniques due to the low copper contents of these materials. The FEG-SEM images of the annealed samples (Fig. 3) reveal that the Cu-TiO 2 materials were composed by aggregates of small nanocrystals.Therefore, a more detailed analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also performed.Characterisation of the morphology and structure of 3.0Cu-TiO 2 by HRTEM (see Fig. 4) confirmed that this material consisted of agglomerates of quasispherical nanocrystalline particles with a size of 10-15 nm, which fits well with the crystal size calculated by the Scherrer equation (see above).The planar distances of the crystalline particles measured from the HRTEM images correspond well with the distance of anatase planes (0.35 nm).No segregated copper species or particles were detected for any copper-doped samples.Furthermore, elemental mapping performed by EDX spectroscopy under scanning transmission mode, indicate a good dispersion of copper throughout the solid (see Supplementary data).These observations suggest that an effective solid solution is obtained, in good agreement with XRD and Raman data. Textural properties were studied by N 2 adsorption-desorption for the Cu-TiO 2 materials, showing BET surface areas in the 30-50 m 2 /g range with no dependence on the Cu content.As can be expected, when crystal sizes estimated by the Scherrer equation decrease, BET surface areas increase.Fig. 5 shows the DRUV-vis spectra of the different Cu-doped samples.The absorption edge shifts towards the visible region upon addition of Cu, and the band gap decreases from 3.17 to 2.98 eV when the doping level is increased from 0 to 3.The band gap shift can be attributed to the presence of Cu ions in the TiO 2 matrix introducing new energy levels to the intra-band space.The broad band between 600 and 800 nm corresponds to d-d transitions of Cu 2 in O h symmetry with a tetragonal distortion.No bands corresponding to metallic copper were observed at 580-590 nm 33343536. The newly synthesised copper-doped titania materials have also been studied by XPS.Peak positions for Cu 2p3/2 photoelectrons are listed in Table 2. Data for titania-supported copper catalysts prepared by impregnation methods ( IM 3.0Cu/TiO 2 , where the nominal weight percentage of copper is 3.0) are also included for comparison.The positions of the Cu 2p3/2 photoelectron energies are different depending on the synthetic method and on the Cu content in the case of copper-doped TiO 2 samples.In either case, only one component for such bands could be observed, indicating that Cu is present in only one oxidation state.Bands for the materials prepared by impregnation are found at higher binding energies than for the doped counterparts.For example, IM 3.0Cu/TiO 2 and 3.0Cu-TiO 2 exhibit their Cu 2p3/2 peaks at 935.4 and 934.5 eV, respectively.In principle, this suggests that the Cu-impregnated samples have more positive charge density on Cu (probably as CuO) than when in the lattice of TiO 2 .Regarding the doped samples, a decrease in binding energy is observed for decreasing copper contents.This can indicate that the positive charge density of Cu ions decreases as its population in the titania matrix decreases.However, it should be pointed out that Cu 2p3/2 signals were weak, due to the low copper contents, and the uncertainties of the corresponding binding energies might be significant.Furthermore, copper tends to reduce under the X-ray beam and thus, short accumulations were performed during the measurements. The Cu-TiO 2 materials prepared in this work have been tested as photocatalysts for the CO 2 reduction in aqueous media and under light irradiation from a UV-rich mercury lamp unless otherwise specified.The reactions were performed in the presence of different sacrificial electron donors in order to facilitate the activation of the otherwise essentially unreactive CO 2 substrate.The detected products mainly included H 2 , CO and CH 4 in the gaseous phases, and formic acid in the liquid phases.It should be noted here, though, that formic acid is expected to occur as formate in the aqueous reaction medium (pH 7) throughout the irradiations; formally, and for simplicity, we will refer to and quantify formate as its conjugated Product yields for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction under UV-rich light on 3.0Cu-TiO2.a Production rate/mol gcat -1 h -1 Liquid phase NaCl (500 mM) 3.0Cu-TiO2 -0.formic acid (on the other hand, the CO 2 /HCO 3 -and H 2 S/HS - acid-base pairs are expected to be rather equilibrated in these solutions, according to their pK a values).Production data for most of the identified products, as analysed from both gaseous and liquid phases, are listed in Table 3. It can be seen in Table 3 that no gas phase products were formed when the reaction was performed in the absence of electron donors and under Ar instead of CO 2 (entry 1).The fact that no H 2 was produced rules out the influence of the water splitting reaction under the irradiation conditions used.Also in the absence of added solutes, but under CO 2 pressure, small amounts of products (0.3 mol g cat -1 h -1 for CO or CH 4 , marginally above their detection limits, see Table 3, entry 2) were detected.Then, a series of solutes were tested, seeking the conversion of CO 2 under irradiated aqueous suspensions of 3.0Cu-TiO 2 .The possible benefits of hydroxide salts, that is, increasing the amount of the CO 2 substrate in the form of carbonate and bicarbonate anions in solution, were investigated by using NaOH as the added solute.Unfortunately, no liquid phase products were formed and only traces of CO were detected (Table 3, entry 3).Halide salts (Cl -and Br -) were also tested, resulting in the production of minor amounts of CO and H 2 , although the yields were not relevant, and no liquid phase products such as formic acid or methanol were found (Table 3, entries 4 and 5, respectively).Thus, neither hydroxides nor halides were further studied.Being a theoretically more efficient electron donor, an oxidisable sulfur-based anion, sulfide, was then considered.It was clearly observed that the presence of dissolved sulfide (Na 2 S) led to the formation of significant amounts of H 2 , HCO 2 H and low, but non-negligible, levels of CO (Table 3, entry 6).These results suggest that S 2-is a suitable electron donor for water and CO 2 reduction reactions under UV-rich irradiation on Cu-TiO 2 photocatalysts.The higher amounts (209.4 mol g cat -1 h -1 ) of H 2 formed reveal that water was more easily reduced, thus, competing with the less energetically favourable activation of CO 2 .However, it should be noted that the formation of CO 2 reduction products (HCO 2 H and CO) on 3.0Cu-TiO 2 proceeds at noticeably high rates, in excess of 25 mol g cat -1 h -1 .These yields are higher than some of the most efficient systems reported 19,20,37.In addition, the activity of the newly prepared Cu-TiO 2 photocatalysts took place in the presence of small amounts of sulfide as the only sacrificial electron donor, without the need for additional reducing agents, as observed elsewhere for ZnS photocatalysts 38. With the purpose of proving that the formate species were formed from carbon dioxide, and not from any organic contaminants on the photocatalysts, an experiment (analogous to entry 6 in Table 3) was carried out using 13 CO 2 as the gaseous substrate.After the reaction, analysis of a liquid sample by 13 C NMR confirmed the formation of H 13 COO -( 170.0ppm, as assigned according to literature data 39), in addition to the presence of H 13 CO 3 - and its precursor 13 CO 2 , whereas no signals were observed for a reaction performed under regular CO 2 (ca.1 atom 13 C).The actual 13 C NMR spectra are shown in the Supplementary data. Copper doping within the titania lattice was anticipated as an important factor regarding the photocatalytic activity of the material, since a homogenous distribution would result in both the preferential formation of isolated copper atoms and the efficient transfer of the photogenerated charges from titania.Such isolated copper atoms should become more ubiquitous and readily accesible active sites than for impregnated samples, whereby copper occurs as particles or aggregates.In order to prove the concept, the photoactivity of IM 3.0Cu/TiO 2 was tested in the presence of sulfide (Table 3, entry 7).It can be observed that the formation of CO 2 reduction products was almost completely supressed when using the Cu-impregnated material, since only a small amount of CO was produced.Formic acid was not formed, in contrast to the case of 3.0Cu-TiO 2 prepared by the solvo-thermal procedure.The photocatalytic activity of IM 3.0Cu/TiO 2 in the presence of sulfide led uniquely to the formation of H 2 at a rate (175.9mol g cat -1 h -1 ) somewhat lower than for the doped sample.Furthermore, the Cu-impregnated material did not exhibit any photoactivity in the absence of added solutes (Table 3, entry 8), in contrast to the Cudoped sample, which promotes the slow but measurable formation of CO 2 reduction products and H 2 (Table 3, entry 2). Copper-doped titania photocatalysts containing different amounts of doping metal (XCu-TiO 2 , X 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0) were then tested for the reduction of CO 2 in the presence of sulfide and under UV irradiation.The production rates of HCO 2 H, H 2 and CO are plotted vs. copper content in Fig. 6.In all cases, H 2 was the major product found, followed by HCO 2 H.Under analogous conditions, photoactivity is low for Cu contents below 1.Pure titania prepared by the same solvo-thermal method also catalyses the formation of certain amounts of H 2 and formic acid under UV-rich light, whereas a small amount (0.5) of Cu dopant in the material leads to an increase in H 2 yields and a slight decrease in formic acid production.The amounts of photogenerated products (especially those of H 2 ) experience a clear increase for higher (1) Cu doping levels (see Fig. 6).Regarding H 2 production rates, a maximum is observed for 2.0Cu-TiO 2 (313.2mol g cat -1 h -1 ).The case of formic acid is peculiar, since its production rates decrease as the titania materials become more enriched in Cu, up to a minimum (3.0 mol g cat -1 h -1 ) at 1.5, and then increase again for higher Cu doping levels, reaching values as high as 25.7 mol g cat -1 h -1 in the case of 3.0Cu-TiO 2 .The yields of CO were moderate for all materials, although they increased with increasing copper contents (2.8 mol g cat -1 h -1 when using 3.0Cu-TiO 2 ).In summary, it appears that the presence of copper plays a key role in these photocatalysts by affecting their activity and selectivity.The material containing more copper (3.0Cu-Ti) exhibits considerable H 2 production and enhanced selectivity towards formic acid.Furthermore, it should be stressed again that the local environment of copper is also crucial, since Cu-doped samples promote the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction much more efficiently than Cu-impregnated samples (see Table 3). The time course of a typical CO 2 reduction reaction in aqueous (3.0Cu)TiO 2 under UV-rich light irradiation has been monitored by analysing formic acid and hydrogen production (unfortunately, CO and sulfur species could not be quantified due to limitations of the analytical procedure using small sample volumes), as shown in Fig. 7.It was observed that formic acid is produced at fast rates during the earliest stages of the reaction, whereas H 2 formation follows a slower and steadier pace.This discovery is interesting in terms of selectivity for CO 2 reduction, which is high at short reaction times.In fact, the production rate of formic acid (i.e.formate) is noticeably high (1247 mol g cat -1 h -1 ) after only 2 h.At longer reaction times, formate species are rapidly consumed, and eventually, a steady state whereby H 2 is preferentially formed, is reached. The fate of sulfide as electron donor was also investigated.For reactions catalysed by Cu-doped titania materials, off-white insoluble solid products were observed on top of the solutions at the end of the irradiations.After sedimentation of the photocatalyst, these solids could be isolated by a simple decantation/skimming procedure (or by extraction using tetrachloroethylene for quantification purposes, as detailed in Section 2) and analysed, revealing that they were mainly composed of elemental sulfur (S n ).In the case of the reaction photocatalysed by 2.0Cu-TiO 2 , the amount of S n produced (ca.328 mol g cat -1 h -1 ) was consistent with the reduction products formed (324.4 mol g cat -1 h -1 ) according to the expected stoichiometries (formal Eqs. ( 1)-( 4) for reduction and oxidation processes, respectively). 2H The photocatalytic system reported herein allows reduction of CO 2 at significant rates and concomitant production of H 2 from water, whereas sulfide is transformed into elemental sulfur, which can be separated from the aqueous suspension by only using physical methods.This proves to be advantageous as compared to other methods by which sulfide is transformed to sulfate and/or thiosulfate 27,29.Thus, a process combining the abatement of sulfide contamination in wastewater and the light-promoted reduction of water and CO 2 can be envisaged using Cu-doped titania photocatalysts.Considering that sulfides are noxious pollutants in wastewaters, the present process represents a valorisation of this undesirable chemical by generating fuels and allowing the recovery of valuable elemental sulfur."

    "content": "The synthesis of nanoparticulate copper-doped titania photocatalysts can be achieved by a solvo-thermal method using ethanol as the solvent.The addition of small amounts of water induced the controlled hydrolysis-condensation of titanium isopropoxide in the presence of Cu 2 , thus, giving rise to Cu-TiO 2 solids composed of small anatase crystallites (12-15 nm in diameter).Copper is incorporated the bulk of the crystalline titania matrix, thus, resulting in the substitution of Ti(IV) atoms with Cu(II), with certain expansion of the anatase lattice, as evidenced by a shift in the X-ray diffraction angles of its (1 0 1) planes.The band gaps of the materials experience a slight but steady decrease with increasing Cu content, a phenomenon which confirms its homogeneous distribution throughout the structure.The effect of copper doping on the photocatalytic activity of these Cu-TiO 2 materials in the UV-induced reduction of CO 2 has been studied.Based on thorough analyses of reaction products and their yields, we have shown that copperdoped titania has the potential to enhance the formation of formic acid and CO, in the presence of sulfide as an electron donor.In addition, concomitant and significant production of H 2 (in excess of 300 mol g cat -1 h -1 ) could be achieved.Short reaction times favour the reduction of CO 2 , whereas increasing irradiation times leads to preferential H 2 formation.Given the simultaneous reduction of H 2 O and CO 2 and the consumption of sulfide, a highly undesirable and toxic pollutant, this finding is promising for combining fuel generation and environmental remediation in a clean and efficient light-activated process.
