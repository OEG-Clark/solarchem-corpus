    "content": "Ordered mesoporous silica COK-12 was prepared as described elsewhere 31.The synthesis takes place at room temperature.In a typical synthesis, 100 g of triblock copolymer P123 were dissolved in 2687.5 mL deionized water.After complete P123 dissolution, 92.1 g anhydrous citric acid and 63.5 g trisodium citrate dehydrate were added to control the synthesis pH between 4 and 5.The buffered surfactant solution was then stirred with overhead mechanical stirring for 24 h.A solution of 260 g sodium silicate and 750 mL deionized water was prepared and incorporated into the buffered micellar solution.Immediate solid formation was observed, and stirring was maintained for 5 min after which the slurry was kept for 24 h without stirring.The solid was separated from the mother liquor by vacuum filtration and thoroughly washed with deionized water, and then dried at 60 C overnight.The dry solid was then calcined at 500 C for 8 h, with a 1 C/min heating ramp to completely remove the organic templating agent. Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts containing different platinum percentages were prepared by a deposition-precipitation method, according to the one initially developed by Haruta and coworkers 36.In this procedure, different solutions were prepared, containing the appropriate amounts of the Pt precursor in 300 mL of milli-Q water.The pH of the solutions was adjusted to 9 by addition of a 0.1 M solution of NaOH.Once the pH value was stable, 2 g of TiO2 (P25, Evonik) were added under vigorous stirring.The deposition-precipitation procedure was done at 70 C, maintaining the pH constant during 2 h, and then the slurry was stirred overnight.The catalysts were washed and dried at 80 C under vacuum overnight.Samples were labeled as XPt/TiO2, where X indicates the platinum loading determined by ICP-OES in wt.. Firstly, a titania sol was prepared according to the patented procedure 37 described also in our previous article 38.Titanium isopropoxide (TTIP, 0.0492 mol) in ethanolic solution was hydrolyzed by acidic (HClO4) aqueous solution.The resulting mixture was refluxed for 48 h.After such a prolonged refluxing, a stable stock of nanocrystalline titania sol was obtained.Separately, a homogeneous silica sol was prepared from TEOS (0.017 mol), deionized water (0.11 mol) and HCl (0.183 mmol), to hydrolyze silica precursor for later condensation reactions.The nanocrystalline titania sol (4.2 mL), the silica sol (600 mL), Levasil 200/30 (1 mL), and absolute ethanol (4 mL) were gradually mixed together to give a binder sol.Finally, a mixture of XPt/TiO2 and COK-12 in 1:1 wt.proportions was suspended in the binder sol.The suspension was then placed in a cold ultrasonic bath for 10 min which promotes the infiltration of nanoparticles into the mesopores 39.It is important to mention that the amount of titanium (TTIP) in the titania/binder sol suspension is 0.0081 mol while the amount of commercial titania (P25) is 0.05 mol.It has been shown in previous studies that the effect of titania from TTIP in the titania/binder sol suspension is very low compared with commercial titania, acting only as a binder component 38.Samples were labeled as XPt/TiO2-COK-12, where X is the same as that in the corresponding XPt/TiO2 sample. Long-range ordering of the ordered mesoporous silica COK-12 was studied by small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXRD) in a Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE with a Bragg-Brentano geometry and a Lynx Eye 1D detector with CuK radiation (Bruker, Germany). Measurements were carried out between 0.5 and 6.0 2 value, with a step time of 1 s/0.0003 at 35 kV and 40 mA and with a 280 mm sample-detector distance.The patterns were analyzed using the Diffrac-Plus/EVA software from Bruker AXS.The pore structure, pore size and specific surface area were studied with nitrogen sorption analysis in a QuadraSorb Station 4 apparatus (Quantachrome, USA).Isotherms were recorded at 77 K after degassing the samples for 10 h at 200 C under vacuum.The surface area was determined using the Brunauer, Emmet and Teller (BET) method 40.The estimation of the pore size was based on NLDFT calculations using the adsorption branch of the isotherm.All nitrogen sorption data were analyzed using the Quantachrome/QuadraWin software. The crystalline phases of synthesized photocatalyst powders were examined by XRD.The XRD patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance using Cu K radiation in the range between 10 and 80o with a step size of 0.034o.The diffraction patterns were analyzed using Rietveld refinement to determine the anatase average crystallite sizes.Sample displacement and zero error have been taken into account.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the powder specimen were calculated from the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K, using a Micromeritics-Gemini chemisorption system.The diffuse reflectance UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (LAMBDA 650 UV/Vis with 150 mm integrating sphere, Perkin Elmer, USA).Indirect band-gap energies were determined from Tauc plots 41.TEM images were obtained in a JEOL 7401F microscope operated at 300 kV and at a working distance of 9 mm.The concentration of Pt in the catalyst was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Varian Inc., USA).To dissolve the platinum, a microwave method (Discover SP-D, CEM, USA) was used. Calibration of the setup was done with a commercial Pt standard solution.FTIR spectra of used catalysts were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (ThermoScientific, USA) with an ATR accessory and a DTGS detector, accumulating 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm -1 . Spectra were collected at room temperature taking the naked fiber glass support as blank spectrum. NAP-XPS spectra were acquired at the CIRCE beamline of ALBA Synchrotron, Spain.The photon energy range is 90-2000 eV and the hemispherical electron energy analyzer is a Phoibos NAP150 from SPECS that can operate at sample pressures ranging from ultra-high vacuum (UHV) up to 20 mbar.The photon energy used for the measurements was 620 eV. Photon energy calibration was done using the Au 4f level measured in a gold foil.High resolution scans (Ti2p, Pt4f, C1s and O1s) were acquired using 10 eV pass energy and 0.1 eV step size.The overall energy resolution was 225 meV.Samples were analysed under sequential conditions: UHV, CO2H2O atmosphere (7:1 molar ratio, total pressure 0.05 mbar) in the dark, CO2H2O under UV (Hamamatsu high power UV LED centred at 365 nm), and CO2H2O in the dark after reaction.Ultrapure water (LC-MS CHROMASOLV grade, Sigma-Aldrich) was introduced into the chamber through a variable high precision leak valve after being degassed by multiple freeze-pump-thaw cycles.CO2 (purity 99.995, Abello Linde) was introduced into the chamber directly from a commercial cylinder.The experiments were performed in \"static mode\", i.e. the analysis chamber was only pumped through the analyser entrance and through the photons entrance.Casa XPS software was used for data analysis.Shirley or two-point linear background subtractions were employed depending on the background shape.Peaks were fitted using GL(30) lineshapes.Known binding energies were used for charge correction: C1s spectra to adventitious hydrocarbon (285 eV) 42 and Ti2p and O1s spectra to the TiO2 characteristic signals measured by Diebold and co.(459.3 eV and 530.4 eV respectively) 43. Gas-phase CO2 photoreduction experiments were conducted in continuous-flow mode in a stainless steel reactor with an effective volume of 280 mL and provided with a borosilicate window for irradiation.A suspension of 100 mg of powdered catalyst was deposited on a glass microfiber filter, dried at 100 C under vacuum and fitted inside the reactor.UV illumination was carried out using four 6 W lamps with a maximum wavelength at 365 nm and an average irradiance of 71.7 W/m 2 .Pure CO2 and water were fed into the reaction system with a CO2:H2O molar ratio of 7. Before starting the experiments, the reactor was firstly vacuumed at 50 C and then purged with Ar (100 mL/min) for 1 h in order to remove any residual organic compounds weakly adsorbed to the surface of the catalyst.Then, CO2 and H2O were flowed in the dark for 1 h to establish an adsorption-desorption balance at the reaction temperature.Prior to illumination, the reactor was pressurized and kept at a reaction flow rate of 2 mL/min for another 1 h.All photocatalytic tests were carried out for 18 h.Control experiments under inert atmosphere (Ar) were performed following the same procedure and under the same conditions described above.The quantum yield index (QYI) was calculated as the ratio between the apparent quantum yield (AQY) with the corresponding sample and that with bare TiO2 24:"

    "content": "The ordered mesoporous COK-12 was characterized via small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXRD) and nitrogen adsorption (Figure 1).The SAXRD pattern revealed three wellresolved diffraction peaks that are indexed as (100), ( 110) and ( 200) and correspond to a P6mm hexagonal symmetry 44.Nitrogen sorption analysis revealed type IV isotherms with type H1 hysteresis, characteristic of materials with open cylindrical mesopores with a narrow pore size distribution, confirmed by the steep adsorption-desorption branches 45,46.The BET surface area is 621.3 m 2 /g and the mean pore size distribution determined by NLDFT is 6.1 nm, with a pore volume of 0.55 cm 3 /g.All analytical results confirm the characteristics of COK-12 materials 474849. The X-ray diffractograms (Figure 2) of Pt/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2-COK-12 photocatalysts confirmed that they contained anatase and rutile phases as it is well known for P25 TiO2 50. The crystallite sizes of anatase (Table 1) are also in good accordance with previously reported values 50.The slight deviations observed for the different samples must correspond to the determination uncertainty rather than to actual differences which are not to be expected from the described synthetic protocols.No Pt species were detected in XRD diagrams, which may be traced back to an ultrafine dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on TiO2 and/or its low Pt content in the samples as measured by ICP -OES (Table 1). The specific surface areas of as-prepared photocatalysts are summarized in Table 1.The pure TiO2 has the lowest surface area of 55.0 m 2 g -1 .Loading with Pt increases the surface area to around 65.7 m 2 g -1 for the largest platinum amount.It was reported that deposition of Pt nanoparticles increases the surface area of TiO2 nanoparticles 19, which may be related to the small size of Pt nanoparticles.COK-12 has a large surface area of originally 621.3 m 2 g -1 , which decreases in the samples containing titania.The effect of Pt loading on surface area can be also observed in the Pt/TiO2-COK-12 catalysts.Regarding indirect band-gap energies of the as-prepared samples, as expected, no significant deviations from the value of 3.1 eV determined for titania from Tauc plots (Supplementary Data, Figure S1) are observed upon deposition of Pt or incorporation of silica. The TEM images of samples 0.5Pt/TiO2 and 2Pt/TiO2 are shown in Figure 3.As it can be seen, Pt nanoparticles are spread all over the titania particles.The increased amount of Pt nanoparticles on the titania surface when moving from ca. 0.5 to ca. 2 wt. loading is evident from the images.But still the Pt nanoparticles are finely dispersed over the whole TiO2 support with particle sizes of around 0.5 to 1 nm. Figure 3 also shows the morphology of 0.5Pt/TiO2-COK-12 with low and high magnification, the former revealing that COK-12 has one-dimensional channels of ordered pores that are clearly identified.The pore size as determined by TEM is around 5.4 nm, in good accordance to N2 adsorption results.In this sample, it can be seen that Pt/TiO2 is dispersed on the surface and possibly inside the pore walls.However, the fraction of TiO2 nanoparticles embedded in the pores of COK-12 is difficult to measure.The Pt/TiO2 particles may block a portion of pores, which explains why the measured surface area of the samples containing Pt/TiO2 is smaller than that of pure COK-12.Aggregates of Pt/TiO2 on the outer surface of COK-12 are shown in the highmagnification image of 0.5Pt/TiO2-COK-12.Clear lattice fringes of TiO2 as well as finely dispersed Pt nanoparticles in size of around 0.5 to 1 nm can be observed. Figure 4 shows the accumulated amounts of the main reaction products over 16 h of irradiation.TiO2 led mainly to the formation of CO, together with H2 resulting from the parallel reduction of water, competing with CO2 for conduction band electrons.Methane was formed in a minor amount, and so was methanol (Figure S2).Traces of other minor products like ethanol and C2 hydrocarbons were also detected.The introduction of Pt drastically changed the situation, largely promoting the formation of methane at the expense of carbon monoxide, as well as the evolution of hydrogen, which could be expected taking into account the catalytic properties of Pt for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution 51.Thus, the deposition of 0.13 wt. of platinum resulted in a considerably larger CH4 production and smaller CO evolution, which upon increasing the Pt amount to 0.58 and 2.39 turned into practically 100 selectivity to CH4, the former producing a larger overall amount of this molecule.As described in the introduction, some works had already reported that loading of Pt lowered the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and improved the photocatalytic reduction efficiency of CO2 to methane, with an optimum loading of metal above which shading effects or excessive surface coverage occur 17181920212223. Similar results were observed in the case of the Pt/TiO2-COK-12 catalysts, in which nevertheless the effect of Pt was diluted after supporting on COK-12 when it was present in only 0.13 wt. with respect to titania, but reached a maximum in CH4 production and selectivity with 0.58 wt. as in the case of the unsupported catalysts.Among all the studied samples methanol production varied only within 10 with the different samples (Figure S2), revealing a negligible effect of both the support and the co-catalysts on this product. Irradiation experiments with P25 in an inert atmosphere (Ar) revealed that most of the CH4 production (ca.75) arose from carbon residues on the catalyst surface.In the case of the TiO2-COK-12 catalyst, notwithstanding that organic residues from the synthesis procedure of the SiO2 support are likely contributing to carbon product formation 52, the amount of CH4 in inert atmosphere decreased to 50 that found when CO2 and H2O are fed to the reactor.Therefore, the data shown in Figure 4 partially account for reaction of the carbonaceous species on the surface of the catalysts.Remarkably, in the case of the platinum-containing catalysts this contribution is in no case larger than 30 except for the case of the nonmethane-selective 0.1Pt/TiO2-COK-12, revealing that these catalysts are indeed selectively reducing CO2 to CH4.After the contributions of the reaction under inert atmosphere have been subtracted, the selectivities between CO and CH4 and the quantum yield indices shown in Figure 5 are attained. It can be concluded that the appropriate Pt content can improve the photocatalytic CO2 reduction towards CH4 formation as it was already reported 17181920212223 and, furthermore, that the selectivity can reach ca. 100 when at least 0.5 wt. Pt with respect to TiO2 is deposited on the surface of the catalyst.Supporting these Pt/TiO2 catalysts on mesoporous SiO2 (COK-12) keeps the CH4 selectivities at these Pt loadings and, as revealed by QYI values, further improves the overall photocatalytic activity of the Pt/TiO2 materials, which can be related to the additional effect of increased surface area and titania dispersion 303132333435.These properties are optimum in the case of the 0.5Pt/TiO2-COK-12 catalyst. In order to gain further insight into the reaction pathways leading to the observed selectivity to CH4 in the present samples, FTIR spectra in ATR mode were recorded on the catalysts after reaction, as depicted in Figure 6 using the optimum 0.5Pt catalysts as example. No features are observed in the CO stretching region on the P25-COK-12 sample, revealing negligible contribution to CO adsorption of these two components.In the case of the Ptcontaining catalysts, however, peaks associated to CO chemisorbed on Pt are observed.Thus, the signals at 2086 and 2116 cm -1 can be assigned to CO molecules linearly bound to Pt 0 and Pt sites, respectively 53545556.In addition, bands at wavenumbers as low as 1958 and 1943 cm -1 , like the ones observed in Figure 6, have been ascribed to CO chemisorbed on Pt sites with exceptional electron donating properties strongly interacting with the support, and tentatively assigned to Ti 3 -Pt-CO species 55,57.The presence of these CO signals after reaction in the here reported catalysts may therefore be an indication of the existence of highly reducing sites able to promote the strong adsorption and further reduction of CO to CH4. In order to shed light onto this CO-Pt interaction, NAP-XPS measurements on a 0.5Pt/TiO2 sample were conducted under irradiation in a CO2H2O atmosphere, following the sequence described in the experimental section.The survey scan of the sample at UHV (Figure S3) shows the presence of all expected elements (O, Ti, Pt and C).No other elements appear after varying the experimental conditions (Figure S2).The Ti2p region (Figure S4) displays the typical spectrum of TiO2 43 without perceptible changes during the experiment (Figure S5). A similar observation can be made regarding the Pt4f spectra (Figure S6), in which shoulders assigned to Pt species 58 appear at the high energy side of the main 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 peaks of metallic Pt 42 centered at 71.1 and 74.5 eV, respectively.These signals do not experience significant changes neither when varying the ambient conditions nor during or after the photocatalytic reaction (Figure S7).In this respect, the main signals and shoulders mentioned above would hide contributions from Pt atoms bound to chemisorbed species such as CO or carbonyl species 59.The O1s and C1s high resolution scans acquired under the sequential experimental conditions are shown in Fig. 7.At ultra-high vacuum, the main contribution to the O1s signal (O 1 component in the fitting of Fig. 7) comes from the oxygen atoms within TiO2 and has been charge corrected to the reference value of 530.4 eV 43.Two smaller structure and a larger one from OH groups adsorbed on the bridging sites of the TiO2 structure 60,61, while O 3 is assigned to the characteristic signal of terminal OH groups on the TiO2 surface 61.The binding energies of O 2 and O 3 components, however, could also be compatible with adsorbed CO2 and carbonate species 62,63, or even with different CO adsorption modes on Pt 64,65.Indeed, these two components increase their contribution to the spectrum upon introduction of CO2 and H2O in the chamber and further augment with UV irradiation.These components remain in the spectrum when the UV irradiation is turned back off, which confirms that the elements contributing to these peaks are from compounds that remain at the surface and may therefore be related to the chemisorption of these species. Additionally, two new signals O 4 (533.8eV) and O 5 (536.7 eV) appear when CO2 and H2O are present.The first of them is assigned to water adsorbed on TiO2 60,61 and the second one has been identified as CO2 gas by retracting the sample from the analysis spot and analyzing only the gas phase.In accordance with the reaction results, no gas-phase CO is observed in either the O1s or the C1s spectra 63.The C1s region in UHV conditions shows, in addition to the signal at 285 eV identified as adventitious aliphatic carbon (C 1 component in the fitting of Fig. 7), a second C 2 contribution at 286.2 eV that can be related to C-OH and related species 42.In line with the O 1s spectra, two new signals appear in the presence of CO2 and H2O: C 4 at 289.6 eV, assigned to surface carbonate species 62,63, and C 5 at 293.4 eV, identified as gas-phase CO2 by retracting the sample from the analysis spot.Upon UV irradiation, the relative contribution of the C 2 component increases by ca.25 and a shoulder appears in its high-energy side, which has been fitted as C 3 (287.2eV).These two effects are maintained even after UV irradiation ceases.In this respect, the small increase in the C 2 component could be related to chemisorbed CO in bridging mode 64,66,67, while the C 3 component binding energy is characteristic of single-site adsorbed carbon monoxide 64,66 and surface formate 62. In-situ NAP-XPS observations both in the O 1s and C 1s region are compatible, in addition to the formation of carbonate species on the surface of TiO2 in contact with CO2 and water 68,69, with a strong chemisorption of CO, as inferred from the ATR spectra, or even formate species, in the presence of TiO2-supported Pt nanoparticles.This strong adsorption could promote the total reduction of CO2 into CH4 as observed in the photocatalytic tests, preventing CO from being the main product as it is the case for bare TiO2, either unsupported"

    "content": "Pt/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2-COK-12 photocatalysts have been synthesized by a depositionprecipitation method.In photocatalytic CO2 reduction over these samples in a continuous flow photoreactor, H2, CH4 and CO are detected as major products in all cases.While carbon monoxide is the main product obtained over TiO2 regardless of the presence of the COK-12 as a mesoporous support.The addition of Pt leads to CO2 reduction towards CH4 formation, with a selectivity that reaches ca. 100 at optimum platinum loadings.Supporting the Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts on COK-12 preserves the CH4 preferential selectivity and further improves the overall activity of the Pt/TiO2 materials.After-reaction ATR-IR and in-situ NAP-XPS spectra suggest a strong adsorption of CO on highly electron donating Pt sites that favours total reduction to methane. 25 using a Controlled Evaporation and Mixing (CEM) unit.The reaction conditions were set at 2 bar and 50 C.The products of the reaction were determined on-line by a gas chromatograph (GC Bruker 450) equipped with two separation branches and two sampling loops.The first separation branch was equipped with two semicapillary columns (BR-Q Plot and BR-Molesieve5A).This branch was also equipped with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD), a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and a methanizer.The second separation branch consisted on a capillary column (CP-Sil5B) and a second Flame Ionization Detector (FID). components O 2 (531.7 eV) and O 3 (532.7 eV) are observed, which have been fitted with relatively large FWHM given the different potential contributions to the peaks.Component O 2 would contain a small contribution from an unidentified signal intrinsic to the TiO2 or supported onto mesoporous silica.This proposed reaction pathways in the presence and absence of Pt is schematically depected in Figure8.
