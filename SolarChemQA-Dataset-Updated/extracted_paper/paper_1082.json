    "content": "Co-doped ZnO/rGO CH 3 OH CO 2 a b s t r a c t ZnO (Z-1), Co-doped ZnO (Z-2), and Co-doped ZnO/rGO (Z-3) nanocomposites are successfully synthesized using a solvothermal method and investigated toward the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH.The asprepared ZnO (Z-1), Co-doped ZnO (Z-2), and Co-doped ZnO/rGO (Z-3) nanomaterials are characterized by a range of spectroscopic, imaging, and thermal techniques, including X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, thermogravimetry analysis-differential thermal calorimetry, UVeVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron micrograph.It was found that Z-3 presented a higher CH 3 OH rate of 30.1 mmol/g compared with Z-2 (27.3 mmol/g) and Z-1 (7.5 mmol/g).Enhanced catalytic activity of Z-3 over other samples was because of the combined effect of the amount of Co, reduced graphene (rGO), and surface area (10.62 m 2 /g).Theoretical calculation revealed that photocatalytic activity has some relationship with the E LUMO 14 A2.922 eV (doped ZnO).The results can not only provide an important indication about the influence of Co and rGO on the activity of CO 2 photoreduction over ZnO but also demonstrate a strategy for tuning the CO 2 photoreduction performance.Our work may lay the groundwork for directing the future design of efficient metal-modified ZnO photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction."

    "content": "Zinc acetate dihydrate (98, Merck), cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (99.5, Fluka Chemika), and graphite flakes (99.9,Alfa Aesar) were purchased and used for photocatalyst preparation.Deionized water (DI) was used throughout the experiment.As and when required, pH adjustments were achieved through 0.1 M HCl and 0.1 M NaOH.DI was used throughout the experiment. The synthesis of ZnO and Co-doped ZnO nanoparticles was prepared by using the procedure reported by Hammad et al. 36 with some modifications.In the synthesis of Z-1, Zn(CH3CO2)22H2O (2.5 g) was dissolved in 50 mL (water: methanol 4:1 v/v) containing NaOH (3.0 mmol) to give a clear and transparent solution.The solution was sonicated for 10 min and then heated to 70 C for 12 h.The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water, and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 80 C for 3 h. To fabricate Co-doped ZnO (Z-2), Co(CH3CO2)24 H2O (0.9 g) was added dropwise to a solution of Z-1 described previously to give a light blue precipitate.To synthesize cobalt-doped ZnO/rGO (Z-3), 0.1 g of dispersed graphene oxide GO (0.1 g) in water: methanol (4:1 v/v) was added dropwise to solution of Z-2 at 70 C for 24 h.GO was synthesized by modified hummer's method 37.The resulting precipitate was filtered and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol to remove excess chemical species formed during synthesis.Finally, all samples were annealed at 500 C for 1 h.The images of synthesized Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 is presented in Fig. S1. The solid reflectance spectra of Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 were recorded on a Shimadzu UVeVis-DRS Spectrophotometer UV-3100 with an MPCF-3100 sample compartment with samples mounted between two quartz discs, which fit into a sample holder coated with barium sulfate.The spectra were recorded over the wavelength range of 800e250 nm, and the scans were conducted at a medium speed using a 20 nm slit width. The Tauc and Devis-Mott equation 38 was used to probe the optical band gap energy of photocatalysts from UVeVis absorption spectroscopy.The equation is expressed as follows Eq. ( 1): where a is the absorption coefficient, hn is the incident photon energy, A is the proportionality constant, E g is the optical band gap energy, and n represent the nature of electronic transition (n 14 1/2 for direct transition).The FT-IR spectra for all samples were acquired in a single mode with a resolution of 4 cm A1 , in the region from 4000 to 400 cm A1 and at an average of 32 scans using a Bruker Tensor 27 platinum ATR-FTIR spectrometer.X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was done at room temperature on a Bruker D2 powder X-ray diffractometer using Co radiation with a Lynxeye detector.A scan range of 5e70 2 at 0.02 per step was used.XRD data analyses and Rietveld refinement were done using Topas V6 software.Scanning Electron Micrograph (SEM) of sample coated with a thin film of gold were obtained on a JOEL 7001f analytical scanning electron microscope.Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) images were collected using a Zeiss Libra 120 equipment working at 10 keV accelerating energy and 50 pA beam current.BrunauereEmmetteTeller (BET) surface area and pore size distribution were measured using Micrometrics TriStar II 3020 Surface Area Analyzer.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were measured using a Perkin Elmer STA 6000 with a thermocouple sensor Pt-Pt/Rh, samples (Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3) was loaded unto crucible pan.A heating range of 50e900 C with a flow rate of 30 mL/min and at a constant heating rate of 20 C/min was used for all the dried fine samples.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al K a source (1486.6 eV).The base pressure of the system was below 3 A 10 A7 Pa.XPS experiments were recorded with 75 W power source using hybrid-slot spectral acquisition mode and an angular acceptance angle of 20 .Kratos version 2 program was used for XPS data analysis, and fitting carried out using a Gaussian line shape. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 over the ZnO-based nanocomposites (Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3) was conducted in double-wall cylindrical quartz photocatalytic reactor equipped with a stirrer and thermometer.NaOH (0.01 M) was added into the system, and 0.10 g of photocatalyst (ZnO, Co-doped ZnO, and Co-doped ZnO/rGO) was uniformly dispersed into the reaction cell with 250 mL H 2 O.This was immediately followed by purging the above system with CO 2 for 30 min.After that, the reactor is irradiated by a high-pressure Xe lamp (400 W), and the photoreaction temperature is maintained at room temperature.The progress of the reaction was monitored by means of gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID).At regular time intervals (30 min), aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction cell, filtered using 0.54 mm filter, and analyzed by GC-FID using Zebron Phenomenex ZB-5MSi capillary column (30 m A 0.25 mm A 0.25 mm), and helium gas as carrier gas. DFT calculation was performed using Gaussian09 quantum chemistry package 39 with the hybrid functional (B3LYP) and double-zeta (LanL2DZ) basis set and accounting for aqueous solvent effects via the conductor-like polarizable continuum model 40.We performed geometry optimization of model clusters with a slight deviation from the ZnO stoichiometry to avoid the problem of the surface states in the gap.The unit cell of ZnO was taken from the American Mineralogists Database\" Web page (http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS/minerals/Zincite)41.For the Z-2, one cobalt atom substitutes a Zn atom as an impurity state in the Z-1; impurity state introduces a hole inside the band gap.The adsorption behavior of CO 2 on ZnO (Z-1) and Co-doped ZnO (Z-2) was defined by means of adsorption energy, which is , where E ads is the total energy of the catalyst (Z-1 or Z-2) with CO 2 adsorbed on the surface, E(CO 2 ) is the total energy of free CO 2 , and E(Z-1 or Z-2) is the total energy of the sample.Thus, a negative E ads value corresponds to exothermic adsorption.The more negative the E ads , the stronger the adsorption 35."

    "content": "The UVeVis absorption spectra of Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 are shown in Fig. 1A.UVeVis of Z-1 presented a maximum absorption peak at l z 360 nm, which can be ascribed to the intrinsic band gap absorption of ZnO for the electron transition from the valence band to the conduction band (O 2p / Zn 3d ) 14.The slight shift in wavelength confirmed a change in the chemical environment of wurtzite ZnO when doped with cobalt, new bands at l z 562, 610, and 658 nm confirms the presence of cobalt (Co 2 ) in a tetrahedral/ octahedral environment (Z-2) 20.Absorption spectrum of Z-3 also confirms the presence of cobalt (weak band at l z 627 nm) in the composite (Fig. 1A). The band gap energy (E g ) of the composite samples was calculated from Tauc's equation, which assumes the relationship between absorption coefficient (a) and photon energy (hy).E g value of Z-3 (2.99 eV) was lower than those of Z-1 (3.10 eV) and Z-2 (3.06 eV).The reduction in energy band gap was attributed to an increase in charge carrier concentration, which can be explained by the interaction exchange between sp-d and d electrons in Co 2 ions when doped into ZnO lattice 42.High electron mobility of rGO (Z-3) also contributes to further reduction in band gap 43. The FT-IR of Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 are presented in Fig. 2. ZneO stretching vibration was clearly observed from 465 to 480 cm A1 for all ZnO samples (Fig. 2).The presence of weak to low bands of OeH bending at 1650 and 1602 cm A1 as well as the corresponding OH stretching bands at 3396 cm A1 , 3450 cm A1 in ZnO (Z-1) and Codoped ZnO (Z-2), respectively, suggests the presence of adsorbed water molecules.Co-doped ZnO/rGO (Z-3) showed strong OeH stretching at 3410 cm A1 , CC vibrations of aromatics at 1400 cm A1 , ZneOeC stretching at 1060 cm A1 , and CeOH stretching at 1150 cm A1 suggest the presence of hydroxyl, carboxyl, and oxygenate functional groups.The ZneOeC band confirms the interaction of Zn and carbon atoms of GO 43,44.The spectrum confirmed the presence of GO.Peak at 475 cm A1 can be ascribed to the stretching vibration of ZneO 44. Figs. S2aec reports a typical DSC/TGA curves of Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 heated from 70 C to 900 C. TGA curves show that all the composites (Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3) follow three degradation steps.In the TGA isothermal curve of Z-1, the first step with a weight loss of (6) is because of the removal of oxygen-containing groups such as H 2 O species at about 130 C. The decomposition of organic matter (CH 3 COO A ) and hydroxide groups, resulting in the formation of ZnO (Fig. S2a), is because of the second and third weight losses of 12 (around 280 C) and 4 at 445 C, respectively.The DSC curve of Z-1 (ZnO) shows broad endothermic peak, which comprises of loss of volatile molecules, formation of ZnO 46.For Z-2, weight loss occurring at 115, 295, and 380 C was attributed to the decomposition of chemically adsorbed water species, organic matters, and hydroxide groups.DSC isotherm curve of Z-2 revealed three endothermic peaks, which are in good agreements with the three decomposition steps observed in the TGA curve.In the TGA curve of Z-3, the first decomposition step with a weight loss of 6 was because of the removal of oxygen-containing groups followed by the release of CO X and H 2 O species around 130 C 47.The second (18) and third (12) step at 280e450 and 583 C was attributed to the removal of organic matter/hydroxide groups and GO combustion 14 (Fig. S2c).The DSC curve of Z-3 revealed broad peak with weak endothermic peaks at 245 and 290 C attributed to loss of volatile surface molecules adsorbed 14. The EDX of Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 samples are shown in Figs.S3aec.Peaks at 1.2, 8.7, and 9.6 KeV corresponds to theoretical L a , K a , and K b values of Zn, whereas O peak is at 0.6 KeV in Z-1.Fig. S3b revealed the presence of cobalt, zinc, and oxygen as constituent elements in Z-2.Peaks corresponding to theoretical L a (1.2 KeV), K a (8.7 KeV), and K b (9.6 KeV) values of Zn, O (0.6 KeV), Co La (0.7 KeV), Ka (7.0 KeV), and Kb (7.5 KeV) were observed.Generally, the EDX spectrum of Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 composite (Figs.S3aec) shows the presence of Zn, Co, O, and C in the material composition, which confirms the successful formation of ZnO (Z-1), Co-doped ZnO (Z-2), and Co-doped ZnO/rGO (Z-3) 14,45,48.As shown in Table 1, the introduction of GO increased the quantity of carbon (C) in Z-3.Table 2 shows that the inclusion of cobalt to Z-1 resulted in a decrease of Zn (wt) in Z-2 (38.36) and Z-3 (28.23), respectively.The ratio of Co to Zn also increased in Z-3 compared with Z-2 (Table 1).Sulfur in the EDX spectrum of Z-3 originates from the use of H 2 SO 4 during GO synthesis. The morphologies and crystalline natures of Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 are characterized by SEM and TEM (Figs. 3 and4).ZnO morphology was different on Co-doped ZnO and Co-doped ZnO/rGO samples, and it is common with ZnO modifications 14.SEM image (Fig. 3AeC) reveals that Z-1 is consists of a non-uniformeshaped agglomerated material with sizes in the range of 2e14 mm. Agglomerated non-uniform particles with a diameter range of 47e53 nm were also indicated by the TEM image of Z-1 in Fig. 4A.Composite of Z-2 are less agglomerated with more uniform shapes and sizes in the range of 2e12 mm.The TEM image of Z-2 (Fig. 4B) is a nearly spherical agglomerated material with a diameter range of 7e11 nm.The agglomeration gradually decreases with an increase in cobalt concentration.The morphology on Z-3 shows a slightly smoother (sheet-like) surface material compared with Z-1 and Z-2, which could be because of the presence of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets (Fig. S4).As a result of the strong hydrophilic nature of rGO because of the plurality of oxygen-containing groups responsible for the electrostatic attractions of ZnO and Co to rGO surface, the morphology of Z-3 appeared to be largely less aggregated 15.Highly dispersed nanoparticles were observed in the TEM image of Z-3, and the dimensions are within 23e49 nm range (Fig. 4C).TEM images of Z-1, Z-2, GO, and Z-3 are presented in Fig. S4. The BET measurements are performed on Z-2 and Z-3, and their specific surface areas (average pore sizes) are 9.98 mfoot0/ g (57.15 A) and 10.62 m 2/ g (55.72 A), respectively.The presence of rGO as a supporting layer in Z-3 increased its specific surface area 14,49,50.The slight decrease in porosity of Z-3 may be because of the anchoring of Z-2 anchoring on rGO 51.The N 2 adsorptionedesorption plots of Z-2 and Z-3 show type IV with H 2 hysteresis loops and type II with H3 hysteresis loops, respectively 14,52,53.Z-2 indicates the presence of mesoporous structures, whereas Z-3 predicts macropores and slit-like pores (Fig. 5A andB) 53. The XRD patterns of Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 are shown in Fig. 6AeC.The reflections of ZnO (Z-1) in a hexagonal wurtzite lattice (JPCDS card number: 36-1451) were observed on Co-doped ZnO (Z-2) and Co-doped ZnO/rGO (Z-3) composites, indicating that ZnO particles attached onto cobalt and rGO and are highly crystalline 54.ZnO in (Z-2 and Z-3) can be described as a hexagonal close packing of Zn and O atoms in P63mc space group, with films exhibiting the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110) and (103) peaks.The general formula of Z-2 (Fig. 6B) as determined by XRD was Co 0.03 Zn 0.97 O.The introduction of Co 2 into ZnO shifts the (002 (2 14 37.8 ), 100 (2 14 40.3 ), and 101 (2 14 43.0 ) XRD peaks slightly by about 2 14 0. 15.This suggests that Co atoms are soluble in ZnO 55,56.For Z-3 composite (Fig. 6C), a weak and low-intensity diffraction peak appears around 2 14 38.1 , indicating the reduction of GO into rGO 14,49,57,58.The absence of impurities such as Zn(OH) 2 in the diffraction peaks of ZnO indicated that the samples are of high purity.The lattice parameters are shown in Table 2.As shown in Table 2, the c-axis lattice parameter of Z-2 decreased from 5.20967 (5) A to 5.1980 (15) A upon adding the dopant, indicative of Co atoms replacing zinc atoms in the ZnO lattice 56 while the introduction of rGO to Z-2 induced lattice growth. Detailed XPS spectra showing the chemical state information of Zn, Co, and O atoms are presented in Figs.7(a) and 8(a) for Z-2 and Z-3, respectively.The analyzed XPS core-level spectra of Zn2p of Z-2 show two strong peaks at 1022.5 eV and 1045.6 eV, corresponding to Zn2p 3/2 and Zn2p 1/2 states, respectively.The decrease in the binding energy of Zn 2p in Z-2 was because of the presence of Co atoms in ZnO.Z-3 shows two strong peaks at 1019.5 and 1042.6 eV, corresponding to Zn2p 3/2 and Zn2p 1/2 (Figs.7(b) and 8(b)).The shift in the binding energy position of Zn2p 3/2 and Zn2p 1/2 peaks confirmed a change in valence electron density of Zn ions on the introduction of rGO.These peak positions are closely matching with the standard value for ZnO, indicating that Zn is in 2 valence state 56.(10) of binding energies between the 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 levels is about 15.8 eV, which corresponds well with the value for Co 2 homogeneously surrounded by oxygen tetrahedra 60,61.The O1s peak at 530.03 eV corresponds to O 2 A surrounded by Zn atoms 55. Fig. 9 shows the C1s spectra of Co-doped ZnO (Z-2) and Codoped ZnO/rGO (Z-3) composites.The C1s XPS spectra of Codoped ZnO/rGO (Z-3) shows peaks located at 284.5eV (C-C bonds), 286e288 eV (C-O/CO bonds) 45.By contrast, Co-doped ZnO (Z-2) spectrum presented low carbon peaks in 286e288 eV (C-O/CO bonds) and 290.2 eV (possibly from carbonates or metal hydrocarbonates).This suggests that reduced GO was only present in Z-3. The photocatalytic activities of the obtained ZnO-based catalyst are tested for CO 2 photoreduction with H 2 O.It is found that CO 2 can be reduced into CH 3 OH in the presence of H 2 O using Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3.Table 3 shows the photocatalytic performance of ZnO (Z-1), Codoped ZnO (Z-2), and Co-doped ZnO/rGO (Z-3) catalysts under irradiation after 7 hours.It can be seen that Z-3 shows the highest photocatalytic activity among the three catalysts with CH 3 OH amount of 30.1 m mol/g; this was followed by Z-2 and Z-1, which are 27.3 m mol/g and 7.5 m mol/g, respectively, at pH 7.5.At pH 6.5, low amount of CH 3 OH was formed, and these are 5.2 m mol/g, 7.6 m mol/ g, and 13.5 m mol/g for Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3, respectively.As shown, the pH of the solution affects the photoreduction of CO 2 , majorly because of the improved solubility of CO 2 in alkaline conditions 43,46.Bicarbonate HCO 3 A species produced by reaction between CO 2 and water are more likely to adsorb on ZnO surface and react with photoinduced electron 46.In addition, it is possible that hydroxyl anions in the solution could act as strong hole scavengers and from OH radicals, thereby reducing the recombination of holeeelectron pairs, the longer decay time of surface electron will accelerate the photocatalytic reaction 35,46. The photoreduction mechanism of CO 2 over the ZnO photocatalysts is illustrated in Fig. 10.On irradiation with UV light, ZnO valence electrons excite from the VB to the CB as reported by Lui et al. 62.Positive holes are generated as shown in Fig. 10, when electrons jump to the CB (ZnO hy / ZnO (e A h )).Generated holes lead to water oxidation to produce O 62.Doped Co 2 on the ZnO traps surface electron, and therefore, it was reduced to species Co .These electrons on the species Co could be devoured by a decrease in H producing hydrogen radicals and thus reoxidizing the species Co to Co 2 (Fig. 10). According to the previously mentioned results, CH 3 OH formation is in the order of Z-3 Z-2 Z-1 (Table 3).It can be seen that catalysts with the lowest band gap, highest Co to Zn, and higher surface area presented the highest activity (Table 3).Differences in photocatalytic activities may arise from the influence of cobalt ion and rGO (light harvesting agent), which plays an important role in narrowing the band gap, to absorb more UV light resulting in higher photocatalytic activity.The surface area of Z-3 was slightly higher than that of Z-2.The large surface area also provides more active sites and reaction centers for the photoreduction of CO 2 , thus improving photocatalytic activity.Studies have shown that ZnO-based photocatalysts have been used to photo catalytically reduce CO 2 to CH 3 OH 63,64. In this study, the yield of methanol was compared with the literature data as tabulated in Table 4.Because of the different catalyst preparation method and reaction conditions, an exact comparison cannot be made; however, we could conclude that the production of methanol was influenced by electronic properties of the catalysts 63. The optimized lattice constants of ZnO were calculated to give average ZneO bond length of 1.992 A, which are very close to the experimental data with average ZneO bond length of 2.004 A 41 (a 14 3.2494 A; b 14 3.2494 A; c 14 5.2038 A; Fig. 11A).On doping with Co (replacing one atom of Zn with Co), average ZneO bond length in the range of 1.975e2.005A was observed, thus confirming the distorting of the ZnO structure (Fig. 11B).The result also showed that lattice shrinkage was induced when the Co ion substituted the Zn ion in ZnO crystal lattice, thus confirming the experimental data. The ionization potential (I), electron affinity (A), chemical potential (m), electronegativity (c), global hardness (h), global softness (S), and global electrophilicity (u) values were calculated using the HOMO and LUMO energy values as follows (Table 5).The HOMO energy (E HOMO ) is related to ionization potential (I) by Koopman's theorem and LUMO energy (E LUMO ) is related to electron affinity (A) 65 by the following relations: Electron affinityA Absolute electronegativity (c) is related to average value of HOMO and LUMO energies defined by Mulliken 66. The softness (S) is reciprocal of the hardness (h) 67. Global hardness; h 14 Global softness; S 14 1 h Parr et al. 68 defined global electrophilicity index (u) Relative Pressure (P/Po) 0,0 0,2 0,4 Electrophilicity index where m is the chemical potential takes the average value of ionization potential (I) and electron affinity (A) 69. For Z-1, Zn and O atoms on the edges contribute HOMO and LUMO orbital energies (Fig. S5), whereas Z-2, electron-rich O atoms contribute the HOMO and LUMO originate mainly around the Co atom (Fig. S6).The HOMOs and LUMOs are not pure but mix (most (lesser, greater) among the catalysts, thus confirming its reactive nature.ZnOeCo (Z-2) possessed higher electronegativity value (c 14 3.413 eV) than Z-1; hence, it is the best electron acceptor (Table 5). The HOMOALUMO gap Z-1 (CO 2 eZnO) and CoeZnO (CO 2 eCoeZnO) were 4.886 eV and 3.982 eV, respectively (Figs.S7 andS8).Thus, indicating that the later (CO 2 eCoeZnO) was involved in a higher electron mobility compared with the former (CO 2 eZnO). DFT studies confirm that CO 2 binds more with CoeZnO as its structure transforms from linear (observed for CO 2 eZnO; Fig. 12A) to bent CO 2 structure (Fig. 12B The atomic charges of photocatalysts are calculated by the Mulliken method 73 and are given in Table 6.This was carried out by measuring the partial charges of atoms such as Zn (in ZnO and Co-doped ZnO), Co (in Co-doped ZnO), O (in ZnO, Co-doped ZnO, and CO 2 ), and C (CO 2 ) before and during interaction.Atomic partial charges of Zn and O in Z-1 and Z-2 changed slightly upon interacting with CO 2 , thus confirming that charge transfer did occur between CO 2 and Z-1 (Z-2) during the adsorption of CO 2 .As can be seen, charge of O in (Z-1 CO 2 , which range from A0.439 to A0.562) is higher than O charge of Z-2 CO 2 atom (A0.221 to A0.258).Hence, the O atom (Z-1 CO 2 ) shows high ability for coordination via O atom because of its increased negative charge.This suggests the possibility of forming activated CO 2 coordinated to ZnO via O atom, whereas C atom (Z-2 CO 2 ) is responsible for coordination because of the decrease in charge (from 0.568 to 0.325).Furthermore, partial charge on the cobalt atom (in Z-2) decreased from 0.434 to 0.220 upon interacting with CO 2 , thus suggesting a transfer of electron occurred from CO 2 to Z-2.This study shows that doped metal plays a significant role in facilitating electron charge transfer/mobility.The doping of Co in ZnO created some level of changes to the lattice of ZnO crystal as indicated by DFT and XRD parameters.Furthermore, it also resulted in the reduction of band gap energy levels between the valence and conduction bands (a reduction from Z-1 3.10 eV to Z-2 3.06 eV).The doping effect influenced CO 2 adsorption energies, which have been described as responsible for the catalyst reactivity.It is evident that the photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction in water was higher in the presence of Co-doped ZnO (Co:Zn 14 0.0047) than undoped ZnO.The theoretical calculations modeling may provide fundamental understanding of how doping level and sites influence CO 2-adsorption energies (photocatalytic activity) as well as give advanced catalyst preparation insights for selectivity optimization."

    "content": "A series of ZnO-based composite materials with different morphologies was prepared by a solvothermal method.The photocatalysts were successfully tested for the reduction of CO 2 to methanol.The UVevis analysis showed the presence of new bands in the visible region (562e650 nm) after the deposition of cobalt into Z-1.Band gaps of 3.10 eV (Z-1), 3.06 eV (Z-2), and 2.99 eV (Z-3) were obtained for the composite materials.SEM and TEM imaging confirmed materials with amorphous morphology with particles in the nanorange.Z-2 and Z-3 are able to produce more methanol compared with Z-1 because of the presence of Co 2 ions and rGO on ZnO, which is confirmed from EDX, PXRD, and XPS analyses. However, the highest yield of methanol was found to be 30.1 mmol/ g cat after 7 h of irradiation with Z-3.Therefore, it is confirmed that cobalt(II) ions and rGO play essential roles during the photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH.Theoretical studies via DFT revealed that doping ZnO with Co 2 ions facilitated the formation of adsorbed carbonate or CO 2 -species on the Z-2 surface.We envisage that this work will pave the path for future research of systematic tailoring of material properties for desired photocatalytic and optical applications.

Optimized structures of CO 2 molecule adsorbed on (A) Z-1 (CO 2 eZnO) and (B) CoeZnO (CO 2 eCo-Z-1) at B3LYP/LanL2DZ.Possible CO 2 adsorption onto Z-1 and Z-2 surfaces via Zn (ZnO)eO (CO 2 ), and C (CO 2 )eCo (Co:ZnO) were observed. Qualitative atomic percentage of Zn and Co in Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 composites. Lattice parameters of ZnO composite samples. Photocatalytic performance of Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 for CO 2 reduction.The catalyst reactivity varies with the modeled structures.The lowest value of the potential ionization (3.716 eV) for ZnO (Z-1) confirms that it is the better electron donor, and the largest value of the affinity (A 14 2.922 eV) for ZnOeCo (Z-2) confirms that it is the better electron acceptor.The value of u for ZnO (Z-1; u 14 3.799 eV) Photocatalytic performances of synthesized ZnO composites with those reported previously for CO 2 reduction. Quantum chemical descriptors of ZnO (Z-1) and ZnOeCo (Z-2). The Mulliken atomic charges of CO 2 and photocatalyts calculated with B3LYP/LanL2DZ method. at 778.8eV and the Co2p 1/2 peak at 794.5 eV for Z-2, whereas peaks 779.6 eV and 795.3 eV correspond to Co2p 3/2 and Co2p 1/2 for Z-3, respectively.This shift of Co peaks suggests that Co was incorporated into the ZnO lattice59.Furthermore, the difference The authors would like to appreciate the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa (TTK170422228302) for funding the project.The authors also acknowledge the Center for High Performance Computing (Cape Town, South Africa) for providing the platform for DFT studies.
