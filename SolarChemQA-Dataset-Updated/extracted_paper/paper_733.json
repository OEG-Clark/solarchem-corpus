    "content": "However, many works are conducted under high CO2 concentration, research on CO2 photoreduction under atmospheric concentration remains rare.Here, CoAl-Layered Double Hydroxide (CoAl-LDH) nanosheets have been synthesized as a platform to explore lowconcentration CO2 photoreduction.The CoAl-LDH nanosheets exhibit efficient photocatalytic activity for CO2 photoreduction of atmospheric concentration (400 ppm) to CH4 under simulated solar light and proceed without deactivation after 55 hours.A CH4 production rate of 4.3 molg -1 h -1 is achieved without the assistant of any sacrificial agent or noble metal.CO2 adsorption experiments show that CoAl-LDH nanosheets exhibit an adsorption capacity of 2.95 cm 3 g -1 , which is about two times than that of P25 with a comparative specific surface area.XPS analysis indicates that CH4 generation relates closely to the divalent cobalt and the CH4 yield decreases sharply when the divalent cobalt is oxidized, which could likely be ascribed to the divalent cobalt for dissociating water to release H for hydrogenation of the intermediates through further experimental analysis.This work emphasizes the importance of alkaline OH group for the efficient adsorption of low-concentration CO2 and reveals the unique property of the divalent cobalt for CO2 photoreduction."

    "content": "All reagents were of analytical purity and received from Shanghai Chemical Company without further purification.CoAl-LDH nanosheets were synthesized in a simple co-precipitation method.Typically, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (0.582 g, 2 mmol) and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (0.375 g, 1 mmol) were dissolved in de-ionized water (20 mL) (noted as solution A).Stirring the solution for 15 min.Sodium hydroxide (0.24 g, 6 mmol) and anhydrous sodium carbonate (0.053 g, 0.5 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water (20 mL) with stirring (noted as solution B).Then solution A was added dropwise into solution B and the suspension was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave (50 mL), sealed and heated at 110 o C for 9 h.The products were filtered and washed thoroughly with de-ionized water and dried in vacuum oven at 60 o C. The crystallinity of the as-prepared catalyst samples was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Rigaku D/MAX 2250 V diffractometer using monochromatized Cu K ( 0.15418 nm) radiation while the voltage and electric current were held at 40 kV and 100 mA.The morphologies and microstructures characterizations were performed on the transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F, accelerating voltage 200 kV).UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples were obtained on an UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3010).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALAB 250, Thermo Scientific Ltd. with a 320 m diameter spot of monochromated aluminum K X-rays at 1486.6 eV under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions.FTIR spectra presented in this work were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer.In situ infrared spectra presented in this work were recorded on a NICOLET iS10 apparatus with a cavity (about 20 cm 3 ) for adjusting atmosphere.The Raman spectra were recorded on a Horiba LABRAM HR, with a 532 nm excitation laser line.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution were measured by a surface area and pore size analyzer (V-sorb 2008 P, Gold APP). The experiments of gas-phase CO2 photoreduction with H2O on CoAl-LDH nanosheets were carried out in a closed pyrex cell (600 mL) with a quartz window.First, CoAl-LDH powder (30 mg) was sprinkled on bottom of the pyrex cell.Water (0.5 mL) was then sprayed around the catalyst.Prior to the irradiation of a Xe lamp (500 W), the cell was purged with dry nitrogen, followed by injection of CO2 (0.25 mL, about 400 ppm).The gaseous products (CO, CH4) were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Tianmei 7890) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).The H2 product was analyzed by a GC (Tianmei 7890II) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The electrochemical analysis was performed on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China) using a standard three-electrode quartz cell with a working electrode, a platinum slice as the counter electrode, and a standard saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in saturated KCl as the reference electrode.To make a working electrode, catalyst powders were deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate by coating.Briefly, 10 mg of catalyst was suspended in 1 mL ethanol solution and the mixtures were ultrasonically scattered for 15 min.Then, 100 L of above slurry was coated on the FTO glass.After natural evaporation of ethanol, the catalyst coated on FTO substrate was used as the working electrode.The area (S) for the coating layer is about 0.8 cm 2 , while the thickness (L) is about 0.02 cm.The electrical resistivity () is calculated by RS / L, where R could be measured by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).During the measurements, the electrolyte of 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH 7) was utilized. In order to accurately characterize the CO2 adsorption capacity of catalysts under the experimental environment, CO2 adsorption measurements were conducted in a closed pyrex cell (600 mL).Typically, the cell was purged with dry nitrogen for half an hour, followed by injection of CO2 (0.25 mL), then the CO2 concentration was detected (noted as N0) by gas chromatograph to obtain the ratio K between the amount of CO2 and the CO2 concentration (The detected CO2 concentration by gas chromatograph keeps a linear relationship with the amount of injected CO2).Control experiments were conducted when catalysts (30 mg) were sprinkled on bottom of the pyrex cell, followed by injection of CO2 (0.25 mL), then the CO2 concentration was detected (noted as N1).The CO2 adsorption capacity could be obtained by the formula A (N0 -N1) K.The experiments were repeated for three times to ensure the veracity.

    "content": "CoAl-LDH nanosheets have been prepared by a simple coprecipitation method.TEM images (Figure 1A-1C) show that the CoAl-LDHs possess a hexagonal sheet-like morphology with a lateral size of about 80 nm and a thickness of about 18 nm.From the SAED pattern in Figure 1D, hexagonally arranged spots are observed and the corresponding spots could be allotted to (012) and (110) planes of CoAl-LDH.The EDS profile of CoAl-LDH nanosheets (Figure S1) indicates the presence of Co, Al, O elements, and the elemental mapping exhibits a relatively uniform distribution of these constituent elements. Powder XRD data (Figure 2A) shows the product to be a typical rhombohedral structure with the lattice parameters of ab0.306nm and c2.263 nm (ab2d110, c3d003). 22The Bragg reflections in the XRD could be indexed as ( 003), ( 006), ( 012), ( 110), ( 113) and (116), respectively, which are consistent with those of well-known LDH materials. 23To analysis the surface and interior structure of CoAl-LDH nanosheets, FT-IR spectra and Raman spectra were exploited.As shown in Figure 2B, the broad strong absorption band around 3430 cm -1 is attributed to the stretching vibrations of surface hydroxyl groups and interlayer water molecules, indicating that hydrogen bonds with a wide range of strength existed, while the weak band centered at 1628 cm -1 is due to the bending mode of water. 24he absorption band at 1358 cm -1 , 1038 cm -1 , 808 cm -1 could be assigned to 3 mode (asymmetric stretching), 1 mode (symmetric stretching), 2 mode (out-of-plane deformation) of the carbonate, respectively. 25, 26 Although the 1 mode is IRinactive in the free carbonate, it becomes activated owing to the lowing of symmetry of carbonate anion in the interlayer. 26he band remained in the low-frequency region could be interpreted as the lattice vibration modes, such as 617 cm -1 , 547 cm -1 , 427 cm -1 corresponding to the Co-OH stretching, O-Co-O stretching, Al-OH stretching, respectively. 24, 25 As for the Raman spectra (Figure 2C), the broad band around 3480 cm -1 is attributed to the H-banded stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups of the brucite-like sheets, analogous to the infrared spectra.The sharp band at 1056 cm -1 is assigned to in-plane OH bending vibrations, with a second band at a slightly lower Raman shift of 1044 cm -1 assigned to 1 mode of the carbonate. 25With regard to the low frequency region lower than 1000 cm -1 , the bands at 545 cm -1 and 508 cm -1 stems from Al-OH vibrations, while the band centered at 153 cm -1 could be due to the framework vibrations. 27he specific surface area and porosity property of the CoAl-LDH nanosheets were studied by nitrogen Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (Figure 2D), which shows a type IV isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesopores.The sample illustrates a wide pore-size distribution in the range of 2-200 nm and a high surface area of 37.7 m 2 g -1 .The high specific surface area of CoAl-LDH nanosheets is expected to be in favor of CO2 uptake and to provide more active sites, so as to improve the photocatalytic activity. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of CoAl-LDH nanosheets is displayed in Figure S2.The absorption peak around 500 nm corresponds to the 4T1g(F)4T1g(P) transition of Co 2 octahedrally coordinated by weak-field ligands, while the peak around 600 nm could be due to the 3A2g(F)3T1g(F) transition arising from spin-orbit coupling. 28The UV absorption around 230 nm may stem from ligand to metal charge transfer within the CoAl-LDH layer.The associated Tauc plot (Figure 3A) reveals that the optical band gap for CoAl-LDH nanosheets is 2.1 eV. 15,21o determine the positions of band edge related to redox potentials of CO2 photoreduction, electrochemical experiment for Mott-Schottky plot was performed to measure the flat-band potential (Efb) of CoAl-LDHs.As shown in Figure 3B, the negative slope of the plot indicates that CoAl-LDH is a characteristic ptype semiconductor.The Efb of CoAl-LDH measured from the intercept of the axis with potential value is 0.66 V vs NHE (0.42 V vs SCE) at pH 7. Generally, the position of Efb is considered to be about 0.3 V above the top of the valence band (Evb) for the p-type semiconductor whose electrical resistivity is in the range of 10 3 -10 4 cm, while the electrical resistivity of CoAl-LDH is calculated to be about 910 3 cm (Figure 3C, RS / L, R 230 , S 0.8 cm 2 , L 0.02 cm). 29,30Therefore, the Evb of CoAl-LDH is supposed to be 0.96 V vs NHE, and the corresponding conduction band (Ecb) is then calculated to be about -1.14 eV vs NHE according to the band gap (2.1 eV).As can be seen in Figure 3D, the positions of the conduction band edge and the valence band edge sit astride the redox potentials of CO2 reduction and water oxidation, indicating the feasibility of CO2 photoreduction for CoAl-LDH nanosheets. To exclude the possible influence of environmental contaminations on photocatalysts and the reaction equipment, photocatalysts in closed pyrex cell were first illuminated for three hours without injecting water and CO2 to affirm no CO and CH4 product was released before measuring photocatalytic activity.Blank experiment was conducted with CoAl-LDH nanosheets in the absence of CO2 under photoillumination.Neither CO nor CH4 was detected, confirming CO2 was indeed the carbon source (Figure S3, S4).Another control experiment was done without either illumination or CoAl-LDH nanosheets, no products were detected, indicating that both the light irradiation and CoAl-LDH nanosheets were necessary for CO2 photoreduction.The predominant reaction product was CH4, whose yield as a function of irradiation time is plotted in Figure 4A.Meanwhile, a small amount of CO and H2 were also detected (Figure S5).Interestingly, the yield of CO and H2 became balanced after several hours of reaction and did not increase anymore, which might indicate that it reached an equilibrium between the production rate and consumption rate.The CH4 yield gradually increased with the reaction time and reached an overall value of 238 molg -1 in 55 hours (corresponding to approximately 4.3 molg -1 h -1 ), which was efficient for a pure semiconductor without any modifications, and the average CH4 formation rate of CoAl-LDH nanosheets (4.2 molg -1 h -1 ) was 13 times higher than that of P25 (0.3 molg -1 h -1 ) for five hours' reaction (Figure S6, supporting information).The CH4 selectivity for CO2 conversion reached 92 (selectivity NCH4 / N(CH4CO) 100) in 55 hours, while the CH4 selectivity for whole reduction products was calculated to be 77 (selectivity NCH4 / N(CH4COH2) 100).Table S1 (supporting information) summarizes the activities of some widely used semiconductor catalysts.It can be seen that CoAl-LDH nanosheets are of high efficiency for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4.More importantly, the CO2 photoreduction activity did not show any significant loss even after 55 hours, indicating the good photostability of CoAl-LDH nanosheets.Besides, CoAl-LDH nanosheets were conducted for five cycles of repetition test (Figure 4B), the CH4 generation rate remained almost unchanged, which confirms the stability further. So the question is why the CoAl-LDH nanosheets exhibited high activity for photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 under lowconcentration CO2 atmosphere.The origins are considered to derive from the surface alkaline OH groups for efficient adsorption of low-concentration CO2 and the divalent cobalt for dissociating water to release hydrogen for the hydrogenation process of the intermediates, which will be discussed in detail in this section. To accurately present the CO2 adsorbing capacity of the catalysts in the experimental environment, CO2 adsorption measurements were conducted in the closed pyrex cell used for photocatalytic reaction.As shown in Figure 5, CoAl-LDHs exhibited an admirable adsorption capacity of 2.95 cm 3 g -1 , which was about two times than that of P25 (1.55 cm 3 g -1 ) with a comparative specific surface area (50 m 2 g -1 ), indicating the efficient adsorption of low-concentration CO2 for CoAl-LDHs.The experiments were repeated for three times to ensure the veracity.Table 1 shows that the measured values kept almost the same, and the standard deviation of CO2 adsorption capacity was much smaller than the CO2 adsorption capacity, manifesting the reliability of the experimental method.In addition, some other LDHs were conducted on CO2 adsorption experiments as well, and all of them exhibited good adsorption of CO2 molecules (Figure S7), probably due to the surface OH groups. In situ FT-IR spectra were implemented to investigate CO2 adsorption further.First, the spectrum for CoAl-LDHs (noted as CoAl-LDH-initial) was recorded when the apparatus was purged with dry argon.Dry CO2 was then introduced for 10 min (20 mL/min) and the spectrum was recorded (noted as CoAl-LDH-CO2 (10 min)).Argon was subsequently used to expel the CO2 for 1 min, 10 min (20 mL/min, noted as CoAl-LDH-Ar (1 min) and CoAl-LDH-Ar (10 min), respectively).As shown in Figure 6A, several absorption bands at 2230-2380 cm -1 appeared after the introduction of CO2, which are typical of the 3 anti-symmetric stretching modes of CO2 gas, while the new-emerging bands at 682 cm -1 , 669 cm -1 and 649 cm -1 could be attributed to the splitting of the v2 bending mode of adsorbed CO2. 31, 32 After the expelling of CO2 by argon, it was observed that the absorption bands at 2230-2380 cm -1 became weakened and vanished at last, indicating that CO2 gas was nearly expelled.However, we could find that the bands around 669 cm -1 remained and had not been blown away, revealing a good adsorption of CO2.With regard to the spectra for P25 (Figure 6B), similar absorption bands were observed after the introduction of CO2.Nevertheless, the bands decreased rapidly and vanished at last after expelling by argon.Therefore, it is proposed that the efficient adsorption of CO2 for CoAl-LDHs could contribute to CO2 photoreduction. Further experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the unique effect of the divalent cobalt in CoAl-LDHs for CO2 photoreduction to CH4.The divalent cobalt was oxidized by heating the CoAl-LDHs in oxygen atmosphere at 85 o C for 0 h, 0.25 h, 0.5 h, 2 h (donated as CoAl-0, CoAl-0.25,CoAl-0.5, CoAl-2), respectively.It is expected that cobalt (II) would be oxidized to cobalt (III) and a series of CoAl-LDHs with different cobalt (II) concentrations were prepared. 33As shown in Figure 7A, the catalytic activity for CO2 photoreduction to CH4 decreased sharply with the oxidation time of CoAl-LDHs increasing, while there was no significant difference between CoAl-n (n0, 0.25, 0.5, 2) samples in the X-ray diffraction (Figure S8), indicating This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins that the phase change of CoAl-LDHs had not occurred during the oxidation for different time, which could also be confirmed by the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra.The DRS spectra of CoAl-n (n0, 0.25, 0.5, 2) did not show much difference (Figure 7B).XPS analysis was then carried out to obtain the surface information of the samples.As shown in Figure 7C, the two strong peaks in the Co region around 797.3 eV and 781.4 eV could be assigned to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, while the other two peaks around 803.7 eV and 787.5 eV could be assigned to the satellite peaks of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, respectively. 34enerally, the peaks at 798 eV and 797 eV in Co 2p1/2 band were severally indicative of cobalt (II) and cobalt (III). 353663738 On account of the oxidation of divalent cobalt for different times, it was found that the peak position of Co 2p1/2 had moved to lower binding energy with the prolongation of oxidation time (Figure 7D), indicating that the oxidation degree of divalent cobalt improved from CoAl-0 to CoAl-2 (CoAl-n, n0, 0.25, 0.5, 2). Figure 7C also shows that the ratio between cobalt (II) and cobalt (III) decreased when extending the oxidation time.All these above make it clear that CoAl-n (n0, 0.25, 0.5, 2) just distinguished from each other with the oxidation degree of divalent cobalt on the surface, but with bulk phase to be the same.However, CoAl-n (n0, 0.25, 0.5, 2) differed greatly on the activity of CO2 photoreduction, and it does not take much effort to find that the catalytic activity of CO2 photoreduction to CH4 decreased sharply with the oxidation degree of divalent cobalt increasing, which strongly confirms that the divalent Cobalt plays a key role in CH4 generation. CO2 adsorption experiments showed that the CO2 adsorbing capacity of CoAl-n (n0, 2) remained almost unchanged (Figure S9), declaring that the decrease of catalytic activity had no relation with the CO2 adsorption.To gain deeper insights into the reason for the poor photocatalytic activity of CoAl-LDHs once the divalent cobalt was oxidized, some traces were seized through other products (such as CO, H2) for CO2 photoreduction.CO or HCOOH is generally considered to be the primary intermediate for CO2 photoreduction to CH4. 39 In this reaction system of CoAl-LDHs, CO was expected to be the primary intermediate in view of that abundant CO was generated and could be further consumed as the reactant.If a large amount of HCOOH was produced as the primary intermediate, CoAl-LDH catalyst would be gradually corroded with reaction time.However, CoAl-LDHs were of good stability in photocatalytic process. CoAl-0 and CoAl-2 were taken as samples to test the yields of CO and H2 with the reaction time.As shown in Figure 8A, CO emission for CoAl-0 gradually reached a platform with time, which has been exhibited in Figure S5.In comparison with CoAl-0, the CO emission for CoAl-2 increased steadily with reaction time.It is proposed that the decrease for CH4 product could likely be in some connection with the sustaining CO emission, which was considered to be ascribed to the relative decrease of consumption rate compared with the production rate.Meanwhile, the H2 emission for CoAl-n (n0, 2) displayed distinct difference from each other (Figure 6B).The CoAl-0 exhibited relatively stable H2 yield for the initial several hours, while little H2 emission was detected using CoAl-2 as the photocatalyst.As is known, H in the CH4 originates from the H in H2O for CO2 photoreduction with water.Hence, the activation of water to release H is of great significance for CH4 formation.H2 emission was experimentally observed for CoAl-0 catalyst, indicating that CoAl-0 must have the ability to dissociate water to release H, while CoAl-2 is likely to have negligible activity to dissociate water to release H for the further reaction with carbon intermediates like CO, which might account for the decrease of CO consumption rate and the sustaining increase of CO yield.It should be noted that the divalent cobalt is frequently-used element employed in water splitting by virtue of the unique and effective electronic structure configuration. 40- 42 Therefore, it is proposed that the poor CH4 yield of CoAl-2 could likely stem from the weak ability to dissociate water to release H when the divalent cobalt was oxidized.In addition, it has been demonstrated that Co (II) could convert into Co (I) under photo-excitation, and then the photoexcited electrons could be transferred to CO2 from Co (I). 43All above indicate the unique and effective property of the divalent cobalt for CO2 photoreduction. In addition to CoAl-LDHs, we further explored the CO2 photoreduction activity of CoM-LDHs (MCr, Fe) and NAl-LDHs (NZn, Ni) synthesized by the same method as CoAl-LDHs.XRD patterns, UV-visible absorption spectra and FT-IR spectra of these LDHs were displayed in Figure S10, Figure S11, and Figure S12.The CH4 formation rates for CoFe-LDHs and CoCr-LDHs were 2.2 molg -1 h -1 and 3.3 molg -1 h -1 , respectively (Figure S13).CoM-LDHs (MCr, Fe) exhibited efficient activity for CO2 photoreduction to CH4 while there was little CH4 yield for NAl-LDHs (NZn, Ni), possibly indicating the universality of the divalent cobalt for CO2 photoreduction. The mechanism of CO2 photoreduction is complex, and CH4 generation is considered to be a multi-step process.Generally, Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins the first step to activate CO2 over catalysts is of great significance for the subsequent reactions, since efficient binding could greatly reduce the high potential barrier and accelerate the dissociation of CO2.CO2 photoreduction over CoAl-LDHs is suggested to begin with the chemisorption between CO2 and the OH groups.The linear CO2 molecules become bent and activated after binding with surface OH Lewis bases, forming carbonate-like species.The carbonate-like species could then possibly be converted into CO accompanied by the break of CO under illumination.Meanwhile, water is dissociated to proton and hydroxyl by the divalent cobalt.The adsorbed CO could likely be further converted into CH4 via the proton-assisted multi-electron transfer mechanism while some H2 was generated by direct combination of two protons and two electrons."
