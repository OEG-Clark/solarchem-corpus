    "content": "CO 2 conversion into chemical fuels is a sustainable approach to the concurrent mitigation of the energy crisis and the greenhouse effect.It is still urgently desirable but quite challenging to explore a promising catalyst for CO 2 photoreduction due to the severity in the fast recombination of electron holes and the deficiency of active sites, which have a tremendous influence on the catalytic behavior.In this regard, mesoporous TiO 2 nanospheres containing oxygen vacancies (OVs) and metallic Au nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully prepared and showed markedly enhanced CO 2 reduction activity and CH 4 selectivity by the simple combination of photocatalysis with the simultaneous photothermal effect under full-spectrum irradiation.The dual introduction of OVs and a Au/TiO 2 Schottky junction can not only serve as an electron sink to significantly improve the charge separation/transfer efficiency but also show effective photothermal conversion to raise the local temperature of the catalyst, thus resulting in an enhanced shuttle of electrons and desorption of products.This study not only offers new insights into the integrated tuning of charge recombination processes but also demonstrates that the photothermocatalysis has great potential in CO 2 reduction."

    "content": "Materials.All chemicals and reagents (analytical grade) were used directly without further purification.Titanium isopropoxide (TIP, 95) and 1-hexadecylamine (HDA, 90) were purchased from Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd.(Shanghai, China).Potassium chloride (KCl), ethanol absolute (C 2 H 5 OH), and ammonium carbonate ((NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 ) were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.(Shanghai, China).HAuCl 4 was obtained from Kaida Chemical Engineering Co., Ltd.(Shaanxi, China). Preparation of Mesoporous TiO 2 Nanospheres.The mesoporous TiO 2 nanospheres (named mTiO 2 ) were prepared by a solgel method according to the literature. 23First, 1.75 g of HDA was dissolved in 200 mL of ethanol absolute, and then 1.3 mL of KCl solution (0.07 M) and 4.32 mL of TIP were added dropwise and stirred continuously.After keeping it static for 18 h, the obtained solid was filtered and washed with ethanol absolute several times and then dried under ambient temperature.Then, the dried white powder (1.6 g) was dispersed in a mixture (10 mL of water and 20 mL of ethanol absolute) and operated in a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave at 433 K for 16 h.The precipitate was filtered and washed with ethanol absolute several times and then dried at 80 C.The dried powders were calcined in air at 773 K for 2 h to get the mTiO 2 products.The mTiO 2 was treated with pure hydrogen at different temperatures (200, 400, and 600 C) under atmospheric pressure for 2 h at a flow rate of 30 mL/min, and the resulting products were named mT-H2, mT-H4, and mT-H6, respectively. Fabrication of Au NP-Decorated mTiO 2 and mT-H6.The Audecorated mT-H6 and mTiO 2 were prepared by a facile deposition/ precipitation (DP) method. 24In detail, mT-H6 powder was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water, and then 25 mL of (NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 solution (1 M) was injected.Then, the stoichiometric contents of an aqueous solution containing HAuCl 4 were added dropwise.The obtained mixture was stirred and dried at 80 C and then hydrogenated at 400 C for 2 h with a flow rate of 30 mL/min.The obtained sample with a nominal weight ratio of Au (R Au ) was labeled as xAu/mT-H6 (x 0.1/0.25/0.5/0.75/1).Sample 0.5Au/mTiO 2 was also synthesized as a reference in the same way except replacing mT-H6 with pristine mTiO 2 ."

    "content": "Structure Features and Physical Properties.The actual Au content in all samples detected by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) is almost close to the theoretical value (Table S1), confirming the successful deposition of Au on the support.The specific surface area (S BET ) is significantly reduced by high-temperature hydrogenation, while the Au decoration has a slight influence on it, which perhaps can be ascribed to the aggregation of the support.Figure 1a displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the mTiO 2 , mT-H6, 0.5Au/mT-H6, and 0.5Au/ mTiO 2 (taking mT-H6 and 0.5Au/mT-H6 as examples because of their better catalytic behavior).The XRD pattern of mTiO 2 shows well-resolved diffraction peaks, which are definitely consistent with the reflections of anatase TiO 2 (JCPDS file no.01-084-1286).No obvious change in the peak positions and no other crystalline phases are detected after the hydrogenation treatment, even at the high temperature of 600 C, or Au decoration, showing the high phase purity and stability of the support mTiO 2 (Figure S1). 25 The sharp reflection peak of mT-H6 compared to that of the pristine mTiO 2 may be attributed to promoted crystallinity because of the high-temperature hydrogenation. 26Moreover, no typical diffraction peaks of Au species (metal Au or Au x O) can be found, which can be attributed to the high dispersion or low content of the Au species.The phase structure of the catalysts is distinguished by Raman spectroscopy, as depicted in Figure 1b.Four vibration peaks (143, 396, 516, and 638 cm -1 ) are clearly observed, which belong to the E g , B 1g , A 1g , and E g vibration modes of mTiO 2 nanocrystals, respectively. 27his suggests that the TiO 2 -based catalysts have a single anatase phase, which is consistent with the XRD results.Moreover, the sharp and intense Raman peaks illustrate the good crystalline phase of the as-prepared samples.Particularly, by observing the characteristic peak at 143 cm -1 of the samples, a slight shift of the peak toward a high wavenumber for the Au-loaded samples can be found.This implies that the symmetric stretching vibration of O-Ti-O in TiO 2 has been partially disordered, which can be ascribed to a strong interaction between noble metal Au and oxygen in TiO 2 . 28he chemical states of the samples were further analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).As presented in Figure 1c, the two highly symmetric Ti 2p peaks at 458.5 and 464.2 eV belong to the core levels of Ti 4 2p 3/2 and Ti 4 2p 1/2 , respectively, and the peak-to-peak separation (5.7 eV) is consistent with the recorded value. 29The O 1s spectra could be fitted into two peaks, where the main peak at 529.7 eV and the minor peak at 531.8 eV correspond to the lattice oxygen (Ti-O-Ti) and the surface hydroxyl groups (Ti-OH), respectively. 30For the catalyst mT-H6, the peaks of Ti 2p and O 1s have a slight shift to lower binding energy, which can be ascribed to the introduction of OVs.Moreover, the observed peaks at 86.7 and 83.0 eV are assigned to the Au 4f 7/2 and Au 4f 5/2 of metallic Au 0 , respectively. 19he morphology of the samples was first studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), in which the growth of anatase TiO 2 nanocrystals and their particle size evolution can be clearly seen.As shown in Figure S2, the average particle size of mT-H6 nanospheres is measured to be around 380 nm, which is much smaller than that of the pristine mTiO 2 nanosphere (500 nm), and it can be found that the surface of the nanospheres becomes denser after hydrogenation.This could explain the greater decrease of S BET , the steady increase in the peak intensities, and the narrower width of the diffraction peaks.After deposition with Au NPs and the second hydrogenation, the overall spherical morphology and sphere diameter basically remain consistent.Moreover, the microstructures and compositions of the typical sample 0.5Au/ mT-H6 and the reference sample 0.5Au/mTiO 2 were further confirmed by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, the high-angle annular darkfield scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images, and the corresponding dot scanning and element mapping analysis, as shown in Figure 1d-g and Figure S3.HRTEM images show that the support mTiO 2 consists of numerous tiny NPs, including both irregular and polyhedral nanocrystals.The lattice fringe spacing of 0.352 nm corresponds to the 101 crystal plane of anatase TiO 2 . 31ecause of the thickness of the support, Au NPs cannot be observed directly in the bright field.In HAADF-STEM images, some bright spots are clearly observed corresponding to Au NPs, which are further confirmed by dot scanning.The average particle size of Au NPs in 0.5Au/mT-H6 is 10.8 nm, which is much smaller than that of 0.5Au/mTiO 2 (22.5 nm).It can be calculated that the maximum Au dispersion of 0.5Au/mT-H6 is 10, which is much larger than that of 0.5Au/mTiO 2 (ca.4.4).This suggests that OVs are conducive to the dispersion of a noble metal precursor to form smaller NPs. 32valuation of Photothermocatalytic CO 2 RR.The photothermocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor was conducted under full-spectrum irradiation (0.72 W cm -2 ) for 2 h and at atmospheric pressure.As shown in Figure 2, CO and CH 4 were detected as the main products in this study, and other possible products, such as ethanol, were not be found at the same time.Meanwhile, the production of O 2 and H 2 was also detected, which are the main products of the H 2 O redox reaction.Control experiments in the absence of either catalyst or irradiation showed that no hydrocarbon compounds could be detected, indicating that catalysts and light are fundamental factors for effective photothermocatalytic CO 2 RR. The yields of CO and CH 4 under full-spectrum irradiation are gradually increased on mTiO 2 hydrogenated at different temperatures, while mT-H6 shows more efficient catalytic activity than the other two samples, mT-H2 and mT-H4 (Figure S4).With increasing R Au from 0 to 1 wt , the yields of CO and CH 4 on xAu/mT-H6 (x 0.1/0.25/0.5/0.75/1)first increase and then decrease.The highest yield is achieved at an R Au of 0.5 wt , with the yields of CO and CH 4 on sample 0.5Au/mT-H6 reaching 6.71 and 10.07 mol g -1 , respectively.As a comparison, the reference sample 0.5Au/ mTiO 2 shows 2.52 and 6.71 mol g -1 of CO and CH 4 , respectively, which is poorer than that of 0.5Au/mT-H6 but more efficient than that of the pristine mTiO 2 .Nevertheless, it is also worth noting that S BET has a great influence on the catalytic performance.According to the normalized surface area of 0.5Au/mT-H6 and 0.5Au/mTiO 2 , the yield rates are calculated to be 0.14 mol m -2 for CO and 0.17 mol m -2 for CH 4 in 0.5Au/mT-H6, while the yield rates of CO and CH 4 are 0.04 and 0.11 mol m -2 in 0.5Au/mTiO 2 , respectively.This demonstrates that S BET is not the key factor for the enhanced catalytic activity of 0.5Au/mT-H6.To sum up, these results confirm that there are significant synergetic effects of OVs and Au decoration on enhanced CO 2 RR under fullspectrum irradiation.The introduction of OVs and Au decoration surely gives the higher CH 4 yield in CO 2 reduction, and the order is as follows: 0.5Au/mT-H6 0.5Au/mTiO 2 mT-H6 mTiO 2 .The CO and CH 4 yields as a function of light irradiation time on 0.5Au/mT-H6 are shown in Figure S5.Moreover, the undesired products H 2 and O 2 were also detected (Figure S6).The involvement of the Au NPs cocatalyst not only promotes the yield of CO and CH 4 but also increases the production of H 2 .The coexistence of OVs and Au NPs cocatalyst can effectively restrain the generation of H 2 .However, the detected amount of O 2 is much less than that of the theoretical value.This might be because some of the O 2 and/or O species were either reabsorbed or consumed by the catalyst. 23Thus, OVs and Au NPs cocatalyst not only promote the catalytic behavior of CO 2 conversion but also alter the product selectivity to CH 4 . Studying the influence of different light regions on the catalytic behavior can provide strong evidence for understanding the role of light in the photothermocatalytic process.Because CO 2 RR is endothermic in thermodynamics, it is extremely essential to explore whether the superior catalytic behavior is dominated by thermocatalysis deriving from the efficient photothermal transformation. 33Therefore, the surface temperature of the catalyst layer was monitored with emphasis under full-spectrum irradiation (0.72 W cm -2 ), which might be ascribed to the nonradiative decay of the incident photons. 34he yield rates of CO and CH 4 in 0.5Au/mT-H6 were also detected at 181 C by IR light heating (Table 1), which was consistent with that of full-spectrum irradiation, and no activity was found.This obviously suggests that this thermal energy does not trigger such CO 2 RR alone, and no conventional electron-hole pairs are stimulated by IR light for the catalytic reaction.Therefore, it can be deduced that traditional photocatalysis is of primary importance in this photothermocatalyic CO 2 RR.To verify this assumption, the vis-IR light was further employed by a UV light cutoff filter to prove the existence of hot electrons produced by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Au NPs.Theoretically, it is known that hot electrons on metallic NPs will transfer to the adsorbed CO 2 molecules and break the molecular bonds to CO 2 reduction. 35The light intensity and surface temperature of 0.5Au/mT-H6 were slightly decreased to 0.68 W cm -2 and 166 C, respectively.Similarly, no production of CO or CH 4 was detected.This result also implies the absence of a nonthermal hot-electron-driven CO 2 reduction pathway, and the absorption of visible and infrared light by OVs and plasmonic Au NPs only produce the photothermal effect.Moreover, the low-temperature experiment was also conducted in which the surface temperature was hugely decreased to 102 C by an ice-water bath under full-spectrum irradiation with the same light intensity.It displays a relatively low catalytic behavior with 3.36 mol g -1 of CO and 1.68 mol g -1 of CH 4 . Overall, the enhanced catalytic behavior of 0.5Au/mT-H6 can be explained by the combination of traditional photocatalysis and the accompanying photothermal effect, where the photocatalysis is the essential prerequisite for the photothermocatalytic CO 2 reduction and the photothermal effect provides more energy for the desorption of target products and the movement of photogenerated electrons. 18,22echanism of Enhanced Catalytic Activity and Proposed Reaction Pathway.Various characterizations were employed to demonstrate the emergence of photogenerated charge transfer and the roles of OVs and Au NPs on the support surface.The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum is a convincing characterization to determine the presence and concentration of OVs qualitatively. 36Figure S7a displays a symmetrical peak at g 2.003, corresponding to the electron trapped in OVs. 37This suggests that hydrogen atoms interact with adsorbed oxygen and surface/bulk lattice oxygen on mTiO 2 , resulting in the formation of OVs on mTiO 2 .The sample mT-H6 shows a stronger intensity than that of mT-H2 and mT-H4, while it is almost zero for the pristine mTiO 2 .Because the relationship between the intensity of the EPR signal and the concentration of OVs is proportional, it can be concluded that the hydrogenation temperature also has a positive effect on the formation of OVs, and mT-H6 has the highest concentration of OVs.As displayed in Figure 3a, the pristine mTiO 2 and 0.5Au/mTiO 2 show no obvious signals, indicating that they both have no OVs generation, and repetitive hydrogenation after depositing Au also has no promotion on the formation of OVs.Apparently, the intensity of the EPR signal has a slight decrease in the 0.5Au/mT-H6, demonstrating that a portion of the oxygen vacancies may be occupied by noble metal Au.There is no significant difference between the EPR signals before and after the stability test, which indicates the stability of the oxygen vacancy and the feasibility of the synthesis method (Figure S7b).Typically, these OVs can act as an electron sink for effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus facilitating the photocatalytic CO 2 RR. To ascertain the arresting roles of OVs, the optical absorption of the samples is investigated by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) (Figure 3b and Figure S7b).For all the samples, a steep absorption edge at 380 nm can be observed, which belongs to the intrinsic band-band transition of anatase TiO 2 . 38This indicates that the bandgap (E g ) cannot be changed by the presence of OVs.In contrast to the pristine mTiO 2 , an additional absorption band beyond 400 nm extending to the NIR region is observed for the sample mT-H6.The intensity increases with the rise of hydrogenation temperature, which is consistent with the color change of the samples (Figure S8).The pristine mTiO 2 appears to be white, whereas mT-H6 is light gray.The variable light harvesting is derived from the increasing concentration of OVs on the mTiO 2 surface. 4Besides, owing to the local SPR effect of surface-decorated Au NPs, 0.5Au/mT-H6 and 0.5Au/mTiO 2 both display an additional absorption band at 565 nm.The color of the samples changes from light gray to light purple as the Au loading content increases.The absorption edges of mT-H6 and the samples with Au decoration are also located around 400 nm, which affirms that hydrogenation treatment and Au NPs decoration did not alter the bandgap of mTiO 2 . For conventional photocatalysis, the position of VB and CB is the decisive factor for the reaction feasibility.Principally, E g can be calculated from the plot of (Ahv) 1/2 versus (hv) according to the DRS data, where A is the absorbance, v is the frequency of light, and h is Planck's constant. 39As shown in Figure S9, the E g is estimated to be 3.20 eV for mTiO 2 , mT-H6, 0.5Au/mT-H6, and 0.5Au/mTiO 2 , which is in accord with the standard bandgap of the anatase crystal. 40On the basis of the XPS valence spectra, the VB position occurs at 2.54 eV for mTiO 2 , mT-H6, 0.5Au/mT-H6, and 0.5Au/mTiO 2 , which is more positive than that of H 2 O to H (0.82 eV vs NHE). 41ogically, their CB position is located at -0.66 eV for the pristine mTiO 2 , mT-H6, 0.5Au/mT-H6, and 0.5Au/mTiO 2 , which is more negative than that of CO 2 to CO (-0.53 eV vs NHE) and that of CO 2 to CH 4 (-0.24eV vs NHE). 41This definitely suggests that the emergence of OVs and Au NPs cocatalyst does not change the VB/CB position of the semiconductor, which is still suitable for CO 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation. As for the optoelectronic properties, a series of relevant photoluminescence (PL) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were tested to inspect the separation and migration process of charge carriers.Usually, the PL spectrum can unravel the recombination performance of charge carriers. 42As depicted in Figure 3c, compared to the pristine mTiO 2 , mT-H6 and 0.5Au/mTiO 2 show lower intensity, suggesting that OVs could trap surface electrons to reduce charge recombination, and Au deposition would also effectively inhibit the recombination of charge carriers because of the Schottky barrier between TiO 2 and Au.0.5Au/mT-H6 shows the most obvious PL quenching, suggesting that the synergy of OVs and Au cocatalyst can collectively inhibit the charge recombination.A transient photocurrent was further performed to evaluate the charge carrier separation. 20As shown in Figure 3d, all samples show a significant reversible photocurrent response with the magnitude of the photocurrent density as follows: 0.5Au/mT-H6 0.5Au/mTiO 2 mT-H6 mTiO 2 .It is generally accepted that a higher photocurrent often represents a higher carrier separation efficiency.This reveals the combined synergy of OVs and Au cocatalyst on facilitating the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.Figure 3e displays the cyclic voltammograms (CV) of samples with obvious anodic and cathodic peaks for each sample.Because the electrolyte is consistent in the measurement, the current density is relevant with the electron transfer rate of the electrode. 43The largest current density of 0.5Au/ mT-H6 indicates the significant acceleration effect of OVs and Au cocatalyst on promoting the charge separation generated from the bandgap photoexcitation of mTiO 2 .Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots were further performed to make out the interface charge transfer in the photocatalytic reaction. 44As shown in Figure 3f, compared to the pristine mTiO 2 , the smaller semicircular Nyquist plot for mT-H6 and 0.5Au/mTiO 2 indicates that both OVs and Au cocatalyst have an advantage on the migration rate of charge carriers.The smallest semicircular Nyquist plot for 0.5Au/mT-H6 declares a superior charge carrier transportation.This also suggests that the OV and Au cocatalyst have a synergy on promoting the separation and transportation of the photogenerated charge carriers.Besides, Figure S10 shows the polarization curves of samples, from which it can be seen that the introduction of OVs and Au cocatalyst conjointly improves the current density.This also strongly demonstrates the highefficiency charge separation and rapid surface reaction kinetics that can be acquired on 0.5Au/mT-H6, which is in accord with other optoelectronic tests.Altogether, it can be extremely explicit that the coordination between OVs and Au deposition can induce rapid separation/transfer of photoexcited charger carriers and low impedance of the material, thus leading to superior catalytic activity in CO 2 RR. Moreover, the CO 2 adsorption performance of the samples was explored because the CO 2 adsorption on the gas-solid interface is one of the key steps of the reduction reaction. 20In Figure S11a, the maximum CO 2 uptake capacities of the samples follow the sequence: mTiO 2 (0.33 mmol/g) mT-H6 (0.16 mmol/g) 0.5Au/mTiO 2 (0.15 mmol/g) 0.5Au/mT-H6 (0.12 mmol/g).Similarly, 0.5Au/mT-H6 displays the minimum desorption amount of CO 2 versus that of the other samples in temperature-programmed desorption of CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) (Figure S11b).It can be definitely seen that the hydrogenation treatment and Au NPs decoration will simultaneously lower the CO 2 uptake ability of the sample.This might be ascribed to the decrease of S BET and average pore size in the material.Besides, the product adsorption/ desorption on the catalyst is also crucial for the reaction.As depicted in Figure S11c andd, 0.5Au/mT-H6 shows a weaker intensity than that of the other ones in the temperatureprogrammed desorption of CO and CH 4 (CO-TPD and CH 4 -TPD), which proves that the target product can be easily detached from the catalyst surface, thus benefiting the continuous reaction. To further unveil the possible reaction pathway of CO 2 RR with H 2 O vapor, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was performed to detect the key intermediates in the reaction process.A number of peaks can be seen from the spectra (Figure 4a), which could be assigned to strongly adsorbed H 2 O molecules (1650 cm -1 ), CO 2 -species (1245 cm -1 ), carbonate species (1340, 1396, 1422, 1437, and 1632 cm -1 ), formaldehyde (HCHO, 1422 cm -1 ), and methoxyl groups (CH 3 O -, 1040 cm -1 ). 38,45464748 The carbonate species consist of bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-), monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3 2-), and bicarbonate (HCO 3 -).The surface CO 3 2-species are formed by the combination of CO 2 and oxygen atoms on the catalyst surface, while surface HCO 3 -is derived from the bonding of CO 2 molecules and surface hydroxyl groups.These results show that CO 2 -species, carbonate species, HCHO, and CH 3 O -are the reaction intermediates in the multistep reaction.Vividly, the signals of H 2 O and b-CO 3 2-(1650 and 1632 cm -1 ) are enhanced markedly under the dark condition and reduced distinctly under irradiation, and those for HCHO and CH 3 O - are also reduced.This is strong evidence that the catalyst can effectively adsorb and activate the reactants to form the target products.Moreover, the appearance of CO 2 -shows that the electron from the defective surface of the catalyst could spontaneously transfer to a CO 2 molecule even under dark conditions. 49The intensity of CO 2 -is grown largely under irradiation and decreased obviously with the reaction time, meaning that it can be effectively converted into an intermediate.These findings reveal that the defective surface and Au NPs decoration of 0.5Au/mT-H6 can capture the photogenerated electrons and then facilitate the injection of electrons from the materials into the adsorbed CO 2 molecules.No peaks attributed to CO and CH 4 were detected due to its low affinity and/or nonpolar property.Combined with the literature, it is reasonable to put forward this possible reaction path: CO 2 CO 2 - CO HCHO CH 3 OH CH 4 . 8On the basis of the aforementioned results and analyses, a convincing reaction mechanism for the photothermocatalytic CO 2 RR can be proposed, as shown in Figure 4b.Under full solar spectrum irradiation, the photogenerated electrons in TiO 2 are transferred to surface OVs and Au NPs due to the formed Schottky junction.Besides, the strong photothermal effect provides considerable thermal energy to facilitate the electron migration from TiO 2 to surface OVs and Au NPs.This enables efficient charge separation and makes it possible for more CO generation that requires two electrons and even multielectron-driven CH 4 production.In this reaction,"
