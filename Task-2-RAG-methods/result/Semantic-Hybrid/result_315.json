{"catalyst": "The photocatalyst used in the experiment is Cu-TiO2-x samples.", "co_catalyst": "Based on the text, methanol was added during the photodeposition method to deposit Cu species onto the TiO2. However, it acts as a solvent rather than a co-catalyst. Therefore, I am unable to find the co-catalyst used in the experiment from the text.", "light source": "Solar Simulator", "lamp": "Xenon", "reaction medium": "Gas-solid heterogeneous reaction mode", "reactor type": "Schlenk flask", "operation mode": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 was performed in a gassolid heterogeneous reaction mode under atmospheric pressure at ambient temperature."}
