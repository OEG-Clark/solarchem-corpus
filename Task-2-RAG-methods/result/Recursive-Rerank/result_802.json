{"catalyst": "10 mg photocatalyst powder", "co_catalyst": "The experiment was conducted without adding any sacrificial reagents and co-catalyst.", "light source": "UV-Vis", "lamp": "Xenon", "reaction medium": "The BiVO 4 nanomaterial was prepared by a simple in situ hydrothermal method.First, 1 mmol bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O) and 0.1 g sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) were separately dissolved in 6 mL and 5 mL of 2 M nitric acid solution under vigorous stirring to obtain the transparency liquid A. 1 mmol NH 4 VO 3 was dissolved in 6 mL of 2 M nitric acid to obtained the solution B. Then, the solution B was poured quickly into the solution A. A clear orange solution was formed after vigorous stirring, and then to which different molar ratios of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 was added.In order to adjust the acid concentration to 1 M, the prepared solution was diluted by a certain amount of de-ionized water.The final resulting 35 mL solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 423 K for 12 h, followed by naturally cooling to room temperature.", "reactor type": "None", "operation mode": "None"}
