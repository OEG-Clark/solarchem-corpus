{"catalyst": "The catalysts used in the experiment are TRP, TRP-NH2 (c), g-C3N4, and P25.", "co_catalyst": "None", "light source": "Monochromatic", "lamp": "Xenon", "reaction medium": "Based on the text, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performances were evaluated at room temperature (ca. 20 C) under ambient pressure. This suggests the reaction medium is likely a gas, as the reaction is performed under ambient pressure and the products are measured using gas chromatography. However, the phrase \"in situ FT-IR analysis\" indicates the presence of a liquid medium.", "reactor type": "None", "operation mode": "None"}
