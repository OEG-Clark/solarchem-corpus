{"catalyst": "The text mentions V2O5, S400 and ZnV2O6 as samples for CO2 adsorption, with S400 having better CO2 adsorption ability. It also mentions that the CO2 and H2O adsorption ability of the catalyst plays a crucial role in boosting the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and H2O oxidation. Therefore, the catalyst used in the experiment is likely one of these samples, but the text does not explicitly state which one was used as the catalyst.", "co_catalyst": "None", "light source": "Solar Simulator", "lamp": "Xenon", "reaction medium": "Liquid", "reactor type": "None", "operation mode": "Continuous"}
